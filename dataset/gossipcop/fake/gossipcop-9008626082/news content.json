Still, lots of fans think they might have taken their very discreet and laid-back relationship to the next level: Mara was recently spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand, igniting rumors that she secretly got engaged to the actor.\n\nMara was recently photographed wearing a huge sparkler on her left hand while casually running errands in Los Angeles. Neither she nor Phoenix have confirmed an engagement, and both of their reps declined to comment to People earlier this week. However, they\u2019ve been dating for a while, and even though they\u2019re exceptionally private, Phoenix revealed during an interview in 2017 that they had moved in with one another.\n\nThe actors first worked together on Spike Jonze\u2019s 2013 Oscar-nominated film Her, in which they played a recently divorced couple. Later, they starred opposite each other in the 2018 biblical drama Mary Magdalene. During shooting, they were often spotted hanging out on and off set, sparking relationship rumors. They didn't make anything official until they walked the Cannes red carpet together hand-in-hand a few months later.\n\n\u201cThey were talking to one another nonstop,\u201d a source told People at the time. \u201cSmall talk between them. Then they went for their car and he\u2019s holding her hand like it was unconscious. Like it fits. They seem a totally natural and easy.\"\n\nWhile Mara is known for being more reserved when it comes to personal matters, her older sister Kate Mara recently announced she and husband Jamie Bell recently revealed they had welcomed their first child. She celebrated her pregnancy with a bright pink shower that both Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix reportedly attended. Maybe there was a secret engagement party thrown in there at some point, too? We'll just have to wait for more intel.", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/1txvx0EPIRHE8uqSaSdAT3Ii6AE=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cee7eddf0b17778acfa18e6__11-3c27855f7caf431f8ead81cf0e2b0b0d.jpeg", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/-_Fdw7OKDT5oXFSdwj0slj97yDo=/1024x576/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cee7eddf0b17778acfa18e6__169-f5ed42739c6442e7a1b111596a2d0264.jpeg", "http://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/-_Fdw7OKDT5oXFSdwj0slj97yDo=/1024x576/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cee7eddf0b17778acfa18e6__169-f5ed42739c6442e7a1b111596a2d0264.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julyssa Lopez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/rooney-maras-diamond-ring-sparks-joaquin-phoenix-engagement-rumors", "title": "Rooney Mara\u2019s Diamond Ring Sparks Joaquin Phoenix Engagement Rumors", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Rooney Mara was photographed wearing a ring on her left hand in Los Angeles, leading to rumors that she got engaged to her partner Joaquin Phoenix", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "BRIDES", "sailthru.author": "Julyssa Lopez", "sailthru.tags": "news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/rooney-maras-diamond-ring-sparks-joaquin-phoenix-engagement-rumors", "title": "Rooney Mara\u2019s Diamond Ring Sparks Joaquin Phoenix Engagement Rumors", "description": "Rooney Mara was photographed wearing a ring on her left hand in Los Angeles, leading to rumors that she got engaged to her partner Joaquin Phoenix", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/-_Fdw7OKDT5oXFSdwj0slj97yDo=/1024x576/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cee7eddf0b17778acfa18e6__169-f5ed42739c6442e7a1b111596a2d0264.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "Rooney Mara\u2019s Diamond Ring Sparks Joaquin Phoenix Engagement Rumors", "description": "Rooney Mara was photographed wearing a ring on her left hand in Los Angeles, leading to rumors that she got engaged to her partner Joaquin Phoenix", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/QAEhQf_6fmU9Xv_9c5Ds30CtoL8=/684x684/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5cee7eddf0b17778acfa18e6__11-3c27855f7caf431f8ead81cf0e2b0b0d.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
