Her sister Kendall Jenner, 21, will also not be walking or attending, the insider claims. Kourtney Kardashian, 38, will reportedly go.\n\nAs we know, Kim was gagged and robbed at gunpoint in the early hours of Oct. 3, 2016, at her luxury apartment in the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s. Thieves got away with valuable jewelry, including a 20-carat diamond ring worth an estimated $4.49 million. See more photos of Kim at Paris Fashion Week last year here.\n\nKim has since spoken out about her horrifying experience, which at the time had her thinking she was about to die. \"I think in life, things happen to you for a reason and you really do have to pay attention, and I got the message,\" she said during a June appearance on \"The View.\" \"I just learned so much and something had to change, just of how I live my life. The things that were important to me before and the things I liked to show off before are definitely not the things I like to show off now,\" she added.\n\nParis Fashion Week starts today, September 26, and goes through October 3.
