{"url": "www.amazon.com/Lion-Dev-Patel/dp/B01MT3LMT4", "text": "My 10 year old daughter wanted to watch this film - she read the Junior Novelization and was so looking forward to it, I bought it and watched it with her. I knew ahead of time there were mature themes - and to do justice to the story, they had to be there. My daughter is very sheltered - and so I was glad I watched it with her - as it gave us a lot of talking points about hard issues she's not normally exposed to in her everyday life. It was nice to see a movie focused on adoption to actually talk about post-adoption issues like trauma, etc. - and not gloss over those. Nicole Kidman did a beautiful job - all the actors did. I understand why this was nominated for so many Oscars. Ultimately, I'm glad I watched it with my daughter - even though there were some uncomfortable moments in the film with regards to implied sex, child endangerment, etc. I think it made my daughter appreciate her comfortable life much more - and to be thankful for all that she has. After the movie ended, she started cleaning the kitchen - which she never does!! Ha! Sometimes it's good for kids to stretch themselves and be exposed to films that show a life that's different from theirs. It also made her want to help with the orphan foundation started by the film - (listed in the end credits) - she was very shocked that 80,000 children become orphaned every year in India. This film opened her eyes (mine, too) - and was simply gorgeous...well worth the price paid to own it.", "images":
