I don\u2019t want to be seen everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don\u2019t stick my nose into everything publicly.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Caitlyn Jenner and Donald Trump Jon Kopaloff/WireImage; Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nRELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family\n\nA long outspoken Republican, Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 election on what she thought was a promise of continued progress for LGBTQ rights.\n\n\u201cOn the economics side, I\u2019m very conservative. I believe in limited government, I believe in lower taxes, I believe in less regulations, I want a thriving economy, I want Americans to be able to succeed,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cBut socially, I\u2019m much more progressive. We have to get them to be more progressive with social issues. It\u2019s their biggest problem.\u201d\n\nBut since Trump\u2019s election, there\u2019s been an attempt to roll back rights \u2014 including Trump\u2019s failed attempt to stop transgender people from enrolling in the military and his move to lift federal protections for transgender students that would guarantee their freedom to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their chosen gender identity.\n\n\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what happened when he got in there,\u201d Jenner remarked. \u201cIt was extraordinarily disappointing.\u201d\n\nThough she hasn\u2019t spoken to Trump since his election (despite publicly asking the president to call her), Jenner explained that she regularly makes trips to Washington, D.C. and has had long meetings with roughly 50 members of the House and Senate and many members of Trump\u2019s White House directly.\n\n\u201cI met with Paul Ryan. I\u2019ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren\u2019t supportive of transgender rights. \u2026 I\u2019ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,\u201d she said, telling Variety that the conversations were confidential but often included \u201cinvasive questions about her body and genitalia.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing that I\u2019m on the Republican side because I\u2019ve got an in,\u201d she said. \u201cHas this administration set us backwards? Absolutely. And every time they\u2019ve done it, I\u2019ve fought it. \u2026. I fight those types of wars. I fight the equality wars. I do it all very quietly. We\u2019re going to be okay in the end.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in Washington D.C. is just disgraceful. The hate, the media, all the things that are going on there. \u2026 [Trump\u2019s] not been doing a very good job, but it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack\n\n\n\nBecause Jenner\u2019s advocacy for transgender rights on Capitol Hill has been mostly behind the scenes, many members of the LGBTQ community have felt frustrated that she hasn\u2019t been using her celebrity and influence to help.\n\nThat criticism has caused Jenner to feel isolation from her own community. \u201cI\u2019ve felt it big time, and it hurts,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes this community can be really tough.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what you say or do, they think you don\u2019t get it because you\u2019re this kind of white, privileged person,\u201d Jenner confessed, disputing any notion that she isn\u2019t an advocate. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my back on anybody. \u2026 We need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality. It\u2019s going to take some time, but we\u2019re working on it.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-trump-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/politics/caitlyn-jenner-very-proud-kim-kardashian-meeting-donald-trump/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner \u2018Very Proud\u2019 of Kim Kardashian for Meeting with Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Caitlyn Jenner,Donald Trump,Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Caitlyn Jenner,Donald Trump,Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "description": "In a sit-down with Variety published on Tuesday, Caitlyn Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter's foray into politics and meeting with President Donald Trump", "og": {"title": "Caitlyn Jenner 'Very Proud' of Kim Kardashian for Meeting with President Trump: 'I Thought They Did the Right Thing'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/politics/caitlyn-jenner-very-proud-kim-kardashian-meeting-donald-trump/", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner&nbsp;is \u201cvery proud\u201d of&nbsp;Kim Kardashian West&nbsp;for her conversations with President Donald Trump that led to the pardon of&nbsp;Alice Marie Johnson, the 62-year-old great-grandmother who&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 785}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/politics/caitlyn-jenner-very-proud-kim-kardashian-meeting-donald-trump/", "description": "In a sit-down with Variety published on Tuesday, Caitlyn Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter's foray into politics and meeting with President Donald Trump", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/politics/caitlyn-jenner-very-proud-kim-kardashian-meeting-donald-trump/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner 'Very Proud' of Kim Kardashian for Meeting with President Trump: 'I Thought They Did the Right Thing'", "description": "In a sit-down with Variety published on Tuesday, Caitlyn Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter's foray into politics and meeting with President Donald Trump", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
