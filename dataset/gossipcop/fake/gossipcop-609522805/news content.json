However, we have learned that it might actually be something much more serious.\n\nOne insider close to the transgender icon told us that \u2018Caitlyn\u2019s biggest fear\u2019s that she\u2019ll lose her nose.\u2019\n\nApparently, Caitlyn is afraid that the damage \u2019hs spread\u2019 and the doctors will need to cut the dead tissue off again.\n\n\u2018She has been having a breakdown about it. With all of her plastic surgeries on her nose over the years, there is not much there, to begin with!\u2019 the source added, explaining that she is really scared of losing her nose.\n\n[media-credit name=\u201dSource: radaronline.com\u201d align=\u201daligncenter\u201d width=\u201d1024\u2033] [/media-credit]\n\nOur snitch also claims that Cait has been using her health problem to guilt trip her family into sending a lot more time with her.\n\nOther sources stated that she was \u2018going overboard about dying.\u2019\n\n\u2018She is taking desperate measures and calling everyone about needing to spend time with her because she does not know what is going to happen with her health.\u2019\n\nHowever, that did not stop Jenner from joking about the terrible situation around her friends, making light of the danger.\n\n\u2018While I am under, maybe they can give me another boob job while they\u2019re at it,\u2019 she apparently told some of her pals.\n\nAs you may know already, the Jenner confessed back in 2013 that because skin cancer was detected, the medical specialists took a chunk of tissue from her nose.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeeing how horrible it looks now, it is hard to believe it is merely sun damage. Has the cancer returned?", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/caityln-jenner-nose-1024x672.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Caitlyn-Jenner-SickChirpse.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlynn-Carter-BoxClue.com_-300x199.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ashley-Mitchell-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/caitlyn-jenner.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kylie-Jenner-Kim-Kardashian-Caitlyn--700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5b75db9b6d10b.image_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/corey-feldman-and-corey-haim-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/caitlyn-jenner-brandon-jenner-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Meghan-Markles-Style-Comes-At-A-Price-Prince-Harrys-Fianc\u00e9e-Is-Not-Allowed-To-Accept-Free-Clothes-e1521598368153-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/caitlyn-jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Mitchell", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/inside-caitlyn-jenners-skin-cancer-nightmare-check-out-the-disturbing-pics-127615/", "title": "Inside Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Skin Cancer Nightmare \u2013 Check Out The Disturbing Pics!", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ashley Mitchell", "news_keywords": "caitlyn jenner,", "keywords": "celebrity news, caitlyn jenner,", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner took to social media to show her fans a huge disturbing scab on her nose that she claims was sun damage from decades ago!
