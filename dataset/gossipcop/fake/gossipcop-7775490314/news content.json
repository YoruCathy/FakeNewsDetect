It started months ahead of her sixth album\u2019s hotly anticipated November 10 release, as the 27-year-old, who took a months-long social media hiatus this spring, teased her 104 million Instagram followers with song lyrics and video clips.\n\nAnd come November 11, the 10-time Grammy winner will officially \u201ccome out of hiding,\u201d says a source, performing two tracks off Reputation on Saturday Night Live. After her self-induced seclusion \u2014 save for a pre-Super Bowl performance in February and court testimony in the August trial of a DJ who groped her, she\u2019s avoided the public eye for nearly all of 2017 \u2014 \u201cshe\u2019s happy to be back in public,\u201d says a Swift insider.\n\nAnd ready to show off just how happy she is. Though she\u2019s kept her nearly yearlong romance with Alwyn, 26, firmly under wraps, the insider says she\u2019s considering having him join her at the November 12 Europe Music Awards in London. \u201cHe might attend,\u201d says the insider, noting Swift is giving their debut a lot of thought. \u201cShe wants to reveal their relationship when the time is right.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s already fairly confident Alwyn is Mr. Right. The family-oriented Brit (he still loves in London with his psychotherapist mom Elizabeth and documentarian dad Richard) and Swift enjoy a \u201cboring relationship,\u201d says the Swift insider. At the singer\u2019s NYC spread she and the actor \u2014 he filmed the 2018 biopic The Favourite with her pal Emma Stone \u2014 hang on her private roof deck, work out together, watch movies and enjoy an easy domesticity. Says the insider, \u201cTaylor loves to cook and bake for him.\u201d\n\nOne day, she envisions preparing meals for a whole brood. \u201cShe\u2019s always said she wants a big family and she sees herself having kids with Joe down the line,\u201d says the insider. \u201cTaylor really believes he\u2019s the one for her.\u201d\n\nFor more on Swift\u2019s romance \u2014 and her post-album release plans \u2014 pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/us-weekly-issue-47.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-02.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-is-preparing-to-come-out-of-hiding/", "title": "Taylor Swift Is Preparing to \u2018Come Out of Hiding\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Taylor Swift spent much of 2017 in hiding, but now she\u2019s ready to make a splashy return \u2014 find out more!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift Is Preparing to \u2018Come Out of Hiding\u2019 \u2014 With Joe Alwyn", "description": "Taylor Swift spent much of 2017 in hiding, but now she\u2019s ready to make a splashy return \u2014 find out more!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-is-preparing-to-come-out-of-hiding/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:19:01+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-08T17:36:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:19:01+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Taylor Swift spent much of 2017 in hiding, but now she\u2019s ready to make a splashy return \u2014 find out more!", "title": "Taylor Swift Is Preparing to \u2018Come Out of Hiding\u2019 \u2014 With Joe Alwyn", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-02.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510162602.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
