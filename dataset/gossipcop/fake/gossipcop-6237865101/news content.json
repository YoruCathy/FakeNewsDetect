Amid the news that Kylie Jenner is expecting her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott, the internet is full of people speculating that she is actually the surrogate for her sister Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 36, and husband Kanye West turned to surrogacy for baby no. 3 after the Selfish author had high-risk pregnancies with daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 21 months. A source exclusively told Us in late July that the surrogate is expected to give birth to the couple\u2019s third child in January 2018.\n\nAs previously reported, an insider told Us Weekly that the Life of Kylie star is \u201cat least four months\u201d pregnant with her first child \u2014a girl \u2014 with rapper Scott.\n\nAfter Jenner\u2019s pregnancy news broke on Friday, September 22, the internet erupted with some conspiracy theorists openly wondering if Jenner, 20, is carrying her half-sister\u2019s child.\n\nOne Twitter user wrote, \u201cWhat if the twist in the alleged Kylie Jenner pregnancy is that she\u2019s Kim and Kanye\u2019s surrogate for baby no. 3?\u201d Another mused, \u201cAnyone else think Kylie is just carrying a baby for Kim & Kanye?\u201d\n\nAnother person quipped, \u201cIf Kylie Jenner is actually pregnant, it\u2019s because she\u2019s Kim\u2019s surrogate. She\u2019s a business woman come on now.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Kardashian has stayed mum about both hot topics, but that didn\u2019t stop her fans from inquiring about the rumors by commenting on a tweet she wrote on Saturday, September 23.\n\n\u201cLook at this little seahorse swimming in our polluted waters. This is the [world] we are creating,\u201d she tweeted, alongside a photo of a seahorse holding a Q-tip, to which one follower simply put, \u201cOkay yes pollution is real but I need answers about Kylie\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d\n\nA source previously told Us Weekly that Kardashian and her husband chose a San Diego mom in her late 20s as their surrogate. The woman has reportedly served as a surrogate before, even appearing in a promotional video about the process with her family.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylieandkim2-c78fd946-0022-4556-8b3e-eac3184f47a0.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylieandkim2-1617fa5f-263f-4896-ab4a-e988f66912bc.jpg?crop=1px%2C107px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylieandkim2-1617fa5f-263f-4896-ab4a-e988f66912bc.jpg?crop=1px%2C107px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/fans-speculate-kylie-jenner-is-surrogate-for-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-w505139/", "title": "Fans Speculate Kylie Jenner Is Surrogate for Kim Kardashian, Kanye West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Amid the news that Kylie Jenner is pregnant, fans are speculating that she is Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s surrogate \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fans Speculate Pregnant Kylie Jenner Is Kim Kardashian\u2019s Surrogate", "description": "Amid the news that Kylie Jenner is pregnant, fans are speculating that she is Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s surrogate \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/fans-speculate-kylie-jenner-is-surrogate-for-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-w505139/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:30:46+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylieandkim2-1617fa5f-263f-4896-ab4a-e988f66912bc.jpg?crop=1px%2C107px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylieandkim2-1617fa5f-263f-4896-ab4a-e988f66912bc.jpg?crop=1px%2C107px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-09-23T21:07:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:30:46+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amid the news that Kylie Jenner is pregnant, fans are speculating that she is Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s surrogate \u2014 read more", "title": "Fans Speculate Pregnant Kylie Jenner Is Kim Kardashian\u2019s Surrogate", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylieandkim2-1617fa5f-263f-4896-ab4a-e988f66912bc.jpg?crop=1px%2C107px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506200871.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
