But the famous family couldn\u2019t stop feuding long enough to let their patriarch rest in peace!\n\nRadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that superstar Janet, 52, and her niece Paris, 20, refused to speak and kept far away from each other during the services.\n\n\u201cParis was almost unnoticeable at the funeral, and chose to stay away from her father\u2019s siblings,\u201d a source told Radar. \u201cShe was definitely frosty.\u201d\n\nA separate Jackson family insider told Radar that the model is furious with her aunt for not spending Joe\u2019s last days by his side.\n\n\u201cParis thinks Janet is acting fake,\u201d the insider said. (As Radar has previously reported, Janet and her father had a notoriously tumultuous relationship.)\n\nRadar previously reported that Janet and Paris were fighting over who would cover the costs of the funeral.\n\n\u201cParis believes her grandpa is a legend and should be treated as such,\u201d a source told Radar last week.\n\nWhile Paris and Janet snubbed each other, Joe\u2019s daughter LaToya fought with his grandson Taj, the son of Tito Jackson.\n\n\u201cTaj is very protective of his grandpa, and he feels that it was disrespectful for her to attend,\u201d the insider told Radar. (LaToya accused Joe of sexual abuse in her 1991 memoir.)\n\nAs Radar reported, Joe died after a battle with cancer on June 17. He was 89.\n\nThe source told Radar Joe was buried outside of the mausoleum where Michael was laid to rest in 2009.\n\nThough celebrities including Jay Z, Wyclef Jean, Tyler Perry and Diana Ross were invited to the funeral, none of the stars attended.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
