Things have gotten so bad that palace aides have reportedly had three top-level crisis meetings about how to deal with her family, particularly her father.\n\nIn his latest tirade, Thomas Markle claimed Meghan changed her phone number and was sending him \u201cmixed messages\u201d, dismissed the royals as a \u201cMonty Python sketch\u201d and accused his daughter of having a \u201csense of superiority\u201d.\n\nHe suggested it would be better for Meghan if he died, and that Princess Diana would be disgusted with how he was being treated.\n\nMeghan is said to be \u201cdeeply hurt and embarrassed\u201d that he mentioned the Princess of Wales, and remains angry over his television interview where he discussed private conversations between himself and Prince Harry.\n\nMost damaging in his recent interview were the comments about the monarchy itself, which he called an \u201cancient institution, stuck in its ways\u201d.\n\nVeteran royal watcher Phil Dampier, author of Royally Suited: Harry and Meghan in their Own Words, told news.com.au: \u201cHarry and Meghan have tried ignoring the Markles, but it\u2019s not working. Before things get even more embarrassing for the royal family, they must try to build bridges.\n\n\u201cIdeally, they should go out and see Thomas or invite him over to London. It is incredible that Harry still hasn\u2019t met his father-in-law. At the very least, a senior courtier should go out and placate him first.\u201d\n\nDampier said the problem stemmed from poor Palace judgement from the start. \u201cThey should have gone out and befriended Thomas and his children long before the wedding. This is now hurting the monarchy and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if behind the scenes the Queen is starting to bang a few heads together.\u201d\n\nSources told Britain\u2019s Daily Mirror Meghan now had three options \u2014 speak to him directly and ask him to stop, get an intermediary to meet with him, or cut him off for good in a desperate hope he will stop. \u201cThis could be the final straw for Thomas. A line has been crossed.\u201d\n\nRoyal commentator Angela Levin, author of new Prince Harry biography Harry: Conversations With The Prince, told news.com.au Meghan would be putting on a brave front, but would be troubled by her father\u2019s antics \u2014 and on edge at what could be coming next.\n\n\u201cIt must be desperately upsetting to Meghan, who I think is a very good actor at putting on a good face, but she must be very hurt.\n\n\u201cShe was very close to her father and she did want him to walk her down the aisle. For him to do that has made her speechless psychologically and physically \u2014 she can\u2019t say anything to him now.\u201d\n\nLevin said the Duchess of Sussex would not be able to speak to her dad about plans to have a baby or things she has discussed with Prince Harry.\n\n\u201cI think his duty is to think of her, that\u2019s a parental duty. If you want to have a good relationship with your children, you have to behave properly yourself \u2026 to talk about Harry\u2019s private conversations about President Trump and Brexit was very wrong.\u201d\n\nThe situation is now so bad that in many ways, Meghan has been left \u201cbereft of a parent\u201d \u2014 and the constant waiting game for a new story to appear could take its toll in the long run, Levin said.\n\n\u201cI suspect she will feel very self-conscious with the royal family. It\u2019s difficult to know how to manage being a senior royal so she must feel very awkward.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry would be sympathetic after all the drama and embarrassment his own parents put him through when he was a young boy.\n\nBut Levin does not believe the Markles are going to stop.\n\n\u201cI think it will be an ongoing issue \u2026 the half-brother and sister seem to imagine the nastier they are about her, the more likely she will come back and be a part of their family. But it doesn\u2019t work like that, does it?\u201d\n\nIt is also set to be a massive distraction for Meghan as she works to find her place in the royal family and achieve her goals.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know her sufficiently to know now if she can put things right out of her mind, but even if she does, (the thoughts) can come at night, can\u2019t they \u2014 at four in the morning and you think \u2018not again\u2019. Also, if you have a few things you don\u2019t want the public to know about, will he say that?\u201d\n\nRumours that her half-sister Samantha Markle is to be a Celebrity Big Brother housemate will just fuel the controversy.\n\n\u201cI think they will spout at every possible occasion and if Samantha goes into Celebrity Big Brother then goodness knows what she will say.\u201d\n\nLevin thought part of the problem lay with royal aides who failed to bring Thomas Markle into the fold and under control before the wedding.\n\nIngrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, agreed. She wrote in the Mail On Sunday it was a mistake not to visit her father with Harry before their engagement. And she warned the complicated situation needed to be urgently brought under control.\n\n\u201cMost people understand how difficult families can be, but in her public position Meghan has to be seen to care, or else her hard-earned reputation could be tainted forever, and no one would wish that on her,\u201d Seward wrote.\n\nSamantha Markle has, at various times, slammed Meghan for not doing enough to look after their father, and even suggested she would be responsible if he died.\n\nIn a series of extraordinary tweets, she even labelled Prince Harry a \u201cwuss\u201d and called Meghan the \u201cDuchess of Nonsense\u201d. She even lashed out at Meghan\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, who she accused of \u201ccashing in\u201d on the wedding by planning an interview with Oprah Winfrey.\n\nAt the weekend, she returned to the public eye in an interview with The Sunday Mirror, where she said she feared their father would die of sadness without speaking to his royal daughter again.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m desperate for Meghan to meet up with Dad when she\u2019s back. If she doesn\u2019t, it would be really cruel and break his heart forever,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t, I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll die of sadness. I just want her to get in touch before it\u2019s too late. Life\u2019s short \u2014 neither of them deserves to be left with the consequences.\u201d\n\nShe said he was even thinking of travelling to the UK, unannounced, to try to see her.\n\nStephen Bates, a former royal correspondent and the author of Royalty Inc, said Mr Markle\u2019s arrival could be \u201cvaguely embarrassing for Meghan\u201d.\n\n\u201cMany of us have slightly embarrassing relatives and I am guessing that people here will be fairly indifferent \u2026 He has really become a tabloid figure of fun.\u201d\n\nBates didn\u2019t think it would rock Meghan\u2019s marriage or the monarchy.\n\n\u201cFar from being silenced by the royals, I suspect she\u2019s not reacting on the basis of \u2018least said, soonest mended\u2019, rather than getting into a public soap opera-type spat.\u201d\n\nHe said she and Prince Harry had already publicly advised they intended to meet Mr Markle when they visited the United States.\n\nandrew.koubaridis@news.com.au", "images":
