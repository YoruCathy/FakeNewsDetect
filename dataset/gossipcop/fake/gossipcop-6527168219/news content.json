It\u2019s almost been two years since the power couple called it quits but they still haven\u2019t finalized the divorce. Things looked like they improved last year, but a new snag might put their divorce settlement on hold once again.\n\nPitt and Jolie announced their split back in the summer of 2016. At the time, Jolie took their six kids and struck out on her own. Pitt, meanwhile, was forced to confront several different scandals, including accusations of child abuse. After the mudslinging stopped and the two started communicating again, it seemed as though Pitt and Jolie were on the verge of finalizing the divorce and moving on.\n\nWhile they have been close to signing the divorce papers, two big issues keep preventing them from coming to an agreement.\n\n? #BradPitt yesterday along with many A-listers attended a U2 concert in LA? his new look is his 2010-2011 look\u2764\ufe0fhis body & face looks healthier than last year and his hair is just ??

Pitt is fighting for joint legal and physical custody of the brood while Jolie wants all of it. Unless Jolie changes her mind soon, the issue could be left for the courts to decide.\n\nThe second thing that is hanging up the divorce is the couple\u2019s massive estate in France, Chateau Miraval. The two bought the vineyard back in 2014 and have produced several profitable wines over the years. Jolie desperately wants to sell the estate and split the profits, but Pitt isn\u2019t about to give up his dreams of making wine.\n\n\u201cBrad has really loved renovating the buildings on the grounds and working with the vintner and olive oil maker,\u201d the insider explained, adding that Pitt is present for each harvest and wants to keep the chateau\u2019s legacy intact.\n\nEmilia Clarke reveals how she missed out on a date with Brad Pitt https://t.co/EjaHrma6J1 pic.twitter.com/s0RIGqCUzR \u2014 Harper's Bazaar UK (@BazaarUK) May 18, 2018\n\nThere\u2019s no telling if Pitt and Jolie will ever reach a compromise and move on with their lives. Until they do, Pitt has already been linked to different women since the breakup. He hasn\u2019t started an official romance, but it looks like he\u2019s back in the dating game.\n\nJolie, meanwhile, has been quietly dating a philanthropist based out of the UK. A close friend of the actress revealed that she\u2019s happy with her new boyfriend and can\u2019t wait to finalize the divorce and finally start a new chapter in her life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have not commented on their ongoing divorce settlement.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Angelina-Jolie-Eternals-Comic-Con-700x466.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlynn-Carter-BoxClue.com_-300x199.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5b75db9b6d10b.image_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/alyssa_milano-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Angelina-Jolie-Wanted-700x466.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/corey-feldman-and-corey-haim-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brad-Pitt-SheKnows.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolies-Divorce-Stalls-Again-His-Relationship-With-Neri-Oxman-To-Blame.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolies-Divorce-Stalls-Again-His-Relationship-With-Neri-Oxman-To-Blame.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolies-divorce-stalls-again-his-relationship-with-neri-oxman-to-blame-148210/", "title": "Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie\u2019s Divorce Stalls Again, His Relationship With Neri Oxman To Blame?", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie, brad pitt, neri oxman,", "keywords": "celebrity news, angelina jolie, brad pitt, neri oxman,", "description": "Are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ever going to get over their differences?
