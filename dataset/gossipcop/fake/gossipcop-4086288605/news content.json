She got flirty with Jennifer Aniston\u2019s ex Brad Pitt at a recent event, according to a shocking Jan. 25 report, and we\u2019ve got all the details right here. So has Jen heard? Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on!\n\n\u201cCourtney Cox, 52, behaved like a smitten fan girl around Brad Pitt, 53, [at the Rock4EB charity concert],\u201d an eyewitness at the Jan. 14 event in Malibu, CA, tells Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 6 issue. Yikes! \u201cShe kept telling him how great he looked and flirted with him like crazy,\u201d the source adds of Courteney, who hosted the big shindig. Well, Brad did look exceptionally good that evening, but still!\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting: Brad might just have a little crush on the Cougar Town actress, too! \u201cSparks were flying big time,\u201d another source tells Australian magazine New Idea of their interaction at the event. \u201cThere\u2019s so much history and affection between those two,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cBrad and Courteney have come full circle. They\u2019ve both been through it all.\u201d Hmm!\n\nOh, and you\u2019d better believe that it gets even more dramatic. Jennifer Aniston, 47, heard about the flirtation\u2026and she was \u201cannoyed\u201d, Life & Style reports. \u201cShe considers it a betrayal,\u201d another insider reveals to the mag of the Horrible Bosses star\u2019s reaction. Jen and Courteney have been friends for ages, so it\u2019s not like this will tear them apart or anything \u2014 but it sounds like Jen doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s cool either way.\n\nOf course, Courteney has been re-engaged to Snow Patrol bandmember Johnny McDaid, 40, since April 2016 (they originally got engaged in 2014, but took a break). So it\u2019s safe to say that she will not seriously pursue the newly-single Brad any time soon!\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it was wrong of Courteney to flirt with Brad?
