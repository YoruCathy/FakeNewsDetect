We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how Jay Z\u2019s newborn twins with wife Beyonce already resemble the rapper, and the couple can\u2019t wait to finally bring them home.\n\nAny new parents can\u2019t wait to bring their baby home from the hospital to the comfort of their own nursery. Unfortunately for Beyonce, 35, and Jay Z, 47, mother and their newborn twins \u2014 a boy and a girl \u2014 are still at UCLA Medical Center a week after she gave birth on June 12. \u201cBeyonce is eager to get her new babies home. She has been stuck inside the hospital for a week now and Jay has been by her side daily as they follow all of the doctor\u2019s conservative orders to ensure the newborns are healthy and strong before going home,\u201d a source close to Jay tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Having twins always causes a higher risk of complications for both mother and babies, even though the kids reportedly just have a \u201cminor issue\u201d that doctors want to monitor.\n\nJay\u2019s genes have proven dominant once again as the newborns resemble their rapper dad. \u201cEveryone who has met the babies are already saying both kids look just like their father! Despite being stuck in the hospital it was still the best Father\u2019s Day ever for the couple,\u201d our insider adds. Bey and Jay\u2019s five-year-old daughter Blue Ivy looks SO much like her papa, and now he has two more mini-me\u2019s on his hands with their new boy and girl.\n\nBarack Obama even gave him a moving pre-taped introduction. Now we know he wanted to stay with his wife and babies in LA and not leave their sides. The couple once again managed to pull off giving birth in secret, as the \u201cLemonade\u201d songstress delivered the twins on Mon. June 12 and the news of the much anticipated arrival didn\u2019t break until Sat. June 17! There was speculation that Queen Bey already had the twins or was at least close to it when Jay didn\u2019t attend his induction ceremony into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in NYC on June 15. He became the first hip hop artist ever to receive the honor and former Presidenteven gave him a moving pre-taped introduction. Now we know he wanted to stay with his wife and babies in LA and not leave their sides.\n\nHollywoodLifers, how do you think Bey and Jay will share the first pics of their new twins?
