In Touch alleges that Gomez wanted to have the child and subsequently went into a \"downward spiral,\" which later led to said stint in rehab in 2014.\n\nThe rumor also had one of the tabloid's sources claiming Bieber's team felt the baby would \"ruin his career because at the time he had a clean image.\" And while the thought of Bieber with a \"clean image\" these days is worth a few chuckles, Gomez's rep told Us Weekly that the entire pregnancy report is \"100 percent fictional.\"\n\nAs for her recent stay in rehab, which she left after just 14 days into a six-week program, much to the objections of facility staff, Gomez's rep also confirmed that it wasn't because of a miscarriage.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/558cd4f72d0000024681f2e2.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce5982000003000fdc1b5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Entertainment Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/selena-gomez-pregnant-rumors_n_5330444", "title": "Selena Gomez Was Not Pregnant, Did Not Miscarry, Says Rep", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Selena Gomez has had a rough year with reports she's battling lupus, a stint in rehab, and her altogether exhausting on-again off-again relationship with...", "keywords": "celebrity,Video,Selena Gomez,selena gomez justin bieber", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez Pregnancy Rumors Are BS", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/selena-gomez-pregnant-rumors_n_5330444", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Selena Gomez has had a rough year with reports she's battling lupus, a stint in rehab, and her altogether exhausting on-again off-again relationship with..."}, "article": {"tag": "celebrity,Video,Selena Gomez,selena gomez justin bieber", "section": "Celebrity", "published_time": "2014-05-15 10:52:49 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-05-16 13:59:01 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Selena Gomez Pregnancy Rumors Are BS", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "Selena Gomez has had a rough year with reports she's battling lupus, a stint in rehab, and her altogether exhausting on-again off-again relationship with...", "creator": "stephaniemarcus"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5330444", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "celebrity"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1400083200.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
