Let\u2019s just start with that,\u201d he said of the First Son. \u201cThis is an imbecile whose job seems to be tweeting, as far as I can tell. But with that said, I do admire that he\u2019s very loyal to his father.\u201d Kimmel went on to respond some backlash he received for seemingly not addressing the Weinstein controversy on TV soon enough. He said, \u201cThe Harvey Weinstein thing, people like this false equivalence. As if that somehow is equivalent to what happened in Las Vegas. Harvey Weinstein is not a person \u2014 is not a friend of mine. I\u2019m not in the movie business. And I\u2019ll add that that story came out, I think, like moments before we went to tape on Thursday and we didn\u2019t have a show on Friday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is now is they\u2019re trying to drag up any kind of \u2014 especially these gun nuts \u2014 trying to drag up, take any comedy bit I did out of context and use it as some kind of proof,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey\u2019re saying I\u2019m calling myself the moral conscience of America, which I most certainly never did and most certainly never would.\u201d Kimmel, who said his son is \u201cdoing well\u201d in advance of another operation, admitted that opening up about healthcare on his show is \u201cnot something that I discussed with anyone other than my wife. But I did know I had to say something.\u201d And now that he\u2019s gotten emotional on-air a few times, he confessed, \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to me. I do my best to keep it together and then I can\u2019t keep it in. I\u2019m a crier. Even as a young boy I was a crier.\u201d\n\nKimmel was on the program to promote his upcoming tapings in Brooklyn. \u201cBrooklyn is a magical place. It is really is,\u201d he said.
