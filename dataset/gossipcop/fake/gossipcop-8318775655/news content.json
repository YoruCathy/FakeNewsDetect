Matt and Annette are getting on and they\u2019re both spending time with their kids. They hope to settle the divorce very soon.\u201d\n\nLauer bought the estate from Richard Gere for $36.5 million in 2016 and used it as a bolthole immediately after he was sacked by NBC.\n\nHowever, the question remains \u2014 who will get the estate in the divorce \u2014 as they both love it and it\u2019s Lauer\u2019s \u201cdream home.\u201d It is set on a massive 6.3 acres on the peninsula of North Haven near Sag Harbor.\n\nAs we revealed last month, the divorce is nearly official \u2014 and the process has been smoother because the couple had already signed a \u201cpostnup\u201d after Lauer persuaded a furious Roque to drop her divorce filing in 2006.\n\nAt the time, Roque cited \u201cmental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment and anxiety,\u201d after learning that Lauer had been unfaithful. But she withdrew the filing months later after signing the postnup.\n\nA source said: \u201cMatt agreed to pay Annette a lump sum of millions back in 2006 as an incentive to stay with him to help him maintain his squeaky clean image as \u2018America\u2019s Dad.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe also got an allowance every year, plus it was agreed that she would get a share of the value of all their homes if they did split.\u201d\n\nSo far, Lauer has offloaded his Upper East Side apartment for more than its $7.35 million asking price.\n\nThe former anchor also has one of his Sag Harbor homes on the market for $12.75 million, a significant drop from the original asking price of $18 million. His New Zealand farm, which he purchased for a reported $9.2 million in February 2017, is currently also still in his possession despite the fact he was poised to lose it as part of the country\u2019s \u201cgood character\u201d test following his sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nThe source added: \u201cMatt\u2019s bending over backwards to give Annette everything she wants because he feels so guilty. But he would love the Hamptons home.\u201d\n\nLauer and Roque are believed to have agreed to share custody of their three children, Jack, 17, Romy, 14, and Thijs, 11, in the divorce.\n\nWhile Lauer has spent the past nine months working on his relationship with his kids, and friends say he is a \u201cdevoted dad,\u201d he still feels resentment about his sacking.\n\nThe source said: \u201cMatt still maintains the relationships he had in the workplace were consensual. He does feel like the poster boy of the #MeToo movement when he sees other high powered men hanging on to their jobs despite allegations.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Lauer didn\u2019t return calls.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/annette-roque-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/annette-roque-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/annette-roque-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/08/14/matt-lauer-agrees-to-pay-annette-roque-up-to-20m-in-divorce/", "title": "Matt Lauer's could pay ex-wife Annette Roque $20M in divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
