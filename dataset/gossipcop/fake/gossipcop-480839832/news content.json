The singer\u2019s fans seem convinced she is once again expecting! See their tweets on the matter and Beyonce\u2019s slim-fitting bodysuit below!\n\nDuring a July 15 performance in Paris, France, Beyonc\u00e9, 36, was absolutely glowing! The singer looked phenomenal as she took to the stage in a chic white bodysuit, and a pair of denim shorts. Over her shoulders she slung a colorful sequin jacket, as she effortlessly danced around the stage. Despite this \u2013 fans were completely convinced: Bey is preggers again, and they were not afraid to let their opinions be heard.\n\nMembers of the Beyhive did NOT hesitate on calling their queen out via social media. In a series of tweets, fans demanded the singer to come clean about her potential baby news. \u201cso when beyonc\u00e9 gonna tell us she pregnant. i\u2019m waiting \u2026\u201d said one fan on Twitter. \u201cNaw Beyonc\u00e9 is really pregnant again omg. That\u2019s so beautiful but damn sis MORE?\u201d exclaimed another. It seems like fans really have their minds made up, but let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, Beyonc\u00e9 has YET to comment on the news herself at all! If the singer isn\u2019t pregnant, she\u2019s definitely letting this rumor ride this wave pretty far.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only recent instance from Beyonc\u00e9 that had fans spouting pregnancy prophecies. In a fan video posted on July 8, Bey can be seen standing onstage rubbing her belly while performing at a concert. Hmmm \u2013 seems like a move from a mother-to-be if we\u2019ve ever seen one! Then, just several days later, Beyonc\u00e9 whipped an ultra flowy dress out of her closet\u2026.you know, the kind you throw on when you have something to hide. Very suspicious!\n\nIf Beyonc\u00e9 did have another child on the way, it would be her fourth one, and a very close consecutive to her last time giving birth! Beyonc\u00e9 welcomed twins, Rumi and Sir Carter into the world on June, 13 2017. This close succession of pregnancies seems to have fans confused, especially since Bey is currently on a joint tour with hubby Jay-Z and has live shows lined up for months to come! Hey, maybe since the two have been spending nearly every night together on tour, this was a surprise for them too!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/beyonce-new-performs-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F17%2Fbeyonce-potential-pregnancy-fans-demand-answers-tweets%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3243901", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/brandy_robidoux.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/beyonce-new-embed1.jpg?w=620&h=700", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/beyonce-new-performs-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/beyonce-pregnant-embed2.jpg?w=620&h=400", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/beyonce-new-performs-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandy Robidoux", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "Music Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/17/beyonce-potential-pregnancy-fans-demand-answers-tweets/", "title": "Beyonce: Fans Beg Her To \u2018Tell Us She\u2019s Pregnant\u2019 After Performance In Bodysuit \u2014 See Tweets", "meta_data": {"description": "Could Bey be expecting again?
