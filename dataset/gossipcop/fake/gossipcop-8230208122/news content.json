Not to mention, the new report claims they could have a baby girl on the way, and it\u2019s a \u2018dream come true\u2019 for Gwen! Get all of the insane alleged details on their upcoming plans!\n\nBlake Shelton, 40, and Gwen Stefani, 47, apparently have two huge reasons to celebrate! Gwen has allegedly been planning their epic Christmas nuptials in Blake\u2019s home state of Oklahoma, according to Life & Style. On top of that, the magazine claims they\u2019ve been \u201ctrying\u201d to conceive, and alleged friends \u201cbelieve she could already be pregnant.\u201d WHAT!\n\nGwen has been longing for a baby girl because she\u2019s felt \u201coutnumbered\u201d for years, according to Life & Style. She has three sons \u2014 Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo Rossdale, 2 \u2014 with her ex husband, Gavin Rossdale, 48. Insiders close to Gwen reportedly pointed out that she is consuming \u201ca lot of carbs\u201d right now; Something she reportedly never does unless she is expecting. Could this seriously be true?!\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, the mag even reports that \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t want to be an unwed mother at the time of the baby\u2019s birth, so she\u2019ll definitely be marrying Blake before then.\u201d Well, this is apparently moving very fast. Adding to the alleged baby chatter, they even claim Gwen has \u201calways wanted a big family,\u201d and she believes \u201cBlake will be a great dad and so protective of a little girl.\u201d While we\u2019re sure the country singer would make a terrific father, we\u2019re not too sure if the pair could be expecting at the moment.\n\nThe happy couple have not even announced any type of engagement yet, let alone baby news. Not to mention, Gwen just celebrated her 47th birthday Oct. 3, and it looked like she could have been sipping some champagne from a video on her Snapchat. There were reports Blake was set to pop the question on her birthday, but that obviously didn\u2019t happen, that we know of. Like we EXCLUSIVELY told you Gwen and Blake \u201care still going strong,\u201d and although \u201che wants to marry Gwen, he hasn\u2019t told anyone his ideas or timing for popping the question. He is keeping that very close to his chest.\u201d\n\nJust about everyone is hoping for Blake to get down on one knee, and speculation was at an all time high when the No Doubt front-woman appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Sept. 23. She could hardly contain her excitement when Ellen, 58, asked about her supposed wedding plans. She said, \u201cBefore I make plans, because I make plans way ahead of time, tell me when you\u2019re getting married \u2026 I just need to know so I can clear my schedule.\u201d Gwen laughed and shied away from the question. The talkshow host told the singer to \u201clet her know,\u201d to where she replied, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d Obviously the two were just joking, but Gwen didn\u2019t exactly deny anything! So, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens between Gwen and Blake, who have been dating for almost a year now. Here\u2019s to hoping we\u2019ll be hearing about an epic proposal very soon!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Gwen will get married? Could she seriously be pregnant?
