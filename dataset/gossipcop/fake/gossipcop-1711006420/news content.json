We're told it's \"not true\".\n\n\n\nThe allegation comes from OK!, which claims the singer was \"partying with a crowd\" that was \"half her age\" at Catch restaurant in Los Angeles last month. A so-called \"source\" tells the outlet, \"She clearly thought she was the hippest, coolest person there, when in reality everyone was rolling their eyes.\" Carey is \"regressing\", further purports the magazine's supposed insider, adding that she has recruited a group of \"young girlfriends\" and is picking up \"boy toys\" in an attempt to \"fill a void\".\n\n\n\nBut Gossip Cop investigated, and a rep for the singer exclusively assures us the entire report is \"not true\". Carey, despite having recently separated from Bryan Tanaka, is not going through a \"midlife crisis\", and any claims made otherwise are simply false. What's more, we're further told the star is currently at the \"top of her game\". From the number of inaccurate stories that OK! is pumping out, it's clear that the tabloid is in a state of crisis, not Carey.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we're not remotely surprised by the outlet's latest piece of fiction. In March, Gossip Cop corrected the magazine for falsely alleging Carey and Nick Cannon argued at Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards. And shortly before that bogus tale, we debunked the publication for wrongly claiming Carey and Lionel Richie were feuding over their joint tour. There was no truth to those stories, and the same goes for this one.\n\n\n\n(Gossip Cop)\n\n", "images": ["http://www.mcarchives.com/images/logo.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/thumb.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/createanaccount.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/comments.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/upload/members/382_small.jpg?uid=92", "http://www.mcarchives.com/fotos/fotos9/24.jpg", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/sluit_knop.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/login.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/newmessage.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/editaccount.png", "https://www.mcarchives.com/fotos/fotos9/24.jpg", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/facebook.gif", "https://www.adx.nl/update.asp?id=2&code=tDFt457q7u", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/rsslogo.gif", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/streep.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mcarchives.com/fotos/fotos9/24.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mcarchives.com/index.asp?id=13984", "title": "Mariah Carey not having \"midlife crisis\"", "meta_data": {"description": "Mariah Carey is not having a midlife crisis, despite a tabloid report.
