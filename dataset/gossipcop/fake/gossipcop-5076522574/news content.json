Britney traveled to her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, for the birth of her niece by the now 17-year-old Jamie Lynn, and while she was thrilled with little baby Maddie, she was taken aback.\n\n\u201cThat was special, but it was also strange because she\u2019s always been the baby, and now the baby was having a baby. It was mind-boggling. I was shocked a little bit,\u201d Britney told OK! \u201cBut it was really cool, and she was happy. When she got to the hospital, we all thought it was going to be an all-day thing, and instead, the baby just sort of popped out. OK, we\u2019re happy now!\u201d\n\nClick HERE to view a gallery of Britney Spears photos.\n\nBritney said Jamie Lynn will be bringing baby Maddie to Los Angeles soon, allowing the newborn to finally meet her cousins \u2013 Sean Preston, and Jayden James.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to come out here for the kids\u2019 birthdays. It will be the first time the cousins meet. I\u2019m sure the boys will be like big brothers to Maddie,\u201d Britney told the mag.\n\nBritney also provided an update on her new album, the follow up to last year\u2019s \u201cBlackout,\u201d which will be out in \u201cthe next six to nine months,\u201d the pop star said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m writing every day, right here at the piano in this living room,\u201d Brit told OK! \u201cThis is my best work ever.\u201d\n\nBritney said she is working with talented people who are helping her take her songs up a level.\n\n\u201cI think it is more urban. I\u2019m working with producers who are just amazing. It\u2019s Harvey Mason of The Underdogs,\u201d she noted. \u201cThere is this fresh new energy. \u201c\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just music Britney is working on. She confirmed she is interested in doing more acting, following her successful appearance on \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d which helped the show achieve its best ever ratings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, if I can find the right movie,\u201d Brit said when asked about continuing her thespian streak. \u201cActually, I have a part that just came up. We\u2019re just trying to work it out with my schedule, with the children.\u201d\n\nThough it was unclear from the excerpts released at press time by OK! whether Britney addressed her hospitalizations of early 2008, her run ins with the paparazzi or the conservatorship protection she is under until the end of October, her father and co-conservator, Jamie Spears, provided some answers to OK!\n\nJamie said the conservatorship of his daughter will come to a close, though he hopes it will last just a bit longer, for Britney\u2019s sake.\n\n\u201cI would hope it stands until the end of the year, and then we\u2019ll sit back and evaluate where we are at that time, where Britney is at that time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conservatorship reunited father and daughter, who in the past had moments where they were estranged from one another.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said of their relationship. \u201cIt is new for both of us. She sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up. But like all daughters, she is very manipulative and cunning. So she gets what she wants a lot.\u201d\n\nJamie also said that despite the troubles that previously affected the pop star, there was a silver lining \u2013 their new relationship and his relationship with his grandsons.\n\n\u201cGod has a way of taking something bad and turning it into something good,\u201d Jamie told OK! \u201cIf this hadn\u2019t happened, I would never have been able to get back with my daughter and have this relationship I have with these two little boys.\u201d\n\nIn related news, Jamie also explained why Britney and her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, settled their custody dispute over their two children, without going to trial.\n\n\u201cBritney and Kevin wanted to settle\u2026 The trial that was coming up was for permanent custody. It made no sense for that trial to proceed so we worked out an agreement. The agreement says that on Oct. 1 we\u2019ll probably get another overnight, and that will stay in place until the end of the year or the end of the conservatorship,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for how Jamie feels about Kevin, he offered a mixed answer.\n\n\u201cKevin has a wonderful heart. I don\u2019t agree with giving him more money,\u201d Jamie said.", "images": ["https://static.accessonline.com/uploads/73521.jpg", "http://www.accessonline.com/articles/britney-spears-speaks-pop-star-talks-sisters-pregnancy-new-music-more-64865/assets/images/logo-gray-1.png"], "top_img": "https://static.accessonline.com/uploads/73521.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.accessonline.com/articles/britney-spears-speaks-pop-star-talks-sisters-pregnancy-new-music-more-64865", "title": "Britney Spears Speaks: Pop Star Talks Sister\u2019s Pregnancy, New Music & More", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "tp": {"EnableExternalController": "true"}, "fb": {"pages": 162290915432}, "google-site-verification": "TkPbHnf5fGyE6vrIQcUc5hATUn1xbAXICAeDmJ7TtsM", "msvalidate.01": "925622343B9488A94BAEAC1029ED5D78", "description": "Britney Spears has opened up about the shock of her teenage sister\u2019s pregnancy, her new album, and future acting plans, in a new interview with OK! magazine.
