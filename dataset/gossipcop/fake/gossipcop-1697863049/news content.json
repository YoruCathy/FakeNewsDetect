It was the perfect setting.'\n\nIn Touch reports the former couple recommitted to each other on a sunny, blue-sky afternoon ahead of their original wedding anniversary on July 29.\n\nBrad's parents, his six children, and a few famous friends were also in attendance, the publication claims.\n\nAmong the famous faces were Jen and Brad's close friends, George and Amal Clooney and Courtney Cox, who acted in the bridal party.\n\n'There wasn's a lot of formality,' says the source. 'Just a beaming Brad and Jen pledging their love to each other.'\n\nRelated: Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston announce: 'We're in love again!'\n\nNo one is happier than Brad's parents, Bill and Jane, In Touch's report adds.\n\n'Jane truly considers it a blessed event,' the insider spills. 'She's always had a special kinship with Jen and was instrumental in her getting back together with Brad.'\n\nAn insider has previously stated that ever since Jen and Justin's split earlier this year, Jane has been begging her son to marry Jen.\n\n'Jane always preferred Jen to Angelina,' the Pitt insider claimed.\n\nIn the last 18 months, Brad's devoted himself to a sober lifestyle and started therapy, which insiders say has paved the way for his renewed relationship with Jen.\n\n'Brad and Jen are more open with each other now than they ever were in their marriage. They are older, wiser and different people in different places of their lives now,' says an insider.\n\n'They both know they got it wrong the first time around.'\n\nJen is finally getting the happy ever after she's longed for.\n\n'She's in it for the long haul with Brad,' a friend tells In Touch. 'Brad loves how they've both come full circle and found each other again. They were destined to be together.'\n\nNeither Brad or Jen have responded to In Touch's report.\n\nRelated: Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunite with a wedding and a baby\n\nRelated: Brad and Jen's wedding minister comes forward\n\nListen below to our new podcast WHO ARE YOU with Pete Timbs - this week he talks to Roxy Jacenko.
