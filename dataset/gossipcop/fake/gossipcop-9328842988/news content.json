After graduating from high school, Pratt briefly attended community college before moving to Maui, where lived in a van on the beach and took whatever jobs he could get, including working as a stripper and on behalf of the organization Jews For Jesus. Eventually Pratt landed a job at the Bubba Gump Fish Company, where by chance in 2000 he served actress and director Rae Dawn Chong, who decided to cast the then-19-year-old in her short film \u201cCursed Part 3.\u201d Pratt then moved to Los Angeles and starred from 2002 to 2006 as Bright Abbott on the WB show \u201cEverwood.\u201d After the series ended, he had a small recurring role on \u201cThe O.C.\u201d before being cast as Andy Dwyer on NBC\u2019s hit \u201cParks & Recreation.\u201d First playing the deadbeat boyfriend of Rashida Jones\u2019 character Ann Perkins and later as the husband of April Ludgate, played by Aubrey Plaza, Pratt didn\u2019t seem to be headed to become a major movie star, but that\u2019s exactly what he was by the time the show ended in 2015. In the year before the TV series went off the air, Pratt began to make his move onto the big screen. In 2014, he first starred in \u201cThe Lego Movie\u201d as Emmet Brickowski and then later that year as Star-Lord in Marvel\u2019s \u201cGuardians Of The Galaxy.\u201d That latter role in the blockbuster sci-fi/fantasy film helped Pratt become one of Hollywood\u2019s most popular leading men, something he would cement in 2015 with his starring role in the long-awaited return of the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d franchise, playing the lead role of park ranger Owen Grady. He has since continued to make several more \u201cGuardian Of The Galaxy\u201d and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d movies. Pratt is also known for his varied roles. Displaying tremendous range, the actor has starred as a baseball player in 2011\u2019s \u201cMoneyball\u201d and a Navy SEAL in \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d in 2012 to a cowboy in 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d and a bad guy in 2019\u2019s \u201cThe Kid.\u201d On the personal front, Pratt met actress Ana Farris while working together on the 2007 film \u201cTake Me Home Tonight.\u201d Two years later, they eloped in Bali, Indonesia. In 2012, Pratt and Farris welcomed a boy born named Jack. But by 2017, the two had announced they were separating and were officially divorce the following year. In June of 2018, Pratt found love again. He began dating Katherine Schwarzenegger, the daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver. The couple married in June of 2019.", "title": "Chris Pratt | Gossip Cop - Part", "site": "@GossipCop"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Chris Pratt was born on June 21, 1979 in the small city of Virginia, Minnesota, but was raised in Lake Stevens, a town outside of Seattle, Washington, where his family moved when..."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://ln.is", "summary": ""}
