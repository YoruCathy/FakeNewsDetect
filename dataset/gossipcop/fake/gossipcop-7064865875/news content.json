Details about and Pitt \u2013 also on board as a producer \u2013 and Negga\u2019s role are being kept under wraps for now.\n\nLast year Negga, 35, attracted international attention when she received an Academy Award nomination for her role in the historical drama Loving. Although she missed out on the Best Actress gong at the ceremony in February, she\u2019s clearly not stuck for work.\n\nIFTA winner Negga, who initially rose to fame on home shores in RTE\u2019s Love/Hate and E4 series Misfits, is currently starring in season two of AMC\u2019s comic book adaptation Preacher. The actress appears opposite her other half, British boyfriend Dominic Cooper, 39, in the drama.\n\n\u2018It would be so lonely if he wasn\u2019t there,\u2019 she said about working with her leading man.\n\n\u2018People say, \u201cNever go out with an actor.\u201d But if you were with someone with a normal job, and one of you had to go away, how would that work?\u2019\n\nThe couple, who have been together since 2009, maintain a low-profile approach to their relationship.\n\nHowever, last month in an interview with Net-a-Porter\u2019s The Edit, Negga gave some insight into her romance with Cooper and spoke about the idea of having children. She revealed she is constantly thinking about \u2018when\u2019 and \u2018if\u2019 she would like children.\n\nNegga said: \u2018By the time you\u2019re in a great relationship, it\u2019s like, oh, I\u2019m 35. S***. So there is part of your thinking that is: \u201cDo I want kids? When? If? How?\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s there, all the time, preoccupying me. And that\u2019s not being an actor, it\u2019s being a woman. I don\u2019t know what [job] really creates a safe space for a woman to have time out, prolong the human race, and return to work in a very supportive way.\u2019", "images":
