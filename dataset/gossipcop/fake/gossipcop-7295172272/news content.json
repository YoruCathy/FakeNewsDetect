The Love, Simon star is reportedly dating Josh Duhamel, who split with Fergie a few months ago. How does Affleck feel about his ex-wife dating again?\n\nAccording to Caf\u00e9 Mom, an inside source revealed that Garner has been secretly dating Duhamel for a few months. The source explained that Garner was having trouble finding a man she could trust and that Duhamel is pretty much the perfect guy. Although the actress is still keeping things tightly under wraps, her relationship with Duhamel couldn\u2019t be going any better.\n\n\u201cAnyone in Jen\u2019s shoes, after all she went through with Ben, would doubt whether they could ever trust a man again,\u201d the insider stated. \u201cBut Josh is truly a good guy, and spending time with him opened her up emotionally. She\u2019s still playing her cards close to the vest, but she\u2019s excited about where this could go.\u201d\n\nDuhamel parted with Fergie back in September. The couple released a joint statement shortly after their split, confirming that they are no longer together.\n\nThe two did not reveal why they decided to end their romance but are keeping their breakup private while they focus on moving forward as a family. Duhamel and Fergie share one son together, 4-year-old Axl.\n\nWhile it is great to see Garner back in the dating game, an insider revealed exactly how Affleck feels about the situation. The source revealed that the Justice League star is a little jealous of Garner\u2019s new romance.\n\nThe insider explained how Garner and Duhamel met while working on their latest movie, Love, Simon, and that they waited a long time before they started dating.\n\nAlthough Affleck has also moved on with Lindsay Shookus, he wasn\u2019t ready to see Garner do the same. Not only did Affleck reportedly feel jealous about Garner\u2019s new love life, but he was also felt threatened by Duhamel.\n\nAffleck and Garner announced their divorce back in 2015, though they didn\u2019t finalize anything until April of last year.\n\nThe two were married for over a decade and share three kids: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 5.\n\nOnce again, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are co-parenting like the best of them. https://t.co/KWeqvSzBAH \u2014 E!
