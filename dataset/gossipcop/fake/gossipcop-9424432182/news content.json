The troubled rapper sought medical treatment for a flu-like illness, but insiders say that the anniversary of Donda West\u2019s birthday always brings problems. Could West be headed for another breakdown?\n\nAccording to Radar Online, West\u2019s wife Kim Kardashian is tired of her husband\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cWhenever anything arises that makes Kanye reflect back on Donda\u2019s death, he gets all weird, and Kim is just sick of it,\u201d reveals a source. \u201cHe is constantly blaming his mom\u2019s death, and while the family tries to be understanding, they are all tired of him using Donda\u2019s death as a reason for him to go off the rails again.\u201d\n\n'Kids See Ghosts II' possibly next year? ? https://t.co/X12U8ojrVG \u2014 XXL Magazine (@XXL) July 25, 2018\n\nThe insider adds that West has a cycle of behavior that starts with him isolating himself and becoming withdrawn. Then, when anyone questions his motives, he starts acting crazy and gets defensive. He feels that people are being insensitive about his mom\u2019s death.\n\nKardashian continues to defend her husband and tells her family \u201cto lay off.\u201d But, she is getting sick of West\u2019s behavior.\n\nBack in 2016, the rapper had a meltdown around the time of his mom\u2019s birthday. He later admitted in an interview that he had to seek treatment for substance abuse after getting hooked on painkillers.\n\nThe insider also claims that Kardashian is tired of covering her husband\u2019s tracks, and the family is afraid he could be heading for another relapse. For about a week, West has apparently been showing signs of mental instability. The 41-year-old has allegedly been \u201cacting strange\u201d since July 12th \u2013 Donda West\u2019s birthday \u2013 but no one will say anything to him out of fear that he will \u201cfreak out.\u201d\n\nAfter his brief hospital visit, People Magazine is reporting that West is getting stronger. Doctors ran tests and gave him some meds, and now the rapper needs to rest. He had been sick for a few days, and didn\u2019t get better, so Kardashian took him to get medical treatment. The reality star wanted to be sure he didn\u2019t have pneumonia like their son Saint did back in January.\n\nSince he returned home from the hospital, West\u2019s daughter North has been helping him heal. He tweeted earlier this week that he could \u201cstill feel the love,\u201d and shared a pic of the 5-year-old giving him a kiss on the cheek.\n\nDespite not feeling well, West and attended rapper Pusha T\u2019s wedding to Virginia Williams at the Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach. Other guests included Pharrell Williams, The Dream, Fabolous, and Trey Songz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West have not commented on the rumors surrounding his mental health.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlynn-Carter-BoxClue.com_-300x199.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5d6534336f24eb08dc37b826-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YNWMelly-Vibe.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cynthia-Bailey-has-a-helpful-message-for-her-fans-about-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kanye-West-Is-Reportedly-Heading-For-Another-Breakdown-And-Relapse.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/corey-feldman-and-corey-haim-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Newly-Engaged-Counting-On-Stars-John-David-Duggar-And-Abbie-Grace-Burnett-Caught-Breaking-Jim-Bobs-Rules-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-vz.cnwimg.com--300x237.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kim-Kardashian-StyleCaster.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kanye-West-Is-Reportedly-Heading-For-Another-Breakdown-And-Relapse.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Lisa Legrano", "J.
