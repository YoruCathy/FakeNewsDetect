Bachelor in Paradise is kinda weird.\n\nKhloe Kardashian being pregnant, it would seem, is not one of them. Yes, that\u2019s right.\n\nDespite the fact the 33-year-old appears to be very, very with child \u2013 literally WEEKS from popping out a tiny infant \u2013 the internet is building a case to support their unusual theory that Khloe has been faking her pregnancy for months on her momager Kris\u2019 orders in the name of publicity.\n\nWe are 99.83 per cent sure this theory is completely and utterly bogus. But that .17 per cent of us that lives for these kinds of wild conspiracies urged us to sort through all the facts for ourselves.\n\nThus began our investigation into whether one Khloe Alexandra Kardashian is actually pregnant.\n\nPart One: The initial reports from Blind Gossip.\n\nThis theory all began with a single report from gossip website Blind Gossip saying the reason for Khloe\u2019s delayed pregnancy confirmation was because she was not really with child.\n\n\u201cPeople think that she is just waiting to be safe before she confirms the pregnancy. She actually is not even pregnant! She is just stretching out the rumours as long as possible because of publicity,\u201d the site reported a source said.\n\nCredible, no?\n\nLogical explanation:\n\nThankfully we didn\u2019t have to dig too deep to figure this one out.\n\nKhloe explained exactly why she kept her pregnancy news to herself for so long in an Instagram post in December 2017, saying \u201cwe wanted to enjoy this between our family and close friends as long as we could privately. To enjoy our first precious moments just us.\u201d\n\nFair enough.", "images": ["http://www.mamamia.com.au/assets/img/6382048.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=810745638982745&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1200 800'%3e%3cpath d='M0 0h1200v800H0z' fill='%23fafafb'/%3e%3c/svg%3e", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/27144906/Headshot_Amy.png", "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/27190902/khloe-kardashian-not-pregnant.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 440 165'%3e%3cpath d='M0 0h440v165H0z' fill='%23fafafb'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mamamia.com.au/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/27190902/khloe-kardashian-not-pregnant.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mamamia.com.au/khloe-kardashian-fake-pregnancy-theory/", "title": "A thorough investigation into the theories that \"prove\" Khloe Kardashian isn't pregnant.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "description": "Khloe Kardashian fake pregnancy theories are gaining traction on Twitter.
