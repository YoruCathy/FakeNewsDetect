No remaining baby weight was apparent in her now stick-thin frame,\u201d the outlet continues, noting, \u201cGeorge too seemed off, as he flashed a shocked, cold look at the cameras while walking with his wife. The duo seemed to want to avoid attention as they left the court.\u201d\n\nYou think? Like most famous couples, the Clooneys don\u2019t like being followed by paparazzi. It\u2019s no wonder George appeared unhappy. As for his wife, there was nothing \u201codd\u201d about her appearance, despite the online publication using that description twice. While this story is written as if Clooney only gave birth just a few \u201cweeks\u201d ago, the twins actually arrived on June 6, nearly 12 weeks ago. That\u2019s more than just a few. And at nearly three months post-partum, it is not unreasonable that the attorney is back to her normally slim frame.\n\nShe by no means look \u201cskeletal,\u201d and there is nothing \u201cshocking\u201d about the photos. RadarOnline shamefully wanted a clickbait approach to the latest snapshots of the couple, and grossly decided Clooney\u2019s body should be the angle. The webloid even asks readers at the end, \u201cWhat do you think of Amal\u2019s extreme weight loss? Do you think the pair is doing okay after welcoming their twins?\u201d Here\u2019s another question: Why would random people on the Internet know whether the Clooneys are doing okay?\n\nFor the record, they are. But at issue is the site\u2019s fake concern. The outlet didn\u2019t post these photos because they were genuinely worried Clooney was on an \u201cextreme post-baby weight loss diet.\u201d They wanted traffic. And if the lawyer was still on the heavier side, the publication would\u2019ve claimed she was struggling to lose weight. There\u2019s no way to win. This is the same webloid that body-shamed Tori Spelling for gaining weight after body-shaming her for being too skinny. RadarOnline remains disgusting.\n\nPhoto: AOL", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e02155cd68bf0576babf110?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-amal-clooney-body-shamed-two-months-after-giving-birth-to-twins/", "title": "Amal Clooney Body-Shamed Two Months After Giving Birth To Twins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Amal Clooney is being body-shamed two months after giving birth to twins.", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "Queen's Feast, Charlotte restaurant week, charlotte north carolina, Charlotte NC, food, restaurants, dining, good eats, 30 or 35 bucks for three courses, best restaurants, deals, Queen's Feast, Charlotte restaurant week, charlotte north carolina, Charlotte NC, food, restaurants, dining, good eats, 30 or 35 bucks for three courses, best restaurants, deals", "og": {"title": "Amal Clooney Body-Shamed Two Months After Giving Birth To Twins | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-amal-clooney-body-shamed-two-months-after-giving-birth-to-twins/", "description": "Amal Clooney is being body-shamed two months after giving birth to twins.", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-amal-clooney-body-shamed-two-months-after-giving-birth-to-twins/", "site": "@QueensFeast", "creator": "@QueensFeast", "title": "Amal Clooney Body-Shamed Two Months After Giving Birth To Twins | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "Amal Clooney is being body-shamed two months after giving birth to twins.", "domain": "charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Amal Clooney Body-Shamed Two Months After Giving Birth To Twins | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-20-amal-clooney-body-shamed-two-months-after-giving-birth-to-twins/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "Queen's Feast, Charlotte restaurant week, charlotte north carolina, Charlotte NC, food, restaurants, dining, good eats, 30 or 35 bucks for three courses, best restaurants, deals, Queen's Feast, Charlotte restaurant week, charlotte north carolina, Charlotte NC, food, restaurants, dining, good eats, 30 or 35 bucks for three courses, best restaurants, deals", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNy8yOC81OTdiNjE3YThjMDhlMDE1YzFjMzQ2MWUvNTk3YjYxN2E2NzA5ODQxOTk0YjlmYzJkX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "fb": {"pages": 106038777280}, "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-20T16:10:00Z", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-section": "(EDMS) Entertainment Report (137691)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503158400.0, "source": "http://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
