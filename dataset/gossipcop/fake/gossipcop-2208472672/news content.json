The motivation for the hilarious rant was the cover of a tabloid that claimed \u2014 with zero evidence \u2014 that his sister, actress Kate Hudson, is dating the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cHe drinks out of the f\u2014 carton and he leaves the door open when he\u2019s taking a dump!!\u201d the 40-year-old actor jokingly vented. \u201cAnd this is when he\u2019s at MY house!!! He\u2019s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\n\nOliver went on to write even his mother, Overboard star Goldie Hawn, was \u201covertly flirting with him,\u201d going around \u201cwearing these little nighties around the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Pa just keeps saying \u2018All right!! It\u2019s Brad Pitt!!'\u201d the actor continued, adding \u201cAnyway not going well.. so BP.. it\u2019s time to move out man.. I need my life back dog.. I\u2019ll smoke one more bowl and then get the f\u2014 out.\u201d\n\nThe joke was lighthearted and seems to come at a time when Pitt is slowly but steadily making more public appearances. Pitt recently stepped out at a Malibu-held charity event, where he seemed in good spirits as he took photos with fans.\n\nPitt was seen shaking hands and making people laugh at the event, whose other famous guests included Charlie Hunnam, Rami Malek, Garrett Hedlund, Kaley Cuoco, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Scott Foley and David Spade.\n\nEarlier this month, Pitt made a surprise appearance at the Golden Globes where he presented the film Moonlight, which his company produced. The critically acclaimed film won the Globe for best drama.\n\nOne day later, he and his ex Angelina Jolie released a joint statement stating that they have reached an agreement to handle their divorce privately and keep details confidential.\n\nAccording to the statement obtained by PEOPLE, \u201cThe parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues. The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=435&h=228&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F01%2Fkate-hudson-435-213.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=435&h=228&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F01%2Fkate-hudson-435-213.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/kate-hudson-brad-pitt-dating-oliver-hudson-joke/", "title": "Oliver Hudson Jokes About Brad Pitt Dating Sister Kate Hudson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brad Pitt,Goldie Hawn,Kate Hudson,Kurt Russell,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Oliver Hudson", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt,Goldie Hawn,Kate Hudson,Kurt Russell,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Oliver Hudson", "description": "The Rules of Engagement actor took to Instagram on Friday to jokingly vent about Brad Pitt living at his home, saying \"He's messy as s---\"", "og": {"title": "Oliver Hudson Jokes About Brad Pitt Dating Sister Kate Hudson", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/kate-hudson-brad-pitt-dating-oliver-hudson-joke/", "description": "Oliver Hudson has a bone to pick with Brad Pitt.
