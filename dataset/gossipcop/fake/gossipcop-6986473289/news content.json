Selena Gomez believes she has made the right decision when it comes to on-again, off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber \u2014 by choosing not to be with him.\n\n\u201cSelena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cShe obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,\u201d the source continued before adding, \u201cShe feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.\u201d\n\nSharing the same sentiment, another insider tells Us that the \u201cWolves\u201d singer, who was the one who broke it off with Bieber, feels like \u201cshe got it out of her system.\u201d Helping things is the fact that Gomez, 25, has other exciting things to focus on, like her new single \u201cBack 2 You\u201d which will be released on Thursday, May 10 \u2014 a song that many are speculating to have been inspired by Bieber.\n\nUs Weekly exclusively revealed that the former flames, who dated from 2011 to 2014, were officially back together after they were spotted reuniting in October 2017. Their rekindled romance saw the pair going to church, enjoying candle-lit dinners and embarking on romantic getaways together, including a trip to Jamaica in February, when the pair attended Bieber\u2019s father\u2019s wedding.\n\nDespite trying to make their revamped relationship work, one person was not convinced that it was a good idea: Gomez\u2019s mother, Mandy Teefey, who reportedly disagreed with her daughter over her decision to give Bieber another chance despite their past tumultuous relationship. In March, Us Weekly announced that the pair were \u201ctaking a break\u201d because of Teefy\u2019s unwavering disapproval of the \u201cBaby\u201d crooner. Since putting their relationship on pause, Bieber, 24, has been spotted spending time with Baskin Champion.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C870px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-chose-happiness-over-justin-bieber/", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018Chose Happiness\u2019 Over Justin Bieber", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Selena Gomez is happy with her decision to 'choose happiness' over Justin Bieber, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018Chose Happiness\u2019 Over Justin Bieber", "description": "Selena Gomez is happy with her decision to 'choose happiness' over Justin Bieber, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-chose-happiness-over-justin-bieber/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-09T23:06:23+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Selena Gomez is happy with her decision to 'choose happiness' over Justin Bieber, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 find out more", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018Chose Happiness\u2019 Over Justin Bieber", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1539px%2C808px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525907183.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
