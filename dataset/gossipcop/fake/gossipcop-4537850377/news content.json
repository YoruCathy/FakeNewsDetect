Nobody was laughing. There were many boos and many women who were telling him he was a sexist pig. Two people got kicked out.\"\n\nThings took another awkward turn when he switched topics, touching on the widespread Harvey Weinstein scandal, he added, \"Weinstein f****d with me by trying to have me star in the worst movies of all time...\"\n\nNeedless to say, Twitter wasn't here for his comments.
