I thought, \u2018Who is this guy?!\u2019 \u201d Longoria spent the next two-and-a-half years getting to know the father of three, who proposed to her on December 15, 2015 during a trip to Dubai.\n\n\u201cI want to yell from the highest mountaintop about everything that goes on with us because I\u2019m so happy and excited to be with a person as kind as Pepe is,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cHe is probably one of the first men I\u2019ve dated that has been older and established and, basically, a grown-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is so nice to be arm-in-arm with someone who is your equal.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Barcroft Media\n\nAfter three years and five months of dating, the two wed in May 2016 in Mexico.
