The White House meeting included a ceremonial signing of the Music Modernization Act, which has increased royalty rights for musicians.\n\nWest also returned to music in a big way in 2018. The rapper released his album, \u201cYe,\u201d on June 1, 2018, which was his first album release since 2016. The album features other big names like Nicki Minaj. West also released an album, \u201cKids See Ghosts,\u201d with Kid Cudi on June 8.\n\nIn addition to his music, West appears to be busy with his business ventures: In April, the entrepreneur tweeted that his clothing company, Yeezy, would hit $1 billion in 2018. During a July appearance on the \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d show, Kim Kardashian West confirmed rumors that Kanye West was approaching billionaire status. His claim that Yeezy would hit the milestone is unlikely, but not impossible, according to GQ magazine.\n\nOpen a New Bank Account\n\n\n\n\u2014 ye (@kanyewest) We have 160 positions to fill by the end of the year. Yeezy will hit a billion dollars this year. It is the 2nd fastest growing company in history. It is a unicorn on its way to becoming a decacorn.\u2014 ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018\n\nKanye West Net Worth: $250M\n\nDespite his wife\u2019s assertion of him reaching near-billionaire status, Kanye West\u2019s current net worth is reported to be $250 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. But at $220 per pair of Yeezy 350s, West would need to do just 12 shoe releases of 400,000 pairs over the course of a year to hit $1 billion in sales, according to GQ.\n\nAlthough the full impact of Kanye West\u2019s recent controversial statements on his net worth is yet to be seen, at least one radio station program, \u201cThe Morning Bounce\u201d on 105.1 in Detroit, announced in May 2018 that it would no longer play West\u2019s music or have him on the show due to his comments on slavery. Other media personalities and hashtags to #BoycottKanye and #MuteKanye called for similar action around that time, but those statements haven\u2019t resulted in a documented hit to West\u2019s net worth.\n\nHis net worth is certainly a lot, but it\u2019s less than half of the family fortune. Kim Kardashian West has a net worth of $350 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, bringing the couple\u2019s grand total to $600 million.\n\nAnother Near-Billionaire in the Family: Kylie Jenner Net Worth Skyrockets \u2014 See the Kardashian Sister\u2019s Unbelievable Fortune\n\nThe couple has spent years renovating their $20 million Hidden Hills, Calif., estate since they purchased it in August 2014. They\u2019ve spent around $20 million to overhaul the 30,000-square-foot property, TMZ reported in January 2018.\n\nBefore the move, they resided at their 9,000-square-foot Bel-Air, Calif., mansion, which they purchased for $9 million in 2013 and spent more than $2 million updating. In November 2017, the couple sold the home for $17.8 million, TMZ reported. Not only did this net them a huge profit, but the sale also made history as the most expensive sale in the Bel-Air Crest community.\n\nKanye\u2019s most recent real estate eye-catcher is a swank apartment in one of Miami Beach\u2019s most luxurious condos. He spent $14 million buying a unit in Faena House for his wife. The 47-unit building features upper crust trappings such as Miele appliances, Dornbracht bathroom finishes and marble flooring, all of which are listed as standard on the Miami Condo Investments website.\n\nKanye West Music Career\n\nKanye West\u2019s debut album, \u201cThe College Dropout\u201d (2004), included hit songs like \u201cJesus Walks\u201d and \u201cSlow Jamz.\u201d He followed that album with his sophomore record, \u201cLate Registration\u201d (2005), which included the song \u201cGold Digger\u201d featuring Jamie Foxx. Then came the albums \u201cGraduation\u201d (2007), \u201c808s & Heartbreak\u201d (2008), \u201cMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u201d (2010), \u201cYeezus\u201d (2013) and \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d (2016).\n\nHis latest album, \u201cYe,\u201d debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. About 70 percent of sales were composed of streaming equivalent albums, which was a first for a Billboard chart-topper. In March 2017, \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d became West\u2019s eighth album to go platinum. This accomplishment is especially significant considering more than 500,000 copies were pirated, making it one of the most bootlegged albums of all time.\n\nUnfortunately for West, the \u201cSaint Pablo Tour\u201d didn\u2019t have the same happy ending. Following a slew of erratic onstage antics, West canceled the final 21 dates of the tour in November 2016.\n\nOpen a New Bank Account\n\nWest began releasing new music in April 2018, starting with the single \u201cLift Yourself,\u201d which some believe is some sort of inside joke. He released the single \u201cYe vs. the People\u201d shortly after, which features West and rapper T.I. talking about their political differences. Unfortunately for West, the media blitz didn\u2019t seem to help generate sales for his new singles. \u201cLift Yourself\u201d only racked up 4,000 digital sales in its first week, and \u201cYe vs. the People\u201d reached only 12,000 in first-week digital sales, The Fader reported in May 2018.\n\nAlso See: Rapper Tyga\u2019s Net Worth and Luxurious Lifestyle\n\nKanye West Business Ventures\n\nApart from music, Kanye West is also a fashion designer with his own collection: Yeezy. Yeezy Season 1 debuted at New York Fashion Week in February 2015 as a collaboration between West and Adidas. West debuted Yeezy Season 6 on Instagram, a departure from his usual NYFW debuts.\n\nPrior to joining forces with Adidas, West created a successful line of Nike Air Yeezy sneakers. But he cut ties with Nike in November 2013, claiming the company didn\u2019t pay him royalties. In June 2016, Adidas announced it would continue its partnership with West, which could help turn him into a billionaire, Inc reported. Under the terms of this agreement, he\u2019ll get his own retail shops, according to Inc. West has also expressed his interest in designing basketball and football athletic wear.\n\nIn April 2018, West claimed on Twitter that he is \u201ccurrently the single highest paid person in footwear. That means I make more money on shoes than Michael Jordan.\u201d Whether or not his claims are true, his Adidas contract is definitely lucrative. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted said that the company has not discussed dropping its deal with West, even though \u201cthere clearly are some comments we don\u2019t support.\u201d\n\nBeyond Yeezy, Kardashian West and West debuted their own line of children\u2019s clothing in May 2017.\n\nKanye West Family\n\nKanye West spent an estimated $6.2 million to surprise his then-girlfriend Kim Kardashian with an elaborate marriage proposal in San Francisco. The couple married in Italy the following year in an extravagant ceremony thought to have cost roughly $2.8 million. This sum does not include the cost of their prenuptial festivities in Paris, which involved renting out the Palace of Versailles for their wedding rehearsal.\n\nFrequently vocal about his love for his wife, West has a history of showering her with over-the-top gestures. For example, for Mother\u2019s Day 2016, West woke his wife with a surprise performance by a string ensemble in their living room. For Christmas 2017, West surprised Kardashian West with hundreds of thousands of dollars in stock options from major performing brands such as The Walt Disney Company, Adidas, Netflix and Apple. Kardashian West splashed the generous gift all over social media, touting West as the \u201cbest husband,\u201d according to Fortune.\n\nKanye West Kids\n\nThe couple currently has three children. Their daughter North was born on June 15, 2013; their son Saint was born on Dec. 5, 2015; and their third child, daughter Chicago, was born on Jan. 15, 2018, delivered via surrogate. The decision to use a surrogate came after Kardashian West was pregnant and faced birth complications in the form of placenta accreta with her first two babies. The newest Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West baby will also be delivered via surrogate.\n\nOpen a New Bank Account\n\nClick through to read more about the ultimate status symbols only the rich can afford.\n\nMore on Net Worth and Celebrities\n\nWe make money easy.
