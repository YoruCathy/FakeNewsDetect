Find out exact dates here & why she hopes baby comes that week!\n\nKhloe Kardashian, 33, is reportedly expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, 26, and she\u2019s rumored to be about five months along in her pregnancy, putting her due date somewhere in February. More specifically though, she\u2019s apparently due in MID February, and she\u2019s hoping her baby\u2019s birthdate falls during NBA All-Star Weekend. Why? Because that way, Tristan, who plays basketball for the Cleveland Cavaliers, doesn\u2019t have to miss out on any court time. Click here to see adorable pics of Khloe with her nieces and nephews.\n\nBut while Tristan will have a nice chunk of time off during All-Star Weekend, he\u2019s also made sure he\u2019ll be able to take a short break when baby Thompson arrives \u2014 no matter WHEN it happens. \u201cTristan will be given a few days off from the Cavs when Khloe goes into labor, and everyone is actually hoping it occurs during the NBA All-Star break so he doesn\u2019t miss any time on the court,\u201d a source close to the Cavs revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cBut one thing that is good, is that the All-Star Game is actually in LA this season. So things may work out perfectly, at least that is what everyone is hoping for. But regardless, he has already got it covered if the baby comes before or after.\u201d\n\nNBA All-Star Weekend will be held from February 16th-19th next year, and, conveniently, it\u2019ll take place in LA at the Staples Center. So no matter what ends up happening with Khloe and the baby, Tristan has a plan in place. The Cavs\u2019 last game before All-Star Weekend is an away game on Feb. 13, and their first game once All-Star Weekend has ended is a home game on Feb. 22. So it looks like Khloe\u2019s due date falls in between the the 16th and the 19th, but anytime in February is also fair game.\n\nIn preparation of their tiny addition, Tristan, who resides on the East Coast, is looking to buy a home in LA, according to TMZ. While the athlete was previously after a temporary home in LA, since Khloe\u2019s pregnancy news, he wants something much more permanent in order to be close to Khloe and their future child, the media outlet reported. Tristan is reportedly set on Bel Air, Beverly Hills, or the Hollywood Hills, and has a budget of around $20 million. Looks like Tristan truly is trying to make sure everything is in place for when his second child arrives!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Tristan and Khloe are having a baby boy or girl?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F03%2Fkhloe-kardashian-due-date-baby-tristan-thompson-nba-all-star-weekend%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2812774", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/03/khloe-kardashian-due-date-baby-tristan-thompson-nba-all-star-weekend/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian & Tristan Thompson: Why She\u2019s Hoping Baby Comes During NBA All-Star Break", "meta_data": {"description": "While Khloe Kardashian's 1st child is reportedly due early next year, she specifically wants to give birth during NBA All-Star Weekend.
