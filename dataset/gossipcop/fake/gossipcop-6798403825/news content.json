The former King Of Diamonds stripper has hired celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom to file a restraining order against Kardashian.\n\nThe news came via a tweet from Bloom on Friday.\n\n\u201cI represent Blac Chyna. I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we\u2019ll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him. More to come,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nThe day before Bloom gave her opinion on the Blac Chyna-Rob Kardashian situation via the social media platform.\n\n\u201cMy take: what Rob Kardashian did to Blac Chyna could be \u2018revenge porn,\u2019 and illegal,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWomen, stand up for our rights!\u201d\n\nAs the Inquisitr previously reported, on Wednesday, Rob Kardashian went on a rampage against the mother of his child on Instagram and Twitter. His social media posts blasted Chyna for allegedly cheating on him in his bed. He also shared nude pictures of her and revealed that he had paid for her weight loss surgery after her pregnancy. Rob\u2019s Instagram account was eventually suspended because of his posts, but then he continued his tirade on Twitter.\n\nIn response, Chyna posted a now deleted Snapchat where she accused Rob of abusing her physically.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, one of Chyna\u2019s other attorneys, Walter Mosley, made a statement on her behalf soon after Kardashian\u2019s tantrum cooled down.\n\nI represent Blac Chyna. I just gave Rob Kardashian notice that we'll be in court Monday seeking restraining orders against him. More to come \u2014 Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 7, 2017\n\nMy take: what Rob Kardashian did to Blac Chyna could be \u2018revenge porn,\u2019 and illegal. Women, stand up for our rights! https://t.co/Lyie5GzpcY \u2014 Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) July 6, 2017\n\n\u201cI am exploring all legal remedies and protections available to my client at this time in attempts to best advise her on how she may want to proceed,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBlac Chyna\u2019s hiring of Lisa Bloom could be an indication that she intends to pursue \u201crevenge porn\u201d charges against Rob Kardashian in the future. According to Gossip Cop, Lisa Bloom has experience with this type of case. She has previously represented actress Mischa Barton who filed a restraining order against an ex who threatened to release a sex-tape of her.\n\nNo matter what you think of @BLACCHYNA, no one should post her nudes without her consent - https://t.co/3LezSQWC5U pic.twitter.com/3n62ZZr8ur \u2014 AFROPUNK (@afropunk) July 7, 2017\n\nRob Kardashian repossessed the cars he gave Blac Chyna ???? https://t.co/HhzHqEpmmE pic.twitter.com/Mbu1OWMxYj \u2014 Global Grind (@GlobalGrind) July 7, 2017\n\nIf Blac Chyna continues to pursue the matter, it could lead to very serious consequences for Rob Kardashian. As attorney Carrrie Goldberg told People Magazine, California has \u201cvery, very strong non-consensual pornography laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is sort of the classic, quintessential revenge porn,\u201d said Goldberg, who is not an attorney for Chyna or Kardashian. \u201cRob has made the work of a prosecutor or a victim\u2019s attorney quite easy so far as to even post about the very motive behind his outrageous act of posting these private and nude photos of his ex.\u201d\n\nRob Kardashian's leaked Blac Chyna pictures could land him in jail\u2014AND cost him millions https://t.co/YZiX3VvTPn pic.twitter.com/h5vUxYNKMH \u2014 Complex (@Complex) July 7, 2017\n\nRob Kardashian could be sentenced to up to six months in jail and a fine, Goldberg said. She also noted that Kardashian could face a civil lawsuit from Chyna as well.\n\nDo you think that Rob Kardashian will be punished for releasing Blac Chyna\u2019s nude photos?
