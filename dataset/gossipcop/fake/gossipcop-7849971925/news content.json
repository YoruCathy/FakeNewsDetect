It\u2019s hard because if everyone distances themselves from Tristan, they\u2019ll risk losing Khlo\u00e9,\u201d the insider explained. \u201cLuckily there\u2019s this buffer time. She always planned to stay in Cleveland the first three months. Now with Tristan in the playoffs for possibly another month, no decision needs to be made right now.\u201d\n\nRumors began to swirl that the couple may have gotten back together after the pair were snapped on Friday, laughing and chatting together at what appeared to be a lunch with friends in Cleveland.\n\nAccording to TMZ, a week ago Kardashian was said to be \"done\" with her 27-year-old boyfriend and decided to stay in Cleveland for the baby while Thompson travels for the NBA playoffs. But things seemed have changed for the new mom in just a week.\n\nAnother source also confirmed to People on Friday that Thompson \u201cis back at the Cleveland house\u201d with Kardashian and their 3-week-old daughter, after it was reported that the basketball player was not allowed in the house following the days of True's birth.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 seems happy,\u201d the source told People. \u201cShe loves being a mom. She\u2019s focused on keeping her family together. She seems okay with Tristan \u2014 there\u2019s no talk of a split.\u201d\n\nThe news of Kardashian and Thompson's reported reconciliation comes after her family members, Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian, did interviews on \"The Ellen Show\" and commented Thompson's recent cheating allegations.\n\n\u201cIt's so f\u2014ed up,\" Kim said of the basketball player's cheating.\n\nIn another episode, Jenner explained that her daughter, the new mom, was \"still figuring it out.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of that kid. I get choked up because she\u2019s such a good mom, and honestly I get so emotional,\u201d she shared. \u201cI was in Cleveland last week, it was snowing, and she was all nestled in the nursery and the baby. She\u2019s just concentrating on that, just being a mom, her baby and that\u2019s what her sisters are doing as well. She\u2019s so excited about motherhood and trying to get the nursing thing down, which is a little tricky. She\u2019s trying, she\u2019s really trying. That was a little bit tricky when I was there \u2026 She\u2019s figuring it out one day at a time, she\u2019s just the best mom already. That baby is so cute, little True.\u201d\n\nTwo days ago, Kardashian disabled her comments on her Instagram. The reason for her social media action is unknown.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mafia-Hit-Man.jpg?ve=1&tl=1",
