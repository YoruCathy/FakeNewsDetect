And I think it\u2019s timing,\u201d says the source. \u201cThey\u2019ve been all over the place. They have not seen each other in probably two months.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t vicious,\u201d adds the source.\n\nBut despite the split, Pattinson and twigs haven\u2019t closed the door on a possible reconciliation.\n\n\u201cI think they will eventually get back together,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe still loves her and I think that\u2019s the girl he wants to marry.\u201d\n\nIn fact, twigs (n\u00e9 Tahliah Debrett Barnett) still has her engagement ring.\n\nImage zoom Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that they could get back together and it\u2019s more like they are taking a break,\u201d says the source. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he asked for the ring. She still has it.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for twigs had no comment on the matter.\n\nPattinson, 31, and twigs, 29, were first photographed hanging out together with friends in 2014 \u2014 fueling rumors of a romance. Just a few months later, the relationship was undeniable when the Twilight star arrived at the singer\u2019s first sold-out concert with a beautiful bouquet of roses.\n\nThe pair were a private couple, keeping a low profile for most of their time together. Their first official public appearance was in late 2016 at the LA Dance Annual Gala.\n\nPattinson popped the question in 2015 \u2014 and the news of their engagement accidentally slipped to the press by rapper T-Pain, who told Vulture the musician may not contribute to his new album because \u201cshe\u2019s engaged now.\u201d\n\nSources later confirmed to PEOPLE that the engagement was real \u2014 but in August 2015, insiders revealed to PEOPLE the wedding had been postponed. By November of 2016, Pattinson feigned confusion when asked how planning was going for their pending nuptials, telling PEOPLE, \u201cPlanning what now?\u201d\n\nIn late July, Pattinson said that he and twigs were \u201ckind of\u201d engaged during an interview on Howard Stern\u2019s Sirius-XM show \u2014 adding that \u201cshe\u2019s amazing\u201d and \u201csuper talented.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nWhen asked by GQ if he was getting married in an interview for the September cover, Pattinson responded with a noncommittal \u201ceh.\u201d\n\nPrior to his relationship with twigs, Patterson dated Kristen Stewart.\n\nHe made headlines in August when he was spotted having dinner in Los Angeles with Katy Perry and a group of friends \u2014 though a source close to theactor told PEOPLE the two were \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super cuddly always,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other forever.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Frobert-pattinson-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1395&h=730&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Frobert-pattinson-5.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Frobert-pattinson-fka-twigs-6601.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1395&h=730&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Frobert-pattinson-5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/robert-pattinson-fka-twigs-split/", "title": "Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs Might Get Back Together: 'That\u2019s the Girl He Wants to Marry'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Breakups,Couples,FKA twigs,Movie Celebrities,Robert Pattinson", "news_keywords": "Breakups,Couples,FKA twigs,Movie Celebrities,Robert Pattinson", "description": "\"They did break up,\" says the source. \"It was very recent\"", "og": {"title": "Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs Might Get Back Together: 'That\u2019s the Girl He Wants to Marry'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/robert-pattinson-fka-twigs-split/", "description": "Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs have called it quits \u2014 for now.
