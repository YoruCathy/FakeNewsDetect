Hey, it isn\u2019t cake, but it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve actually appeared with one another in a pic.\n\nHowever, it also isn\u2019t proof that they\u2019re dating, despite what some reports have been touting.\n\nA rep for DiCaprio told the Los Angeles Times that the actor \u201cis single and has been for some time,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201cbeen focused shooting\u201d Oscar-winning director Alejandro G.
