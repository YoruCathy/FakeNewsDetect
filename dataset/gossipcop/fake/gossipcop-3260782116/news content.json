Check it out.\n\nJennifer Aniston, 45, has finally found happiness with fiance Justin Theroux, 43, but her road to true love was definitely bumpy! After enduring a very public and painful split from ex-husband Brad Pitt, 50, who allegedly cheated on her with his Mr & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, 39, Jen has found a way to forgive the \u201cunforgivable\u201d and achieve inner peace. Here\u2019s how she did it!\n\nJennifer Aniston Forgives Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie For Cheating\n\nJennifer opens up like never before to Harper\u2019s Bazaar about her marriage to Brad, her future with Justin, and learning to forgive.\n\nI\u2019m \u201ca forgiving person,\u201d she says. \u201cI absolutely am. I think it\u2019s extremely important to forgive. Otherwise it just builds up like toxic waste. There\u2019s nothing worse than holding a grudge. Listen, people can do unforgivable things, but you have to let it go and say, \u2018Look, we\u2019re all human beings. We make mistakes.\u2019 To hold any kind of resentment is like taking rat poison and waiting for the rat to die.\u201d\n\nWow, Jen is a true inspiration! She has clearly grown and learned so much since the demise of her marriage to Brad and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of her. No wonder she was finally ready for the man of her dreams to come along!\n\nJennifer Aniston: Brad Pitt\u2019s Betrayal Prepared Her For Justin Theroux\u2019s Love\n\nOf course, Jen ended up getting her fairytale ending too \u2014 with fiance Justin Thereox! And she says everything she went through with Brad actually helped prepare her for her new life with Justin.\n\n\u201c[Taking time] really helped me get to a place where I was more comfortable with myself, truly ready for love and for a partner,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe past wasn\u2019t \u2018less than.\u2019 It was extremely important to my growth as a woman. But if you take the law of attraction, if you only love yourself 70 percent, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to come back to you. So you fill up that 30 percent, then all of a sudden there\u2019s this pure, good love standing right in front of you. Then you realize, \u2018Oh, this can be easy! It doesn\u2019t have to be so hard.'\u201d\n\nNow Jen couldn\u2019t be happier with Justin. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most humble, decent human beings. He\u2019s not an a**,\u201d she says.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do YOU admire Jen for forgiving Brad and Angelina? Do you agree with Jen that it\u2019s important to forgive?
