In an interview with The New York Times, Glaze said the kiss made him \"uncomfortable immediately\" and that he wished it could have been saved for his first relationship. He later clarified his comments to ET, calling the kiss \"harmless.\"\n\n'American Idol' Contestant Calls Unwanted Kiss from Judge Katy Perry 'Uncomfortable' This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
