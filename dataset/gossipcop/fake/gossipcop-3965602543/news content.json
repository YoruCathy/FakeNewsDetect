It\u2019s about trying to find a balance where I\u2019m a mixed woman, and sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t fully fit into the black community; they don\u2019t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman. That disconnect is confusing sometimes. I am what I am.\u201d\n\nBut many on Twitter are objecting to her remarks, to the point where \u201cTinashe\u201d has become a trending topic on Twitter. Most of the comments are negative, with tweets accusing the songstress of simply not being talented enough. @Prettyy_THICK, for instance, bluntly posted, \u201cDear Tinashe, It\u2019s not a colorism issue. That fact is, we just don\u2019t see it for u sis. Sincerely, Everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cTinashe not getting sympathy. being light skinned is an advantage in entertainment. Don\u2019t blame the black community, blame your management,\u201d said @PrinceHAK33M. @cook2020 wrote, \u201cMaybe the reason Tinashe isn\u2019t popping like that is because she hasn\u2019t shown the ability to cross over & produce a world wide chart topper. @CandyceRox commented, \u201cColorism is def a thing but the way colorism works, Tinashe SHOULD be winning. But her music really isn\u2019t that good so\u2026\u201d\n\nOthers, however, expressed understanding of the performer\u2019s point. \u201cI don\u2019t get why yall try Tinashe, why yall hate her, girlie is a performer, a singer, an artist, we need more of that in this economy,\u201d tweeted @artisticbey. @mannyjay_ asked, \u201cWhy do people feel like Tinashe has no place to speak on colorism bc she\u2019s mixed lightskin? colorism negatively affects EVERYBODY.\u201d And @OwenLauer insisted, \u201cTinashe isn\u2019t wrong. The general public / industry doesn\u2019t allow many woman of color to shine in the industry.\u201d\n\nSo far, Tinashe has not responded to the backlash. Gossip Cop will update if she does.", "images": ["http://www.iheart.com/v8.16.1/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f?ops=contain(740,0)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "//www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-13-tinashe-slammed-for-saying-black-community-wont-fully-accept-her-over-light-skin/", "title": "Tinashe Slammed For Saying Black Community Won't 'Fully Accept' Her Over Light Skin", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "Tinashe is under fire after suggesting in an interview that she\u2019s not more accepted in the black music community. | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f", "description": "Tinashe is under fire after suggesting in an interview that she\u2019s not more accepted in the black music community. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-13-tinashe-slammed-for-saying-black-community-wont-fully-accept-her-over-light-skin/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Tinashe Slammed For Saying Black Community Won't 'Fully Accept' Her Over Light Skin | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f"}, "description": "Tinashe is under fire after suggesting in an interview that she\u2019s not more accepted in the black music community. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-13-tinashe-slammed-for-saying-black-community-wont-fully-accept-her-over-light-skin/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Tinashe Slammed For Saying Black Community Won't 'Fully Accept' Her Over Light Skin | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Tinashe Slammed For Saying Black Community Won't 'Fully Accept' Her Over Light Skin, tinashe, slammed, for, saying, black, community, won't, 'fully, accept', her, over, light, skin", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/593fedcdfa0ac1b1ff57cc5f", "parsely-link": "http://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-13-tinashe-slammed-for-saying-black-community-wont-fully-accept-her-over-light-skin/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-13T13:51:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "trending-urban", "parsely-tags": "Tinashe (30572567)", "parsely-title": "Tinashe Slammed For Saying Black Community Won't 'Fully Accept' Her Over Light Skin", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497283200.0, "source": "http://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
