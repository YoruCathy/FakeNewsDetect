Additionally, Jolie is allegedly barred from being present or interfering with Pitt's time with the kids in person.\n\nRELATED: The Sad Reason Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Has Yet to Be Finalized\n\nThis somewhat messy turn of events is the next chapter in the saga that is Angelina and Brad's custody battle. As previously reported, the divorce legal proceedings are still ongoing, in part because of prolonged disagreements about custody. Just last month, there was another snag.\n\n\u201cThe latest issue is that Angelina wants to film [Maleficent 2] in Europe for months and take all six kids with her for the duration of the shoot,\" a source shared in May. \"Brad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in L.A. for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule.\"\n\nHopefully, the couple can reach an agreement soon.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F06%2Fgettyimages-609272014.jpg%3Fitok%3DtNa6iyKr", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F06%2Fgettyimages-609272014.jpg%3Fitok%3DYbPJih9L"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F06%2Fgettyimages-609272014.jpg%3Fitok%3DtNa6iyKr", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Whittaker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-custody-court-judge", "title": "Why Angelina Jolie Could Lose Custody of Her Kids to Brad Pitt (Report)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,latest,Celebrity,Celebrity Moms,Angelina Jolie,Brad Pitt", "news_keywords": "News,latest,Celebrity,Celebrity Moms,Angelina Jolie,Brad Pitt", "description": "Angelina Jolie is in danger of losing primary custody of her six children with ex Brad Pitt unless she makes some changes.
