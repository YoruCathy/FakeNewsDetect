{"url": "collider.com/deadpool-brianna-hildebrand-negasonic-teenage-warhead-interview/", "text": "Last year, when director Tim Miller\u2019s Deadpool movie was filming in Vancouver, I got to visit the set with a few other reporters. While I\u2019ve been able to visit a number of movie sets while they\u2019ve been filming, getting to see Deadpool get made was something special because of the passion of everyone involved. In case you aren\u2019t aware, Miller, Ryan Reynolds, and screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick had spent many years trying to get Fox to give them the greenlight and shortly after some test footage leaked and the fan reaction was beyond enthusiastic, Fox finally gave them the go ahead to make their movie \u2013 with the added bonus of allowing it to be rated R. While on set, I got the feeling they were making something special, but now that I\u2019ve seen the finished film, I can happily report the movie is even better than I hoped. Not only is Deadpool a hard R superhero film, it pushes the boundaries of what a comic book movie can show and do and allows the genre to expand into new areas. The fact is, the only way for the \u201csuperhero movie\u201d to survive is by making sure each film does something new. Deadpool absolutely does that.\n\nWhile on set I got to participate in a group interview with Brianna Hildebrand, the young actress who plays mutant Negasonic Teenage Warhead in the film. She talked about her character and her relationship to Deadpool, being part of her first big movie, how Ryan Reynolds was her childhood crush, her character\u2019s piercings, working alongside someone doing motion-capture on set, and a lot more. Check out what she had to say below.\n\nQuestion: Start by introducing yourself and your character and her relationship to Deadpool.\n\nBrianna Hildebrand: I am Brianna Hildebrand, I play Negasonic Teenage Warhead. She is a 15 year old psychic, she reads the future, and she also is her own personal cannonball, she\u2019s a warhead. So she runs at things and explodes at them, and she\u2019s Colossus\u2019 sidekick. Her relationship with Deadpool is friendly, it\u2019s like a brother-sister relationship. They don\u2019t really get along but they\u2019re on the same side, so, yeah.\n\nYour character was only in one comic book before she was killed, so I\u2019m curious, you get to create this character for the audience, so what\u2019s it like to take what little there is and build off it?\n\nHildebrand: It\u2019s awesome, yeah, for my character development it was really great because I could literally give her my own biography, I could give her whatever I wanted her to be. It\u2019s been fun, I\u2019m really excited about it.\n\nYou\u2019re relatively new to the film world, was it daunting to step on a set this massive?\n\nHildebrand: It was, I was so afraid because everyone knows what they\u2019re doing and I was like \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on? Let me know.\u201d Once I got here it was so much fun, and has been so much fun, everyone\u2019s like so chill, it\u2019s awesome. Everyone is pretty understanding. Also, since it\u2019s Tim\u2019s first time directing I was like \u201cWe\u2019re in this together man! We got this! I believe in you!\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s the coolest thing you\u2019ve done so far in the film?\n\nHildebrand: The coolest thing is probably just all the stunts. The stunts are my favorite part, the stunts that I get to do anyway. Like when Angel Dust throws me, that was so fun because they put you on this string bungee cord thing and they throw you in the air, and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhoooaaa.\u201d I think I love the stunts the most of everything.\n\nWhat kind of training have you had like fighting or anything like that?\n\nHildebrand: I trained in Muay Thai for a few months before I got out here, because I was a dancer before but I had never done any kind of fighting so I was like I should probably look like I can kick someone\u2019s ass. I\u2019ve done a lot of boxing, which I really enjoy, but that\u2019s really the training that I did, and a lot of sprinting because she runs at things.\n\nIn terms of her looks did you bring something personally, for her look physically?\n\nHildebrand: I think maybe the fact that I have a shaved head would be a look that I bring. I really love everything that she wears, and all of her outfits is actually stuff that I would actually wear, I was so excited about it all. I was like \u201cAw the studs, so cool, she\u2019s badass.\u201d\n\nDid you go all the way with the piercings?\n\nHildebrand: I actually already had all of this happening, and when I auditioned I actually had my septum ring flipped up, so they didn\u2019t know I had it, but they saw it in a picture and they were like \u2018Oh that\u2019s really cool.\u2019 I\u2019ve had my head shaved for like a year and I\u2019ve had my piercings for like a year. It\u2019s cool that they loved all of it and cool that they could be useful.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest surprise in terms of being on set and making a movie, was there something you were really shocked about?\n\nHildebrand: Probably just how friendly everyone was, I don\u2019t know, and also how slowly things go, because there are so many people, like how slowly it takes to film certain scenes and to set up for another shot takes like fifteen minutes because everyone is getting ready to set up. I dunno, it\u2019s crazy. I didn\u2019t think about how many factors played into filming and stuff. It\u2019s really cool though.\n\nCan you talk a little about working with Ryan Reynolds?\n\nHildebrand: Ryan is great, he\u2019s super cool. Ryan Reynolds was my childhood crush. His name is all over the walls of my room, I actually photoshopped myself into a picture with him my freshman year of high school. I was hardcore obsessed so it\u2019s crazy how this all worked out. When I auditioned for this film I actually didn\u2019t really have any kind of idea what I was auditioning for, or that he had anything to do with it, but for my call back I was like \u201cOh my god! What!\u201d So yeah, it\u2019s cool working with him. He\u2019s awesome.\n\nHave you admitted that to him?\n\nHildebrand: Oh yeah, my first day on set I brought the picture and everything. I was like, \u201ccheck it out!\u201d I was more excited about it than they were.\n\nWhat was it that you saw Ryan Reynolds in when you were young?\n\nHildebrand: I saw him in The Proposal, I saw him in a lot of stuff, I saw him in the Green Lantern. I remember watching that in my room. Everything though because I was obsessed with him, everything he was in just because he was in it.\n\nHas Blake pulled you aside and said\u2026\n\nHildebrand: I don\u2019t know that she knows, if not, sorry Blake. She\u2019s really sweet though so it would probably be okay. She\u2019d be like, \u201cI understand, my husband is a hot piece of meat\u201d and I\u2019d say \u201cYeah, go you girl, 10/10.\u201d\n\nAre you in any of these (concept art)?\n\nPublicist: Here she is, exploding into action.\n\nHildebrand: It looks like, maybe, the thing is for the exploding and stuff we film up to the explosion obviously and then it\u2019s the effects. She explodes like three times, I think we\u2019ve filmed one of them so far, maybe two. It\u2019s just strange because of how it\u2019s filmed, we go up to the explosion and then we start filming after the explosion so it\u2019s kind of hard to tell like where the explosion is or where the explosion is type thing. We\u2019ve at least filmed one so far.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously a lot of back story, a lot of comics, did you read a lot of the comics? Did you discover something about Deadpool in general that you were happy to see incorporated into the movie?\n\nHildebrand: I was really focused into my character because I couldn\u2019t find anything about her and it was actually stressing me out a little bit, but I borrowed a few comics, Deadpool comics from Ed (Skrein) actually, my co-star, he plays Ajax. He\u2019s a comic book nerd, straight up, he has all of them. So I borrowed some from him and I was reading through a few of them, I haven\u2019t really got that much into them. I\u2019ll let you know. I\u2019m on volume two of the complete Deadpool series, go me.\n\nYou\u2019re spending a lot of time working next to a gigantic man wearing a motion capture suit who is playing Colossus, can you talk about that? Are you visualizing the final character when you\u2019re working with him?\n\nHildebrand: Kind of, it\u2019s hard because I don\u2019t actually know what he\u2019s going to look like in the end. It can be a little difficult talking to him with the thing on his head. I started making fun of him, calling him a tellytubby. For the most part I just imagine a giant titanium guy, I\u2019m really excited to what he looks like actually at the end and be like, \u2018Oh thats who I\u2019m talking to.\u2019\n\nHow tall is he?\n\nHildebrand: Without his things, he\u2019s like 6\u20198\u201d.\n\nPublicist: 6\u20198\u201d and then 8\u201d platforms on set for the motion capture.\n\nHildebrand: I told him I was going to try them (his shoes) on. I told him I\u2019m going to try them on by the end.\n\nHave you listened to the song that is the namesake for your character?\n\nHildebrand: Yeah, by Monster Magnet? It\u2019s on my playlist, I gave her a nice rock playlist that I listen to in the morning so I get in the zone. I love it, I jam.\n\nDeadpool is in theaters this weekend.", "images": ["https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-movie-image-wade-wilson-600x400.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/devs-alex-garland-thumbnail-171x160.jpeg", "https://collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/Collider_Logo_Dark.png", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-movie-image-ed-skrein-ajax-600x399.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deadpool-400x600.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/armageddon-ben-affleck-liv-tyler-thumbnail-171x160.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/justice-league-dark-thumbnail-171x160.jpeg", "https://collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/close-circle-512.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1628636477376373&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/peacock-thumbnail-171x160.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-movie-image-brianna-hildebrand-negasonic-teenage-warhead-399x600.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand-600x400.jpg", "https://collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/Collider_Logo_Light.png", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/deadpool-brianna-hildebrand.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand-slice-600x200.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mad-max-fury-road-charlize-theron-thumbnail-171x160.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub"], "canonical_link": "https://collider.com/deadpool-brianna-hildebrand-negasonic-teenage-warhead-interview/", "title": "\u2018Deadpool\u2019: Brianna Hildebrand on Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Ryan Reynolds, and More", "meta_data": {"msapplication-square70x70logo": "/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/largetile.png", "description": "Steve talks with Brianna Hildebrand about her debut role as Negasonic Teenage Warhead in Deadpool, working with Ryan Reynolds, character design, and more.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Deadpool': Brianna Hildebrand on Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Ryan Reynolds, and More", "description": "Steve talks with Brianna Hildebrand about her debut role as Negasonic Teenage Warhead in Deadpool, working with Ryan Reynolds, character design, and more.", "url": "https://collider.com/deadpool-brianna-hildebrand-negasonic-teenage-warhead-interview/", "site_name": "Collider", "updated_time": "2019-09-24T23:36:39+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/colliderdotcom", "tag": "Tim Miller", "section": "Interviews", "published_time": "2016-02-08T17:10:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-09-24T23:36:39+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 190932086012, "pages": 160246414365}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Steve talks with Brianna Hildebrand about her debut role as Negasonic Teenage Warhead in Deadpool, working with Ryan Reynolds, character design, and more.", "title": "Deadpool: Brianna Hildebrand on Her Marvel Debut, and More", "site": "@collidernews", "image": "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/deadpool-ryan-reynolds-brianna-hildebrand.jpg", "creator": "@colliderfrosty"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://collider.com/deadpool-brianna-hildebrand-negasonic-teenage-warhead-interview/?ia_markup=1"}, "msvalidate.01": "F97A06145E9767C313B356E7E5B833F3", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "rtgRWlKYqmg2IwU4e9PBjtt31jXoTjotyW6iJbyqdyc", "verify-v1": "ag44RccQF3Xr4VqGQnxB+TOx8+rCP4SHaCwwGAtuWzc="}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1454951436.0, "source": "http://collider.com", "summary": ""}
