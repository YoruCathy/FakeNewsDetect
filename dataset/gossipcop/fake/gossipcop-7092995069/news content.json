Leonardo & Drake Avoid Each Other At Pre-Oscars Bash DiCaprio stayed in a private booth with pals, away from the rapper.\n\nRihanna\u2019s been linked to various hot Hollywood hunks, but recently, her two most notorious conquests were caught in an awkward run-in during a pre-Oscars party!\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Drake acted like total strangers when they bumped into each other at an LA nightclub before the 2018 Oscars.\n\nA source told RadarOnline.com that Leonardo, 43, went straight to his VIP dining room with pal Tobey McGuire, while Drake, 31, hung out on the other side of the club!\n\n\u201cLeo is always in the main room with his crew and sits in the same booth, but he stayed away the whole night and ignored Drake who took his spot,\u201d said the insider. \u201cHis friends kept coming through but none of them spoke to the rapper and everyone thought it was odd considering they are all meant to be friends,\u201d\n\nAs RadarOnline.com readers know, Leonardo was first liked to Rihanna, 30, in 2016, when the two were caught canoodling at Coachella.\n\nHer fling with Drake happened later on, and was very short-lived. The two reportedly parted on bitter terms after Drake was pictured showing some sexy PDA with Jennifer Lopez!\n\nRihanna is now dating billionaire Hassan Jameel and has evidently moved on, but can her exes say the same?\n\nWhile Leonardo DiCaprio and Drake were once close friends \u2013 and were even seen partying together in October \u2013 an eyewitness told Radar that they completely ignored each other during the pre-Oscars bash.\n\nDuring the night, \u201cDrake had attractive blondes flocking to him all night and seemed to be enjoying the single life as he danced and smoked hookah with his crew,\u201d according to the insider.\n\nWhile he seemed to be enjoying himself without Leo, things took an awkward turn when the DJ decided to play two of Rihanna\u2019s hits!\n\n\u201cEveryone was looking around to see his reaction but he stayed in the bathroom and was missing again when Wild Thoughts played later on in the night,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe used to play Rihanna\u2019s music during surprise club appearances and even give a shout out to her, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s trying to forget and move on now she has a new man.\u201d\n\nWhy were things so awkward between Leonardo DiCaprio and Drake?
