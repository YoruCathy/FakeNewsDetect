Washington Post? At least the National Enquirer knows very few people take it seriously \u2026 the others pretend they\u2019re real journalists.\n\nAnd look, Chelsea is trying to bond with Megyn over it:\n\n.@megynkelly welcome to the \"club\"! Soon you too will have alien children (or siblings), excerpts from diaries never kept published & more! https://t.co/WZyDPQmicF \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) June 9, 2017\n\nUmm.\n\nJust no.\n\nAnd don't forget they'll have her engaged in a \"shocking\" lesbian affair. \u2014 Tracy E. Gilchrist (@TracyEGilchrist) June 10, 2017\n\nNah, she\u2019s not a Clinton.\n\nI love you dearly Ms. Chelsea, but Kelly supported and voted for trump. \u2014 Susan Ward (@SusanWard2016) June 9, 2017\n\nAren\u2019t her supporters just adorable? Hey Chelsea, you\u2019re my bae but you shouldn\u2019t be nice to Megyn Kelly because Trump and stuff.\n\nLet's not welcome her anywhere. She assured the world that Santa was white. \u2014 RogueCheeseburger (@RogueCheeseburg) June 9, 2017\n\nMan, can these people hold a stupid grudge or what?!\n\nTBH I don't really feel bad for Megyn. She's 'no angel'. #sorrynotsorry \u2014 Miss Gee (@nevertrumptoo) June 9, 2017\n\nGuess the love fest Chelsea was looking for in bonding over the National Enquirer ain\u2019t gonna happen because her own followers are just too mean.\n\nWonder if she saw that one coming.\n\nWe did.\n\nRelated:\n\nAre you HIGH?!
