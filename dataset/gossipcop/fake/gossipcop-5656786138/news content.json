She now goes by Caitlyn and uses female pronouns.)\n\n\u201cI think Bruce is an incredible human being and I think that Bruce is a great father, he just wasn\u2019t a great father to me,\u201d he said.\n\nBrody said Caitlyn and his mother Linda Thompson had a \u201cmessy divorce\u201d when he was young, which created tension in the family.\n\n\u201cI grew up with my stepdad,\u201d said Brody, referring to David Foster. \u201cBruce was never around. I can\u2019t tell you how many birthdays went by where Bruce wasn\u2019t there. I resent him for that.\u201d\n\nBrody\u2019s strained relationship with Caitlyn also caused a rift in his bond with sisters Kendall and Kylie. A source tells PEOPLE that Brody was \u201cnever close\u201d with his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian after Caitlyn married Kris Jenner.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t spend a lot of time with his dad when his dad married Kris, so he didn\u2019t see them as much,\u201d the sources says.\n\nAnd while Brody spent time with Kendall and Kylie when they were younger, they\u2019ve grown apart.\n\n\u201cAs much as they love them, they\u2019re not close,\u201d the source adds. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding Caitlyn\u2019s Transition\n\nBefore transitioning, Caitlyn battled depression and identity issues, which caused her to pull away from her family.\n\n\u201cThe big, formative years for them, I was really struggling with those issues [of gender identity],\u201d she said during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.\n\nStill, she takes full responsibility for not being there for her kids.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems that you have,\u201d Jenner told ABC in 2017. \u201cNo excuse for that.\u201d\n\nAnd the former Hills star has remained supportive of Caitlyn\u2018s transition.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I thought was just like, \u2018It finally makes sense,'\u201d Brody told ABC in 2017.\n\nIn fact, Brody said he actually prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.\n\nImage zoom John M. Heller/Getty Images;\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Bruce for a long time and I didn\u2019t really get along with Bruce,\u201d he said. \u201cCaitlyn and I get along a little more, because Caitlyn is actually who she really is and she\u2019s living her life finally now as the person she actually was.\u201d\n\nBrody said he was able to start fresh with Caitlyn and let go of his resentment toward his father.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like getting to know somebody \u2013 your dad \u2013 all over again, in a better way.\u201d\n\nBrody\u2019s siblings have expressed similar sentiments about their father\u2019s transition.\n\n\u201cIn seeing him come out to me and explain his true self, I was more proud right then to carry the last name Jenner, to be a part of the family, than at any time before,\u201d said Brandon.\n\nRebuilding a Relationship\n\nBoth Brody and Caitlyn have been making more of an effort to spend time together in recent years.\n\nIn 2016, Caitlyn spent Thanksgiving with Brody and his siblings.\n\n\u201cThanksgiving with family is the best. And mine keeps getting bigger,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!\u201d\n\nIn April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cCaitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They\u2019re so happy for Brody,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cBrody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.\n\n\u201cWent to my first bridal shower,\u201d Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. \u201cI had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy you were there!!!\u201d Carter commented on the post. \u201cIt meant a lot to me!!\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1677&h=878&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrody-jenner.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrody-jenner.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1677&h=878&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fbrody-jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/inside-brody-jenner-caitlyn-jenner-complicated-relationship/", "title": "How Brody Jenner and Dad Caitlyn Jenner Repaired Their Relationship After Her Transition", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brody Jenner,Caitlyn Jenner,Kardashians,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Brody Jenner,Caitlyn Jenner,Kardashians,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,News,TV", "description": "Here is a look back at Brody Jenner's complicated relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner", "og": {"title": "How Brody Jenner and Dad Caitlyn Jenner Repaired Their Relationship After Her Transition", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/inside-brody-jenner-caitlyn-jenner-complicated-relationship/", "description": "Brody Jenner\u2018s relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner hasn\u2019t always been an easy one to navigate.
