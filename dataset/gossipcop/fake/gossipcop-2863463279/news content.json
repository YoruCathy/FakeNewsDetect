If the switch happens, she\u2019d be much closer to her family.\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson might be going through a major life change soon! No, we\u2019re not talking about their rumored pregnancy \u2014 this is about the 26-year-old basketball player possibly being traded to a team in Los Angeles. Rumor has it that Tristan, who currently plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, might be swapped with Los Angeles Clippers player DeAndre Jordan. If this were to happen, Khloe would be spending more time in her hometown, which we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY learned is what she\u2019s hoping for.\n\n\u201cKhloe is freaking out and totally excited about the possibility of Tristan being traded to an NBA team in Los Angeles,\u201d a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt would be the best scenario for her to be able to be back in LA close to her family on a more full time basis. While Khloe loves spending time in Cleveland, there is no place like home.\u201d See pictures of Tristan and Khloe here!\n\nThe source added that being close to family is more important now than ever due to the 33-year-old\u2019s rumored pregnancy . \u201cWith a baby on the way, Khloe feels that having the love and support of her family now is more important than ever,\u201d the source said. \u201cIn her own subtle way, Khloe has been gently encouraging Tristan to do everything in his power to get traded to a team in Los Angeles. A blockbuster NBA trade that would put her and her baby back in LA would make Khloe happy and relieved. Khloe wants her baby to be a California kid and grow up with her cousins and family close to her. Khloe feels family is the most important thing in the world, so she is hoping they get to move back to LA soon.\u201d Switching to an LA team does seem pretty ideal for the couple \u2014 and if the reality TV star is looking to be closer to family, it definitely doesn\u2019t hurt that her boyfriend would be playing for the same team as her sister Kendall Jenner \u2018s man Blake Griffin\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you want Tristan to be traded to the Clippers?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F11%2F28%2Fkhloe-kardashian-excited-tristan-thompson-trade-la%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2889815&comment_count=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/khloe-kardashian-happy-about-tristans-team-trade-ftr1.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/khloe-kardashian-happy-about-tristans-team-trade-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/28/khloe-kardashian-excited-tristan-thompson-trade-la/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Is Thrilled Over Tristan Thompson\u2019s Possible Trade To Los Angeles Clippers", "meta_data": {"description": "Khloe Kardashian is 'excited' about Tristan Thompson possibly being traded to the Los Angeles Clippers.
