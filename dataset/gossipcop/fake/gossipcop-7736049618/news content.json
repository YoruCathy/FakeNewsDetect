He discusses Marilyn, Bush and a private life in the public eye\n\nAbout an hour into Gavin Rossdale\u2019s new job as a judge on The Voice UK, the ITV producers had a word in his ear.\n\n\u201cThey asked me to up the energy, because I was a bit laidback,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut then I\u2019ve been told that for years on TV. I\u2019d meet these presenters that were really loud and I\u2019d think: \u2018Why are you being so annoying?\u2019 And then I\u2019d watch it on TV and I\u2019d look half-dead and they look normal.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s understandable if Rossdale seems slightly low-energy today. He has been working since 5am, and for a large part of that time he has been forced to interact with the British press. For years, the UK music mags tore into his band Bush \u2013 mocking his private school upbringing and his embracing of angsty American grunge just as Britpop was sweeping that sound away over here. More recently, Rossdale has been tabloid gossip fodder \u2013 the ex-husband of Gwen Stefani who allegedly wronged her by sleeping with the nanny. And yet here he is, having to play nice for the same publications.\n\n\u201cI felt like a rag doll\u201d is how he describes the experience. \u201cI was not really saying anything and just waiting for them to cut me up like a sushi chef one more time.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t escaped my mind that Rossdale is sitting here talking to \u2026 a member of the British press. He\u2019s polite and engaged, but he doesn\u2019t trust me very much. Most journalists, he says, are nice to his face \u2013 \u201cbecause I\u2019m bigger than they think I am\u201d \u2013 but end up stitching him up when they get behind their keyboard. I glance at the gleaming triangular ring on his finger, which would double neatly as a knuckle duster, and wonder how this encounter might go \u2026\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson, Sir Tom Jones and Gavin Rossdale. Photograph: Joel Anderson/ITV\n\nRossdale was not an obvious choice for the UK version of The Voice. A massive rock star in the US who has shifted about 20m albums, he has been a comparative flop back home. He admits he was shocked to get the call \u2013 \u201cI thought I was being punk\u2019d!\u201d \u2013 and a fair few \u201cWho is Gavin Rossdale?\u201d pieces made their way to publication.\n\nDoes he see the irony in being asked to coach UK pop stars when he struggled to make an impact here?\n\n\u201cFor sure,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cThe reason why Bush never got signed at first was always that I couldn\u2019t sing. But I believe great singers become great singers.\u201d\n\nRossdale is a quiet presence on the show \u2013 perhaps a little nervous at first \u2013 but he scares the other judges with his smooth talk and his ability to win over contestants and convince them to join his team. In a canny twist by the show\u2019s producers, his ex-wife judges on the US version. But Rossdale says other reasons are behind his desire to appear on it. Bush have a new album out in early 2017; this could be one last, unexpected, opportunity to try to break Britain. \u201cI was clearly at peace with not having [done so],\u201d he says, \u201cbut I always felt it was unfortunate we weren\u2019t given the exposure that could have led to a few more people knowing about us,\u201d he says.\n\nI wonder what it must have been like, playing enormodomes in the US and then returning home to play pub shows to nobody, but Rossdale says it wasn\u2019t like that: \u201cWe were having really killer shows [in the UK], but then getting destroyed in the reviews.\u201d I never played shows here that weren\u2019t packed, that weren\u2019t full of people having an amazing time \u2026 well, apart from whoever was writing the review.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Swallowed, Bush\u2019s biggest hit in the UK.\n\nWhat was the worst thing anyone ever wrote about him?\n\n\u201cOh, God, it just went on and on,\u201d he says. \u201cI stopped reading it, which was a much better decision by me. I still don\u2019t. I had to tell my new manager to stop sending me press cuttings recently, but he\u2019s still doing it.\u201d\n\nEven in the US, the press could be snarky. When Rossdale made the cover of Rolling Stone in 1996, the topless shot of him ran alongside the cover line: \u201cWhy won\u2019t anyone take Gavin Rossdale seriously?\u201d Is it true he had the cover framed, but pointedly crossed out the cover line? \u201cIt\u2019s the only cover I\u2019ve ever seen them insult anyone,\u201d he sighs. \u201cBut I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not true. I wouldn\u2019t bother framing a Rolling Stone magazine, although people do still ask me to sign it occasionally. And I always sign over the word \u2018seriously\u2019 and replace it with \u2018to lunch\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, I meet Rossdale after another early start \u2013 he has just finished a This Morning interview, in which he seemed overjoyed to have met Philip Schofield (\u201cHe\u2019s been on screen all my life!\u201d). There\u2019s no low energy today. We zip through Rossdale\u2019s early life as a \u201cpainfully shy\u201d outsider living out various dual roles simultaneously: he schooled at the ultra-posh Westminster College, yet hung around with football casuals from the estates near his Swiss Cottage home. He spent a couple of teenage weekends in an East End pub, serving jellied eels to gangsters and learning to double-salt the crisps so that punters drank more. Yet by 16 he had run away to start a new life \u2013 music was his main solace and he ended up frequenting hedonistic clubs such as Taboo and the Wag Club.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nIt was around this time that he met the popstar Marilyn, who has said they had a love affair he never got over, although Rossdale describes the suggestions it lasted for five years as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. He continues: \u201cI knew him for five minutes. You hang out with people and, when you\u2019re young, you find out what you want \u2026 and that just wasn\u2019t my world. I\u2019m the biggest libertarian on earth, I have no qualms with anyone doing anything ... I couldn\u2019t care less if you want to sleep with a telephone.\u201d\n\nBeing asked about Marilyn is the closest Rossdale gets to angry during the interview \u2013 he says he\u2019s fed up having to talk about something he considers inconsequential that happened decades ago. I notice he\u2019s still wearing the spiked ring from yesterday.\n\n\u201cI wear it as my armour against you!\u201d He swivels it around so that the spike is within his hand. \u201cThis is the friendly side,\u201d he says \u2013 symbolically, I think, but then he swivels it back into spike mode.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not actually a violent person,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I am fully aware that I have an incredible life and I should be grateful and shut the fuck up. I have no complaints, really. I mean, of course I have complaints, I have loads of complaints \u2013 I got divorced! It was the worst time of my life ever!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gavin Rossdale, Nigel Pulsford, David Guy Parsons and Robin Goodridge of Bush. Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns\n\nWas he aware of how negative the press was about him?\n\n\u201cWell, if you divorce America\u2019s sweetheart, you\u2019re in trouble. Or rather, if she divorces me. So \u2026 I don\u2019t read that stuff, but I know I\u2019ve been portrayed as a bad guy.\u201d Rossdale says his priority is his kids, so he would never say anything bad about her publicly. \u201cShe\u2019s the mother of my children and one of the most incredible girls in the world.\u201d\n\nAre they still talking?\n\n\u201cShe has a boyfriend and she\u2019s busy \u2026 but I wish her all the happiness in the world, and that\u2019s the true sign of love. As I\u2019m sure your favourite artist Sting said: \u2018If you love someone, set them free.\u2019\u201d Last year, Stefani released This Is What The Truth Feels Like, which dealt with their split in forensic detail: \u201cI don\u2019t know why I cry/ But I think it\u2019s \u2019cause I remembered for the first time/ Since I hated you/ That I used to love you\u201d, she sang on Used To Love You. Has Rossdale heard it?\n\n\u201cErm,\u201d he says, pausing for a while. \u201cYou know, I did hear it the other day in an airport.\u201d He trails off for a moment. \u201cNow I\u2019m talking about Gwen more than I intended to. Fucking journalists! But, yeah, I walked through the airport and they had one of those little kiosks playing it and I heard the song about how she used to love me. So I stood in the store and listened to it from beginning to end going: \u2018Okaaaay.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rossdale with Gwen Stefani. Photograph: Charbonneau/BEI/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nWhat did he think?\n\n\u201cAs a songwriter, I thought it was an interesting lyrical twist.\u201d I assume he\u2019s being evasive, but then I notice his eyes are filling up a bit: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cDivorce is a lot.\u201d\n\nWas it horrible to hear Stefani singing about it?\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure what the parameters are,\u201d he says, composing himself again. \u201cIt could only really be horrible, tragic or terrible, right? That\u2019s the range. It never really moves into joy or satisfaction, does it?\u201d\n\nIt might move into anger \u2026\n\n\u201cOh, no. Because I live in a glass house in a glass room in a glass bed with a glass bathroom. So I don\u2019t say anything about anyone. If she had to do that, if she needed to do it, that\u2019s her perspective and everyone has that. It\u2019s just that \u2026 look, it\u2019s bad enough getting divorced, but getting divorced publicly from her was fucking next level. But what do I know? Here we are discussing this against the Oxo Tower, and London is beautiful, the sun is shining and it\u2019s the worst thing if you think about suicide, because people pass, they die and they go, and yet life goes on \u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019m taken aback. Suicide?\n\n\u201cLife is like waterskiing,\u201d he continues \u2013 and I\u2019m not sure either of us know where he\u2019s going at this point \u2013 \u201cin the sense that you\u2019ve got to make sure you don\u2019t let go of the rope. And I didn\u2019t let go of the rope. But if one year ago you said I\u2019d be doing this, and I\u2019d have a record that I have and the support that I have \u2026 it\u2019s been a dark time.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nDid he consider suicide?\n\n\u201cNo, because I have children \u2026 but there were times when I 100% understood why people do it.\u201d\n\nDespite not trusting journalists, Rossdale turns out to be good company \u2013 funny and full of statements suitably ludicrous for a pop star (\u201cWas I tired yesterday? No, because I\u2019m a fucking warrior and I will outlast anyone at anything\u201d) yet vulnerable and far more self-aware than I\u2019d anticipated (\u201cIt\u2019s all you want to know, really, let\u2019s face it,\u201d he says after the barrage of questions about Stefani. \u201cI mean, what\u2019s the new record like? Yawn!\u201d).\n\nI wonder if this more relaxed, honest version of Rossdale is one that not many people get to see. As we leave, he tells me that Stefani often didn\u2019t want him opening up to the press, so he learned to stay guarded. But now he has a degree of freedom to do what he wants \u2013 he mentions on a couple of occasions about wanting to \u201cbecome 3D\u201d, so that people can go beyond the headlines and see who he really is: \u201cAnd then be like \u2026 yeah, now I really don\u2019t like him,\u201d he laughs.\n\nAnd how would he feel if people still didn\u2019t like him? Or if the Bush album doesn\u2019t take off? If all this amounts to nothing in the end?\n\n\u201cI just got divorced and I\u2019m still alive,\u201d he says. \u201cSo nothing can crush me. Nothing!\u201d\n\nThe Voice UK is on Saturdays, 8pm, ITV", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2a3d3e0830291beadf14323a07eddd6c6dab09e/122_0_1127_676/master/1127.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=79405b35f321e1093188f985daa13cbd", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a0084d583b0e264af2865946df0d8a47b9d8bd/823_0_4742_2845/master/4742.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c7277f5c23562e28c940651c249bdc93", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4166c2c3e4f3dc11ef96a9f6c762451a8e5e7a7/0_227_1429_857/master/1429.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=4b6fd228a9c5d7ad87a3e7624a67be2f", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3966a53dd654db3da1bf7b894ca7a344c778e17f/0_50_3703_2223/master/3703.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=58398945e853251e157bc537ddbc3f55", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Tim-Jonze,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=227ac2bee52a5fa87926df8146593c7d", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18a231e45985ce7bcba1fbca3e2ebabd780eb50/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75aa52927cc7afe8e0dc3bf8c1a9c0ce", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c5fc29b7a7733ecaf96c0719f5874e45da40dfc/2445_1130_5840_3504/master/5840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=665ccb81270939bb7bffb7e2b83abe63", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1e9d5cfafa1e23f3b52419588ad1e62f7f6e0a9/238_194_2323_1393/master/2323.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3a858cc35f5b68ae4679b4ed5f23013", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53f187f12da162d30e5d9f03347f4de07d600f91/0_429_2506_1503/master/2506.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c9e390d18c41a844530b807a8708342c", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Television%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture%2CThe+Voice%2CGwen+Stefani%2CIndie", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0493a924e2cff8c1c556650bcc76bbf50a018ca/0_1219_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=757cd6d897bfd5d24aaba2c6250320c0", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a78344c24d0843c22387c610fed972dcd3e5b4c/0_1400_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=561d9be0bcf29e3e5bd02bfa23de3322", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18a231e45985ce7bcba1fbca3e2ebabd780eb50/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9c3a860ca84b8fe2778b8173aedb8ade"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a18a231e45985ce7bcba1fbca3e2ebabd780eb50/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=75aa52927cc7afe8e0dc3bf8c1a9c0ce", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Jonze"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/28/gavin-rossdale-the-voice-gwen-stefani", "title": "Gavin Rossdale: \u2018If you divorce America's sweetheart, you're in trouble\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Better known as Gwen Stefani\u2019s ex than as a rock singer, he\u2019s now trying his hand as a judge on The Voice UK.
