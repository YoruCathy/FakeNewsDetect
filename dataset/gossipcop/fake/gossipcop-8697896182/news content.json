After dodging rumors about her relationship with Jamie Foxx for four long years, it was time to come out of hiding. At first, a source revealed, \u201cKatie was super worried about the public attention\u201d and was content to hole up in Foxx\u2019s massive, gated estate outside of Los Angeles. But by this spring, the source said, she was \u201ctired of playing that game.\u201d An April 2 dinner in NYC was the couple\u2019s first real tiptoe into the spotlight, the source told Us Weekly, but they were making plans for more outings. Dished the source at the time: \u201cThey\u2019re going to start going public.\u201d\n\n\n\nKatie Holmes and Jamie Foxx: A Timeline of Their Relationship\n\nCome Labor Day, the proof was in the pictures. After years of rarely being seen together, the two were photographed September 4, striding down a Malibu beach hand-in-hand and splashing in the Pacific Ocean surf. In the past, Holmes, mom to 11-year-old Suri, and Foxx employed cloak-and-dagger methods to keep their love under wraps. For date nights, they\u2019d rent out whole restaurants or sneak in through back elevators. And they spent the entirety of a December 2016 jaunt to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, confined to their suite. But by spring, the Logan Lucky actress, 38, and the Oscar winner, 49, knew it was time to come out of the relationship closet. Notes a source close to Foxx, \u201cHe expected pictures to come out even sooner than this.\u201d\n\nThough he knew they couldn\u2019t stay cloistered forever, sources say that even within his inner circle, Foxx was hesitant to open up about his romance. \u201cEveryone knows they\u2019re together, but it\u2019s still unspoken,\u201d said an insider, noting some friends had put the pieces together. \u201cHe could often be overheard talking flirtatiously to someone on the phone and excited to wrap up work and go home,\u201d said the insider. \u201cIt\u2019s been obvious that he\u2019s had someone special in his life for a long time.\u201d\n\nWhen the two first danced at a 2013 fundraiser in East Hampton, New York, (a year after Holmes\u2019 highly publicized divorce from Tom Cruise, 55, was finalized), the romance was merely a fling. By 2015, however, a source told Us Weekly the union had grown \u201cvery, very serious.\u201d (Another source added that Holmes was \u201chead over heels,\u201d noting Suri was also a fan of the actor.) Their quiet start could be the reason their bond is still strong today. \u201cThey wanted to get to know each other and see where things were headed so it could develop in private before they went public,\u201d said a source. \u201cBut it\u2019s very serious.\u201d\n\nKatie Holmes' Life Without Tom Cruise\n\nAfter ending her summer with a romantic debut, Holmes is living her best life. On September 7 she celebrated New York Fashion Week by supporting pal Zac Posen at a screening of his House of Z documentary. Later that night, she trekked to Queens to catch a U.S. Open match in the Emirates Ace Suite with her college-aged nephew and a pal. Says a source, \u201cShe was super low-key.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-2-5b2a827b-c818-45fb-860c-8ceceea623a9.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/uw3917_cover_ns-1bd310c6-5824-4f43-ac13-4d822aa5da32.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-c04a93a7-6ad3-4052-a4e4-d55cdf18e0a9.jpg?crop=166px%2C0px%2C1469px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-3113dab4-a491-481a-b284-de9f89f41192.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katie-holmes-us-open-79d28a37-6a5c-4442-ab73-69c253a6293e.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-c04a93a7-6ad3-4052-a4e4-d55cdf18e0a9.jpg?crop=166px%2C0px%2C1469px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-why-they-went-public-now-w502589/", "title": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx: Why They Went Public Now", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are finally ready to take their relationship public \u2014 see pictures and find out why", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Are Finally Going Public", "description": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are finally ready to take their relationship public \u2014 see pictures and find out why", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-why-they-went-public-now-w502589/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-16T00:05:57+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-c04a93a7-6ad3-4052-a4e4-d55cdf18e0a9.jpg?crop=166px%2C0px%2C1469px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-c04a93a7-6ad3-4052-a4e4-d55cdf18e0a9.jpg?crop=166px%2C0px%2C1469px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-09-16T20:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-16T00:05:57+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are finally ready to take their relationship public \u2014 see pictures and find out why", "title": "Why Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Are Finally Going Public", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kaite-holmes-jamie-foxx-c04a93a7-6ad3-4052-a4e4-d55cdf18e0a9.jpg?crop=166px%2C0px%2C1469px%2C771px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505592000.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
