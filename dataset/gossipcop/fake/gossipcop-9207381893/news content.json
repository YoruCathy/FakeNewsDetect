The Duchess of Cambridge is known to be very sporty, but she didn\u2019t run in the marathon. She is regularly seen at big sporting events, sometimes pictured sporting her trainers and publicly promoting fitness. Before marrying William she was often snapped at sporting events, and played various sports at her boarding school. However, according to Kate\u2019s friend Bryony Gordon, Kate is not allowed to run marathons.\n\nKate Middleton: Kate can\u2019t run marathons because of this royal rule\n\nOn Loose Women, Bryony revealed that the Duchess is not allowed to run in the marathon, or any public race, because of one royal reason. Speaking on the show Bryony said that she asked Kate if she would be running the marathon, to which she replied: \u201cOh no, security and all that.\" Bryony, author of 'Eat, Drink, Run', then retorted: \"If I can do the marathon, you can.\" Around 41,000 people ran the London marathon this year, creating a huge threat to Kate\u2019s security if she were to participate. While Kate wasn\u2019t able to run the 26.2 mile marathon herself, she did take part in a 100-metre sprint with Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nThe reason Kate can't run marathons was revealed on Loose Women by her friend Bryony Gordan\n\nKate Middleton in pictures: The best casual looks from the off-duty Duchess Mon, June 11, 2018 Kate Middleton in pictures: The best casual looks from the off-duty Duchess of Cambridge.

One Middleton who is allowed to run marathons is Kate\u2019s sister, Pippa Middleton, who completed her first marathon in Kenya in 2015. Speaking to Hello! magazine Pippa said: \u201cI decided that a marathon was a \u2018life box\u2019 that needed ticking and this year was my time\u2014despite it being one of the toughest in the world, with temperatures rising to more than 30 degrees Celsius [86 degrees Fahrenheit], at an altitude of 5,550 feet and with the possibility of bumping into lions or rhinos.\u201d She\u2019s also completed the Great Wall marathon in northern China. Pippa is a keen sportswoman and patron of sports charity Disability Snowsport UK. /life-style/style/976541/pippa-middleton-pregnant-style-latest-winter-games\n\nKate did partake in a 100-metre sprint, with Prince William and Prince Harry", "images": ["http://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/982199_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-04-17.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/285x190/981732_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/376080.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/982862.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/982862.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isabella Sullivan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/982862/kate-middleton-marathons-royal-rules", "title": "Why sporty Kate Middleton is BANNED from marathons - royal rule revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "KATE MIDDLETON is one of the sportiest royals, reported to love running, tennis, skiing and hockey.
