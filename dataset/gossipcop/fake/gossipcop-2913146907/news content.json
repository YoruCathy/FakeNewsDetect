What you were influenced by and what has made you the amazing person that you are today. So, I combined that and questions when we first met like, 'Who's your idol? And what would you do if you weren't a talk show host?'\"\n\nShe continues, \"So, I combined that with the fact that literally guys, for, like, the last two years, Ellen has said to me, 'I feel like I'm not doing enough.' Every day, almost. So, I put all that together and I got you this gift. So, let's see it -- happy birthday!\"\n\nPortia then cuts to a video of her talking about Ellen's hero, Dian Fossey, and her dedication to animals. \"So, for your birthday, Ellen, I am bringing you and your hero, Dian, together by building the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund,\" she reveals. \"Ellen, you will carry on Dian's legacy by giving them a permanent home in Rwanda. Now, you will join Dian as a protector and champion of these amazing animals, the mountain gorillas. Happy birthday!\"\n\nPortia didn't stop there! \"I have also set up a foundation in your name called The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,\" she shares. \"So, this is the first initiative for the fund that you can take this and do whatever you want with it. You've done amazing work for elephants and you can just continue and support whatever you want to do.\"\n\nBlown over by the gift, Ellen says tearfully, \"It\u2019s the best gift. I\u2019ve always said -- and when we got married, Portia\u2019s line was, 'It\u2019s good to be loved; it\u2019s profound to be understood' -- and, she understands me because that is the best gift that anybody could have given me. So, I love you.\"\n\nSee photos of the couple together:\n\n\n\n44 PHOTOS Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi See Gallery Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi during VH1 Big in '04 - Backstage and Audience at Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, California, United States. ***Exclusive*** (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic, Inc) Portia de Rossi and Ellen DeGeneres during HBO Golden Globe Awards Party - Inside at Beverly Hills Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, United States.
