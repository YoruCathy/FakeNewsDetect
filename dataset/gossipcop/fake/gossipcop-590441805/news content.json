Now that Kylie Jenner is a mom \u2014 she just announced that she gave birth to her first child with her baby daddy Travis Scott \u2014 she definitely had a completely different mindset than most other 20-year-olds. Last June, fans were shocked when Kylie and Travis debuted their new matching butterfly tattoos, but now it all makes sense. She got the butterfly to symbolize her relationship with the father of her baby girl!\n\nWhat\u2019s more surprising is Kylie got a tattoo of an insect that she\u2019s afraid of!\n\nOver the summer, her show Life of Kylie, has really taught us a lot about the makeup mogul. In a clip from an episode from Season 1, Kylie and her BFF Jordyn Woods went to a zoo together. Too bad Ky learns that she\u2019s terrified of butterflies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared if one lands on me!\u201d the 20-year-old screamed as her friend laughed. Of course, the workers assured her that the butterflies are harmless, but she didn\u2019t care.\n\n\u201cButterflies are just part of the secrets of Kylie,\u201d she said in a voiceover. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just ironic because I\u2019m terrified, terrified of butterflies. All butterflies. This is how I think of them: cut the wings off and if you just look at their bodies, they\u2019re not that pretty. It\u2019s literally a bug.\u201d\n\nThe irony came from the fact that she and boyfriend Travis Scott have matching tatoos of those \u201cbugs.\u201d Kylie got a mini butterfly above her right ankle while Travis, 25, got the same exact ink on his left ankle.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the couple has shown their love using the winged insect. Over the course of their ten-month romance, they have sent each other cryptic messages on social media using the butterfly emoji, most likely inspired by Travis\u2019 song, \u201cButterfly Effect\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe caught the waves just thumbin\u2019 through my braids (alright)/ Heatin\u2019 up, baby, I\u2019m just heatin\u2019 up (it\u2019s lit),\u201d he rapped in the NSFW hit. \u201cNeed ya love, not a need it is a must/ Feelin\u2019 stuck, you know how to keep me up.\u201d And it looks like the song even inspired their baby\u2019s nursery room!\n\n(Photo Credit: YouTube)\n\nBack in June, Life & Style reported that Kylie and Travis may have made their relationship even more permanent by getting married in a super secret ceremony. \u201cKylie and Travis tied the knot at her Calabasas mansion,\u201d a source revealed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big, glamorous affair like other Kardashian weddings, and only a few close friends were invited. But Kylie is crazy about Travis.\u201d\n\nThe insider continued, \u201cThere were no official E! cameras there, but Kylie asked her friends to film the special moment on their iPhones. She plans to use the footage on her new show.\u201d\n\nAs expected, her ex-boyfriend Tyga was not thrilled. \u201cTyga will be upset,\u201d an insider said of the 27-year-old, who dated the lip kit mogul for almost three years. \u201cBut he won\u2019t necessarily be surprised. He felt Kylie was so immature. The two of them together were just nothing but fighting and drama all the time.\u201d\n\nTo see what other changes Kylie has made to her body, check out the gallery below!", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kylie-jenner-hips.jpg?fit=200%2C200", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kylie-jenner-butt.jpg?fit=200%2C200", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-butterflies-baby-nursery.png?w=1180&h=547&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kylie-jenner-hips.jpg?resize=1000%2C630"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kylie-jenner-hips.jpg?resize=1000%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kylie-jenner-butterfly-tattoo-134542/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Is Afraid of Butterflies, But Has a Tattoo of One", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Having a baby definitely changes you!
