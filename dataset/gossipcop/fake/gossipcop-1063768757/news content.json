While we don\u2019t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise\u2014not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.\n\nStone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009\u2019s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she\u2019s often thought of as a redhead, she\u2019s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she\u2019s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we\u2019ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she\u2019ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once.
