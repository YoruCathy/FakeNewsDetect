Go buy it today, everybody.\u201d\n\nAnd viewers did, apparently.\n\nAbigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that \u201cthe beginning of February\u201d shows \u201cthe best performing weeks in the history of the brand.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,\u201d Klem said.\n\nSarah Tanner, Lyst\u2019s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton\u2019s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter\u2019s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.\n\nBut the brand was \u201clargely featured\u201d in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had \u201cbeen treated so unfairly\u201d by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,\u201d Tanner said of Conway\u2019s Fox interview. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.\u201d\n\nConway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.\n\nRep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway\u2019s comments were \u201cabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong\u201d and \u201cclearly over the line,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nAD\n\nThe White House later said that Conway had been \u201ccounseled.\u201d But concerns about her comments remain.\n\nOn Thursday, the government\u2019s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post\u2019s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president\u2019s deputy counsel.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen an employee\u2019s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,\u201d Shaub wrote. \u201cNot taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLast month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway \u2014 a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar \u2014 partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump\u2019s products.\n\nAccording to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen such a large uptick,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cTypically, she\u2019s not in our top 100 sellers.\u201d\n\nComparing February\u2019s numbers with last year\u2019s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company\u2019s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.\n\nThe Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.\n\nIvanka Trump: A life in the spotlight share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image MANHATTAN, NY - JULY 16: Ivanka Trump poses for a portrait inside the Trump Tower in Manhattan, NY, on July 16, 2014. (Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post)\n\nSome retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump\u2019s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.\n\nStill, despite the boycott, Trump\u2019s line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon\u2019s best-selling list last month, The Post\u2019s Amy B Wang reported. The Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum spray was the top-selling item in the \u201cPerfumes & Fragrances\u201d category.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aQuLDJmTLJTJVc31hsin4Vose30=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O5IAQWYYEAYALKBZCJIYPPDTYI.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/c6a5c81c-3382-40e6-8231-fcfb2d41a328.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aQuLDJmTLJTJVc31hsin4Vose30=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O5IAQWYYEAYALKBZCJIYPPDTYI.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kristine Phillips", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/03/10/go-buy-ivankas-stuff-kellyanne-conway-said-then-the-first-daughters-fashion-sales-exploded/", "title": "\u2018Go buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff,\u2019 Kellyanne Conway said.
