We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how for 2018, she\u2019s going to stop obsessing about her booty.\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt that Kim Kardashian, 37, might not be the household name she is today without her infamous giant booty. But with a second daughter coming into her family in 2018, she\u2019s resolved to stop being so hyper focused on her body and not be so consumed with what the world thinks of her famous figure. \u201cKim\u2019s vowed to give up obsessing over her butt, that\u2019s one of her New Year\u2019s resolutions, she\u2019s going to totally love and accept her body exactly as it is. She\u2019s under so much pressure and scrutiny to be perfect and there have been times she\u2019s been really hard on herself,\u201d a Kardashian insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cBut no more. 2018 is going to be all about positivity for Kim and that includes her self-talk. She\u2019s working on her self-love, that\u2019s one of her big resolutions.

See pics of Kim\u2019s butt evolution, here.\n\n\u201cShe will keep working hard to stay fit and healthy but will also strive towards a more accepting attitude towards her body for the sake of her children,\u201d our source adds. She and husband Kanye West, 40, are expecting their third child \u2014 a second daughter \u2014 via surrogate in early 2018. Kim has always had huge battles with losing pregnancy weight, but that isn\u2019t an issue for her this time around.
