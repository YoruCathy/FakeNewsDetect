And though it only gives us a tiny glimpse of Roberts in character as caseworker Heidi Bergman (she literally just scribbles down some notes, says the above line to someone off camera and then clicks on a tape recorder) we\u2019re already entranced by her calm, collected mannerisms. Luckily, Amazon also revealed that you won\u2019t have to wait much longer, as \u201cHomecoming\u201d will premiere this November on the streaming service.\n\nThe rest of the one-minute clip promoting the mind-bending drama directed by \u201cMr. Robot\u201d creator Sam Esmail, explores the abandoned halls of what we can safely assume is the titular Homecoming Transitional Support Center where Heidi workers, a Geist Group facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life.\n\nAlso Read: 'My Best Friend's Wedding' Reunion: Dermot Mulroney Joins Julia Roberts on Amazon's 'Homecoming'\n\nWalter Cruz (Stephan James) is one of these soldiers, eager to begin the next phase of his life. Overseeing Heidi and the facility is Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an ambitious company man whose manic demands point to questionable motives.\n\nFour years later, Heidi has started a new life, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a small-town waitress, when a Department of Defense auditor (Shea Whigham) comes to her with questions about why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi begins to realize that there\u2019s a whole other story behind the story she\u2019s been telling herself.\n\nBased on the popular podcast of the same name, \u201cHomecoming\u201d is created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Along with Roberts, the cast includes Jeremy Allen White, Alex Karpovsky and Dermot Mulroney, among others.\n\nAlso Read: Frances McDormand Joins Amazon's 'Good Omens' Series as the Voice of God\n\nMulroney is set for a recurring guest star role as Anthony, Heidi\u2019s (Roberts) boyfriend, who is eager to please, but a bit needy and grows increasingly frustrated with Heidi\u2019s lack of attention to him and their relationship.\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d is produced by Esmail through his production company Esmail Corp; as well as \u201cMr. Robot\u201d executive producer Chad Hamilton of Anonymous Content; the podcast\u2019s Horowitz and Bloomberg; and Chris Giliberti, Alex Blumberg, and Matt Lieber of Gimlet Media. Roberts will also serve as executive producer through her production company Red Om Films; her partners Lisa Gillan and Marisa Yeres Gill will co-executive produce.\n\nWatch the trailer above.\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d will debut Friday, Nov. 2 on Prime Video.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg",
