Leslie, 30, and Harington, 30, reportedly split a year later, before getting back together in 2014.\n\nThe duo didn't make their first public appearance together as a couple until the Olivier Awards in London in 2016. Harington opened up about falling in love with Leslie during an interview with L'Uomo Vogue, saying, \"If you\u2019re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.\"\n\nIn June, Harington revealed that he had moved in with Leslie during his appearance on CBS' The Late Late Show With James Corden.\n\n\"I've moved in with my other best friend, Rose,\" said Harington. \u201cSo, I\u2019m very. very happy and it\u2019s going well. She has all sorts of ideas for the house.

Move anything you want around \u2014 change anything or chuck anything out.' \"\n\nCongrats to the couple!\n\n7:15 a.m. Wednesday, Sept. 27: Updated with newspaper announcement.", "images": ["https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kit-harington-rose-leslie-are-engaged-report-1043209", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kit-harington-rose-leslie-are-engaged-report-1043209", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/kit-harington-rose-leslie-are-engaged-report-1043209", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Game of Thrones' Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "sailthru.description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "sailthru.author": "THR Staff", "sailthru.vertical": "Style", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-26 13:38:19", "sailthru.tags": "Style,Kit Harington,Style News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506404299.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
