You're a pretty girl, I'll give you that. But stealing my recipe, it's an ugly look.\"\n\nNow, the insider says Pink and Gaga \u201care talking of working together\u201d to get back at Madonna. \u201cThey\u2019re writing lyrics that target Madonna as superficial and a fraud,\u201d the insider told OK!\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Pink has come to Gaga\u2019s defense. Back in February, Pink slammed fans for accusing Gaga of stealing her acrobatic moves for the 2017 Super Bowl Halftime Show performance.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s celebrate a woman who has the guts to jump off a roof and stand up there in the first place,\u201d Pink said at the time. \u201cWho cares if I flew first? Cause I didn\u2019t! Cirque and Peter Pan have been in the air for years!\u201d", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-long.jpg?fit=1200%2C596&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-02.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-03.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Madonna-Madame-X-PP.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-05.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-04.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-long.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-07.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-06.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-08.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem-long.jpg?fit=1200%2C596&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["November"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/pink-lady-gaga-write-anti-madonna-anthem/", "title": "Pink & Lady Gaga Are \u2018Working Together\u2019 To Write An Anti-Madonna Anthem", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Pink and Lady Gaga are teaming up to take down Madonna!
