Kate McKinnon needs our help.\n\nYou see, the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d MVP is the only full-time cast member in the show\u2019s 43-year history to win two Emmys. From Bieber impressions to alien abductions, she is its deft quarterback, its kooky crown jewel, its melodic moral compass \u2015 every bit as essential to the lineup as Kristen Wiig or Amy Poehler or Eddie Murphy or John Belushi.\n\nWhy, then, on God\u2019s sin-ridden earth, can no one write her a good movie role?\n\nSeeing as McKinnon is the best part of anything she\u2019s in, it can be easy to forget she\u2019s never had a good role. That\u2019s because she\u2019s, well, Kate McKinnon, able to elevate characters that otherwise coast on one-note hijinks. Often, they\u2019re not so much characters as they are walking punch lines: the whimsical engineer in \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d the buttoned-up HR coordinator in \u201cOffice Christmas Party,\u201d the bossy redneck in \u201cMasterminds,\u201d the Australian madcap in \u201cRough Night\u201d and now the adventurous unemployed actress in \u201cThe Spy Who Dumped Me.\u201d\n\nAll of these roles play out the same way. McKinnon is a sidekick to more established movie stars, introduced as the eccentric friend, wife or colleague with an odd collection of life experiences that act as a stand-in for character development. As Holtz in \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d she\u2019s a \u201cgluten-full\u201d skier who somehow put a physicist in a coma. As Pippa in \u201cRough Night,\u201d she\u2019s an animal whisperer who once perished and came back to life during a drug trip in the desert. As the buffoonish Jandice in \u201cMasterminds,\u201d her husband died from a snake bite; at his funeral, she fell in love with his \u201cdistant cousin.\u201d\n\nAnd as Morgan in \u201cThe Spy Who Dumped Me,\u201d her biography includes getting deported from Belize, doing cocaine with her basketball coach, being the target of Mandy Patinkin\u2019s advances, discussing penis preferences with her mom and inviting a magician to live in her grandmother\u2019s condo.\n\nLionsgate Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis in \"The Spy Who Dumped Me.\"\n\nInstead of giving her characters depth, screenwriters give them anecdotes. McKinnon delivers lines like these matter-of-factly, as if anyone who doesn\u2019t relate is a freak \u2015 a convincing way to tap into the irony of her full-bodied ebullience. She plays walking scrapbooks overflowing with uproarious one-liners and wacky reaction shots, having become a go-to for nimble physical humor that evokes Lucille Ball, Jerry Lewis and Jim Carrey. But those performers\u2019 manic verve had sell-by dates: Ball\u2019s attempts to re-create the joys of \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d never quite worked, Paramount Pictures eventually declined to renew Lewis\u2019 contract, and Carrey grew tired of being a tool for box-office capital.\n\nOr perhaps it\u2019s more apt to compare McKinnon to her \u201cSNL\u201d predecessors. Take, for example, Will Ferrell, inarguably one of the biggest movie stars the sketch series has produced. Ferrell and McKinnon share a penchant for visceral oddballs, but a few things set them apart. First, Ferrell gets to headline movies, whereas McKinnon is always second fiddle. (The entire plot of \u201cThe Spy Who Dumped Me\u201d revolves around Mila Kunis.) Secondly, Ferrell\u2019s lead roles, however silly they may be, have proper arcs with family histories and detailed psychologies (see: \u201cElf,\u201d \u201cTalladega Nights,\u201d \u201cStep Brothers\u201d). And finally, Ferrell \u2015 like Kristen Wiig, Adam Sandler and Bill Murray \u2015 has evidenced that he is more than a one-trick pony by taking astute roles in thoughtful character studies (see: \u201cStranger Than Fiction,\u201d \u201cEverything Must Go\u201d).\n\nMcKinnon, on the other hand, has so far been pigeonholed as little more than the resident nut job, tasked with making googly eyes or thinning her voice to steal scenes in unremarkable chaos comedies.\n\nSony Chris Hemsworth, Kate McKinnon, Leslie Jones, Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig in \"Ghostbusters.\"\n\nSooner or later, that schtick runs thin for even the sharpest performers. Even Eddie Murphy, once a supreme movie star, descended from \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d to \u201cDaddy Day Care.\u201d And McKinnon, like Murphy before her, is far too good for that. She deserves a part that doesn\u2019t feel like an \u201cSNL\u201d bit pushed beyond its limits, where the musicality of her voice and the dementedness of her dexterity are more than devices for cheap chuckles.\n\n\u201cThe Spy Who Dumped Me,\u201d directed and co-written by Susanna Fogel (\u201cLife Partners\u201d), is the ultimate example of this. In \u201cSpy,\u201d an action comedy with a third act that has far too much action and hardly enough comedy, Morgan is the daring BFF who can drop everything to delve into international assassin mayhem that really has nothing to do with her.\n\nMorgan doesn\u2019t have much to offer the plot beyond aiding Kunis\u2019 Audrey, so she enlists the help of onetime flame Edward Snowden to take down the crime syndicate that Audrey is wrapped up with. Like most of McKinnon\u2019s big-screen characters, Morgan has an impressive sexual prowess, but it\u2019s only evidenced with an implicit wink. She can\u2019t have normal relationships, no way; she needs to have the world\u2019s most famous dissident on speed dial.\n\nThere\u2019s a key moment in \u201cSpy\u201d that presents a unified theory of the Kate McKinnon Cinematic Universe. Speaking, rather rudely, for everyone who comes in contact with a feature-length McKinnon character, Audrey\u2019s boyfriend (Justin Theroux) tells her she is \u201ca little much.\u201d\n\nSony Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Jillian Bell, Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Ilana Glazer in \"Rough Night.\"\n\nIn that one line, the movie reveals that it knows it\u2019s resting on McKinnon\u2019s antics \u2015 and that \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cOffice Christmas Party,\u201d \u201cMasterminds\u201d and \u201cRough Night\u201d knew too. They wanted her to be too much. They insisted on it. Is she good for anything else? These projects wouldn\u2019t know.\n\nIn a rare emotional exchange toward the end of \u201cSpy,\u201d Morgan concedes that her career isn\u2019t thriving and she fears everyone thinks she\u2019s \u201ca little much.\u201d Because it\u2019s so far removed from anything we\u2019ve seen of Morgan in the previous 100 minutes, the sentiment barely lands. It reads like a note from a Screenwriting 101 guidebook \u2015 ground this character in something real, won\u2019t you? But what it really does is emphasize everything that\u2019s preventing McKinnon from achieving greatness.\n\nAlone, none of McKinnon\u2019s films is an affront. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a ludicrous escapade here and there. But when it becomes someone\u2019s entire brand, that brand eventually loses vitality. And if there\u2019s anything the comedy world needs, it\u2019s for Kate McKinnon to be more than an \u201cSNL\u201d workhorse asked to generate the same zany big-screen frolics time and again. Her talents are far more sustainable than that.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=crop_27_211_1377_1247,scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b6334441900002b00c6b71c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b6333b31900002a00c6b71b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ad8af452000007d06eb523c.jpeg?cache=2cqqu2iwvs&ops=210_120", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59a963dd1e00003c00c6060e.jpeg?cache=d498hsivi3&ops=210_120", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b3812f91a0000cd04ce3068.jpeg?cache=huege11hhb&ops=210_120", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c113ccf1d00002e023175d5.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5942c941160000210011660e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1778_1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kate-mckinnon-the-spy-who-dumped-me_n_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48", "title": "For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" like several films before it, reduces McKinnon's comedic genius to cheap laughs.", "keywords": "Movies,comedy,SNL,kate mckinnon,The Spy Who Dumped Me", "og": {"title": "For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kate-mckinnon-the-spy-who-dumped-me_n_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" like several films before it, reduces McKinnon's comedic genius to cheap laughs."}, "article": {"tag": "Movies,comedy,SNL,kate mckinnon,The Spy Who Dumped Me", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-08-03 08:00:17 -0400", "modified_time": "2018-08-03 10:51:14 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "For The Love Of God, Why Can't Anyone Write Kate McKinnon A Good Movie Role?", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b632e992000007a03378cdb.jpeg?cache=sw3yk3olfy&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"The Spy Who Dumped Me,\" like several films before it, reduces McKinnon's comedic genius to cheap laughs.", "creator": "tarantallegra"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b61e93ae4b0fd5c73d59a48", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533297617.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
