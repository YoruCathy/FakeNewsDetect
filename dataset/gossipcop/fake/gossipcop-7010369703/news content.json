In July, Rob posted on Instagram a slew of naked pics of Chyna and a video of her kissing another man, which he said she sent him. He accused her of cheating, belittled her and threatened that she would never see their daughter again unless she stopped \"the alcohol and drugs and cocaine and X and E.\"\n\nChyna responded on Snapchat by claiming Rob had \"beat\" her and obtained a temporary domestic violence restraining order against him. It does not involve Dream.\n\n\"Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,\" her attorneytold E!
