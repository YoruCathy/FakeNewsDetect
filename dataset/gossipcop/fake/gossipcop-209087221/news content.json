He likes her, but he feels like she\u2019s moving too quickly.\u201d\n\nAs the insider explains, this is because of her insecurities; she\u2019s seemingly nervous to let him embark on his tour alone because she\u2019s nervous about potential groupies \u201cthrowing themselves\u201d at the 26-year-old.\n\nMUST SEE: Selena Meets the Weeknd\u2019s Manager\u2019s Baby!\n\n\u201cSelena\u2019s paranoid that fans will be throwing themselves at The Weeknd and he\u2019ll be tempted to stray,\u201d the insider notes. \u201cShe\u2019s so scared that she\u2019s threatened to dump him if he doesn\u2019t let her come along on tour.\u201d\n\nBut, the insider notes, ending their relationship may be the best thing for both Selena and her new beau.\n\n\u201cSelena\u2019s acting so crazy that he\u2019s starting to have second thoughts about their relationship,\u201d the insider tells In Touch. \u201cFriends are concerned that it\u2019s only a matter of time before it all ends in tears due to Selena\u2019s self-sabotaging ways.\u201d\n\nSelena and The Weeknd were first linked after they were spotted getting affectionate on a date in January \u2014 just months after the singer (whose real name is Abel Tesfaye) broke up with Bella Hadid, his long-term girlfriend.\n\nMORE: Selena Gomez Poses Topless After Kissing The Weeknd \u2014 Bella Hadid Not Impressed!\n\nIn Touch previously reported that the two began speaking to each other behind Bella\u2019s back long before the he called it quits with Bella \u2014 but the model, 19, always had suspicions about the \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d singer talking to other girls behind her back.\n\n\u201cTheir relationship deteriorated as they started spending more and more time apart due to work commitments,\u201d a source told In Touch exclusively. \u201cShe began to lose trust when his calls and texts became less frequent. In the back of her mind, she had her suspicions that there was someone else, but little did she know that person [was] Selena!\u201d\n\nFor more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-weeknd.jpg?w=1180&h=510&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/in-touch-weekly-cover-680-921.jpg?w=1180&h=921&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-680-440.jpg?w=1180&h=440&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Harry-Potter-Star-Rupert-Grint-and-Girlfriend-Georgia-Groome-Pregnant-Expecting-Baby-No.-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C396px%2C2232px%2C1266px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teen-mom-og-maci-doesnt-think-ryan-is-sober.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/selena-gomez-the-weeknd.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Sitzer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-relationship-125087/", "title": "Selena Gomez Is Acting \u201cCrazy\u201d With The Weeknd, \u201cPushing Him Away\u201d (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "There\u2019s already trouble in paradise for The Weeknd and Selena Gomez.
