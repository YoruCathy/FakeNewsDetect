The momager was of course referring to her nine grandchildren.\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner crew grew quite a bit in last few months. Kim Kardashian welcomed her third child \u2014 a daughter named Chicago \u2014 on January 15. Then Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian became first-time moms (They have daughters Stormi, 5 months, and True, 3 months, respectively.)\n\nKris marvels at how Kylie has adjusted to parenthood. \u201cKylie is more calm than I was,\u201d she tells Us. \u201cI look at the way she she loves Stormi and takes care of her. She doesn\u2019t go anywhere without her.\u201d The businesswoman is equally in awe of Khloe \u2014 through she never doubted the Good American denim cofounder\u2019s mothering skills.\n\n\u201cI knew she would be amazing. She is always the one who has her house stocked with goodies and takes care of everyone else\u2019s kids,\u201d Kris gushes. \u201cThey all want to have the sleepovers at Auntie KoKo\u2019s. True is the light of her life.\u201d\n\nJust before Khloe gave birth, videos and photos surfaced of her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, getting close with other women during her pregnancy. But fans might not see the drama play out on TV. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on baby and her life,\u201d Kris explains. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of her for being an amazing mommy.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians premieres on E! on Sunday, August 5, at 9 p.m.\n\nFor more on the Kardashians and season 15, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.\n\nWith reporting by Brody Brown\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nGo back into the Us Weekly archives and revisit some of the best bombshell stories, riveting feuds and couplings with our new podcast \u201c#TBT!\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kris-jenner2.jpg?w=253", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kris-jenner2.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/UW3318_cover_ns.jpg?w=221", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kris-jenner2.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kris-jenner-talks-season-15-of-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/", "title": "Kris Jenner Talks Season 15 of \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kris Jenner opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about season 15 of \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 \u2014 find out what she said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kris Jenner Spills Secrets About the New Season of 'KUWTK'", "description": "Kris Jenner opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about season 15 of \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 \u2014 find out what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kris-jenner-talks-season-15-of-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:08:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kris-jenner2.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kris-jenner2.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-08-01T13:08:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:08:48+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kris Jenner opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about season 15 of \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2019 \u2014 find out what she said", "title": "Kris Jenner Spills Secrets About the New Season of 'KUWTK'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kris-jenner2.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533128900.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
