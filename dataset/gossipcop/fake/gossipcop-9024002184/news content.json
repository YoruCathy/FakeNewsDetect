She is somehow exactly me, exactly John, and exactly herself. I adore her.\n\nI had everything I needed to be happy. And yet, for much of the last year, I felt unhappy. What basically everyone around me\u2014but me\u2014knew up until December was this: I have postpartum depression. How can I feel this way when everything is so great? I\u2019ve had a hard time coming to terms with that, and I hesitated to even talk about this, as everything becomes such a \u201cthing.\u201d During pregnancy, what I thought were casual comments about IVF turned into headlines about me choosing the sex of my daughter. And I can already envision what will be said about me after this admission. But it\u2019s such a major part of my life and so, so many other women\u2019s lives. It would feel wrong to write anything else. So here goes.\n\nI had such a wonderful, energetic pregnancy. Luna sat inside me like a little cross-legged Buddha facing toward my back for nine months. I never saw her face in a sonogram, just her butt or the back of her feet. Every time we kinnnnd of saw a nose, she would quickly dodge, and I was left guessing again. John, my mom, and my sister were all in the delivery room. John was DJ-ing. Luna, fittingly, popped out to the song \u201cSuperfly.\u201d The first lyric is \u201cDarkest of night. With the moon shining bright.\u201d I immediately put her on my chest. And she had a face! I was so happy. And exhausted.\n\nAfter I had Luna, our home was under construction, so we lived in a rental home, then a hotel, and I blamed whatever stress or detachment or sadness I was feeling at that time on the fact that there were so many odd circumstances. I remember thinking: \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll feel better when we have a home.\u201d\n\nI went back to work on Lip Sync Battle in August, when Luna was four months. The show treated me incredibly well\u2014they put a nursery in my dressing room and blew up photos of Luna and John and my family for my wall. When Luna was on set, they lowered the noise levels. They turned down the air so she wouldn\u2019t be cold. Only the most gentle knocking on the door. Pump breaks. I mean, there was no better place to get to go back to work to.\n\nBut I was different than before. Getting out of bed to get to set on time was painful. My lower back throbbed; my \u00adshoulders\u2014even my wrists\u2014hurt. I didn\u2019t have an appetite. I would go two days without a bite of food, and you know how big of a deal food is for me. One thing that really got me was just how short I was with people.\n\nI would be in my dressing room, sitting in a robe, getting hair and makeup done, and a crew member would knock on the door and ask: \u201cChrissy, do you know the lyrics to this song?\u201d And I would lose it. Or \u201cChrissy, do you like these cat ears, or these panda hands?\u201d And I\u2019d be like: \u201cWhatever you want. I don\u2019t care.\u201d They would leave. My eyes would well up and I would burst into tears. My makeup artist would pat them dry and give me a few minutes.\n\nI couldn\u2019t figure out why I was so unhappy. I blamed it on being tired and possibly growing out of the role: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just not a goofy person anymore. Maybe I\u2019m just supposed to be a mom.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f755dc429701015cb98/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-04.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f740aac72189c03c1fd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-02.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7444ad5e14c23a03a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-01.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7540800d79a851f027/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-pullquote.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f766b5e90715a100cce/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-lede.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chrissy Teigen", "Chrissy Teige"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up for the First Time About Her Postpartum Depression", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Chrissy Teigen", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "In her interview for the cover of Glamour's April 2017 issue, Chrissy Teigen opens up about her postpartum depression.", "id": "58b741e550629d72400bb20b", "keywords": "entertainment,chrissy teigen,cover stars,postpartum,motherhood", "news_keywords": "entertainment,chrissy teigen,cover stars,postpartum,motherhood", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58b741e550629d72400bb20b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In her interview for the cover of Glamour's April 2017 issue, Chrissy Teigen opens up about her postpartum depression.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7450629d72400bb1f5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-03.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain.\"", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up About Her Postpartum Depression", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "\"The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain.\"", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b8a77e72d5a047cb7f24f2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-02%2520at%25205.46.35%2520PM.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Opens Up About Her Postpartum Depression"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
