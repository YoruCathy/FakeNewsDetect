The pair have a longtime friendship, and certain tabloids are set on portraying the actresses as though their friendship is a facade.\n\nThis time around, the rumor that has made headlines due to a false report by the National Enquirer states that Cox went on a jealous tirade over the success and happiness of Aniston. Gossip Cop shares the details about this ludicrous fabrication.\n\n\u201cA so-called \u2018source\u2019 tells the National Enquirer, in oddly unnatural language, \u2018A longtime friendship\u2019s about to go up in flames! Courteney stunned close pals at a recent dinner, launching into a jealous, un-\u2018Friend\u2019-ly attack on Jen, saying, \u2018I should have been the movie star!'\u201d\n\nThe source goes on to claim that Courteney was openly sharing her frustrations about the fact that Jen \u201ccatapulted\u201d to a whole other level of stardom, while her own career failed to take off. GC continues to relay the words of the source.\n\n\u201cSlamming Jen for being the more famous one, Courteney grumped that she can\u2019t understand how Jen catapulted to huge movie stardom while her own big-screen career never took off! Her sniping behind Jen\u2019s back sounded damn nasty and people definitely overheard it.\u201d\n\nThe celebrity gossip policing site was sure to check in with more reliable sources close to the Friends co-stars and have been assured that Aniston and Cox are great pals and that the raven-haired beauty did not go off on a tirade regarding Jen\u2019s stardom and success.\n\n#Friends to the end!

Cox and Pitt were at a charity event and were reportedly quite flirtatious with one another, which allegedly made Aniston a bit annoyed with her pal. As stated, this too was stamped out as false.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never feel scolded. She\u2019s extremely fair, ridiculously loyal and fiercely loving\u201d- Jennifer Aniston about Courteney Cox pic.twitter.com/qp3Vp9VFJX \u2014 mondler trash (@bingandgeller) February 18, 2017\n\nIt seems as though ever since Aniston shared her piece in her letter in the Huffington Post last summer in which she shared her frustrations with tabloid rumors regarding false pregnancies focused on her. However, tabloids have been tirelessly trying to gain readership for false stories about the star based on other subjects instead. It\u2019s clear that the point was missed entirely, seeing as Aniston\u2019s intent was to share that she wanted the fabricated stories and the harassment by paparazzi to stop altogether. This has not been the case.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u2018journalism\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.'\u201d\n\nRecently, Jennifer Aniston even shared in an interview that although she was impressed by how well-received her letter in the publication has been, she admitted that she sees it has done little to cause tabloids from churning out falsities about her and other celebrities, while also focusing on aspects of such stars that should not be the primary focus \u2014 pregnancy, weight, appearance, and break-ups, to name a few.\n\nDespite the constant focus on everything other than her career, which is clearly a frustration, Aniston takes it all in stride. Although she appears to be near-perfect in many aspects of her life, she shared in an interview with Marie Claire last fall that she really does not always have it all together, but that it\u2019s okay, as the Inquisitr formerly shared.\n\n\u201cThis is a time when I\u2019m not completely sure what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m at this sort of crossroads trying to figure out what inspires me deep in my core. What used to make me tick is not necessarily making me tick any- more \u2026 The most challenging thing right now is trying to find what it is that makes my heart sing.\u201d\n\n[Featured Image by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Jennifer-Aniston-clarifies-Mile-High-story.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/784fcf0a3514f31a582147119c01ff3d?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Dafoe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4004828/courteney-cox-did-not-go-on-a-jealous-tirade-about-pal-jenniferaniston/", "title": "Courteney Cox Did Not Go On \u2018Tirade\u2019 About Pal Jennifer Aniston [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
