But in actuality nothing could be further from the truth,\u201d said source close to Shepherd, who once worked for Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Erika Girardi and choreographer Mikey Minden.\n\nAccording to Shepherd\u2019s pal, \u201cStephanie was tired of being talked to like she was beneath Kim, and she could never do anything for herself because Kim would beg her to stay and work for days on end.\u201d\n\nThe breaking point came when Shepherd recently asked for a raise from her millionaire boss, the insider claimed.\n\n\u201cSteph asked her for a raise, but Kim told her no.
