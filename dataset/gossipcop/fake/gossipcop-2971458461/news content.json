Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\nNaturally, the photo quickly became a meme on Twitter, because how were there two reality TV stars in the Oval Office?\n\nA Trump - Kim summit at last pic.twitter.com/ok9U500Y4t \u2014 Alfons L\u00f3pez Tena #FBPE (@alfonslopeztena) May 31, 2018\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN'S COMING OVER DON'T TELL JEFF SESSIONS I WANT TO MAKE HER THE NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL ALSO HAVE YOU SEEN MELANIE? pic.twitter.com/BryvoLwRlR \u2014 Karen DaltonBeninato (@kbeninato) May 30, 2018\n\nDonald is wearing KKW Beauty foundation in Nonsensical Screaming Papaya and Kim is sporting creme lipstick in Kanye We Need to Talk pic.twitter.com/zYqZPUK8ka \u2014 kyla (@whatkyIasaid) May 30, 2018\n\nThe meeting took place after months of discussion between Kardashian and Jared Kushner, according to Vanity Fair. Kardashian asked the president to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.\n\nBefore the meeting, Kardashian tweeted a birthday message for Johnson.\n\nHappy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u2728 \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018\n\nBut people on Twitter just couldn't believe that this was actually happening.\n\nIf you would\u2019ve told me five years ago Donald Trump would be POTUS and Kim Kardashian would be in the Oval Office discussing prison reform with him I would have called you insane.\n\n\n\nWe truly live in the darkest timeline. \u2014 Denizcan James (@MrFilmkritik) May 30, 2018\n\n\u201cSo, here\u2019s the pitch. It\u2019s a fish out of water story but get this, he\u2019s the president and we have Donald Trump play him. And then, here\u2019s the kicker we have Kim Kardashian play his sassy but still incompetent Chief of staff. It\u2019s like Veep meets The Purge.\u201d pic.twitter.com/3EO9V87vAL \u2014 Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) May 30, 2018\n\nI present the 10th circle of Dante's Inferno\u2014 Donald Trump meeting with Kim Kardashian about prison reform. pic.twitter.com/rjUseCYQvL \u2014 Dani Bostick (@danibostick) May 30, 2018\n\nThis book by @richardhine was published in June 2016 https://t.co/ebyLPgViWC \u2014 Daniel Radosh (@danielradosh) May 30, 2018\n\nApparently prison reform hits home for Kushner, who has firsthand experience with an incarcerated family member after his father Charles was charged with tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering. Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.\n\nThe young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.\n\nSince the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.\n\nKardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.\n\nThis man is sentenced to 35 yrs for selling drugs. He serves over 21 yrs, is released, finds a job, new relationship, starts a new life, & now is being sent back for another 10 yrs because the original release was an error. This man has completely rehabilitated himself. So sad https://t.co/msLsMSHGxh \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 28, 2018\n\nShe also shared a tweet about a man who was sentenced to only 90 days of house arrest after raping a child.\n\nSince he doesn\u2019t have to go on the sex offender registry, let it be known in the court of public opinion instead:\n\n\n\nHis name is LYLE BURGESS in California and he is the founder of auto part company RARE PARTS INC\n\n\n\nSpread the word. Let everyone know what he is, since the law won\u2019t. https://t.co/ar2WPtLJG9 \u2014 Kelly (@kellyblaus) May 27, 2018\n\nKardashian has also hinted at political aspirations. In an unaired clip from Khloe and Lamar, she pondered running for mayor of Glendale, a town in the greater Los Angeles area, because of its prominent Armenian population. (It's worth noting that Glendale doesn't have mayoral elections \u2014 instead, its city council appoints a member to serve as mayor for one year.) Despite her past misinformation about the town's bureaucratic structure, it's possible that she used this meeting to sow seeds for future political gain.\n\nKardashian hasn't made a public statement about the meeting yet, aside from tweeting the birthday message for Alice Marie Johnson. Is there a chance we'll get to see a behind the scenes of the meeting on the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians? Possibly \u2014 although season 15 doesn't have a premiere date yet. A Variety report revealed that the Kardashian/Jenner/West empire milked a deal with E! that will keep them on the air until 2020.", "images":
