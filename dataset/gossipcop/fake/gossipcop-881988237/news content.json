He\u2019s his own nemesis! I feel kind of sorry for him. He\u2019s a kid. Who\u2019s taking care of him? That\u2019s the question I want to ask. Who\u2019s taking care of this child? He\u2019s clearly in a bad place, so I don\u2019t want to slag him off. I think he\u2019s beautiful, a beautiful boy. Let\u2019s not pretend here. He\u2019s a beautiful boy.\u201d \u201cHe looks like a beautiful dyke. I kind of like that \u2014 the whole dykey, androgynous thing he\u2019s got going on. But I feel like everyone\u2019s giving him a hard time and, yes, he\u2019s slightly out of control. Somebody [should] step in.\u201d\n\nWe also have to hand it to Ferber for having the guts to ask Boy George if he\u2019s tried Grindr!
