Some of the stories might have a nugget of truth hidden in them, but most are just so out there that they couldn\u2019t possible have any merit, right?\n\nThe most recent rumor says that Grande forces her staff to carry her like a baby, according to In Touch magazine. \u201cHer new rule is that she has to be carried \u2014 literally like a baby \u2014 when she doesn\u2019t feel like walking,\u201d a source told the magazine. \u201cShe says she doesn\u2019t want her precious feet to hit the floor.\u201d\n\nMore: 11 Times Ariana Grande tried really hard to be Mariah Carey\n\nHere are some other outlandish rumors about Grande that have popped up.\n\n1. She refused to do the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge\n\nAccording to Star magazine, Grande would not film herself having ice dumped over her head because she refuses to be seen without her hair extensions or full makeup. \u201cCelebrities all over the world are doing it for a good cause, but she doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Star says a source told them. \u201cHer skin is a big problem for her and she absolutely does not want to be seen barefaced.\u201d\n\n2. She threatens lighting crews with drastic measures if they mess up\n\nIn August, Grande allegedly berated a lighting crew and made sure she was only shot from certain angles. \u201cShe was a total nightmare,\u201d a source told Star. \u201cShe demanded to be shot only on her left side and told the lighting crew that if they used red light, she would \u2018kill herself.'\u201d\n\nMore: Harsh! Did Bette Midler just call Ariana Grande a \u2018whore\u2019?\n\n3. She has an assistant feed her water with a straw\n\n\u201cShe had an assistant follow her around with a bottle of water and a straw,\u201d a witness told Star. \u201cAnd as soon as she was feeling a bit parched, she would scream \u2018Water!\u2019 and the girl would scurry over\u2026 At one point, the water was too warm for her liking, so she spit it out!\u201d\n\n4. She elbowed Giuliana Rancic in the side\n\nGrande allegedly strong-armed Rancic into moving out of her way during an interview, again to make sure she was only seen from her good side. It seems that this rumor might actually be true, because the allegations come straight from Rancic\u2019s mouth. \u201cI remember, I think I was at the AMAs, she came up on the platform and normally I stand on this side to the camera,\u201d Rancic said, according to Perez Hilton. \u201cLittle Ariana comes over like all bink [mimics an elbow jab] with an elbow in my side. I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 And they pushed me to the other side.\u201d\n\n5. She wished death upon her fans\n\nAccording to a source, Grande was all smiles while signing autographs for fans earlier this year, but said some pretty brutal things as soon as they were out of earshot. \u201cAs soon as the doors [of an elevator] shut she said, \u2018I hope they all f***ing die,'\u201d an insider told the New York Daily News.\n\n6. She ordered her security to delete a fan\u2019s camera photos\n\nA couple of very disappointed fans took to Twitter after meeting Grande, who was alleged very distant and snubbed them at a meet and greet.\n\nWe won a #MTV contest to meet @ArianaGrande & we ended up in tears. Disappointed our idol would treat us like this \ud83d\ude14 pic.twitter.com/afeb7irAJv \u2014 Jennifer O'Connor (@HerNamesJen) August 24, 2014\n\n@ArianaGrande My sister & I were huge fans. u made @HerNamesJen extremely sad by walking away from her & telling me to delete all my pics. \u2014 Kelle Jansky (@KelleJansky) August 26, 2014\n\nWhat do you think?
