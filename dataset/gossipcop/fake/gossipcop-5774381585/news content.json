Pitt and Jolie are parents to 16-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, 13-year-old Zahara, 11-year-old Shiloh and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\n\u201cBrad tries to maintain a safe environment for the children, so that when they visit they stay home,\u201d the source says. \"When the children are visiting, they are usually accompanied by bodyguards and nannies. The house is basically on lockdown.
