It was the president\u2019s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981\u2014then recovering from an attempted assassination.)\n\nAmong the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u2014for, it seems, they weren\u2019t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally\u2014as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe\u2019s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast\u2014but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf\u2019s jokes about Trump\u2019s wealth (\u201cMr. President, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you\u2019re doing fine\u201d) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.\n\nSanders was reportedly seated in Wolf\u2019s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: \u201cI loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Wolf said to her. \u201cI\u2019m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what\u2019s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders\u2019s seeming gameness for taking the criticism\u2014\u201cThat @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,\u201d she wrote on Twitter\u2014a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf\u2019s speech), said, \u201cWashington is so thin-skinned.\u201d (She would know.) Celebrities like Rosie O\u2019Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf\u2019s performance\u2014though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.\n\nBut there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf's own, in response to Sean Spicer's tweet that \"Tonight's #WHCD was a disgrace.\" \"Thank you!\" she responded.\n\nRelated Videos\n\nAlso, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn\u2019t have water.", "images": ["https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/16/585335b7d3b7a5db18f3a051_GettyImages-138427937.jpg?h=600px",
