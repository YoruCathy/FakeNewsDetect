The only thing that would make Orlando and Katy a cuter couple than they already are is a baby \u2014 and it sounds like Orlando is all for the idea.\n\nInstagram\u2019s new Ask Me Anything feature may be the best thing the app has come up with! Without it, we may never have known that Orlando Bloom, 41, wants more kids. Although he has a son named Flynn with his ex Miranda Kerr, the actor has been dating Katy Perry, 33, on and off since 2016 \u2014 and now it\u2019s looking like they may be ready to take things to the next level. Well, Orlando is at least. After posting on his Insta story, \u201cI\u2019m waiting to go to set ask me a question,\u201d one fan asked if he wanted to have kids. His answer? \u201cYes I love being a dad.\u201d\n\nAs if his answer wasn\u2019t sweet enough, Orlando even posted it with a smiling selfie. Now if that big grin doesn\u2019t make it clear how he feels about having more kids, we don\u2019t know what does! Wondering if Katy feels the same? Good thing a source close to her told Hollywoodlife EXCLUSIVELY, \u201cKaty doesn\u2019t want to make things very secret with Orlando Bloom, and if he wanted to marry her and have children, she would be all in. She has jokingly said to friends she would be a baby-making machine for him, but it is something that is drenched in truth.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll just let that sink in for a sec\u2026 These two are both excited about starting a fam \u2014 so what are they waiting for? We hope to see a baby announcement from Orlando and Katy sooner rather than later.\n\nWith rumors flying around that Beyonce and Jay-Z are expecting a fourth, not to mention that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are trying for their first, it sounds like there are going to be a lot of cute kiddos running around this time next year. Fingers crossed one of them is Orlando and Katy\u2019s!", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F19%2Forlando-bloom-wants-kids-katy-perry-baby%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3245916", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/riley_cardoza.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/orlando-bloom-katy-perry-family-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/orlando-bloom-katy-perry-family-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/orlando-bloom-katy-perry-family-embed.jpg?w=620&h=877", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/orlando-bloom-katy-perry-family-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Riley Cardoza", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Kristen Lopez", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/19/orlando-bloom-wants-kids-katy-perry-baby/", "title": "Orlando Bloom Ready To Start A Family With Katy Perry?
