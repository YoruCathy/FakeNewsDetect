Check out this conversation between the two that has fans buzzing!\n\nWe always knew Andy Cohen, 49, was great friends with the Kardashian family. However, we didn\u2019t know they were so close that Khloe Kardashian, 33, would name her first child after the Bravo host! Well, it\u2019s a joke, but a clever joke at that, that had fans in a tizzy during a Twitter exchange on April 8. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to meet baby Andy! (That\u2019s the name right?!),\u201d Andy tweeted at Khloe while discussing The Real Housewives of Atlanta. \u201cI mean, I was going to surprise you but you guessed her name,\u201d Khloe replied, clearly joking that she\u2019s already planned to name her baby after Andy. While we wish this was a legitimate reveal, Khloe continues to keep us guessing. Check out their playful conversation below!\n\nThe conversation started when Khloe tweeted that part 1 of the RHOA reunion was \u201cjust too good,\u201d before thanking Andy for yet another juicy broadcast. The Bravo host then told Khloe she has \u201can OPEN invite\u201d to the reunion [which is three parts]. Khloe said she would totally be there, however, the \u201conly thing\u201d holding her back is that she\u2019s \u201cabout to give birth.\u201d \u2014 Which leads up to the most recent report involving her pregnancy.\n\nKhloe is reportedly in labor, according to TMZ on April 9. While we do know that the Good American designer is in Cleveland, patiently waiting for the arrival of her daughter with boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, 27, nothing else has been confirmed involving the birth. Adding to the speculation, Kylie Jenner\u2018s, OB/GYN, Dr. Thais Aliabadi, posted a photo of herself traveling for work over the weekend. The interesting timing of her flight had fans buzzing that she was traveling to Cleveland to assist with Khloe\u2019s delivery; Since the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is due to give birth any day now.\n\nKhloe and Tristan are expecting their first child together, a baby girl, which they announced on December 20, 2017. Khloe\u2019s baby shower took place on March 10 in CA, where her family and friends, including Kim Zolciak-Biermann, 39, and her daughter, Brielle, 21, were both present.
