Kourtney breaks down in an emotional phone call to Khloe, who just so happens to be sitting with Kim and their mom, Kris Jenner.\n\n\"I'm not here to be mistreated by my f**king b**ch family,\" she cries. \"Kim saying that I'm the least interesting to look at -- who even speaks like that?\"\n\n\"You guys just have really different values than me. I choose to be a mother to my three kids. I am not here looking for another job. I already work enough, more than I would like to,\" Kourtney continues, as Kim gets out of her chair.\n\n\"You don't do f**king sh*t!\" Kim yells, causing Khloe to get up and walk away, with Kim following her.\n\nKhloe Kardashian Calls Out 'B**chy' Kourtney This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

So maybe deal with that,\" Kim shouts back, forcing Khloe and Kris to take Kourtney's side.\n\n\n\n\"Oh my god, Kimberly. That's not OK to say,\" Khloe interrupts.\n\n\"What I said was rude and I wasn't even being serious. I said I'm sorry for that, but you're the most entitled f**king person on the planet when you work the least,\" Kim continues.\n\nBut the fight isn't over! Watch below.\n\nKim can definitely dish it, as she's clapped back in several celebrity feuds over the past few years, with stars like Piers Morgan, Bette Midler, Lamar Odom and Taylor Swift.
