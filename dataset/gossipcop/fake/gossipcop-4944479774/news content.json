His taste was exquisite, he was so intelligent. When you went to pitch with Brad, it was actually fun. He had such confidence underneath a cool, amused exterior. The thing I will remember most about Brad is his generosity. He loved movies, he loved entertainment, he loved life. He loved his success and he made sure to share it with the people who surrounded him. I\u2019m going to miss him terribly.\u201d\n\nMartin Scorsese, Oscar-winning filmmaker:\n\n\u201cBrad Grey was a true friend, and he genuinely loved movies. Our professional relationship started with The Departed, which he basically shepherded into existence \u2014sadly, he is uncredited as a producer on that picture, but that\u2019s the title he deserved. He and I worked together on every picture I made since, all the way through Silence, and he was always extremely protective of the creative process, very careful to keep it separate from all infighting and financial entanglements \u2014 in other words, the business. Like so many of Brad\u2019s friends, I\u2019m in a state of shock.\u201d\n\nJim Gianopulos, Chairman & CEO of Paramount Pictures:\n\nAll of us at Paramount are deeply saddened by the news of Brad Grey\u2019s passing. He was at the helm of the studio for over a decade and was responsible for so many of it\u2019s most beloved films. We extend our deepest sympathies to Cassandra, Max, Sam, Emily and Jules Grey, along with Brad\u2019s mother, brother and sister. I was proud to call Brad a friend, and one I greatly admired. He will be missed by us all, and left his mark on our industry and in our hearts.\n\nI am devastated over the loss of my best friend since I was twenty-two, Brad Grey. My heart is with his family, who are my family. \u2014 bob saget (@bobsaget) May 15, 2017\n\nBrillstein Entertainment Group:\n\nBrad was a unique force in our business and a self-made man. Brad helped forge a new paradigm in representing artists and worked to reinvent how a management company can serve its clients. Our hearts go out to his family, whom he loved dearly. As a company, we are indebted to his legacy.\n\nJim Berkus, UTA chairman:\n\n\u201cBrad Grey was a colleague, collaborator and, most importantly, a great friend. As a talent executive, he fought for his clients and helped stretch the boundaries of tradition to enable his clients to do great things. As a studio executive, he was committed to making movies that would stand the test of time. He created a legacy in our industry that will have a lasting impact. All of UTA mourns his loss, and we will miss him greatly.\u201d\n\nAt Bernie Brillstein memorial Brad said to me, \"In the blink of an eye John, it goes so fast, enjoy it all\" I'm in shock. #BradGrey pic.twitter.com/Lw6Fw7WeT9 \u2014 John Stamos (@JohnStamos) May 15, 2017\n\nHBO:\n\nAll of us at HBO are heartsick to learn of the passing of our colleague and friend Brad Grey.

My thoughts are with his wife Cassandra, his children, and his entire family.\n\nBob Weinstein, Co-Chairman of the Weinstein Company:\n\nI knew Brad for over 40 years. He started out as me and my brother\u2019s assistant and within 6 months it was clear that we should be working for him and not the other way around. He was destined for great things in this business, but more importantly on a personal level, I knew him as a family man and nothing was more important to him than that. My condolences to his family and he will be missed.\n\nFilmmaker Ava Duvernay:\n\nBefore Selma was released, he invited me to dinner. Fab stories. Good laughs. And shrewd advice that I still use.
