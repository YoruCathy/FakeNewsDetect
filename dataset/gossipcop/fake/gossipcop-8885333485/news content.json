(Picture: Kim Kardashian/Instagram)\n\nNope, not here (Picture: Kim Kardashian/Instagram)\n\nThe father of her baby niece, however, was nowhere to be seen, suggesting that all is not well between them.\n\nIt may have something to do with claims that Thompson cheated on Khloe, who was pregnant at the time with their now three-month-old baby daughter, True.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nKim shared a video of the work of art on her Instagram stories, as did Khloe. Neither mentioned the missing sportsman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe image did feature Kim, Khloe and Kourtney\u2019s late father Robert Kardashian, as well as a host of other close family members.\n\nThis is not the first time Kylie appears to have given Thompson the cold shoulder. In June, the Kardashians welcomed Khloe home from Cleveland with balloons that read \u2018Khloe and True\u2019 \u2013 but not Tristan.\n\nKhloe Kardashian decided to stay together with Thompson despite accusations that he cheated, and instead the pair reportedly enrolled in couple\u2019s therapy to make their relationship work.\n\nSister Kim previously stated she was supportive of whatever decision Khloe made, so long as she is happy.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
