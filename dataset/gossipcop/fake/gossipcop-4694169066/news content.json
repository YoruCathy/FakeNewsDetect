Daniel Radcliffe reportedly asked his longtime girlfriend Erin Darke to marry him and the two have been shopping for rings that you just have to hear about!\n\nDaniel Radcliffe may \u201cdisapperate\u201d right off the market! The 27 year-old Harry Potter star has reportedly asked his girlfriend of five years TV and film actress Erin Darke, 28, to marry him, according to Star magazine. Despite denials of an engagement from Daniel\u2019s reps, multiple sources told the mag about the couple\u2019s alleged ring shopping outings. \u201cDaniel recently took Erin ring shopping and spared no expense,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about marriage for a while now and thought this was something worth splurging on.\u201d\n\nDaniel reportedly is not one to splurge on major expenses even though he has $97 million at his disposal. He\u2019s practically richer than Gringotts! He and Erin \u201clive a very quiet, ordinary life together in Manhattan,\u201d a source told the mag. The pair have definitely lived their lives fairly under the radar with the exception of a truly impressive karaoke performance! Daniel and Erin were spotted in Half Moon Bay, CA during the summer of 2015 giving their all to a performance of Eminem\u2019s \u201cThe Real Slim Shady.\u201d We love these two together! A source described Erin as \u201can incredibly calming influence on Daniel,\u201d who struggled with alcoholism during his Harry Potter tenure and has been sober for more than three years now.\n\nFans will be waiting longer than a few years for Daniel to don his Hogwarts robes again, but the actor did leave a small chance for his return in the future. \u201cThe circumstances would have to be pretty extraordinary. But then I am sure Harrison Ford said that with Han Solo and look what happened there! So I am saying, \u2018No,\u2019 for now but leaving room to backtrack in the future,\u201d he told Britain\u2019s Radio Times in June 2016. Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing?\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Daniel is engaged?
