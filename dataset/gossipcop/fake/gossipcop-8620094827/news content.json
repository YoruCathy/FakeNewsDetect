Is there trouble in paradise already?\n\nNope. There's that's definitely not what's happening here. \u201cThey are still doing really well together,\" a source close to the couple told E! News. \"They agreed it was best for them to be with their families for the holiday.\u201d\n\nApparently, Sel decided having a joint Thanksgiving would be jumping the gun this early on in their rekindled relationship. \u201cSelena felt it was too soon for Justin to come to Texas with her,\u201d another insider added. \u201cHer family is still getting comfortable with the idea of them back together.\u201d\n\nFair enough. After all, the pair are still in their honeymoon phase. It makes sense to wait a while before getting family involved.\n\nDespite spending the holidays apart, Justin and Selena reportedly stayed in touch the whole time through FaceTime. Justin is hoping he could get an invite to a future family holiday with Sel in the future.\n\n\u201cJustin says he hopes he can spend Christmas with her but knows that it will take a very long time for her family to accept him back in,\u201d the source shared.\n\nThe Jelena army is crossing their fingers for you, Justin!\n\nNoelle Devoe is the Entertainment Web Editor at Seventeen.com.
