In a new interview, the pregnant reality star said that having a baby won\u2019t mend her estranged relationship with Caitlyn Jenner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that affects anything with Caitlyn,\u201d Kardashian, 33, told Ross King on the U.K. morning show Lorraine on Thursday, February 8. \u201c[Things are] just as they are.\u201d\n\nJenner\u2019s relationship with the Kardashian family has been rocky since the Olympian, 68, revealed her identity as a transgender woman in April 2015. Two years later, the estrangement worsened after the release of Jenner\u2019s memoir, The Secrets of My Life, in which she claimed that ex-wife Kris Jenner \u2014 who is Kardashian\u2019s mother \u2014 was not supportive of her transition. (Kris and Caitlyn, formerly Bruce, were married from 1991 to 2015 and share daughters Kendall, 22, and Kylie, 20.)\n\nCaitlyn opened up about the family feud in November. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,\u201d she admitted while speaking to students at Cambridge Union in England at the time. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven\u2019t talked to in a year. They don\u2019t want me in their lives. They bashed me pretty badly. It\u2019s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.\u201d\n\nThe I Am Cait alum still has a close relationship with Kendall and Kylie, though. In fact, a source recently told Us Weekly exclusively that Caitlyn has already met the Lip Kit creator\u2019s newborn daughter, Stormi. The proud grandparent later confirmed the news on Instagram, writing, \u201cMy daughter just had a daughter. It\u2019s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She\u2019s SO beautiful already. Can\u2019t wait to watch her grow.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Khlo\u00e9 is seven months pregnant with her first child, a boy, with her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/caitlyn-jenner.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kardashian-itv.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kardashian-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?crop=207px%2C0px%2C1510px%2C793px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kardashian-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?crop=207px%2C0px%2C1510px%2C793px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/khloe-kardashian-says-baby-wont-mend-relationship-caitlyn-jenner/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: Baby Won\u2019t Mend Relationship With Caitlyn Jenner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian said in a new interview that having a baby won\u2019t mend her relationship with Caitlyn Jenner \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: Having a Baby Won\u2019t Mend Relationship With Caitlyn", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian said in a new interview that having a baby won\u2019t mend her relationship with Caitlyn Jenner \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/khloe-kardashian-says-baby-wont-mend-relationship-caitlyn-jenner/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T20:57:18+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kardashian-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?crop=207px%2C0px%2C1510px%2C793px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kardashian-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?crop=207px%2C0px%2C1510px%2C793px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-02-08T17:32:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T20:57:18+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian said in a new interview that having a baby won\u2019t mend her relationship with Caitlyn Jenner \u2014 watch", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: Having a Baby Won\u2019t Mend Relationship With Caitlyn", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/khloe-kardashian-caitlyn-jenner.jpg?crop=207px%2C0px%2C1510px%2C793px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518111162.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
