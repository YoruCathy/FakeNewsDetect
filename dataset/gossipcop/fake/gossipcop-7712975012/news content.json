Find out why she didn\u2019t bring her love, Joe Alwyn, here!\n\nTaylor Swift, 28, surprised everyone when she showed up to the Billboard Music Awards on May 20 and although she seems happier than ever with boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, 27, she\u2019s happy she attended the event alone. It turns out Joe is busy making a name for himself in his acting career and Tay is in full support of her hunky beau. \u201cJoe is determined to make it as an actor in his own right, and not to be known just as Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriend,\u201d a source close to Joe EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. \u201cTaylor is really supportive of Joe\u2019s career, and totally understands why he doesn\u2019t want to be a red carpet fixture with her. Joe has been in Cannes where he was awarded the Chopard Trophy, which is a huge honor and recognizes Joe as one of the hottest up and coming actors of his generation. Taylor loves that Joe is so dedicated to his career, and to making it big in his own name, and their relationship is all the happier for it.\u201d\n\nDespite the constant spotlight on Taylor, Joe isn\u2019t letting it bother him and in fact, he\u2019s giving her equal support too. \u201cIt can be really challenging to date Taylor, as she\u2019s such a huge star, but Joe isn\u2019t phased by it in the slightest\u2014he is very secure in himself, and determined to succeed on his own terms\u2014it\u2019s one of the things Taylor loves the most about him, and why their relationship is one of the healthiest she has ever had,\u201d the source continued.\n\nWe\u2019re so happy to hear that things are going well for these two and it\u2019s good to know Taylor can stand on her own and be confident with or without her boyfriend by her side! With the criticism she\u2019s received about having too many boyfriends in the past, it\u2019s great to see her embracing her independence while being in love at the same time. You go, girl!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F21%2Ftaylor-swift-joe-alwyn-happy-missed-billboard-music-awards%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3152833", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-didnt-go-to-billboards-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-didnt-go-to-billboards-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-didnt-go-to-billboards-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/21/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-happy-missed-billboard-music-awards/", "title": "Taylor Swift & Joe Alwyn: Why He Didn\u2019t Join Her At Billboard Awards & They Are Both \u2018Happier\u2019 For It", "meta_data": {"description": "Taylor Swift &amp; Joe Alwyn: Why she didn't bring him to the Billboard Music Awards", "news_keywords": "Joe Alwyn, Taylor Swift", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift & Joe Alwyn: Why He Didn\u2019t Join Her At Billboard Awards & They Are Both \u2018Happier\u2019 For It", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/21/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-happy-missed-billboard-music-awards/", "description": "Taylor Swift went solo for her surprise appearance at the Billboard Music Awards on May 20 and she had very good reason to do so.
