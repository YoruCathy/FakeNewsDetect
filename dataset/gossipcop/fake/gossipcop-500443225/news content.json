Last year, following reports that Garner had called off their divorce, Affleck finally moved out of the property the couple shared.\n\nShortly after, it was revealed that Affleck had moved on with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer Lindsay Shookus in July 2017.\n\nThe exes have an amicable relationship and are focused on co-parenting their daughters, Violet, 12, and Seraphina, 9, and son Samuel, 6.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely a modern family. We\u2019re doing really well,\u201d Garner said previously. \u201cIt has to be [children first]. You have no choice. It has to be.\u201d\n\nReps for Garner and Affleck did not immediately return requests for comment.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/08/10/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-garners-divorce-may-be-dismissed/", "title": "Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner\u2019s divorce may be dismissed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
