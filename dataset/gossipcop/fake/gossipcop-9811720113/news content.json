Her performance as a junkie in \u201cThe Town\u201d features the \u201cBride Wars\u201d of Boston accents. Her performance in \u201cThe Age of Adaline\u201d \u2014 as a woman \u201ccursed\u201d to stay 30 forever \u2014 was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn\u2019t yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.\n\nSo I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it\u2019s refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something \u2014 beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I\u2019d actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.\n\nThere might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don\u2019t fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he\u2019s just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.\n\nLots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else\u2019s turn to be \u201cit.\u201d (It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn\u2019t done with that.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Wesley Morris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html", "title": "How I Learned to Tolerate Blake Lively", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-07-01T20:22:42.000Z", "modified": "2016-07-01T20:22:39.000Z", "section": "Movies", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/wesley-morris", "tag": "Collet-Serra, Jaume", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004504050, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/e14abf2d-f176-5d5e-8c9e-1572986c9200", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/2d5cce51659a4525a385279fdc47d486", "description": "\u201cThe Shallows\u201d is the kind of woman vs. shark movie that\u2019s rigged for triumph, no matter who the star is.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Wesley Morris", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": ",Movies,Blake Lively,Shallows,Shark,Kate Hudson,Jaume Collet-Serra", "pdate": 20160701, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html", "type": "article", "title": "How I Learned to Tolerate Blake Lively", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Blake Lively in \u201cThe Shallows,\u201d directed by Jaume Collet-Serra."}, "description": "\u201cThe Shallows\u201d is the kind of woman vs. shark movie that\u2019s rigged for triumph, no matter who the star is."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html", "title": "How I Learned to Tolerate Blake Lively", "description": "\u201cThe Shallows\u201d is the kind of woman vs. shark movie that\u2019s rigged for triumph, no matter who the star is.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/01/arts/04BLAKELIVELY2/04BLAKELIVELY2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Blake Lively in \u201cThe Shallows,\u201d directed by Jaume Collet-Serra."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/e14abf2d-f176-5d5e-8c9e-1572986c9200"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "movies", "CN": "editors-picks", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/e14abf2d-f176-5d5e-8c9e-1572986c9200", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/04/movies/in-the-shallows-blake-lively-surfs-in-kate-hudsons-wake.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1467561600.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
