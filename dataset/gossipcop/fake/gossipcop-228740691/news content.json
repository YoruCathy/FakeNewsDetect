At 6:52 A.M., the Times\u2019s media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, tweeted, \u201cBREAK: NBC Matt Lauer fired, inappropriate workplace behavior . . . story to come.\u201d But, at 7 A.M., the \u201cToday in New York\u201d warmup ended, the friendly corporate bells chimed, and the \u201cToday\u201d show, as it has since 1952, started. The minutes in between were a chasm.\n\nStills of Lauer\u2014bespectacled and reviewing notes in one, professorially inquisitive in another\u2014crossed the screen as the voice of his co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, announced the breaking news that Lauer\u2019s employment had been terminated overnight, after an employee had come forward on Monday \u201creporting behavior in violation of our company\u2019s standards.\u201d Guthrie\u2019s voice trembled as the camera captured the tableau\u2014Guthrie and her guest co-anchor, Hoda Kotb, palpably sombre, the Popsicle-orange \u201cToday\u201d show logo floating between them. Guthrie clasped Kotb\u2019s hand. She read the entirety of a statement from the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, which was composed in the corporate \u201cwe\u201d: \u201cwe\u201d had reason to believe that the employee\u2019s complaint wasn\u2019t an isolated incident; \u201cwe were deeply saddened by this turn of events\u201d; \u201cwe will face it together as a news organization\u2014and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.\u201d Then Guthrie and Kotb offered their personal expressions of shock and dismay. Lauer had been loved by so many; \u201cwe\u201d loved him. \u201cAs I\u2019m sure you can imagine, we are devastated,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to process it and make sense of it, and it\u2019ll take some time for that,\u201d Kotb said. Expressions of disorientation not dissimilar from expressions of mourning continued for the rest of the show. As Rebecca Traister wrote earlier this month, a \u201cpowerful white man losing a job is a death.\u201d\n\nWe have witnessed a theatre of accountability insidiously refine itself, quite quickly, in the past few months. Louis C.K.\u2019s statement, for example, following the expos\u00e9 in the Times of his sexual harassment of female comics, was not as passionate as, but was more coherent than, Harvey Weinstein\u2019s ramblings about Jay-Z and the gun lobby. The opportunistic finesse of Kevin Spacey\u2019s coming-out certainly tripped some social alarms, but he nonetheless garnered some sympathy. Power brokers like the Pixar animation baron John Lasseter have even scooped long-labored-over articles by pre\u00ebmpting them altogether. (Lasseter is taking a six-month leave of absence.) No display was savvier than NBC\u2019s orchestration on Wednesday.\n\nThe \u201cToday\u201d show\u2019s artful transposition of grief where there would naturally be scrutiny continued into the 10 A.M. slot, in which the veteran host Kathie Lee Gifford spoke of how much she, too, loved Lauer and how sad she was. It continued on this morning\u2019s program, with Guthrie and Kotb again at the helm. Not since Bill Cosby\u2014or Bill O\u2019Reilly, depending on one\u2019s television diet\u2014has the scourge of sexual assault so acutely infiltrated the righteous perimeter of the American home. (President Trump, also affiliated with NBC and accused of assaulting women, never quite depended on a family-man image.) The influence of a behind-the-scenes figure like Weinstein can feel diffuse, removed from our everyday cultural consumption; Lauer was, and is, synonymous with the family feel of \u201cToday.\u201d Part of this comes from the network\u2019s bloated investment in Lauer\u2014he reportedly earns between twenty million and twenty-five million dollars a year. (In 2014, a source told Page Six that the company chartered helicopter rides for Lauer from his Hamptons compound to its Rockefeller Center studios at his request.) When, in 1996, Lauer wrested the anchor chair from Bryant Gumbel, gossip magazines swooned over his geometric jaw and feathery hair; twenty years later, he was transforming comfortably into a smug but wise paternal figure. His tenure at the \u201cToday\u201d show was the longest in its history. Now instances of Lauer\u2019s public pettiness toward women seem like the exertions of a holistically awful campaign. In 2012, he admonished the actress Anne Hathaway for photographs that the paparazzi had taken of her exiting a car. \u201cSeen a lot of you lately,\u201d he said. And, famously, Lauer was an architect of \u201cOperation Bambi,\u201d a plan that succeeded in getting his former co-anchor Ann Curry fired from the show that same year. (\u201c \u2018Chemistry,\u2019 in television history, generally means the man does not want to work with the woman,\u201d Curry said, according to Brian Stelter\u2019s insider anatomy, \u201cTop of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.\u201d) On her final show, Curry wept and Lauer pretended to soothe her. His interview of Hillary Clinton last year was intrusive and aggressive when compared with his handling of Trump. How a man thinks of women dictates how he works with them.\n\nThe stakes with Lauer, as with Charlie Rose, who was fired from both CBS and PBS last week, for sexual harassment, threaten the geniality and social integrity that are the trade of the morning-show apparatus. And so it is no surprise that, to convey something like moral mooring to a vastly female audience, the networks rely on women anchors to break the public fall. An ether of remorse already fogs the perception of Lauer\u2019s ousting, though Lauer waited a day to issue a statement and in it said, \u201cSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.\u201d It seems likely that, at least when it comes to the fact of Lauer\u2019s firing, Guthrie had truly been caught off guard. The company, however, wasn\u2019t; reporters at Variety and the Times had spent months investigating claims against Lauer. Guthrie\u2019s vulnerable pose conferred an unearned armament to a company that had employed a reckless man for two decades. The woman anchor\u2019s surprise becomes the network\u2019s surprise; her sorrow, its sorrow. \u201cHow do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they behaved badly?\u201d Guthrie asked, her eyes glassy. For her, and for Gayle King, who asked a similar question when reporting on her co-host Rose\u2019s transgressions last week, on CBS, the question of loyalty may be relevant. (It was Lauer who lobbied for Guthrie\u2019s co-anchorship, in 2012, following the success of \u201cOperation Bambi.\u201d) But neither love nor loyalty nor sadness excuses NBC, the company that passed on its own employee\u2019s reportage of Weinstein\u2019s abuse of women. The Variety report on Lauer, published on Wednesday afternoon, included accounts of harassment from three unnamed women. It showed an emboldened player whose harmful wiles were accommodated by the network around him. The news mediates the news.\n\nOne detail from Ramin Setoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister\u2019s reporting in Variety mentions a contraption, apparently common in the offices of executives of his stature, that in this context sounds like something used by a villain from a Bond film. The installation of a button under Lauer\u2019s desk made it possible for him to lock himself, and anyone else who might have been invited into his office, inside, without getting up from his seat. The Times reported that NBC on Wednesday had received at least two more complaints from employees about Lauer\u2019s behavior. One woman told the Times that Lauer locked her in his office in 2001: \u201cShe said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her.\u201d She passed out and was taken to a nurse by Lauer\u2019s assistant. Reading the article, I wondered who had seen that commotion, and I thought about the lock, an instrument of security turned into an instrument of violence.", "images": ["https://media.newyorker.com/photos/596fbd91a28215791910e1f3/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/st-felix-doreen_avatar.png", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a183c335c93520d44916535/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/Shatz-Tariq-Ramadan.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a1c9013486ee46c3e0419ca/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/DeRogatis-Why-Not-R-Kelly.jpg", "http://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-reverse.f915b516b6ca9c0c2a9bdf9b749519365b2b2e4a.svg", "http://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo.f1893bac6dafe13d6d5bad671a5bee2345efa44d.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_360%2Cq_80%2Cw_480/v1510947354/thenewyorker_the-backstory-ronan-farrow-tk-tk.jpg", "http://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-header.6e34c81346bc43475ffd572e6c2eb3e125927148.svg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Doreen St. F\u00e9lix", "Doreen St. F\u00e9li", "Jim Derogati", "Adam Shat"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/matt-lauers-firing-and-nbcs-theatre-of-accountability", "title": "Matt Lauer\u2019s Firing and NBC\u2019s Theatre of Accountability", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Doreen St. F\u00e9lix", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Doreen St. F\u00e9lix writes about the way in which the \u201cToday\u201d show, on NBC, talked about the firing of Matt Lauer.", "id": "5a201167fc02d4395ac400c5", "keywords": "culture desk,matt lauer,today show,nbc,harvey weinstein", "news_keywords": "culture desk,matt lauer,today show,nbc,harvey weinstein", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a201167fc02d4395ac400c5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Doreen St. F\u00e9lix writes about the way in which the \u201cToday\u201d show, on NBC, talked about the firing of Matt Lauer.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The network\u2019s announcement of the \u201cToday\u201d host\u2019s dismissal was a savvy display of moral maneuvering.", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg", "site_name": "The New Yorker", "title": "Matt Lauer\u2019s Firing and NBC\u2019s Theatre of Accountability", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/matt-lauers-firing-and-nbcs-theatre-of-accountability"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NewYorker", "description": "The network\u2019s announcement of the \u201cToday\u201d host\u2019s dismissal was a savvy display of moral maneuvering.", "domain": "https://www.newyorker.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a202dae8989ed395dbb8178/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/DSF-Matt-Lauers-Firing-and-NBCs-Theater-of-Accountability.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@NewYorker", "title": "Matt Lauer\u2019s Firing and NBC\u2019s Theatre of Accountability"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1147169538698836, "pages": 9258148868}, "google-signin-client_id": "275906274807-b4eqbdqr511u9msdpj8mh0pf77fcciv7.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newyorker.com", "summary": ""}
