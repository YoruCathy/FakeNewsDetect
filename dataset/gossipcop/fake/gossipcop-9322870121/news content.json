Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.\n\nBefore and after his landmark show last week at the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Famous Arena,\u201d the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible \u2014 and likely all-time record-breaking \u2014 MSG run.\n\nAfter mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.\n\nOn the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for the violence that occurred \u2014 and that were some \u201cvery fine people\u201d among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had to do something that night,\u201d Joel responded. \u201cThe president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, \u2018There\u2019s some good people on that side \u2026\u2019 No, Nazis aren\u2019t good people.\n\n\u201cIt really enraged me, actually,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. \u2026 My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.\n\nBut the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards \u2014 Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff\u2019s girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a \u201cmainstream thing again.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nBilly Joel wore a yellow Jewish star.
