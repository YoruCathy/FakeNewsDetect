Colin Jost was not too shy to let the world know that he\u2019s taken while appearing on live television.\n\nThe comedian, 35, who has been dating Scarlett Johansson, revealed that he has a girlfriend during his \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment of Saturday Night Live on Saturday, May 5. Leslie Jones stopped by to talk about Facebook\u2019s new dating feature and went through a list of the \u201cterrible men\u201d she\u2019s dated and shared why the relationships didn\u2019t work.\n\nAt the end of the clip, she showed a photo of Jost, saying: \u201cColin, he was so cute and sweet and kind but it would never work because he\u2019s gay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gay!\u201d Jost responded with a laugh. \u201cI told you I have a girlfriend!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I have told you that I am not acknowledging that bitch! You either prove that you are not gay or I\u2019m going to keep telling everybody that you are,\u201d Jones responded.\n\nJohansson, 33, also made a surprise appearance at the beginning of the show on Saturday, starring as Ivanka Trump during the cold open.\n\nThe actress and the funnyman have not openly discussed their relationship, but they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the premiere of her movie Avengers: Infinity War in L.A. on April 23. They previously made their first appearance together at the American Museum of Natural History Gala in November 2017. The pair didn\u2019t walk the red carpet at the event but posed for photos with each other inside.\n\nThey first sparked romance rumors when they were spotted getting cozy at an SNL afterparty for the show\u2019s season 42 finale in May 2017. The duo then spent July 4 weekend in Montauk, New York, and were spotted kissing after leaving a restaurant in NYC in November 2017.\n\n\u201cScarlett and Colin looked very happy together,\u201d an eyewitness told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cHe was very protective over her as they were leaving. He tried blocking her from the photographers and the rain at the same time as they left.\u201d\n\nLast year an insider told Us that Jost \u201cwants to marry\u201d the Ghost in the Shell actress. \u201cHe loves to take her out and show her off,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s head over heels.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Johansson filed for divorce from ex-husband Romain Dauriac in March 2017. The actress and Dauriac share daughter Rose, 2. Prior to that relationship, she was married to Ryan Reynolds from 2008 to 2011.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/colin-jost.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/colin-jost.jpg?crop=709px%2C191px%2C1037px%2C545px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/colin-jost.jpg?crop=709px%2C191px%2C1037px%2C545px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/colin-jost-calls-scarlett-johansson-his-girlfriend-on-saturday-night-live/", "title": "Colin Jost Calls Scarlett Johansson His Girlfriend on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Colin Jost revealed that he has a girlfriend during the Weekend Update segment of \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 on Saturday, May 5 \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch SNL's Colin Jost Call Scarlett Johansson His Girlfriend for the First Time", "description": "Colin Jost revealed that he has a girlfriend during the Weekend Update segment of \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 on Saturday, May 5 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/colin-jost-calls-scarlett-johansson-his-girlfriend-on-saturday-night-live/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/colin-jost.jpg?crop=709px%2C191px%2C1037px%2C545px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/colin-jost.jpg?crop=709px%2C191px%2C1037px%2C545px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-06T14:24:20+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Colin Jost revealed that he has a girlfriend during the Weekend Update segment of \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 on Saturday, May 5 \u2014 watch", "title": "Watch SNL's Colin Jost Call Scarlett Johansson His Girlfriend for the First Time", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/colin-jost.jpg?crop=709px%2C191px%2C1037px%2C545px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525616660.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
