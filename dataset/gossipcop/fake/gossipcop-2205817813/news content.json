Falling in love is easy, but staying that way is inevitably much harder \u2013 even when the love is real.\n\nThe biggest hurdles we face after the altar are the giant mounds of heartbreak and pain that can seem insurmountable at first glance. For some couples, the fractures in their foundation become too hard to bear and walking away is what\u2019s healthiest for them. Others choose to stick it out and fight to rebuild after the damage has been done, holding out hope that the tide will shift and good times will roll in once again. Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z are the latter.\n\nThe notoriously private couple has slowly rolled out one detail after another about the bumps in the road they\u2019ve encountered in their marriage\u2014one hit album at a time. First, in 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 released arguably her most emotionally raw album to-date, Lemonade, and track-by-track revealed her heartbreak and anger over discovering her husband\u2019s infidelities and how they almost ended their marriage. A year later JAY-Z told his side of the story on his latest album 4:44. He came clean about his infidelities and his guilt over the pain he caused his wife and daughter at the time. But, as it seems, while fans were still reeling from the heartbreak of learning that the Carters, like so many other married couples, weren\u2019t living the picture-perfect life they believed they were, Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z were pressing reset and putting in the work to save their marriage.\n\nOn Saturday, the couple released a surprise album\u2014their first-ever joint release\u2014titled Everything Is Love, and they couldn\u2019t have picked a more fitting title to describe the new place they\u2019ve arrived at together. If you listen closely to the lyrics, they\u2019re telling us just how far they\u2019ve come together, how much love and passion they still share for each other, and perhaps most importantly, how committed they are to making their marriage work. The album\u2019s final track \u201cLOVEHAPPY\u201d says it all.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down, shall we?\n\nHe went to Jared, I went to Chaumet out in Paris\n\nYeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried\n\nYo, chill man\n\nWe keepin\u2019 it real with these people, right?\n\nLucky I ain\u2019t kill you when I met that b- (Nah, aight, aight )\n\nY\u2019all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together\n\nTo get her back, I had to sweat her\n\nTranslation: While it takes two to achieve true forgiveness in a marriage, when it comes to infidelities, the onus most definitely falls on the guilty party to show and prove, and JAY-Z is clearly putting in that work to show Bey he\u2019s a changed man.\n\nY\u2019all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather\n\nMove the whole family West, but it\u2019s whatever\n\nIn a glass house still throwing stones\n\nHova, Beysus, watch the thrones\n\n(Happy in love)\n\nTranslation: A lot of things can trigger painful memories, including a home, a city or even an area code. Sometimes the easiest way to truly start over is to just\u2026well, start over. In August 2017 Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z moved from New York City to Los Angeles, and now we know it was most likely about a lot more than just the better weather.\n\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9]\n\nYou did some things to me\n\nBoy, you do some things to me\n\nBut love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change\n\nBaby, the ups and downs are worth it\n\nLong way to go, but we\u2019ll work it\n\nWe\u2019re flawed but we\u2019re still perfect for each other\n\nTranslation: Beyonc\u00e9 forgave JAY-Z and she\u2019s pushing past the pain and willing to put in the work because he is too. She\u2019s acknowledging that it hasns\u2019t been an overnight process, but she believes their love will stand the test of time. Real talk: When a marriage hits a rough patch and a couple share what\u2019s going on with close friends and family, usually lots of opinions and judgements follow. Let\u2019s be honest, it can be hard to forgive someone you love for doing the unthinkable when the people around you are telling you that you\u2019re crazy to do so or to stay. The decision is yours and yours partners, and what really matters most is what the two of you want and believe. (Even when the noise around you makes it hard to think clearly.) Here, Beyonc\u00e9 is setting the record straight: She knows where they\u2019ve been and she knows where they\u2019re going and she\u2019s moved on. End of story.\n\nSometimes I thought we\u2019d never see the light\n\nWent through hell with heaven on our side\n\nThis beach ain\u2019t always been no paradise\n\nBut nightmares only last one night\n\nTranslation: They\u2019ve been through the fire and back and their faith is now lifting them higher.\n\nDamn, look at us now\n\nPray, pray for the vows\n\nWay up now, yes, and a way, long way down\n\nWe came, and we saw, and we conquered it all\n\nWe came, and we conquered, now we\u2019re happy in love\n\nTranslation: Bey and Jay\u2019s love is back on top and they\u2019re putting their faith in each other and their vows, which they recently renewed and shared footage from as part of their new On The Run II tour videos.\n\nYou have to applaud Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z for their transparency and their deep commitment to fighting forward and making their marriage work. I imagine the only thing harder than reaching a crisis in your marriage is the vulnerability that comes with sharing the news with the world. But, in true Carters fashion, they\u2019re going hard and not looking back\u2014and sparking necessary conversations on the realities of marriage and the work involved.\n\nTo quote the Carters, \u201cThis. Is. Real. Life.\u201d And, in the real world, when it comes to matters of the heart, sometimes we have to fight for what we want and forgive in order to move forward.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1529307191/GettyImages-968691712.jpeg?width=1920&height=1080", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rgb-TAG-Registered-80px.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1529307191/GettyImages-968691712-900x600.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1529307191/GettyImages-968691712-900x600.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/love/beyonce-jay-z-saved-their-marriage-lyrics-album-everything-is-love/", "title": "This Is Real Life!
