Britney Spears has never been happier with boyfriend Sam Asghari and it seems the couple are getting even more serious.\n\n\u201cSam will be with Britney for [her] entire tour and they are more in love than ever,\u201d a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. \u201cEven though Sam is younger than Britney, he is extremely nature for his age. Don\u2019t be surprised if they get engaged in the next year.\u201d\n\nThe news comes shortly after Asghari, 24, opened up about his relationship with the pop star, 36. \u201cShe motivates me more than anyone,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health on July 17. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy who I can be humbled by a person like her. If I could be that humble when I\u2019m that high in life, that would be the best thing.I grew up with three sisters and my personality is just to be a supportive person for my family and she\u2019s family. I\u2019m always going to support her. She is another blessing that happened to me.\u201d\n\nSpears and the Iranian hunk met on the set of her \u201cSlumber Party\u201d music video in October 2016 and started dating after wrapping. A source told Us in February that the Grammy winner is so in love with the fitness model and their romance is heating up.\n\n\u201cThey spend a lot of time together \u2014 cooking, working out, going on vacation or just hanging out,\u201d the source revealed at the time. \u201cBritney swore she was done with relationships, but then Sam came along. She\u2019s very happy in her relationship. She has a consistent routine and she\u2019s doing what she does best. Life is good for Britney.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cToxic\u201d songstress was married to Jason Alexander for 55 hours in 2004 and then Kevin Federline from 2004 to 2007. She and Federline, 40, share sons Preston, 12, and Jayden, 11.\n\nFor more on Spears and Asghari\u2019s relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d below!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Britney-Spears-Sam-Asghari-engaged.jpg?crop=139px%2C303px%2C1185px%2C669px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Britney-Spears-Sam-Asghari-engaged.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C1476px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Britney-Spears-Sam-Asghari-engaged.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C1476px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-coud-get-engaged-soon/", "title": "Britney Spears and BF Sam Asghari Could Get Engaged Soon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Britney Spears and her boyfriend, Sam Asghari, may take the next step in their relationship soon, a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Britney Spears and Sam Asghari Could Get Engaged Soon!", "description": "Britney Spears and her boyfriend, Sam Asghari, may take the next step in their relationship soon, a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-coud-get-engaged-soon/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:09:17+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Britney-Spears-Sam-Asghari-engaged.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C1476px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Britney-Spears-Sam-Asghari-engaged.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C1476px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-27T12:00:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:09:17+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Britney Spears and her boyfriend, Sam Asghari, may take the next step in their relationship soon, a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "title": "Britney Spears and Sam Asghari Could Get Engaged Soon!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Britney-Spears-Sam-Asghari-engaged.jpg?crop=0px%2C283px%2C1476px%2C775px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532692858.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
