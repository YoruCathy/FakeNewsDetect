It was subsequently denied by Sandler during an interview at the Los Angeles premiere of his new Netflix movie, The Meyerowitz Stories, earlier this week.\n\n\u201cJustin Bieber Wants to Break Into Acting, Asked Adam Sandler and David Spade for Advice,\u201d US Weekly had trumpeted as its headline in a story this week, which prompted copycat articles from outlets that didn\u2019t bother to fact-check for themselves.\n\nHowever, the claim that Justin asked for Sandler for film advice because he supposedly wants to try acting is just not true.\n\nWhile the Biebs did dine with Sandler and comic-actor David Spade \u2014 just after the trio appeared at a hurricane relief telethon last month \u2014 the \u201cSorry\u201d superstar did not quiz Sandler for acting tips.\n\nIn Entertainment Tonight\u2019s interview, Sandler was asked about the claim that he dined with the Canadian pop singer to help his acting career.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who said that, but that\u2019s some weird story that they made up,\u201d Sandler firmly refuted.\n\nThe veteran comedy star explained, \u201cThat\u2019s not it at all.\u201d\n\nSandler continued, \u201cWe just hung out. He just wanted to go to dinner, me and David Spade and Dustin [Hoffman], and Dustin said no, he ran away, so it was just me and David.\u201d\n\nWatch the brief interview below.\n\nSandler\u2019s emphatic calling out of the fake story indicates the purported \u201cquotes\u201d in US Weekly\u2019s story were either inadequately sourced or simply made up.\n\nGiven that the magazine is owned by American Media, Inc. \u2014 the publisher that also owns the National Enquirer, Radar Online, Star, OK!, and other outlets of that low-tier ilk \u2014 we\u2019ll leave it to sensible Inquisitr readers to decide whether or not US Weekly used incompetent sources or just flat-out fabricated them.\n\nEither way, the claim that the Biebs had \u201csought out some A-list help to guide him in his thespian ambitions,\u201d as US Weekly\u2019s spurious \u201csource\u201d puts it \u2014 is fiction.\n\nExhibit one: \u201cJustin Bieber asked Adam Sandler and David Spade out to dinner to pick their brains about breaking into the film industry.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cquote\u201d is false.\n\nExhibit two: \u201cThey had a great time! Justin had a lot of questions for them about the movie world.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cquote\u201d is also bogus.\n\nAnother \u201cquote\u201d claimed the pop prince \u201cis trying to educate himself about the industry and learn more about it,\u201d and \u201cwants to break into acting and directing/producing.\u201d\n\nHowever, that was also a completely erroneous \u201cquote.\u201d\n\nJustin Bieber Did NOT Ask Adam Sandler For Acting Advice, Despite Claim https://t.co/dLc5ctxUd0 pic.twitter.com/zjSdCb9U3e \u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) October 12, 2017\n\nHere are some of the things Sandler actually did say about the Biebs.\n\nSandler told Entertainment Tonight that hanging out with the 23-year-old superstar bagged him cool points with his daughters, 11-year-old Sadie and 8-year-old Sunny.\n\n\u201cThat was a good thing at home, but he\u2019s a great kid,\u201d Sandler told ET\u2019s Cameron Mathison.\n\nThe 51-year-old added, \u201cHe\u2019s funny as hell and we went out to dinner and had a nice time. He\u2019s really, really a great guy \u2014 just funny and he can sing pretty well.\u201d\n\nSandler then quipped, \u201cDid you know he sings and dances? I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBad reporting is commonplace in entertainment news. Much of it is highly exaggerated and/or fabricated. Typically, the aim is attracting clickbait to sites and newsstands.\n\nIn recent weeks, false media stories claiming Bieber had given interviews to two UK tabloids about Ed Sheeran and Simon Cowell were also debunked.\n\nGossip Cop, the reliable rumor-watchdog website, reported that Justin did not give any interviews to the tabloids in question, shortly after the offending outlets removed the made-up interviews from their sites.\n\nOther recent false Justin Bieber-media stories alleged the Grammy winner has been banned from renting properties in Beverly Hills.\n\nHowever, that claim was also revealed to be fake news.\n\nThe best advice? Always consider the source before believing a story.\n\n[Featured Image by KGC-138/STAR MAX/IPx/AP Images]", "images": ["http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Justin-Bieber-Adam-Sandler-help.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b911717e2a01903d946c8f1136c6928f?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Page Mackinley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/opinion/4545022/adam-sandler-confirms-justin-bieber-didnt-ask-for-acting-advice-says-singer-is-funny-as-hell/", "title": "Adam Sandler Confirms Justin Bieber Didn\u2019t Ask For Acting Advice, Says Singer Is \u2018Funny As Hell\u2019 [Opinion]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
