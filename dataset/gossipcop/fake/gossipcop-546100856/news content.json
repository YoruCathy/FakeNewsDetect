At the Hollywood premiere of Duhamel's new movie, Scenic Route, on Tuesday, Aug. 20, the 40-year-old actor said they were packed and ready to go to the hospital at a moment's notice.\n\n\"We do have a bag ready but just not here,\" he told Us. \"So he's going to have to wait. He's going to have to wait until next week.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Fergie and Josh's wedding album\n\nThe star also spoke recently about how well his wife had been handling her first pregnancy. \"I'm mostly impressed with how gracefully\u2026I mean she's just been awesome throughout this whole thing,\" he gushed on Aug. 15. \"She's taken really good care of herself, she's happy, she's in great spirits, she looks beautiful and I'm just really proud of her more than anything. And I'm really excited to meet this little dude. I can't wait.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity pregnancies\n\nThat said, he's not sure he's entirely ready for how much his life is about to change.

I thought that I was ready for this, and I'm a little bit terrified. I'm excited and terrified, because I am responsible for this little thing. Forever.\"", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1377793219_fergie-josh-duhamel-zoom.jpg?w=200&h=113&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1377793219_fergie-josh-duhamel-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1377793219_fergie-josh-duhamel-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Takeda"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/fergie-gives-birth-to-baby-boy-with-husband-josh-duhamel-2013298/", "title": "Fergie Gives Birth: Singer, Josh Duhamel Welcome Baby Boy Axl Jack", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Josh Duhamel's wife Fergie gave birth to the couple's first child, a baby boy, on Aug. 29", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fergie, Josh Duhamel Welcome Baby Boy!
