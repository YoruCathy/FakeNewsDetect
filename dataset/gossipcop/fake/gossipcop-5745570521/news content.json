OK! Magazine is reporting that the \"Wildest Dreams\" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.\n\nThe tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.\n\nThe source said, \u201cTaylor was so young when they dated, she wasn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship, but now she\u2019s showing Jake how much she\u2019s matured. She\u2019s excited to see where things go.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.\n\nAn unidentified source told Star magazine that, \u201cHe said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor\u2019s new number. They\u2019ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.\"\n\nThis would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.\n\n\u201cThis guy walks in who is a friend of my ex\u2019s and starts talking about how he\u2019s heard we\u2019re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together \u2014 just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, \u2018This is what we\u2019re writing,\u2019\u201d she once revealed to GMA.\n\nThe lyrics in the track said: \"I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.\"\n\nIn the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.\n\nSince Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was \"no truth\" to the report.\n\nDo you think Taylor should get back together with Jake?
