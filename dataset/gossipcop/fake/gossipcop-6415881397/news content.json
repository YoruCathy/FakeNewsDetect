I was like, that was fast!\u2019\n\nVanessa Kirby and Tom Cruise had to kiss for a scene (Pictures: ABC/PA)\n\nThe 30-year-old was referring to reports she was \u2018in line to be wife number four\u2019 when she said: \u2018We were filming on the river bank in Paris, and we have to kiss, and then the paparazzi [were] taking pictures.\u2019\n\nBut Vanessa and Tom haven\u2019t even had spoken about the awkward rumours yet.\n\n\u2018It was embarrassing. Most of all for him probably,\u2019 she said.\n\nTom Cruise seen kissing Vanessa Kirby during a scene for \u2018Mission Impossible 6\u2019 in Paris (Picture: SIPA USA/PA)\n\nBut Vanessa isn\u2019t always facing embarrassment moments as we can only imagine she was pretty chuffed to win a Bafta Award just last month in the supporting actress category for her portrayal of Princess Margaret,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer win, which gave Netflix its first ever TV Bafta, came after Claire Foy \u2013 who plays the Queen \u2013 lost out on the leading actress prize to Molly Windsor.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nCollecting her prize Kirby said: \u2018To Christine and Luke Windsor, and to my family. Claire, my sister, the best sister ever, apart from my real ones.\u2019\n\nThe actor quickly thanked her real sisters after the room erupted in laughter.\n\n\u2018No, but I actually do want to dedicate this to my sisters, Boo and Anna, because I couldn\u2019t have done a second without them,\u2019 she said. \u2018I played Scotland the Brave on bagpipes nonstop at home when I was trying desperately to get into character. So, they were there utterly through it.\u2019\n\nThe star also gave a tribute to the real-life princess, who passed away in 2002: \u2018So actually this is for Margaret, wherever she is.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
