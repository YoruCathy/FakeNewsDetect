Sofia seems smitten.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious she looks up to Scott,\u201d said another source. \u201cShe constantly giggles around him. They are very flirty.

Everything everyone has been telling her to look out for, she\u2019s now starting to see for herself. It\u2019s really upsetting for her, but she is trying to work through it.\u201d\n\nBut the tensions in the relationship didn\u2019t seem to last long, with the couple being spotted on vacation in Mexico days later.\n\nLater that month, the model opened up about her relationship on the red carpet at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation Patron of the Artists Awards in Beverly Hills, telling E! News that her father had been \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their relationship.\n\n\u201cI am into her business and she\u2019s trying to keep me out of her business,\u201d added Lionel, 68.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very cool. He\u2019s very supportive, whatever that means,\u201d Sofia said as Lionel jokingly pointed a gun-shaped hand gesture at his head.\n\nOfficial Debut\n\nDisick and Sofia made their official debut as a couple in December at a party for DuJour magazine, arriving together at the Confidante Hotel in Miami.\n\nAlthough Sofia posed solo on the red carpet, the lovebirds were seen \u201cchatting and kissing throughout the night,\u201d sources told PEOPLE.\n\nImage zoom Andrew Toth/Getty\n\nThe couple coordinating their looks \u2014 she in a body-hugging, long-sleeved black mini dress and he in black pants and a black button-down exposing his chest.\n\nThe two also made an appearance at Art Basel, where they were followed by a camera crew that filmed their every move, including their PDA.\n\nAn onlooker told PEOPLE that the couple was affectionate throughout the night, sharing cell phones to take photos.

Instead, they all stayed close to Scott,\u201d a source told PEOPLE of the dinner. \u201cIt was a short dinner. Scott and Sofia were not affectionate. The kids seemed fine with her, but all sat close to Scott.

It made me laugh. I liked Hershey and he liked Hershela, so it was like a middle ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted the dog for a while, but he ended up surprising me with it,\u201d she added.\n\nFamily Vacations\n\nThe following month, Sofia and Disick hit another milestone in their relationship: In late March, they took a vacation with his three kids, flying to Cabo San Lucas via private jet, where they stayed at the luxury Chilean Bay resort & residences.\n\nA source told PEOPLE they were \u201chaving fun in the sun\u201d and spent time \u201cswimming in the pools and enjoying the resort.\u201d\n\nRomantic Gestures\n\nIn late April, Sofia took to Instagram to show off Disick\u2019s latest romantic gesture, sharing a photo of him posing on a bed with rose petals in the shape of a heart.\n\nBirthday Boy\n\nTo celebrate Disick\u2019s 35th birthday on May 26, the couple flew to St. Barts with his three kids.\n\nRELATED: Scott Disick Gets Birthday Foot Massage from Girlfriend Sofia Richie: \u2018Could Be Worse\u2019\n\nSofia wished her man a happy birthday with a photo of the two getting cozy in the water.
