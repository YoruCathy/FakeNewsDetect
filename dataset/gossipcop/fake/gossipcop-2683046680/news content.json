Kim has allegedly made the decision to file for divorce from Yeezy and is \u2018ready to move on\u2019 with her life, according to a new report.\n\nUPDATE: A rep for Kim exclusively reveals to HollywoodLife.com that this report is \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d \u2014 Original report: Kim Kardashian, 37, will allegedly be filing for divorce from Kanye West, 40, Life & Style reports, adding that \u201cit\u2019s officially over\u201d between the power couple. \u201cShe is ready to move on with her life,\u201d an insider tells the mag. After Ye\u2019s 2016 hospitalization, where reports claimed he suffered a mental breakdown, the source says that things only got worse with his \u201cerratic behavior.\u201d Upon his release from UCLA Medical Center [back in Nov. 2016], Kanye\u2019s felt \u201cspied on,\u201d by Kim, which has caused him to come distant, as reported by the mag. \u201cKanye will go days without talking to her. He\u2019s hot and he\u2019s cold. Even their sex life isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d\n\nThe mag goes on to report that Kanye is hiding dark secrets, that only Kim knows about. Around the time of his hospitalization, he told Kim about his alleged drug use, which involved both liquid and traditional marajuana among other substances, a second source claims. Despite Kim\u2019s rep denying the divorce report, Life & Style still continues to report that the couple is struggling. The mag claims that Kanye doesn\u2019t trust anyone and that the pair has recently been fighting over him spending time away from Kim and the kids \u2014 North, 4, and Saint, 1. Kimye are also expecting their third child together, via surrogate, as Kim has been vocal about issues with her past pregnancies. The source adds that \u201cKim was hoping this baby would bring them closer, but it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKim and Kanye recently jetted off to Utah for a weekend getaway for her 37th birthday; a trip that mag claims was a \u201cbust\u201d because Kim was bored the entire time, despite Ye\u2019 loving it. Ultimately, \u201cshe\u2019s tired and she\u2019s done with this marriage,\u201d the insider says. \u201cKanye makes it very difficult for her. She loves being a mother, but she wants it all and Kanye can\u2019t give that to her\u2026 Kim definitely wants out of the marriage.\u201d The mag also claims that even with a third child on the way, Kim is set on her alleged decision to leave Ye\u2019.\n\nKim and Kanye have yet to address the divorce reports. The pair looked happier than ever at her 37th birthday dinner with her friends and family on Oct. 26. Ye\u2019 sang \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to Kim, with the rest of her loved ones, and she documented the entire night. And, the countless, loving videos didn\u2019t hint at a split if you ask us!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you really think Kimye are splitting?", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-reportedly-divorcing-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F11%2F01%2Fare-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorcing-split-break-up-baby-number-3%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2852424&comment_count=4", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-reportedly-divorcing-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/01/are-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorcing-split-break-up-baby-number-3/", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Reportedly Divorcing Weeks Before Baby #3 Arrives", "meta_data": {"description": "Kim has reportedly made the decision to file for divorce from Kanye West and is 'ready to move on' with her life.
