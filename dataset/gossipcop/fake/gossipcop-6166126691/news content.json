And hers is this:\n\nKaty Perry is a cannibal who attends private dinner parties in Hollywood where the guests dine on human flesh.\n\nSo here's what you need to know before making your mind up. According to leading theorists, the \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" singer opened up about her cannibalism in an interview \"on French radio\" earlier this year.\n\nNo one's been able to find audio of the interview, but several sites have picked up wild-ass quotes that they attributed to her.\n\ngod damn katy perry is a fuckin cannibal\u2026 go find that article cause that lady needs help \u2014 beardgaud (@gsmg23) November 2, 2017\n\nThey quote the singer as having said people in Hollywood say human meat is the best meat, but its \u201cgotten a bad rap\" because of \u201csqueamish Christians and their hypocritical virtues.\u201d\n\nWhile you might think this is bullshit, or I know Katy Perry, did you also know she started her career as a Christian country singer before reinventing her image to attract the masses? Country Taylor is shaking!\n\nIn June of this year, the singer told the New York Times she finally \"woke up\" (from\u2026life, I guess?) adding that she intends to reveal her \"true self\" to fans this year. \"The old Katy Perry wasn\u2019t a construct,\" she tried to explain, but \"That was just me, and this is me now.\u201d\n\nMoving on to more evidence! If there were a fan theory about you being a cannibal but you weren't actually a cannibal, would you create a video about you being one? Of course not. But that's exactly what the flesh-eater did this year.\n\nLet me now direct your attention to\u201cBon App\u00e9tit,\u201d where Katy Perry is cooked in a giant, human-sized pot and then served to a bunch of other humans on a plate.\n\nAt one point in the video, the singer even appears to eat a cherry pie stuffed with body parts. She claims the imagery is a metaphor for her own \"sexual liberation\", but we know the truth.\n\nNaturally, her fans think otherwise.\n\nSo I just saw Katy Perry's Bon Appetit video. It reminded me of the evidence submitted in the Cannibal cop court case. \u2014 Piccola stella?? (@Sixcheeks30) August 20, 2017\n\nAll the way back in 2014, another story ran about the pop star where she admitted to wanting to join the illuminati because she finds the idea of joining a cult \"exciting.\" We probably should have listened to her.\n\n\"If the Illuminati exists, I would like to be invited,\" she told Rolling Stone. But maybe she's already part of a cult \u2014 a bigger, more cannibalistic one. Maybe it's filled with other high-profile celebs who come hang out in Katy's mansion to chat about industry news and eat baby legs dipped in hummus or whatever.\n\nMaybe this is where all of her unaccounted for Twitter followers came from because I certainly don't know a single other person following her.\n\nDO YOU THINK KATY PERRY MADE BON APPETIT FOR THE VORE AND CANNIBAL FANDOM? \u2014 eddie (@HlGHOFFHELlUM) May 18, 2017\n\nThe answer has been hiding directly in front of our eyes all along \u2014 she's not even trying to deny it.\n\nInstead, she's been shoving it down our throats.\n\nRelated stories recommended by this writer:\n\n\u25cf \u2018Most followed person\u2019 Katy Perry lost millions of followers in Twitter\u2019s spam account crackdown\n\n\u25cf Katy Perry

Fashion Show\n\n@carolinephinney", "images": ["https://media.thetab.com/blogs.dir/279/files/2017/11/human-person-people-8.jpg",
