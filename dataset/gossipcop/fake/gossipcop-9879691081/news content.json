Kunis\u2019s family came to the US from the USSR with only $250 when she was a child. Portman\u2019s parents, descended from Holocaust survivors, emigrated to the US from Israel for her father\u2019s work as a doctor.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nKunis is brash and sexy \u2014 the black swan to Portman\u2019s swan princess \u2014 and Portman is all grace and quiet strength, shocking the Jewish world with her controversial choice not to accept an award alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTheir love stories are intertwined, as Kunis revealed on Monday on Marc Maron\u2019s podcast \u201cWTF.\u201d\n\nPortman, who after playing Queen Amidalah in \u201cStar Wars\u201d became perhaps the most lusted-after woman in the galaxy, famously fell in love on the set of the 2010 film that won her an Oscar \u2014 \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d Portman and Kunis played rivals in a ballet company, and Portman fell in love with their choreographer and co-star, French ballet dancer Benjamin Millepied, who later converted to Judaism. He and Portman are married and raising two children, Aleph and Amelia.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nOn Maron\u2019s podcast, Kunis divulged that Portman also played a role in her romance with her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, with whom she is, like Portman, raising two Jewish children, Wyatt and Dmitri. Kunis and Kutcher co-starred in the sitcom \u201cThat 70\u2019s Show\u201d for eight years \u2014 Kunis was cast when she was only 14 \u2014 but she says they had \u201cno feelings whatsoever\u201d for each other. Though their characters were romantically involved, leading to plenty of steamy on-screen scenes, \u201cThere was nothing there,\u201d Kunis remembers. \u201cIt was like \u2026 whatever,\u201d she says. They were friends.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nKunis went on to date fellow child star Macauley Culkin for eight years. Kutcher famously wed actress Demi Moore, and the couple eventually filed for divorce, which was finalized after\u2026 eight years of marriage. (See how much weird symmetry there is in this story?)\n\nIn 2011, Kunis was cast in a movie called \u201cFriends With Benefits,\u201d about a man and woman who decide to add a sexual component to their friendship, believing they\u2019ll be able to stay otherwise platonic. Of course, they fall in love. Her co-star wasn\u2019t Ashton Kutcher, which would have been too easy; it was Justin Timberlake.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nIn 2011, Kutcher was cast in a movie called \u201cNo Strings Attached,\u201d about a man and woman who decide to add a sexual component to their friendship, believing they\u2019ll be able to stay otherwise platonic. Of course, they fall in love. His co-star was none other than Natalie Portman.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nOne night, Kunis says, she was backstage at an awards show. She saw an attractive man \u2014 from her vantage point, she could only see his profile \u2014 and began wondering who he was. He turned. It was Ashton Kutcher. She had been admiring the man she\u2019d known for almost 15 years. They began seeing each other.\n\n\u201cWe never dated,\u201d Kunis said. \u201cWe hooked up.\u201d Kunis was starring in a movie about casual sex with friends. Kutcher was doing the same. \u201cWe lived out our movies,\u201d she said. (Really makes you wonder what she does when she\u2019s in movies about crime.)\n\nAny romantic-comedy fan knows exactly what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\nThe affair lasted three months, then something shifted. Kunis began to have feelings for her longtime friend. \u201cI walked up to him, and I was like, \u2018You know what? I actually care about you, and I don\u2019t want to mess anything up, so I\u2019m just going to walk away before it becomes too much,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\u201cThe next day, he showed up to my house, and he was like, \u2018Move in with me,\u2019\u201d she remembers.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nAnd so she did.\n\nWhy did it take so long for the photogenic couple to come together?\n\nKunis says it had to happen the way it happened. \u201cWe would have never been together if we didn\u2019t both go through what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we met,\u201d she says. \u201cReconnected I should say \u2014 not met.\u201d\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nJenny Singer is the deputy lifestyle editor for the Forward.
