Must be the liver cancer,\" cried the masses in unison.\n\nWe guess the folks at NW can skate by on a technicality here, as Johnny Depp will almost certainly not live forever, and is thus dying, in a sense.\n\nBut if we know Johnny -- and we don't -- he'll be shambling across the stage like the reanimated cadaver of his idol Keith Richards long after everyone has stopped caring or paying attention.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--YoHqp3PL--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1528125637/johnny-depp-in-russia.jpg"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--YoHqp3PL--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1528125637/johnny-depp-in-russia.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-hiding-deadly-disease-from-fans/", "title": "Johnny Depp: Hiding Deadly Disease From Fans?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/06/johnny-depp-hiding-deadly-disease-from-fans/", "title": "Johnny Depp: Hiding Deadly Disease From Fans?", "description": "Recent photos of Johnny Depp have left fans concerned.
