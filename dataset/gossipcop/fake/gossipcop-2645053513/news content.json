Marvel vs DC: It\u2019s on!\n\nThor Odinson, who also goes by the name of Chris Hemsworth, has \u2018threatened\u2019 not to come on TV host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show after latter revealed himself for the treacherous person he is, someone who sides with team Batman. Chris Hemsworth also challenged Jimmy Kimmel to find \u201canother Avenger named Chris.\u201d It seems Kimmel, a mortal and surely not a superhero, is stuck in this altercation of superheroes and he had to choose sides. It all started with Ben Affleck, who plays Batman in DC\u2019s film universe, and when he quoted a \u2018news\u2019 report stating that Matt Damon has replaced Ben Affleck with Chris Hemsworth as his new best friend. Is there going to be a battle between the God of Thunder and the Dark Knight?\n\nAffleck said to Hemsworth that he can have Damon, and that he is team Jimmy Kimmel \u2018anyways\u2019. \u201cHey @chrishemsworth, you can have him! I\u2019m Team @JimmyKimmel anyways,\u201d he said.\n\nTo which Kimmel replied, \u201cWow. Another big win for #TeamBatman! Sorry Matt, I\u2019m sure this is a Thor thubject. #Iwilltakeeveryoneyoulove.\u201d\n\nThor, the short-tempered guy he is, replied, \u201cHey @jimmykimmel sounds like you\u2019ve chosen your side. Guess I\u2019m not coming on your show this week. Good luck finding another Avenger named Chris.\u201d Oh, Thor had also replied to Ben Affleck, saying, \u201cSorry mate not my fault! He\u2019s just a big @Marvel fan, not @DCComics. How do you like them apples \ud83d\ude18. @jimmykimmel the ball is in your court. Choose wisely\u2026\u201d\n\nWow. Another big win for #TeamBatman! Sorry Matt, I\u2019m sure this is a Thor thubject. #Iwilltakeeveryoneyoulove \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) April 21, 2018\n\nSorry mate not my fault! He\u2019s just a big @Marvel fan, not @DCComics.\n\nHow do you like them apples \ud83d\ude18. @jimmykimmel the ball is in your court.

Good luck finding another Avenger named Chris. https://t.co/I01PB03QGw \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 21, 2018\n\nThis is just the latest chapter of the age-old rivalry between Marvel and DC that began in the early 1940s. It is doubtful we will ever see any crossover between Marvel and DC in films, but it has happened in comics and not surprisingly those comics sold really well, but even Twitter banter is better than nothing.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War releases on April 27.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
