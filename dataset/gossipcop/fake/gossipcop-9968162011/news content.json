{"url": "www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/angelina-jolie-cover-story", "text": "Jolie and Pitt, who\u2019d been together for 12 years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in Hollywood, split last September. She filed for divorce suddenly \u201cfor the health of the family,\u201d according to her lawyer, and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children, three of whom are adopted (Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara), three of whom are biological (Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox). Things had been rocky for some time, but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane, where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between Pitt and Maddox. When they touched down, Jolie went home with the kids, effectively kicking him out. This was no \u201cConscious Uncoupling.\u201d An anonymous phone call was made to authorities. The F.B.I. and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services began investigating Pitt for child abuse. He was soon cleared and later said in an interview with GQ Style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem.\n\nThere were rumors he was having an affair with Marion Cotillard (denied by both Pitt and Cotillard). Jolie got the early jump P.R.-wise. But Pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in GQ Style. The two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce.\n\nAs for Jolie, a life already bursting at the seams\u2014with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women\u2019s rights at the London School of Economics\u2014just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she\u2019s now doing it alone. There\u2019s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day\u2014playdates, doctors\u2019 appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. And there\u2019s the deeper, emotional chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s just been the hardest time, and we\u2019re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we\u2019re all trying to do our best to heal our family.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. Jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung\u2019s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung\u2019s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other Cambodians, a quarter of the country\u2019s population. Shot entirely in Cambodia, and in the Khmer language, the film, a Netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several Cambodians who\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country\u2019s history, a history that\u2019s still difficult for Cambodians to discuss. But if Cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it\u2019s surely a thank-you gift. For Jolie, Cambodia is where she started her family, and it\u2019s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e461bd71e4b33f10349/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-opener.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e19b5f53c646c2dea5e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss08.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e18b5f53c646c2dea5a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss05.png", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e19b5f53c646c2dea5c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss07.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e6d7c67a060584ba8f8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e1790225743bcad6788/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss02.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978ba1d7c67a060584ba972/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss09.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/597667f81bd71e4b33f10351/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a-angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss03.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e18fe060e64db80eb3f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e181bd71e4b33f10347/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss04.png", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54579cbeb8745bb176802731/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/vf-cover-angelina-jolie-12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58d972d8993c7e7c827eb7ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-interview-about-future.png"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evgenia Peretz", "Evgenia Peret", "Mert Alas", "Marcus Piggot", "Jessica Dieh", "Janine Di Giovann", "Hilary Weave"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/angelina-jolie-cover-story", "title": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s Vanity Fair Cover Story", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Evgenia Peretz", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "There\u2019s the Angelina Jolie who\u2019s now a single mother\u2014managing the day-to-day chaos of six kids, and the trauma of her split from Brad Pitt\u2014and there\u2019s the Angelina Jolie whose latest movie, a groundbreaking Netflix original about Cambodia\u2019s genocide, is also a thank-you to the nation that transformed her.
