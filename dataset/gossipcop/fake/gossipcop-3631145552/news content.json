Get EXCLUSIVE details.\n\nJay-Z, 48, has been thinking about showcasing his talents in other things like acting, but after Beyonce, 36, had to stop an actress from hitting on her man at a previous event, she\u2019s not too keen on the idea! \u201cJay knows exactly where his money comes from and that is in music but as a entrepreneur he wants to dive into many other things in business and would love to even step more into acting,\u201d a source close to the couple EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cBut what ends up happening in acting is you have the chance of having a love interest and with Jay\u2019s wandering eye the one thing Beyonce doesn\u2019t want is to give him options. So if it was up to Bey, and she certainly tells him, she\u2019d rather have him stick to music because you can\u2019t hook up with a microphone.\u201d Woah! It sounds like Bey definitely wants Jay all to herself. After being together for almost 15 years and sharing three children together, we don\u2019t blame her!\n\nBeyonce may be feeling cautious, but the two lovebirds have seemed to be enjoying their time together and recently took an early Valentine\u2019s Day trip to Miami, where they got cozy on a yacht. Bey and Jay have both been open about their marital troubles in the past and Jay even admitted to cheating on Bey during a rough time. After going through a rocky road, it\u2019s no surprise that Beyonce would be weary of any women having to get close to her hubby, but it\u2019s good to see the hip-hop royals still going strong as lovers and parents.\n\nBey proved to be a devoted wife when she was by Jay\u2019s side at the Grammy Awards on Jan. 28. Although they both looked amazing, their daughter, Blue Ivy, 6, was the one who stole the spotlight that night due to her sassy side telling her parents to calm down after clapping. We can\u2019t help but love this family and we can\u2019t wait to see what they get up to next!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about Beyonce\u2019s cautions with Jay-Z?
