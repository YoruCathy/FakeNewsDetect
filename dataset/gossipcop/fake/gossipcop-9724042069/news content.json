Here\u2019s what went down between them at Serena Williams\u2019 wedding.\n\nCelebrity feuds have a way of bringing us all together (while tearing famous relationships apart). Whether you\u2019re Team Kimye or not, we can all agree that we\u2019ll be here for whatever drama these stars find themselves in. And hoo boy, do we have some drama to discuss today! As we know, Kanye has beef with JAY-Z, 47, and by association, Beyonce, 36. As we also know, Kim Kardashian, 37, will always stand by her 40-year-old husband and it just so happens that Kim and Beyonce ran into each other for the first time since their husbands started fighting. Kim and Bey came face-to-face at Serena Williams\u2018 wedding and it was just as awkward as you expected it to be.\n\n\u201cBeyonce seemed to avoid Kim at Serena\u2019s wedding however they did have an uncomfortable exchange while at the glitzy party,\u201d an eyewitness at the wedding tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt was very awkward because they have all these good friends in common like LaLa and Ciara who are tight with Beyonce who were also at the wedding. Serena did not seat Kim and Beyonce next to one another so it took a while for the pair to bump into each other. The incident took place near one of the open bars inside the event and both Kim and Beyonce were totally light, polite and cordial. They said hello and asked how each other was doing but not much else. They were smiling but the exchange def looked a bit cold and icy. It was clear that whatever issues they have between them, they were not going to get into it at the wedding. They pretty much avoided each other the rest of the night.\u201d\n\nBey and Kim were standing at the VIP bar together at Serena\u2019s wedding to Alexis Ohanian on Nov. 16, onlookers told E! News. They ordered glasses of champagne before celebrating their friend\u2019s big day. Kim wore a long, black dress that made her look exactly like an hourglass. Bey rocked a long-sleeved green gown for the formal occasion. Luckily, they appeared to put aside whatever issues they may have with one another to honor the tennis all-star\u2019s special day. Neither of their husbands were in attendance \u2014 and that\u2019s probably for the best.\n\nThe JAY-Z and Kanye fallout started an entire year ago when the \u201cFamous\u201d rapper stopped a show in Sacramento, CA to go on a rant about his supposed friends. A video of him rambling was posted to Twitter, where you could clearly hear him saying, \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, I was hurt \u2019cause I heard that you said you wouldn\u2019t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \u2018Hotline Bling,'\u201d before adding, \u201cIn my opinion \u2013 now don\u2019t go trying to diss Beyonce \u2013 she is great. Taylor Swift is great.\u201d See, I told you Taylor would come up. Calling Beyonce \u201cgreat\u201d in the same way that he called Taylor Swift, his Public Enemy #1, \u201cgreat\u201d was clearly meant as a diss toward the Lemonade star.\n\nHe then went on to publicly tell Jay-Z to give him a call and talk to him, \u201clike a man.\u201d JAY-Z later responded to the fallout on TIDAL\u2019s Rap Radar podcast, where he spoke openly about how Kanye\u2019s actions hurt him. So basically, Kim and Kanye are no longer tight with Jay-Z and Beyonce. And suddenly that Taylor Swift lyric, \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only friend you\u2019ve lost lately. If only you weren\u2019t so shady,\u201d from her notorious new Kanye diss track \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things, has started to make a bit more sense, huh?\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about Kim and Beyonce\u2019s run in?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F11%2F17%2Fbeyonce-kim-kardashian-meet-up-serena-williams-wedding-jay-z-kanye-feud%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2875903&comment_count=14", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-awkward-run-in-serena-williams-wedding-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-awkward-run-in-serena-williams-wedding-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-awkward-run-in-serena-williams-wedding-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/17/beyonce-kim-kardashian-meet-up-serena-williams-wedding-jay-z-kanye-feud/", "title": "Beyonce & Kim Kardashian Had An \u2018Icy\u2019 Exchange At Serena Williams\u2019 Wedding", "meta_data": {"description": "Beyonce and Kim Kardashian met up at Serena Williams' wedding.
