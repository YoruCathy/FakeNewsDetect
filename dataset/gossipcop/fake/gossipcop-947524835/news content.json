Without much in the way of fanfare, one of the TV industry\u2019s most challenging obstacles has been cleared: consumers have mastered the art of accessing the wealth of content sitting behind the notorious \u201cinput button.\u201d\n\nAccording to recent streaming meter data from Nielsen, consumers in homes with over-the-top (OTT) capabilities spend one out of every 10 minutes of TV usage with OTT platforms or apps. Whether they\u2019re accessing this content through a variety of interfaces or one of many skinny bundles of local and national content, consumers are growing more accustomed to OTT as a primary \u201cinput.\u201d\n\nAs all insiders know, this button\u2014an often misunderstood piece of remote control real estate\u2014unlocks a wide range of content for consumers with an array of devices. Historically, that content has fallen outside the scope of traditional audience measurement and monetization. Today, that\u2019s no longer the case. Nielsen has introduced new technologies over the past two years to better understand over-the-top media consumption and allow new ways to market to interested consumers.\n\nSo how do advertisers, content owners and broadcasters already well positioned in the linear TV environment take advantage of where audiences are growing? Luckily, there are some strategies to utilize this change for the better.\n\nGo Where the Party Is\n\nLocal broadcasters have recognized the growth of OTT viewing, and many have taken aggressive steps to create their own apps and include their channel lineups in new skinny bundles offered by familiar and new names alike.\n\nWhen YouTube TV is advertised on nearly every backstop and billboard during the World Series, consumers are going to notice. As a content provider, ensure you reach this audience, or others will fill the void.\n\nDon\u2019t box yourself into traditional advertising or content delivery paradigms\n\nThrough consumer adoption of smartphones, both advertisers and content providers learned you can\u2019t maximize consumer engagement and marketing by simply repurposing the same product and ad models. OTT, like mobile, has the benefits of two-way data that drives precision in targeting and delivery. Advertisers can use OTT to go wide for broad branding campaigns and hypersegmented to motivate consumers to drive purchases.\n\nFor content providers, making different advertising options available combines the best of both worlds: the breadth of interest in high-quality content and improved outreach capabilities.\n\nTrack success and demonstrate value in OTT\n\nAdvertisers can\u2019t assess the merits of OTT if viewing isn\u2019t measured. According to Nielsen measurement, 11% of all viewing minutes in OTT-capable homes is going to these services, and the percentage is even higher among younger audiences. Teenagers ages 12-17 spend a quarter of their time on OTT-enabled TVs using streaming services, while young adults from 18-24 spend almost one in every five minutes with them.\n\nEnsuring that all viewing and ad exposure can be verified by a trusted source\u2014regardless of whether it\u2019s distributed broadly or selectively\u2014will be the difference between \u201ctoe in the water\u201d investments and long-term success.\n\nWith OTT, long-term is key. Amazingly enough, OTT seems to be just getting started; low-cost smart TVs and OTT devices have flown off the shelves this year. As features and capabilities expand\u2014and service providers diversify and expand their offerings\u2014the players that find their footing through early trials and experimentation will prove themselves to be the winners.\n\nThis article originally appeared on AdWeek.", "images": ["http://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/youtube-footer@2x.png", "http://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/twitter-footer@2x.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/usflagicon.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/n-square@2x.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/04/jeff-wender.jpg?w=1110", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/baseball-diamond-full-widthj.jpg", "http://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/newsletter-icon@2x.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-dotcom/dist/images/location-menu-submit.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/full-width-image-millennials-with-media.jpg", "http://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/fb-footer@2x.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/n-tab@2x.png", "http://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/in-footer@2x.png", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/Total-Audience-Feb-2020-seo.jpg", "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/open-graph-default.png", "http://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/rss-footer@2x.png"], "top_img": "https://www.nielsen.com/wp-content/themes/nielsen-base/dist/images/open-graph-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2018/perspectives-why-you-need-a-comprehensive-ott-strategy/", "title": "Why You Need a Comprehensive Over-The-Top Strategy.
