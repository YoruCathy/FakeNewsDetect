Gossip Cop can debunk this report. Pitt is committed to his sobriety, and was never dating Oxman in the first place.\n\n\n\nBut the Globe wants readers to believe Pitt has \u201csuffered a painful blow to the heart\u201d after Oxman \u201cjilted him for a billionaire.\u201d The magazine contends that \u201cfriends\u201d now \u201cfear losing at love will send\u201d the actor into a \u201cdestructive abuse binge.\u201d The narrative was sparked by Oxman being seen with her boyfriend, Bill Ackman, in Paris last month.\n\n\n\n\u201cBrad still thought things would work out with Neri. So it was a shock when he saw she\u2019s back with Bill,\u201d a so-called \u201csource\u201d is quoted as saying. Maintains the outlet, \u201cNow sources worry the Allied star could fall off the wagon\u2026 Insiders worry the stress of romantic disappointment and his custody war [with Angelina Jolie] could trigger an issue.\u201d Of course, none of these untraceable \u201csources\u201d or \u201cinsiders\u201d are named.\n\n\n\nGossip Cop can\u2019t help but wonder if they\u2019re the same ones that led this publication to falsely allege last month that Pitt and Jolie were \u201ccalling off\u201d their divorce. The tabloid even went as far as claiming they were \u201chot again\u201d after a \u201csteamy, clothes-ripping reconciliation,\u201d and that they\u2019d have a \u201csecond commitment ceremony.\u201d Notably, nothing is said about any of that in this new tale about Pitt\u2019s supposed heartbreak from Oxman.\n\n\n\nThe stories aren\u2019t just inconsistent; they\u2019re also plain wrong. Just as Pitt was never getting back together with Jolie in June, he was never romantically involved with Oxman. As Page Six rightly reported back in April, Pitt and the MIT professor have shared a friendship and nothing more.\n\n\n\nConfirms his spokesperson to Gossip Cop, \u201cThey were only friends.\u201d And Oxman was dating Ackman all along. So the premise that Pitt has been \u201cjilted\u201d is entirely untrue. As for his love life affecting his well-being, \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d reported just last week that Pitt has chosen to focus on fatherhood, not dating. It was specifically noted, \u201cHe spent over a year learning to live a healthier lifestyle and he feels better than ever.\u201d\n\n\n\nConclusion: After wrongly claiming Pitt reunited with Jolie in June, the tabloid is now contending in July that he\u2019s been dumped by Oxman. But according to other outlets and Pitt\u2019s own rep, he and the scholar were never dating. That means this article is based on a false premise. Additionally, while the magazine asserts there\u2019s concerns Pitt is on the verge of a relapse, it was just reliably reported last week that he is feeling \u201cbetter than ever\u201d and has embraced a \u201chealthier lifestyle.\u201d It\u2019s apparent this story is entirely inaccurate.", "images": ["https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/k/knife-322808f87044c4eed4d3f820b0d9d516785eb2db.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/f/flamingo-d55b313720a065a21c500962fe670c6b3474768d.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/i/image001-7.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/b/baby-in-blanket-d9f538e519d4a1a6b0ea54a26a9a8316f1843d15.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye7.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/l/lightning-7027059984b9945d9a0fb63a76cf3a332c79bc2f.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/t/tiger-5117e3f2cb071e456e3d5fc7d5872570741e2150.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/seagulls-32b6c85d8065e4adbb2d87a1bbb9e9a15dc0ab54.jpg", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/f/fighter-jet-081b86e576474c00b187601078a4027476a9c19c.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/z/zebra-6a816e66761bf274817e7d770bc3c715fc9e5cf3.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/c/cat-breaks-into-couples-home-ef4a392f7387557515cfffa911a82ff.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/k/knife-322808f87044c4eed4d3f820b0d9d516785eb2db.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=752720", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
