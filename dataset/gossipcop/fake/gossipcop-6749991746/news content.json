Michael Strahan 'Furious' Alex Rodriguez Stole His TV Spotlight Athlete-turned-host feels 'overshadowed' by baseball great.\n\nTake a seat on the bench, Michael Strahan! Now it\u2019s A-Rod who\u2019s getting all the playing time on TV.\n\n\u201cAlex Rodriguez is everywhere!\u201d an insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com. \u201cMichael is feeling overshadowed \u2014 even though he\u2019s six-foot-five!\u201d\n\nAccording to sources, A-Rod\u2019s goal is to unseat Strahan as the \u201ctop jock\u201d on the tube \u2014 and his ambition has the former football great watching his blind side.\n\n\u201cThey both have massive egos,\u201d the source spilled. \u201cMichael is seething that all anybody talks about is A-Rod.\u201d\n\nThe once-disgraced Yankee All-Star, 43, is FOX Sports\u2019 lead MLB analyst. He also is a judge on \u201cShark Tank\u201d \u2014 and ABC stunned Strahan when they named Alex a contributor to \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d without his input.\n\n\u201cMichael was irate,\u201d a source spilled. \u201cHe immediately felt threatened that Alex is being groomed to replace him.\u201d\n\nOf course, Strahan, 46, should be used to sneaky end-arounds.\n\nIn April 2016, he shocked his \u201cLive!\u201d co-host Kelly Ripa, informing her he was leaving the show for \u201cGMA\u201d mere minutes before they went live.\n\n\u201cHe knows how cutthroat TV can be,\u201d the source spilled.\n\nBut ABC doesn\u2019t seem to care Rodriguez\u2019s reputation is a train wreck compared to squeaky-clean Strahan. Rodriguez was heading for baseball\u2019s Hall of Fame until he was caught using steroids and suspended for the entire 2014 season.\n\nNow, sources report, A-Rod is trying to use TV stardom to rebuild his tarnished legacy \u2014 and doesn\u2019t care who he has to climb over to achieve his goal!\n\n\u201cMichael can\u2019t believe the image renovation Alex has gotten on TV,\u201d the source spilled. \u201cHe used to be hated. Now Michael is telling pals Alex is set to replace him!\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
