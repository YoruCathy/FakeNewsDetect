A new report claims the couple have been putting their realtor to work in the French capital!\n\nWe love Rihanna, 29, and Hassan Jameel together, so we\u2019d be so excited if the couple decided to take their relationship to the next level in the City of Love \u2014 which is what Star reported. The magazine\u2019s sources tell them that the pair are currently house hunting in Paris \u2014 but don\u2019t get your hopes up for the \u201cWild Thoughts\u201d singer to make the move. A source close to Rihanna tells HollywoodLife.com that the report is completely not true.\n\nThe magazine\u2019s source pointed out that \u201cParis is the perfect home base [because] it\u2019s the heart of the fashion world, so Rihanna can work on her Puma collection.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t take into consideration that the \u201cWork\u201d singer has a lot of work she could be doing in the US. Her makeup company Fenty Beauty is about to outsell Kylie Jenner\u2018s and Kim Kardashian\u2018s makeup lines, Kylie Cosmetics and KKW Beauty, our sister site WWD reported. It\u2019s an impressive feat considering the makeup company only launched in Sept. 2017 \u2014 while Kylie\u2019s brand is approaching its 2-year anniversary. Rihanna is \u201cfocused on her career first and foremost\u201d right now, a source previously told us, so it would make more sense for her to stay put and continue growing her immensely successful (and inclusive!) beauty brand.\n\nIf you need further proof that RiRi\u2019s makeup game is beyond strong, look no further than the celebs who\u2019ve been using the products. On Jan. 30, Jennifer Lopez, 48, wore the new Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Plush Matte Lipstick in Saw-C, an \u201cexotic tangerine\u201d shade while promoting her show World Of Dance in Los Angeles. Rihanna tested, JLo approved!\n\nThis also isn\u2019t the only rumor that\u2019s been circulating around the couple lately. After her killer performance at the 2018 Grammy Awards, fans were quick to suspect that Rihanna was pregnant with Hassan\u2019s child. But the rumors aren\u2019t true. \u201cShe\u2019s not pregnant, and she\u2019s not even trying to get pregnant either at this point,\u201d a source told HL. Case closed.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what\u2019s your favorite project that Rihanna\u2019s worked on?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rihanna-hassan-moving-in-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F31%2Frihanna-hassan-jameel-moving-paris-house-hunting-together%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2973028&comment_count=3", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rihanna-hassan-moving-in-ftr1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rihanna-hassan-moving-in-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/31/rihanna-hassan-jameel-moving-paris-house-hunting-together/", "title": "Are Rihanna & Hassan Jameel Moving In Together?
