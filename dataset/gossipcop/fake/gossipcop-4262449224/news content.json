I had so much of it that I didn\u2019t know what it was like to be without it.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was incredible because it was forced humility. Previously, I would\u2019ve looked at humility as more of a negative thing.\u201d But that humility, he said, \u201cgave me time to grow.\u201d\n\nOn opioids, medication and liposuction\n\n\u201cI was drugged out,\u201d Mr. West said on TMZ, about the period preceding his hospitalization. \u201cI was on opioids. Two days after I got off of opioids, I\u2019m errrrrr \u2014 I\u2019m in the hospital.\u201d He said he had been prescribed the pills after undergoing a liposuction procedure. \u201cI had plastic surgery because I was trying to look good for y\u2019all,\u201d he told the staff of the gossip outlet. \u201cDidn\u2019t want y\u2019all to call me fat, so I got liposuction. And they gave me opioids.\u201d\n\nMr. West said he went from taking two pills a day after the surgery to taking seven, but that he was no longer on as much medication. \u201cThese pills that they want me to take three of a day, I take one a week maybe, two a week. Y\u2019all had me scared of myself, of my vision. So I took some pills so I wouldn\u2019t go to the hospital and prove everyone right. We are drugged out! We are following other people\u2019s opinions. We are controlled by the media. And today it all changes.\u201d\n\nOn racism\n\nMr. West began a diatribe on race by citing new lyrics. \u201cI got this rap that says: Parents are the strippers/strip they kids of their confidence/teach white dominance/question your common sense/I\u2019ve been washed in tradition, now I\u2019mma rinse/hopped off the Amistad and made \u2018I\u2019m a God.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe went on to explain that the conversation about putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill \u201cwas the moment that I wanted to use Bitcoin,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s like when you see all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don\u2019t you show us \u2014 put Michael Jordan on a $20 bill.\u201d\n\nIn reference to Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X, he added: \u201cMan, I know this is going to cause an uproar, but certain icons are just too far in the past and not relatable and that\u2019s what makes them safe.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/arts/music/2016summer_jam15/2016summer_jam15-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/arts/02kanyeinterview/merlin_137562693_d29efbc8-3850-46e1-a298-b524ff009eb2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/arts/02kanyeinterview/02kanyeinterview-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/arts/02kanyeinterview/02kanyeinterview-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli", "Reggie Ugwu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/arts/music/kanye-west-charlamagne-interview-tmz.html", "title": "What Kanye West Said About Slavery, Obama and Mental Health in His New Interviews", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-05-01T21:23:55.000Z", "modified": "2018-05-02T19:37:26.000Z", "section": "Arts", "tag": "Charlamagne Tha God", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005878054, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/2b938f74-a7cb-579b-9171-f3f0dcdb357d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/97459b562186479787cb41c22f2560d1", "description": "In a 105-minute sit-down with Charlamagne Tha God and an appearance at TMZ, the rapper addressed everything from racism to his fraught relationships with two presidents.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/arts/02kanyeinterview/02kanyeinterview-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Joe Coscarelli and Reggie Ugwu", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/arts/02kanyeinterview/02kanyeinterview-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Rap and Hip-Hop,Yeezy,Kanye West,The Life of Pablo,Charlamagne Tha God", "pdate": 20180501, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/arts/music/kanye-west-charlamagne-interview-tmz.html", "type": "article", "title": "What Kanye West Said About Slavery, Obama and Mental Health in His New Interviews", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/03/arts/02kanyeinterview/02kanyeinterview-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "In a 105-minute conversation filmed at Kanye West\u2019s California home on April 18, the rapper spoke about controversies, aspirations and regrets.
