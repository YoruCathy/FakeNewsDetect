Discussed refugee crisis, South Sudan and prevention of sexual violence in conflict,\" the archbishop had captioned the pictures.\n\n\"She needs a bra. Looks like she could poke someone's eye out. How embarrassing!\" a shocked viewer wrote on Twitter. Another user mockingly asked the archbishop to maintain his focus, \"Eyes up, Archbishop!\" the tweet read.\n\nOne of the angry tweets branded her \"shameless\" while another furious tweet said: \"Angelina Jolie is a trick ass ho in this pic. You are meeting religious figures, wear a goddamn bra.\"\n\nJolie met the Archbishop to discuss topics such as sexual violence, the refugee crisis and South Sudan. However, on social media at least, the focus was on her clothing \u2014 a full-sleeved grey sweater and an ivory-pleated skirt.\n\nPrivilege to welcome UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie.

Secretary General's Special Envoy on Refugees, Angelina Jolie Pitt, is one that has been extraordinary,\" he said.\n\n\"What she said just now sums up so beautifully the issues we are facing, and puts it so precisely in terms of the challenge that there is. It's wonderful that she has committed her time, her energy, and has taken great personal risks in order to be able to speak authentically as to what she's done.\"\n\nTake a look at some of the reactions on Twitter to Jolie's meeting with the archbishop below:\n\nSHAMELESS ANGELINA JOLIE GOES BRALESS ON A MEETING WITH ARCHBISHOP OF\u00c2 CANTERBURY https://t.co/8WgEntSPsR pic.twitter.com/enJIwAX8Aq \u2014 BaronessJMedia&Event (@Baronessj) March 17, 2017", "images": ["https://g.ibtimes.co.uk/www/img/home/ibtimes-logo-scroll.png", "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1600151/angelina-jolie.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1600151/angelina-jolie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sutrishna Ghosh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/angelina-jolie-branded-shameless-by-angry-fans-she-goes-braless-meet-archbishop-canterbury-1612325", "title": "Angelina Jolie branded 'shameless' by angry fans as she goes braless to meet Archbishop of Canterbury", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Author": "Sutrishna Ghosh", "news_keywords": "Celebrity,Angelina Jolie,Angelina Jolie nude,Angelina Jolie braless,Angelina Jolie photo,Archbishop of Canterbury,Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby,Angelina Jolie and Archbishop of Canterbury,refugee crisis,sexual violence,South Sudan", "description": "The UNHR special envoy met the Anglican leader to discuss issues of sexual violence and the refugee crisis.", "article": {"author": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/reporters/sutrishna-ghosh", "section": "Celebrity", "tag": "Angelina Jolie braless", "published_time": "2017-03-18T07:06:56+00:00"}, "og": {"title": "Angelina Jolie called 'shameless' on Twitter as she goes braless to meet Archbishop of Canterbury", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/angelina-jolie-branded-shameless-by-angry-fans-she-goes-braless-meet-archbishop-canterbury-1612325", "site_name": "International Business Times UK", "image": {"identifier": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1600151/angelina-jolie.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1600151/angelina-jolie.jpg"}, "description": "The UNHR special envoy met the Anglican leader to discuss issues of sexual violence and the refugee crisis."}, "fb": {"app_id": 133405490194030}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IBTimesUK", "creator": "@IBTimesUK", "title": "Angelina Jolie branded 'shameless' by angry fans as she goes braless to meet Archbishop of Canterbury", "description": "The UNHR special envoy met the Anglican leader to discuss issues of sexual violence and the refugee crisis.", "image": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1600151/angelina-jolie.jpg"}, "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "robots": "index, follow", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,ibtimes.co.uk,newsweek.com,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk", "com.silverpop.cothost": "pod6.ibmmarketingcloud.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489820816.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk", "summary": ""}
