In a 2017 appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel asked Chopra if the Met Gala appearance together meant they were dating. Chopra explained to Kimmel, \"We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. It was fun ... We were on the same table and we know each other, so we were like, 'Hey, you know what, let's go together.' And I was like 'OK, let's go together.' It ended up just working out.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live on YouTube\n\nAs Chopra mentioned on Jimmy Kimmel Live, she and Jonas knew each other before attending the Met Gala. According to the Indo Asian News Service in December 2017, Jonas reportedly said in a statement in December 2017, \"[Chopra and I] met through a mutual friend, who she did Quantico with \u2014 this guy Graham \u2014 and we met up like, in New York the first time, and the same day I think we found out that we were both going to the Met Gala with Ralph Lauren.\" Graham could likely be Graham Rogers, who starred in Quantico with Chopra and the film Careful What You Wish For with Nick Jonas.\n\nJonas' also said in his statement to Indo Asian New Service that he would like to visit India one day. He said in the statement:\n\n\"I've never been (to India). But I'm dying to go and I have now heard from Priyanka, my new friend a lot about it. Just given me a lot of names of place to go if I go there ... \"And as strange as it sounds but we couldn't have planned it [the Met Gala]. We just had a great time. She's a lovely person and I'm dying now to go to India.\"\n\nAnd now, according to several news outlets, it looks like Jonas is visiting India with Chopra. Whether or not Jonas' sweet Instagram story is definitely confirming their relationship, it seems like Jonas and Chopra are having a great time together.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/6/23/13a1f921-3d7a-4b2f-a566-f24ceb4b3091-screenshot_20180623-082623_instagram.jpg?w=646&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/6/23/f9e3bc76-970d-499f-9ec3-c15630c17e69-getty-678060068.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/15/37f4f60e-5d87-4523-9a7d-39f782b3c0e4-getty-1209799355.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/6/23/f9e3bc76-970d-499f-9ec3-c15630c17e69-getty-678060068.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/15/0301616f-a32f-413e-9fef-efe48242f292-getty-537759406.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/17/436a4d24-0503-4050-a54f-0367f1974937-getty-919969056.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/4/17/39520c21-3afd-488a-968d-c3a389c49a76-a22ba8ea-8478-485b-bd12-e0d831859033-getty-1205125763.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/6/23/f9e3bc76-970d-499f-9ec3-c15630c17e69-getty-678060068.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopras-relationship-is-reportedly-instagram-official-fans-are-loving-it-photo-9563691", "title": "Nick Jonas & Priyanka Chopra's Relationship Is Reportedly Instagram Official & Fans Are Loving It \u2014 PHOTO", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopras-relationship-is-reportedly-instagram-official-fans-are-loving-it-photo-9563691", "type": "article", "title": "Nick Jonas & Priyanka Chopra Just Became Instagram Official & Fans Are LOSING It", "description": "It turns out there may have been some truth to all the rumors about Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's relationship.
