She was amazing! Such a wonderful lady and so beautiful! It was such an honour to finally meet her. To have a Queen like that is great.\"\n\nAlthough Trump was apparently happy to meet with the matriarch, many in the UK were not.\n\n100,000 protestors flooded London's Trafalgar Square to object to the president's visit.\n\nAccording to CBS, it was the largest weekday protest the city has seen in 15 years.", "images": ["https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3405?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-made-big-royal-faux-pas-when-visiting-the-queen-2018-7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3405?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3404?width=1200&format=jpeg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b4c5f5142e1cc6e312a3404?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/trump-made-big-royal-faux-pas-when-visiting-the-queen-2018-7", "title": "Trump made one of the biggest royal faux pas when visiting the Queen \u2014 and people are outraged", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Trump made one of the biggest royal faux pas when visiting the Queen \u2014 and people are outraged", "date": "2018-07-16", "news_keywords": "The Queen, Royal Family, Donald J.
