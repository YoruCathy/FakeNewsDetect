Here\u2019s how he\u2019s supporting her amidst Wendy\u2019s continuous disses!\n\nKylie Jenner, 20, is basking in the joy of being a new mother, but when she hears about Wendy Williams, 53, and her constant verbal attacks on her relationship with Travis Scott, 25, it\u2019s hard not to get a bit frustrated. Wendy has stood by her prediction that Travis will eventually leave Kylie and the baby to live the partying lifestyle of a successful rapper. Before baby Stormi Webster was born on February 1, Wendy predicted that Travis would leave Kylie to raise the baby on her own. However, Travis hasn\u2019t done that, and he doesn\u2019t plan to, a source tells HollywoodLife.com. He\u2019s sticking by Kylie\u2019s side, and proving Wendy wrong.\n\n\u201cKylie is getting the last laugh in her feud with Wendy Williams thanks to Travis,\u201d the insider says. \u201cKylie\u2019s not being petty and dwelling on it but yes, she\u2019s pretty thrilled that Travis is proving Wendy and all the haters wrong. Don\u2019t forget, Wendy said some pretty nasty things about how Travis was going to abandon Kylie and Stormi and that has not been the case at all.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s been the compete opposite. \u201cHe\u2019s been so solid,\u201d the source continues, adding that Travis is \u201cthe best dad and Kylie could not be happier. \u2014 She\u2019s falling more in love with him every day.\u201d\n\nThroughout Kylie\u2019s pregnancy, Wendy taunted the young star on her show. She remained adamant about her opinion that Kylie would be a single mother, even before giving birth. \u201cAt 20-years-old being pregnant, and I don\u2019t care how much money you have, it\u2019s got to be hard,\u201d the talk show host said on her January 24 show. \u201cThe next reality show in the works right now might be, I got a name for you, \u2018Kylie Goes It Alone\u2019 because Travis Scott is not sticking around,\u201d she proclaimed while laughing at a photo of the rapper. \u201cAnyway, he\u2019s not sticking around,\u201d she said, once again.\n\nNonetheless, the couple is still going strong. In fact, Kylie and Travis celebrated Stormi\u2019s one-month birthday on March 1, with both parents gushing over their bundle of joy on social media. First, Kylie took to Snapchat to show off the massive bouquets of pink flowers Travis had sent her in honor of Stormi\u2019s one month in their lives. Then, both parents showed off photos of Stormi \u2014 the most we\u2019ve seen of the little one \u2014 despite hiding her face in the snaps. Kylie also showed off her 4-week post-baby boy, aka her flat abs, on Snapchat.\n\nKylie and Travis welcomed a healthy baby girl, Stormi \u2014 who was 8 pounds, 9 ounces \u2014 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 1. Kylie didn\u2019t reveal she was pregnant or that she gave birth until February 4 when she released an 11-minute video with never-before-seen footage from her entire pregnancy. Since then, she\u2019s returned to her normal social media use after taking a 9-month hiatus from the spotlight to enjoy her pregnancy in private. The news of Kylie\u2019s pregnancy broke in September 2017.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F02%2Ftravis-scott-helping-kylie-jenner-feud-wendy-williams-relationship-stormi%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3017597", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kylie-jenner-vs-wendy-williams-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kylie-jenner-vs-wendy-williams-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/02/travis-scott-helping-kylie-jenner-feud-wendy-williams-relationship-stormi/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Vs Wendy Williams: How Travis Scott Is Helping Her Get Revenge In Their Feud", "meta_data": {"description": "As Kylie Jenner's feud with Wendy Williams rages on, Travis Scott is helping Kylie in the best way!
