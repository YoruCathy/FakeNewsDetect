Cotillard, who is expecting a baby with partner Guillaume Canet (who also directed Rock'n Roll), utilized Instagram's new photo gallery feature so as not to flood fans' feeds.\n\nThe successive posts tie Rihanna's record of 18 selfies in a 24-hour period, which the singer had posted in celebration of the Crop Over festival in her native Barbados in 2015.\n\nA post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:10pm PST\n\nA post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:11pm PST\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Cotillard's reps for comment.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marion-cotillard-gets-lip-injections-movie-role-983945", "title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off 'Rock'n Roll' Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marion-cotillard-gets-lip-injections-movie-role-983945", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off 'Rock'n Roll' Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off 'Rock'n Roll' Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marion-cotillard-gets-lip-injections-movie-role-983945", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off 'Rock'n Roll' Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "sailthru.description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "sailthru.author": "Sam Reed", "sailthru.vertical": "Style", "sailthru.date": "2017-03-07 11:06:39", "sailthru.tags": "Style,Style News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488855999.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
