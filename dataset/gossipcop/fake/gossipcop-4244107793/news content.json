The movie stars Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson as two best friends that have planned every aspect of their weddings since childhood. After they both get engaged and work out their wedding plans, a few problems arise\u2026.after all\u2026it\u2019s a movie called \u201cBride Wars\u201d. Anyway, what follows is two best friends that decide to go to war over their dreams. Here\u2019s the official synopsis:\n\nLiv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) are best friends who since childhood have planned every detail of their respective weddings. At the top of their bridal \u201cmust have\u201d list: a ceremony at prefix = st1 ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags\" / New York \u2018s ultimate bridal destination, the Plaza Hotel.\n\n\n\nNow, at age 26, they\u2019re both about to get married; they\u2019re about to realize their dreams; and they\u2019re about to live happily ever after.\n\n\n\nOr maybe not\u2026\n\n\n\nWhen a clerical error causes a clash in wedding dates \u2013 they\u2019re now to be married on the same date! \u2013 Liv, Emma and their lifelong friendship are put to the ultimate test. Liv, a successful lawyer who is used to getting what she wants, including the perfect job and the perfect man, won\u2019t settle for anything less than the perfect wedding she has dreamed of for years. Emma, a schoolteacher who has always been good at taking care of others, but not so much in looking after herself, discovers her inner Bridezilla and comes out swinging when her own dream wedding is imperiled.\n\n\n\nNow, the two best friends who\u2019d do anything for each other, find themselves in a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners struggle that threatens to erupt into all-out war.\n\nAnyhow, recently I attended a press conference with the two stars and they each talked about making the movie and a lot more. As always, you can either read the transcript or listen to the audio by clicking here. Again, \u201cBride Wars\u201d opens this Friday at theaters everywhere.\n\nQuestion: What did you guys do physically to get ready for this movie?\n\n\n\nKate: We didn\u2019t eat for weeks. [Laughs] Well, I\u2019m always doing something. I\u2019m either dancing or doing pilates or biking or running. I\u2019m quite active.\n\n\n\nAnne: Yes you are! [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: So, for this movie, we were actually doing a lot of drinking.\n\n\n\nAnne: Yes, we did. We developed beer biceps.\n\nQ: Drink any tequila?\n\n\n\nAnne: Kate, forever and always.\n\n\n\nKate: I\u2019m a tequila girl. We like our champagne, though, too.\n\n\n\nAnne: We do. Kate\u2019s amazing. Kate\u2019s inspiring, in terms of all of the physical activity that she engages in. We would have script meetings and she would be stretching. I\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going to touch my toes next year. It will be fine.\u201d And so, I work out with a trainer in New York.\n\n\n\nKate: You worked out pretty hard, though.\n\n\n\nAnne: I did. Well, I really wanted Emma to appear like an ex-ballerina. I wanted everything to be tight and proper and sinewy, so I really watched what I ate. Just the usual stuff. Whatever the character needed, that\u2019s what we did.\n\nQ: The guys you have in the movie were gung-ho to just have a double wedding, but you wouldn\u2019t have had a movie, if that happened. In your real lives, if the situation were similar, would you have just had a double wedding?\n\n\n\nKate: Yeah. I would have thought it would be more fun, it would be a bigger party, and there would be a bigger ballroom. In real life, I probably would have been like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I want to get married. Go ahead.\u201d But, then again, there\u2019s that little part of you that\u2019s like, \u201cNo, it\u2019s my one day!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnne: And, I think you would also want your friend to have that day as well. You want it for yourself, but you\u2019re also like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be diluted in my joy for you.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have a double wedding. Economically, absolutely, it\u2019s fantastic. But, psychologically, I think you\u2019d always be kinda pissed.\n\n\n\nKate: It would be kinda weird if one of the groom\u2019s vows were better.\n\n\n\nAnne: The competition would be horrible.\n\n\n\nKate: If Fletcher\u2019s vows were better than Daniel\u2019s vows, that would feel weird.\n\n\n\nAnne: Fletcher\u2019s vows would never be better than Daniel\u2019s vows. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: You\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, that kinda sucked!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnne: Maybe you would read too much into it. I think a double wedding would cause you to analyze it too closely and read too much into it. You\u2019d have an immediate comparison. That being said, if anybody here has had a double wedding, I\u2019m sure it was lovely.\n\nQ: What are your plans for this holiday season? Particularly given the economic state we\u2019re in, what sort of gifts will you be giving?\n\n\n\nAnne: I\u2019m doing a lot of research right now on cool gifts for under $50. The Real Simple magazine has an amazing gift guide right now. You have to see it. It\u2019s so good. It makes me feel like a successful human being, when I actually do some of the stuff in that magazine. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: The crafts, like the card making?\n\n\n\nAnne: One year for Christmas, I actually made everybody ribbon board.\n\n\n\nKate: Are you serious? That\u2019s a good idea!\n\n\n\nAnne: I made it, but it was terrible. I couldn\u2019t find the bunting, so it didn\u2019t actually work with any cards. I just included a little bag of festive thumbtacks. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: That\u2019s really funny!\n\n\n\nAnne: I\u2019m a willful crafter, but I\u2019m kind of a C student when it comes to crafts. Like everyone, I\u2019m going to be making a lot of gifts. My family has a price cap on things. We always give money to the Heifer Project, so I think we\u2019re going to be focusing on that.\n\n\n\nKate: I\u2019m still shopping. [Laughs] It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s a really weird time. I think everybody\u2019s feeling it. In terms of the holidays, Christmas has always been a big holiday for our family. We\u2019ve always been pretty crafty anyway. We all knit. The girls knit. I\u2019m going to be in Colorado . We\u2019re going to ski, like we always do. My son is skiing now. He started last year. He started his school, and it was the same school I went to when I was his age. I went in to pick him up from it, and I brought my skis. I went in a little early \u2018cause I wanted to go out there with my skis and maybe play with him a little, and I thought he\u2019d be on the little bunny hill. I said, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ryder?\u201d and I started panicking a little bit because I couldn\u2019t see him anywhere. And, the person came over and said, \u201cWell, actually he\u2019s up on the mountain,\u201d and I went, \u201cUp on the mountain?\u201d [Laughs] So, I went over to the base of the mountain, I\u2019m standing there in my skis, and I look up and, all of a sudden, I see this little kid in camouflage and I\u2019m like, \u201cNo.\u201d [Laughs] He was just zooming down the mountain, and I started to cry. I grew up skiing, and then to see my kid ski, there\u2019s a freedom in it. There\u2019s a freedom in that, that you recognize in them, and a confidence that your kids start to get when they do things like that. That was a big little moment. So now, he\u2019s going to be a terror, so the helmet is on and I\u2019m going to put those rubber things on the bottom of his skis, so that he doesn\u2019t go too fast. [Laughs]\n\nQ: How old is he?\n\n\n\nKate: He\u2019s going to be 5 in January. It\u2019s crazy!\n\nQ: Earlier this year, you referred to this film as Estrogen Land , with Get Smart being Testosterone-ville. How is the weather in Estrogen Land , and how does that vibe on set inform characters for you?\n\n\n\nAnne: The weather in Estrogen Land usually inspires a very cozy feel. Precipitation is unexpected, but constant. Anyway, I\u2019m not going anywhere with that. It was delightful. I\u2019m really not a girly girl, in the slightest. I found my best girlfriends a little bit later on in life. My best friends growing up were my brothers, and I always had a lot of guy friends, particularly gay men. So, for me to actually be around women all the time and give into the shoe love, [was new for me]. I always judged myself and was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s frivolous!\u201d And now, I\u2019m just like, \u201cNo, there\u2019s nothing wrong with it.\u201d Kate turned me on to Net-a-Porter.com, and I was just looking at it between takes. I was just like, \u201cYeah, I really do like clothes.\u201d So, it was great to realize that I\u2019m still myself, but I can be girly as well. It\u2019s been a nice little stay.\n\n\n\nKate: You didn\u2019t learn that in The Princess Diaries?\n\n\n\nAnne: No. I fought it, all the way.\n\n\n\nKate: That\u2019s the girliest movie of all time. Every little girl wants to be a girl because of that movie.\n\n\n\nAnne: I never wanted to be a princess, so I was focused on my character\u2019s psychological torture, at that time. She had to accept an identity that she wasn\u2019t ready for. I missed the point. [Laughs] It\u2019s actually been really nice to be in this movie and be around such strong female energy and to find that so liberating. When I grew up, I had this idea that I would be defined by a way that I\u2019d be uncomfortable with, and I\u2019ve actually been made much better because of it. I\u2019m much stronger and more open and more loving and more compassionate. This movie was really good for me, in that way.\n\n\n\nKate: It was an interesting time for all of us. Especially in the age we\u2019re both in, you\u2019re going through so many transitions and, for some reason, being around women, you become empowered by your girlfriends and by other women that you learn from, which is what the movie is about, having those friendships. Poor Gary Winick. He was the one man. It was all girls. The producers and executives were all females, and the stars of the movie. He was just surrounded by the ladies. And, when you get a lot of girls in a room, watch out. It\u2019s a powerful energy. And, this movie felt really good for that. We were all going through these amazing coming out parties. It was really interesting. It was fun.\n\nQ: Can you talk about the bachelorette party scene and the dance-off?\n\n\n\nAnne: All good comedy is painful and horrifying to actually do. But, I felt very protected by my character\u2019s drunkenness, so I knew that, if it didn\u2019t quite turn out the way that I\u2019d hoped, [that it would be okay] because I did project onto it. I really wanted to be a good dancer, but I am not a good dancer. Watching the movie is hard for me because I\u2019m just like, \u201cI\u2019m trying really hard, and I just look silly and drunk.\u201d [Laughs] But, on the day, it was just hysterical. It was fun. The fact of the matter is that we had a great cast to work with and, that day, we had a lot of background artists in that scene and everybody was really into it and was giving so much. It just felt fun. My favorite part of the scene got cut out of the movie. At the end of it, I run up to Officer Not-Your-Husband and I did a handstand at his feet and wrapped my legs around his head and then pulled myself up, and then he grabbed my butt and I opened my legs wide into a V, and I say, \u201cBook me!\u201d Doing that, take after take after take, felt so good. This movie did stretch some of my boundaries.\n\n\n\nKate: I was so scared when you were doing that. I was so terrified that you were going to go right over his head.\n\n\n\nAnne: And, I nailed it every time!\n\n\n\nKate: I was sitting there going, \u201cShe\u2019s going to wipe out. I can\u2019t watch this!\u201d [Laughs] But, she did it, and she never did.\n\n\n\nAnne: Kate has great faith in my physical abilities.\n\nQ: Will they put that on the DVD?\n\n\n\nKate: There\u2019s a lot that should be on this DVD. We had a lot of good outtakes on this movie. We also have some behind-the-scenes footage that we did, that\u2019s kind of funny. The DVD extras should be rated R. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nAnne: When we made the movie, we never knew where we wanted the humor to be, so we did raunchy versions of jokes. I think very few of the raunchy ones wound up in the movie, and probably for the best.\n\n\n\nKate: The DVD will be really funny.\n\nQ: A lot of people will enjoy this movie, but some people may feel that it perpetuates the negative Bridezilla stereotype. What would you say to those people?\n\n\n\nAnne: When I got the script, that was what I anticipated, and I was really sensitive to that. I just thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in making a movie that is reductive to women, in the whole process.\u201d So, I was so happy, when I read the script, that the movie takes the tact that the Bridezilla thing doesn\u2019t have a lot to do, in our movie, with actually getting what you want and being the center of attention. That\u2019s the myth that plays into, at least, my character\u2019s consciousness. But, what it actually does is bring her to a new place of freedom, where she\u2019s admitting to herself that she wants more for herself and she wants better for herself. And, that leads her to make an incredibly difficult, but ultimately wonderful decision to take control of her life and be more present and be more demanding and to set boundaries with people and to be stronger and more confident. So, to those people that believe we perpetuate a stereotype, I say, \u201cCome to see the film. If you disagree with us, I will answer the strongly worded letter that I\u2019m sure you will write.\u201d But, we were super-sensitive to that, in the beginning. Kate and I are both strong women that want to do everything we can to make sure that every woman feels strong, so we would never do anything that would set women back.\n\n\n\nKate: As producer of the film, in developing this, when it came as a pitch, it was like, \u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe this movie hasn\u2019t really been made.\u201d The more I thought about it, I realized it\u2019s because it\u2019s so easy to pit women against each other and get carried away with the cattiness and the pettiness of the stereotypes of how women handle lots of situations. For me, I looked at it as a challenge. I thought, \u201cWait a minute. This is such a great thing for women to be able to make fun of themselves.\u201d We are a little guilty of going a little crazy sometimes and getting stressed out, and I think women are great at being self-deprecating and making fun of themselves, but we don\u2019t get the opportunities, as a female comedian, to do that, that often. There aren\u2019t really that many female-driven comedies. So, in developing it, I felt that there was a way to try to make a movie that is appealing to all ages of women, that doesn\u2019t leave anybody out and, at the end of this wild, funny thing that we can all relate to a little bit or feel is a little bit accessible, is about friendship and honoring your friends and the importance of having those people in your life. None of these things matter, if you don\u2019t have your girls. That was the trick. That was really hard, and we really worked hard on that, especially Gary, who I have to say did such a great job of making this movie have that real emotional undertone that took me by surprise, the first time I saw the first cut. That was the one thing I was most concerned with. And, it really did make me go, \u201cOkay, I want to go call my girlfriends.\u201d That\u2019s why we made the movie. I hope women will appreciate that.\n\n\n\nQ: Kate, what makes Daniel a keeper for Liv, and what\u2019s the perfect guy for you?\n\n\n\nKate: I don\u2019t know yet. I don\u2019t know what the perfect guy is yet. I do know that I like honest guys. That always gets me going. I like guys who are really up-front and just are who they are. They\u2019re hard to find.\n\n\n\nAnne: Yes, they are. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: What I liked about the guys in this movie, and what I liked about the relationships that we both have, which are so different, is that it [was unexpected]. Liv would be the expected one to be divorced in two years, whereas Emma would probably be the one who people would think would have this long, lasting relationship, and go through the worst possible times and just still be married. So, we liked playing that Liv actually found somebody who could deal with her and knew how to handle her. And, Emma needed the person in her life who allowed her to look at herself and go, \u201cYou know what? I need something else and something different.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne: Because Liv knows exactly what she wants and who she is, she needed to find someone who found her adorable. He probably prefers her when she\u2019s being herself and happy, but also finds her messiness when she\u2019s stressed out great, and he gets it and accepts it. Because Emma is, in some ways, having a latent rebellion, she needs someone who is going to want her to be happy above all, and wants her to explore every part of herself, and is willing to accept whatever she finds. And, they each do find that, in their own way. The sad thing about Emma is that Emma is that person that marries for keeps. Once she got married, she would have stayed married through anything. That\u2019s kind of sad because she really would have been unhappy with Fletcher.\n\n\n\nKate: If this movie is successful and we thought about doing another one, we talked about how much fun we would have, thinking about where our characters go. [Laughs]\n\ncontinued on page 2 \u2014\u2014\u2013>\n\n||SPLIT||\n\n\n\nQ: Would it be Child Wars?\n\n\n\nKate: Totally! It would be Baby Wars. It would be great! We could go so many different ways with Emma.\n\n\n\nAnne: We really could. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: That would be so fun!\n\nQ: Why is there so much emphasis placed on a woman getting married? Do you think there\u2019s too much emphasis?\n\n\n\nKate: We love love. We love relationships. I would never be cynical about people wanting that day and being excited about that day. I think there\u2019s a reason for it. It\u2019s your day to present yourself to your man, to throw this party that\u2019s about wanting to spend the rest of your life with somebody, and bringing everybody together. The idea of the ceremony is great. The reality of the ceremony becomes stressful. I think the emphasis on marriage will always be important for people, no matter what kind of marriage they choose, whether it\u2019s getting hitched on the top of the Himalayas with just the two of them, or having a 300-person wedding. I feel like people always want that ceremony. When we all sit around and have coffee or drinks, the first thing we talk about is kids, and then we talk about our relationships and love and loss, and drama in love. It\u2019s such a big topic for us. So, I think celebrating it will always be something that people will emphasize.\n\nAnne: To be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t know. [Laughs] I don\u2019t know because I don\u2019t, personally, feel any pressure to get married. I don\u2019t feel it from my family, I don\u2019t feel it from my friends and I don\u2019t feel it from within, so I don\u2019t really know how to answer that question. But, I\u2019m not everyone. I don\u2019t know if there is a pressure on women to get married, or if it\u2019s something that women put on themselves, or if it\u2019s the way things have been done and we\u2019re not yet in a new moment where things have transitioned into people accepting that anything goes and you can do whatever you want. I think there is something to be said about living the happiest life possible, but the only way that you can live a happy life, specific to yourself, is if you are yourself. And, if you\u2019re the sort of person that never wants to get married, never get married. Who cares. And, if you\u2019re the sort of person that really loves the idea of being committed to someone and having that piece of paper that says that you are committed to someone, and celebrating with either a huge party or a quiet party, go for it. Just be yourself. The important thing to note, though, is moreso than whether or not women feel pressure to get married, I think we need to work on making it possible for everyone in America to get married.\n\nQ: When crossed, are women meaner to each other than men?\n\n\n\nAnne: I love that everybody thinks we have all these answers. [Laughs]\n\n\n\nKate: I don\u2019t know because I grew up with all boys, and so did Anne.\n\n\n\nAnne: It\u2019s hard to say.\n\n\n\nKate: You know what, yeah. I think so. Because women are a little bit more complicated, I think women can really hit you where it hurts.\n\nQ: With a knife or a gun?\n\n\n\nKate: No, that\u2019s men. Men go right for the shins, whereas I think women can be more hurtful because we\u2019re more emotional. But, I don\u2019t know.\n\n\n\nAnne: Being mean is awful. I do believe that female friends can be worse to each other than male friends, simply because, for whatever reason, women have a stronger emotional language. We\u2019re encouraged more to use that. Kate and I know things about each other that I don\u2019t know about my male co-stars and, if Kate and I were to turn on each other, because I know how to celebrate her, I would also know how to bring her down, and she would know the same for me. When you give that trust to someone, that is what you\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nKate: It\u2019s so true! We talk. Girls talk about everything.\n\n\n\nAnne: We talk about what we\u2019re feeling about deep things. Maybe they\u2019re not even particularly deep, in the grand scheme of things, but they\u2019re things that matter to us. So, when you give someone that power, you\u2019re showing them where your buttons are. If you pick wrong, and someone turns around and short-circuits those buttons, I think it hurts more.\n\n\n\nKate: When you go through relationships, all of a sudden, you realize, \u201cGod, boys don\u2019t have anybody to talk to. That must really be horrible.\u201d They just don\u2019t talk about their feelings with each other. They talk to their girlfriends. My guy friends call me and they\u2019re like girls. They\u2019re like, \u201cHey, can you talk?,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, sure!,\u201d and they\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m having problems with my girlfriend.\u201d They talk to their girls, but they don\u2019t talk to boys about it. They really don\u2019t. My brothers talk to me, but they don\u2019t talk to their friends.\n\nQ: Can you talk about working with Candice Bergen, who has played some pretty strong female characters, in her career?\n\n\n\nAnne: We were just totally in awe of her. I would look at her and get emotional. I kept just wanting to thank her for so much. And, she\u2019s still so fabulous. She\u2019s so quick. When I get shy around people, especially around people that I deeply respect, like Candice and some of the other actresses that I\u2019m privileged enough to work with, my instinct is to hang back and just observe them. Just watching her and the way she takes in the environment and the way she plays with a line, she could clearly just relax and enjoy the ride and be herself, and that would be enough, but she really cares. She would show up every day and explore. To see that kind of passion in someone, of any age, was inspiring, but particularly to see someone, like Candice Bergen, who is such a powerful woman, and means so much to so many women, like us, was really cool.\n\nQ: Is there a particular moment on this that stands out for you?\n\n\n\nKate: Probably when we were so tired and we were on the floor with our torn up wedding dresses. That\u2019s my favorite shot in the movie. We were lying there, looking at each other, and we were there for hours. At one point, we were on our sides and we were just talking, lying on the floor. That was probably my most memorable moment because you don\u2019t get to work with girls, this closely, very often. It\u2019s always with a guy.\n\n\n\nAnne: One of the things that I\u2019m just so excited about with this film is that, so often in films that we\u2019ve been in, there\u2019s the main character and then there\u2019s the quirky best friend that you never really get to know, who comes in with the great one-liner. To have two complex female characters, who are best friends, at the center of a movie, I haven\u2019t really seen that before. So, anytime we were in those scenes where we got to go deeper, and there wasn\u2019t that formula in place in the script, I was feeling something new, as an actress, for the first time, because I have never been in a situation like that. And, Kate was just there, every time, listening and going deeper with me. There wasn\u2019t one specific moment. There were so many. Just to get to return to those scenes, again and again and again, it shouldn\u2019t be rare, but it really is. I remember that, and I\u2019m really appreciative of it.\n\n\n\nKate: We did the end at like four in the morning, for the wedding scene where we\u2019re both crying. It was so late and I remember, as a producer, they\u2019re like, \u201cCan we get to you last?,\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201cSure, we can do that scene last.\u201d I did that whole scene at 4:30 or five in the morning, after being up all day. We were doing it and I was at that place where I was like, \u201cOkay, I could go right to sleep, right now. I could just curl up and go to bed.\u201d Our characters had been fighting that day and doing so much stuff, and we did the scene. I was in it and I was getting a little teary-eyed, and I looked at Annie and she was getting teary-eyed, and I was like, \u201cI love being girls!\u201d [Laughs] We were right there for each other, and that\u2019s what the movie is about. There were a lot of good moments. Annie is the best because she\u2019ll be like, \u201cI have this idea!,\u201d and I\u2019d be like, \u201cOkay, what?,\u201d and she\u2019d say this idea and then be like, \u201cOkay, it was a really bad idea!\u201d\n\n\n\nAnne: I\u2019d be like, \u201cThere is something good in there. Let\u2019s pick it apart.\u201d\n\n\n\nKate: Annie is the first one to do that. It was so great! It was so funny.\n\n\n\nQ: What did you relate to, and what didn\u2019t you relate to in the script?\n\n\n\nAnne: I\u2019ve never really thought about my wedding. So, I think part of the reason why I was drawn to the script was because here was a girl that I had no relationship to. I didn\u2019t understand that concept of identifying with yourself as a bride, before it had occurred to you to identify with yourself as a woman, as far as the bride specific thing. But, I did know what it was like because I thought of myself, I guess, as an actress. I really wanted that when I was a kid. And so, I developed that, and assumed that I would develop as a person aside from that, and that didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s taken a lot of work to figure out who I am and what I want, aside from what it is that I\u2019ve put in my head, and to be here in reality and not just living the dream that I wanted, and accepting that things are different and far more interesting than they were when I thought of them when I was 8, and just accept that. That was wonderful. I identified with that kind of desire in my character \u2014 that process, and the hunger for that process. And then, [I understood] the female friendship. It\u2019s beautiful, powerful and scary to mean so much to someone. It\u2019s so fun, but also so much responsibility, in the best possible way. I was so happy because, in the script, and I hope I\u2019m not speaking out of turn by revealing this, but we didn\u2019t figure out that ending until just before. We always knew that there was a piece missing, and we couldn\u2019t quite figure it out. We were just talking, and Kate told a story, and we all burst into tears because the point of the story was that, as much fun as marriage hopefully is, and as much as we all want to find that one person that fulfills us, and not exactly have the fairy tale, but be able to rely on that person, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s a sad, sad, sad fact, but whatever happens in your life, in the great moments, the bad moments and the unexpected moments, there\u2019s always going to be someone there, refilling your wine glass, giving you a shoulder to cry on, picking you up and celebrating with you, and that\u2019s your girlfriend. We didn\u2019t find that message in the movie until much, much, much later. And then, as soon as we did, it all made sense. That\u2019s what I related to fully, and that\u2019s when I fully, fully, fully gave in to it.\n\nQ: Do you mean that scene where you come back from Hawaii ?\n\n\n\nAnne: No, the final monologue about how weddings are great and the dream is great, and it\u2019s so much fun, but don\u2019t . . .\n\n\n\nKate: Conceptually, that\u2019s what it was. But, when we sat down, we were talking about trying to fix the end of the movie. We all sat around, and I told this story about my mother. Basically, my brother was getting married, and we had this bridal shower for my sister-in-law, and my mom made this speech, and she said, \u201cI want all the girls to look around the room and, even if you don\u2019t know each other, even if you\u2019re just getting to know each other, or even if it\u2019s your sister, I want you to remember one thing: trust me. Men, they come and go. They always will. Hopefully, they stay. But, it\u2019s the girl that\u2019s sitting next to you, or the girl that\u2019s sitting across from you, that\u2019s going to get you through everything.\u201d My mom is filled with all these little wisdoms like that. That\u2019s really important \u2014 that idea of not losing sight, no matter where you go in your life with men, because women give a lot to men. We love relationships. We thrive in them, as we should. But, sometimes, you lose sight of the girls that are there for you, all the time, which we shouldn\u2019t hold against any of our friends. I have a girlfriend right now, who\u2019s off and running with somebody, but we\u2019re always there [for each other]. When she\u2019s ready to pick up the phone and go, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d we\u2019re all there. And, that\u2019s what the movie\u2019s about. And so, when we sat around and talked about that, that\u2019s where we came up with that end, because it\u2019s hard to tie these types of movies together and have something that makes you feel something emotional, and that makes all the other crazy stuff worth it.\n\nQ: Kate, what did you or didn\u2019t you relate to, with your character?\n\n\n\nKate: I feel like, just creatively, I\u2019m constantly watching other people. I have so many friends that are all so different, and all things are different to other people. So, I could relate to a lot, whether it\u2019s me that\u2019s like that, or my best girlfriend. I\u2019m so not like Liv, so I based the whole hair thing after my one girlfriend, who is in the hair salon like two times a week. She won\u2019t dip her foot in water because her hair might get frizzy. That, to me, is Liv. I can\u2019t relate to that, but I can because I know somebody who\u2019s like that, and it cracks me up. But, in terms of weddings and stuff, I can relate to it because I like to dress up, I like to have a party, I like to throw parties, I like to bring people together. Look, everybody has their own opinion, as to the sanctity of marriage or what it is they believe. I come from two parents who aren\u2019t married. Well, I come from one parent who ended up not marrying my other parent. I come from a complicated household! So, it\u2019s a little unconventional, how I see marriage, but I can relate to it. I got married, and it was great! It was a blast. Everybody should do it! [Laughs]\n\nQ: Would you get married again?\n\n\n\nKate: You know, possibly. I don\u2019t know. If it\u2019s right. If it\u2019s important to everybody. But, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know who the guy would be yet. It would all depend on what kind of relationship that is, you know?\n\nQ: Congratulations to Anne Hathaway on getting named Best Actress by the National Board of Review for Rachel Getting Married. How do you feel about all that?\n\n\n\nAnne: As I\u2019m sure you can imagine, it\u2019s hugely overwhelming. I\u2019m delighted, but it doesn\u2019t seem real. It seems to be an embarrassment of riches that I supposed I have to learn to get comfortable with.\n\nQ: Anne, can you talk about your role in Alice in Wonderland?\n\n\n\nAnne: I play the White Queen in it, and I think that\u2019s all that I need to say.", "images": ["https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/devs-alex-garland-thumbnail-171x160.jpeg", "https://collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/Collider_Logo_Dark.png", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image__3_.jpg", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image__1_.jpg", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image.jpg", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_poster.jpg", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image__5_.jpg", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image__2_.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/armageddon-ben-affleck-liv-tyler-thumbnail-171x160.jpg", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/justice-league-dark-thumbnail-171x160.jpeg", "https://collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/close-circle-512.png", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image__4_.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1628636477376373&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/peacock-thumbnail-171x160.jpg", "https://collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/Collider_Logo_Light.png", "https://collider.com/images/collider-logo.png", "https://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mad-max-fury-road-charlize-theron-thumbnail-171x160.jpg", "https://collider.com/uploads/imageGallery/Bride_Wars/anne_hathaway_and_kate_hudson_bride_wars_movie_image__6_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://collider.com/images/collider-logo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub"], "canonical_link": "https://collider.com/anne-hathaway-and-kate-hudson-interview-bride-wars/", "title": "Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson Interview \u2013 BRIDE WARS", "meta_data": {"msapplication-square70x70logo": "/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/widetile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/largetile.png", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson Interview \u2013 BRIDE WARS", "description": "Written by Steve \u2018Frosty\u2019 Weintraub Opening this Friday is 20th Century Fox\u2019s comedy \u201cBride Wars\u201d.
