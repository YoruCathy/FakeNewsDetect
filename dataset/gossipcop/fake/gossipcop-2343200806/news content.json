Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt have allegedly been set up by Clooney. Inside their reported late-night hangouts!\n\nQuestion, is it the early 2000s, because a new report claims the gang is back together again \u2014 Jennifer Aniston, 49, Brad Pitt, 54, and George Clooney, 56. Jen and Brad \u201chave been secretly getting together for late-night hookups, and it\u2019s all because of George [Clooney],\u201d Star magazine reports. \u201cGeorge was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angie imploded,\u201d a source tells the mag. \u201cAfter Jen and Justin [Theroux, 46] announced their split, he encouraged Brad to reach out and give their relationship another chance.\u201d Jen and Brad were married from 2000-2005.\n\nThe insider goes on to claim that George has been pressing Brad to reunite with his ex ever since the news broke that she and Theroux had split. George allegedly first facilitated a meeting between the exes on March 3, when he attended a pre-Oscar party with Brad in Beverly Hills. \u2014 And, get this, Jen apparently had a car chauffeur Brad and George to her Bel Air home after that party, the mag reports. \u201cThe plan was to head over to Jen\u2019s place afterward for a nightcap, but, of course, George would just drop Brad off,\u201d the source reveals, adding that Jen was very excited to make things happen that night.\n\nAs for what went down that night? \u2014 \u201cTheir evening together was very relaxed and low-key. They reminisced about the past and had a lot of laughs. It seemed just like old times, but better.\u201d The source claims while the two don\u2019t regret marrying their exes [Theroux and Angelina Jolie, 42], \u201cthey both realized they had a good thing when they were together \u2014 and still do.\u201d\n\nA representative for George has denied Star\u2018s report, the mag admits. However, they still stand by their source, who alleges that that Brad and Jen are ecstatic George reunited them. \u201cJen wants to keep the reunion under the radar, since she went public with her divorce just a few weeks ago, and the last thing she wants is more scrutiny,\u201d the insider says. \u201cGeorge has gotten the ball rolling \u2014 and who knows where it will lead?\u201d\n\nAnd, that remains a mystery as Jen, Brad and George all have yet to address the outlandish report. However, \u201cthis is totally false,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nAniston and Theroux announced their split on February 15 in a joint statement which read: \u201cIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d The pair were together for nearly seven years and married for two and a half years. Aniston and Theroux insist they will remain cherished friends.\n\nAs for Brad and Angie? \u2014 The exes, who split in September 2016, went through a messy divorce and custody battle throughout 2017. However, the pair later decided to seal their court docs to settle their issues out of the public eye. Now, they are in a better place and amicably co-parenting their six children, Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-meeting-in-secret-ftr.jpg?w=620", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F22%2Fjennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-secret-meetings-planned-george-clooney-relationship%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3048334", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-meeting-in-secret-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-meeting-in-secret-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/22/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-secret-meetings-planned-george-clooney-relationship/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt Reportedly Have Secret Late-Night Meetings Set Up By George Clooney", "meta_data": {"description": "Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt are reportedly having secret late-night meetings, reportedly set up by George Clooney!", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt Reportedly Have Secret Late-Night Meetings Set Up By George Clooney", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/22/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-secret-meetings-planned-george-clooney-relationship/", "description": "Is George Clooney the ultimate matchmaker?
