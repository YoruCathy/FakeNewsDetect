However, it doesn\u2019t mean the \u201cFury\u201d star considers the latest ruling a major victory over his estranged wife.\n\nDespite a recent report, Pitt, who shares Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9, with Jolie, has not been partying alongside famous pals like Jennifer Aniston and George Clooney amid his ongoing custody battle.\n\nGossip Cop slammed an article claiming Pitt reunited with Aniston, George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney to throw a surprise \u201ccustody party\u201d following his \u201ccourt victory.\u201d\n\nThe story published by New Idea claims the 54-year-old actor hosted a \u201clavish, over-the-top event,\u201d to honor his friends for their role in helping him get joint custody of the children.\n\nPhoto: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nA spokesperson for Pitt claimed reports of the actor throwing a \u201ccustody party\u201d were false and Gossip Cop noted the current agreement is only in place for the summer months.\n\nJolie still has primary custody of their six children. However, the eldest child, Maddox, 16, is not required to abide by the new arrangement as the court believes he is old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with his father.\n\nFurthermore, Pitt and Aniston reportedly haven\u2019t seen one another \u201cin ages,\u201d and the actor didn\u2019t even attend the AFI Gala on June 7, where Clooney was honored with the Life Achievement Award.\n\nAlthough Pitt hasn\u2019t been partying since negotiating a new custody arrangement with Jolie, those around the star believe the court decision has had a positive effect on him. \u201cHe seems like a better version of the old happy Brad,\u201d an insider told People on Saturday.\n\n\u201cHe looks like he has aged in reverse. You can tell he is taking better care of himself. He also seems very positive about the future,\u201d the source shared.\n\nPitt is expected to film his latest flick, \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d alongside Margot Robbie, Leonardo DiCaprio and other A-list stars over the summer. Thanks to the new custody arrangement in place, when the actor isn\u2019t on set, he will be able to spend his free time with his children.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/small-business-administration-chief-jovita-carranza-has-overseen.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/the-group-tours-istanbul-neighbourhoods-densely-populated-by.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/26/brad-pitt.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2018/06/26/jennifer-aniston.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/03/19/spacex-dragon-has-made-several-resupply-trips-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/president-donald-trump-flanked-by-vice-president-mike.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/wuhan-is-slowly-reopening-after-a-lockdown-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2014/01/21/target-logo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/arinew10.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/02/06/airasias-top-executives-have-stepped-aside-during-an.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/26/brad-pitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-didnt-celebrate-kids-custody-arrangement-jennifer-aniston-george-clooney-2694903", "title": "Brad Pitt Didn\u2019t Celebrate Kids\u2019 Custody Arrangement With Jennifer Aniston, George Clooney", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "brad pitt kids, brad pitt news, brad pitt children, brad pitt and jennifer aniston together, brad pitt and angelina jolie kids, brad pitt george clooney friends, angelina jolie custody arrangement, george clooney wife amal, brad pitt custody battle", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-didnt-celebrate-kids-custody-arrangement-jennifer-aniston-george-clooney-2694903", "title": "Brad Pitt Didn\u2019t Celebrate Kids\u2019 Custody Arrangement With Jennifer Aniston, George Clooney", "description": "Brad Pitt didn\u2019t party with friends to celebrate his new custody arrangement with Angelina Jolie.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/26/brad-pitt.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/26/brad-pitt.jpg", "height": 663, "width": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Cortney Drakeford", "modified_time": "2018-06-26T11:00:28-04:00", "published_time": "2018-06-26T11:00:28-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt Didn\u2019t Celebrate Kids\u2019 Custody Arrangement With Jennifer Aniston, George Clooney", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-didnt-celebrate-kids-custody-arrangement-jennifer-aniston-george-clooney-2694903", "description": "Brad Pitt didn\u2019t party with friends to celebrate his new custody arrangement with Angelina Jolie.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/26/brad-pitt.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "brad pitt kids, brad pitt news, brad pitt children, brad pitt and jennifer aniston together, brad pitt and angelina jolie kids, brad pitt george clooney friends, angelina jolie custody arrangement, george clooney wife amal, brad pitt custody battle", "author": "Cortney Drakeford", "description": "Brad Pitt didn\u2019t party with friends to celebrate his new custody arrangement with Angelina Jolie."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530025228.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
