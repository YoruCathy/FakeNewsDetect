Big names such as Fake Bake and Anthony Logistics for Men have created tanners that cater to men!\n\nTruth be told, both men and women can benefit from self tanning (not just Bradley Cooper).\n\nBy applying self tanner, you can automatically accentuate muscles, cover imperfections, smooth out your skin tone and even mask cellulite.\n\nTo me, it seems like a no-brainer to use one right before a national awards show. I\u2019m sorry, but no male (or person) should get ridiculed for trying to better their appearance.\n\nThis goes for all you women out there as well.\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying to over-do it.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to end up looking like a cast member from Jersey Shore. But a little color or sunkissed glow never hurt anyone.\n\nJessica Biel and Angelina Jolie both looked amazing at the 2014 Oscars, and do you know what they had in common? That\u2019s right, a tan!\n\nThere\u2019s nothing worse than seeing one of Hollywood\u2019s hottest bombshells blend in with her ivory/white dress.\n\nNow, don\u2019t forget self tanning is not just for A-Listers, and it\u2019s definitely not just for red carpet events.\n\nMaintaining your tan on an ongoing basis will help boost your confidence, not to mention make you more attractive to the opposite sex.\n\nBut most importantly, self tanning will save your skin.\n\nYou\u2019ll be thanking yourself years down the road when you avoided wrinkles from tanning beds, or even worse, skin cancer.\n\nSo overall, there aren\u2019t many downsides to self tanning.\n\nHey, if celebs like Bradley Cooper and Leonardo DiCaprio are doing it, I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth a try!\n\nCategory: Celebrity Self Tanning, Is This Celebrity Self Tanning?, Rate This Celebrity Self Tan!, Self Tanning For Men", "images": ["https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/small-gg.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1786750084881830&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7b0cdd50feada590216943c24c496690?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ulta-bb1.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/remove-self-tanner-150x150.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EL-Ad.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/cloudy-day-150x150.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/small-fb.png", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/gp3.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/stlogo.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/selftanningreviews-150x150.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/selftannerhowlong-150x150.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/small-tw.png", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/small-yt.png", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pt3.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fb3.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/yt3.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bradley-cooper.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tw3.jpg", "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/small-pin.png"], "top_img": "https://www.selftanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bradley-cooper.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.selftanning.com/bradley-cooper-self-tanning/", "title": "Are A-Listers Like Bradley Cooper Self Tanning?", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QLhiwoLnX7CfllL8MDCrpGqbhSUxefw5JiqG6BXIFzE", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Are A-listers like Bradley Cooper self tanning?
