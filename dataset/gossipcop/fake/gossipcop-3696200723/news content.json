A joke reference to this is made in the opening credits of the episode \"The One After Vegas\", where the rest of the cast has \"Arquette\" added to their names. The dedication \"For Courteney and David, who did get married\" \u2013 a reference to Monica and Chandler's decision not to marry in the episode \u2013 appears during the fade out to the tag scene.[13]\n\nFilm career [ edit ]\n\nCox also appeared in the high-profile Hollywood films Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), and Scream 3 (2000) as reporter Gale Weathers.
