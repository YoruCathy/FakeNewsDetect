Britney's Family 'Desperately Worried' She'll Have Another Meltdown Spears locked in litigation with K-Fed and begging Sam Asghari to propose.\n\nBritney Spears has more than a brutal custody fight with her ex, Kevin Federline, to blame for her recent mood swings, RadarOnline.com has learned.\n\nAccording to an insider, Spears is \u201cdesperate\u201d for Sam Asghari, to propose, \u201cbut he\u2019s dragging his feet and stalling.\u201d\n\nAs Radar reported, Spears, 36, immediately turned her attention to tying the knot with her 23-year-old boy toy, Asghari, after she recently wrapped her Las Vegas residency.\n\nThe reason? Spears wants to start a family as soon as possible with the dancer.\n\n\u201cAll she can talk about right now is having a baby,\u201d a source told Radar. \u201cShe wants a girl so bad and she\u2019s madly in love with Sam.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Spears, the family fairy tale seems to be on hold until Asghari\u2019s cold feet have time to warm up.\n\nIn the meantime, Spears is also dealing with the stress from her ongoing feud with Federline, who is asking for more money in spousal and child support for himself and their two young sons, Sean and Jayden.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s freaking out over this court deposition and doesn\u2019t see an end in sight to all the ugliness with Kevin,\u201d noted the source.\n\nAs a result, those close to the pop star worry her issues could be approaching a breaking point not seen since Spears\u2019 \u201cshave her head\u201d meltdown fiasco over 11 years ago.\n\n\u201cThere are still some major demons that Britney has to fight on a daily basis, and her workload never lets up,\u201d the insider noted. \u201cShe feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and her family\u2019s desperately worried about her.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
