A new report claims that the reality star is planning on adopting a baby boy!\n\nCaitlyn Jenner, 66, is no doubt loving her new life, but something seems to be missing. The transgender reality star is reportedly expanding her family and is adopting a baby boy. That\u2019s not all. She plans to bring the little one home with the help of another woman!\n\n\u201cShe is going to adopt and is leaning toward a little boy,\u201d a source told In Touch. That\u2019s not all. Caitlyn is looking to raise a little one with her bestie Candis Cayne, 44. \u201cCaitlyn and Candis have thought about adopting an older child because there are a lot of trans kids whose parents have turned away, or who have run away from home. But the ideal scenario is a baby. Being a mom is Caitlyn\u2019s dream.\u201d Unfortunately, not everyone in her family is on board with this idea \u2014 especially Kris Jenner said the insider. \u201cCaitlyn all of a sudden thinking she can be a mom is beyond belief. Everyone is scratching their heads over this one. Kris says Caitlyn adopting a baby is not only ridiculous but a shameful grab for attention \u2014 and Kris knows about getting attention.\u201d To hear more about Caitlyn Jenner, head over to iTunes and download the latest HollywoodLife podcast for free!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source also revealed that \u201cKris is 60 and the last night she would ever want to do again is raise a child. Kris wonders how Caitlyn is going to raise a child now when she barely raised her own kids when she was Bruce \u2014 because Bruce wasn\u2019t a hands-on dad unless it involved fun sports stuff.\u201d Well, regardless, we hope Cait continues to help young kids who are struggling with their own transitions. Since coming out as transgender in 2015, Caitlyn has been deemed an important figure in the fight against LGBTQIA rights.\n\nHollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Caitlyn is going to adopt a baby?
