It was super challenging, but [King] was so warm and welcoming and open to all of it. She was generous with her story that it made it much easier than if she was like, 'Please don't make this movie about me, good night.'\"\n\nIn fact, King had met everyone involved with the film before it started shooting. Although she had spent time with Stone, directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (who are also married) made sure the two kept their distance as well.\n\nFaris told THR, \"It was important they met, but they were starting to get a little friendly and Emma realized, 'I think I need to have a little distance.' Emma said she felt weird because she had to just study videotape of Billie Jean. She needed to hear her voice at 29.\"\n\nAdded Dayton, \"We were making a film about one year in [King's] life. It was good to have a little distance, and now we can all really embrace her.\"\n\nKing chatted it up with both Carell and Stone at Saturday's afterparty, which was sponsored by FIJI.\n\nBattle of the Sexes hits theaters Friday.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/09/gettyimages-848198366_-_h_2017.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/gettyimages-848198366_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/gettyimages-848198366_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Porreca", "Brian.Porreca Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/battle-sexes-premiere-emma-stone-working-icon-billie-jean-king-1040045", "title": "'Battle of the Sexes' Premiere: Emma Stone on Working With \"Icon\" Billie Jean King", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"This person is an icon and an absolute badass that I could never even hope to be exactly like,\" said the actress.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/battle-sexes-premiere-emma-stone-working-icon-billie-jean-king-1040045", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Battle of the Sexes' Premiere: Emma Stone on Working With \"Icon\" Billie Jean King", "description": "\"This person is an icon and an absolute badass that I could never even hope to be exactly like,\" said the actress.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/09/gettyimages-848198366_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Battle of the Sexes' Premiere: Emma Stone on Working With \"Icon\" Billie Jean King", "description": "\"This person is an icon and an absolute badass that I could never even hope to be exactly like,\" said the actress.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/battle-sexes-premiere-emma-stone-working-icon-billie-jean-king-1040045", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/09/gettyimages-848198366_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Battle of the Sexes' Premiere: Emma Stone on Working With \"Icon\" Billie Jean King", "sailthru.description": "\"This person is an icon and an absolute badass that I could never even hope to be exactly like,\" said the actress.", "sailthru.author": "Brian Porreca", "sailthru.vertical": "Movies", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-17 15:38:20", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Emma Stone,Steve Carell,The Battle of the Sexes,autoplay"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505633900.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
