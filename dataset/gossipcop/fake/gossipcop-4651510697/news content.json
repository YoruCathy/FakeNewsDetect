Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We\u2019re told it\u2019s not true.\n\nAccording to the National Enquirer, the singer\u2019s friends fear she\u2019s headed for a meltdown following the New Year\u2019s fiasco, during which technical difficulties interfered with Carey\u2019s set. A so-called \u201csource,\u201d however, tells the magazine that the singer mixed a combination of booze, prescription medications and marijuana prior to going on stage in Times Square, which caused her to fumble her performance.\n\n\u201cMariah seems to be paranoid and delusional, thinking that everyone is out to get her,\u201d says the magazine\u2019s dubious insider. Of course, sound problems and Carey\u2019s earpiece malfunctioning were the real cause of her bungled performance, but Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the singer to get to the bottom of the drug and alcohol allegations. We\u2019re assured that Carey wasn\u2019t impaired on New Year\u2019s and her friends aren\u2019t worried about her well-being, nor would they talk to the Enquirer about it in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019re not surprised by the magazine\u2019s inaccurate story. Back when the singer was engaged to James Packer, Gossip Cop called out the Enquirer for falsely alleging Carey\u2019s engagement ring was fake. There was no truth to that report, and the same goes for this latest one.\n\nRelated on Gossip Cop:\n\nWas Ellen confronted over leaving a bad tip?\n\nDo Nicole and Keith practice their red carpet walk at home?", "images": ["http://www.wonderwall.com/cache/img/gossipcop_1520380848.png", "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/11/21/109-194163_FacebookShare.jpg?x=700&y=367&icq=74&sig=5c2549f4258f8e99165a1c699ade8a53", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAX4AAAAyAQMAAABh+SIcAAAAA1BMVEXl5eX7Oj7PAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAABlJREFUeAHtwQEBAAAEACD/V3sBVNEMAIAECZIAAY3qJn4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAMAAAAECAAAAABuRtrbAAAAAnRSTlMA5abz288AAAANSURBVHgBY3zKwICMASBsA5nUrAQKAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/12/04/194783_Actual.jpg?x=647&y=800&icq=74&sig=d9e3fa64fbcfc905239a86e2b87dc2c9", "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/11/21/109-194163_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAL0AAAAaAQAAAADKtWDLAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAAOSURBVHgBYxgUYBSMAgACigABeXQ0YAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="], "top_img": "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/11/21/109-194163_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Shuster"], "canonical_link": "http://www.gossipcop.com/mariah-carey-new-years-eve-drugs-alcohol/", "title": "Mariah Carey's New Year's Eve Mishap NOT Caused By Drugs And Alcohol, Despite Report", "meta_data": {"description": "Was Mariah Carey's bizarre NYE incident the result of a mix of drugs and booze?", "pubdate": "2017-01-15T23:33:05-08:00", "title": "Mariah Carey's New Year's Eve Mishap NOT Caused By Drugs And Alcohol, Despite Report", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/11/21/109-194163_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "title": "Mariah Carey's New Year's Eve Mishap NOT Caused By Drugs And Alcohol, Despite Report", "description": "Was Mariah Carey's bizarre NYE incident the result of a mix of drugs and booze?", "type": "article", "site_name": "Wonderwall.com", "url": "https://www.wonderwall.com/celebrity/photos/mariah-careys-new-years-eve-mishap-not-caused-by-drugs-and-alcohol-despite-report-1954154.article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-01-15T23:33:05-08:00", "section": "Celebrity"}, "fb": {"app_id": 111376106992, "pages": 61348233862}, "twitter": {"site": "@Wonderwall", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mariah Carey's New Year's Eve Mishap NOT Caused By Drugs And Alcohol, Despite Report", "description": "Was Mariah Carey's bizarre NYE incident the result of a mix of drugs and booze?", "image": "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/11/21/109-194163_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "p": {"domain_verify": "6bd7ca8def87b619f395211fb9be7755"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fb1896", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wonderwall.com/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ededed"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484551985.0, "source": "http://www.wonderwall.com", "summary": ""}
