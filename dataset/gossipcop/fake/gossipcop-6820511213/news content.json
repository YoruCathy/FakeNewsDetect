Miss Isla Phillips\n\nSource: www.royal.uk/succession\n\nThis system, which dated back 300 years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.\n\nThis change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kate's daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.\n\nPreviously if the third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.\n\nThis new rule only takes into account children born after 2011, meaning Prince Edward's youngest child, James, born in 2007, is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in 2003.\n\n8 Baby Archie was introduced to the world two days after he was born on May 6 - he is seventh in line to the throne Credit: PA:Press Association\n\nCan the monarch marry a Catholic?\n\nCommonwealth leaders also decided in 2011 to remove the rule that no heir could assume the throne if he or she married a Roman Catholic.\n\nThen Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: \u201cThe idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn\u2019t acceptable anymore.\n\n\"Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.\n\n\u201cThe thinking behind these rules is wrong.\"\n\nThe Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the 16th-century reign of Henry VIII.\n\nThe King broke with the Roman Catholic Church so he could divorce his wife, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn after the Pope refused his divorce request.\n\n8\n\nThe changes, under the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, came into force in March 2015 but apply to people born after October 28, 2011.\n\nLive Science reported that because one of the duties of the British monarch is to head the Church of England, no Roman Catholic can hold the crown.\n\nThe basis for the succession was determined in the 17th century.\n\nWhen James II fled the country in 1688, Parliament held that he had \"abdicated the government\" and that the throne was vacant.\n\nThe throne was then offered, not to James's young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers, following the \"Glorious Revolution\".\n\n8 Prince William with his son Prince George, then two, snapped after the Christening of Princess Charlotte on July 5, 2015 Credit: Getty Images\n\nWill Prince Charles step aside and let Prince William become King?\n\nAt 70-years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three - and would become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.\n\nSome royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a 2016 poll.\n\nPrince Charles has faced controversy over his divorce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with now-wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nHe has also been accused of \u201cmeddling\u201d in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.\n\nIn 1936, Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry divorcee Wallis Simpson.\n\n8 Prince Harry has said that the country still needs the 'magic' of the monarchy Credit: Getty Images -
