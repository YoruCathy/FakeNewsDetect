Last week, Sienna Miller was the said woman who had Affleck\u2019s attentions, yet this week, it is his \u201cdetox nurse\u201d Elizabeth Weaver who the Live By Night star is said to be infatuated with. Not only that, but Garner is reportedly \u201cseeing red\u201d over the relationship that her estranged husband has with the nurse.\n\nBen Affleck Enjoys Lunch Date With Mystery Blonde Amid Jennifer Garner Reunion Rumors https://t.co/3zcem61YZm #celebrity #gossip \u2014 100% Celeb News 24/7 (@celebnews1456) January 6, 2017\n\nGossip Cop shares how the rumor came to be ignited and the culprit is none other than The National Enquirer, a tabloid known for its fabricated stories.\n\n\u201cAccording to the National Enquirer, an \u2018addiction-challenged\u2019 Affleck is \u2018hooked\u2019 on Weaver, who the magazine describes as his \u2018detox nurse.\u2019 A so-called \u2018source\u2019 tells the tabloid, \u2018Ben is infatuated with her.\u2019 The magazine\u2019s supposed insider further contends, \u2018He\u2019s feeling pretty vulnerable these days, and Elizabeth has helped him regain his confidence.\u2019 ]He adores her,\u2019 adds the publication\u2019s alleged tipster.\u201d\n\nThe story is completely inaccurate and as GC notes, the tabloid simply used photos of Affleck and Elizabeth Weaver while in Los Angeles together to make it seem as though the two are dating. The photos then became the catapult to the tabloid fabricating a whole story that is totally untrue.\n\nAs for Garner\u2019s anger about the relationship Ben and Elizabeth have, these claims are also completely false. Both Jennifer and Ben have been longtime friends with Weaver and the nurse is a trusted confidant to both.\n\nAs it seems, based on new claims, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are actually doing better than ever since their split 18 months ago. There have been many ups and downs, yet the estranged couple, who have remained amicable all the while, are said to be on the upswing.\n\nRadar Online shares details about Jen and Ben\u2019s current status.\n\nA source close to the stars stated to the publication, \u201cJennifer confided in a friend that she and Ben Affleck are getting along better than ever.\u201d Garner reportedly also stated, \u201cWe weren\u2019t having sex before, so now I get the best of both worlds!\u201d\n\nIt was a very difficult time when Jen and Ben announced their separation back in June of 2015. Following the announcement, the infamous nanny scandal then broke involving the former couple\u2019s nanny Christine Ouzounian. The source reminded that it was not the nanny who led to the split between Jen and Ben, stating \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the nanny\u2019s fault they split because they weren\u2019t having sex before that.\u201d\n\nJennifer Garner And Ben Affleck Spotted Together At Church Amid Reconciliation Rumors https://t.co/BUDBM66Yan \u2014 Lindsay Cronin (@GirlWithGossip) December 13, 2016\n\nJen, herself, even corroborated the fact that Ouzounian was not at all the cause of she and Ben\u2019s split. Garner spoke openly to Vanity Fair on the subject during her first interview after the two separated. It was also during this same interview that Garner was candid about her love for Ben and the love their children have for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Ben\u2019s job to make me happy. The main thing is these kids\u2014and we\u2019re completely in line with what we hope for them. Sure, I lost the dream of dancing with my husband at my daughter\u2019s wedding. But you should see their faces when he walks through the door. And if you see your kids love someone so purely and wholly, then you\u2019re going to be friends with that person.\u201d\n\nThe two have continued on co-parenting their three children-Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 4, and are sure to take family trips to remind their kids that they are still a unit and that both are present in their lives.\n\nThe most recent getaway for Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck with the little ones was a trip to Big Sky over the holidays\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jennifer-Garner-and-Ben-Affleck-Things-Getting-Tense.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/784fcf0a3514f31a582147119c01ff3d?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Dafoe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3917369/jennifer-garner-is-not-suspicious-of-ben-afflecks-relationship-with-elizabeth-weaver-estranged-couple-doing-well-debunked/", "title": "Jennifer Garner Is Not Suspicious Of Ben Affleck\u2019s Relationship With Elizabeth Weaver, Estranged Couple Doing Well [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
