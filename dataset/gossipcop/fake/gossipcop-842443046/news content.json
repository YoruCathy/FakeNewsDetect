His political drama The Ides of March opened the festival a year ago.\n\nAdditionally, Clooney was connected romantically with Italian actress Elisabetta Canalis for nearly five years.\n\nBut the relationship with Canalis ended last year. And Marco Mueller, the Venice artistic director who regularly invited Clooney to the Venice Lido was ousted from the job in December and replaced by Alberto Barbera, who has said that Venice under Mueller was \"in a rut\" with the same people appearing every year -- perhaps an indication that the storied festival would not rush to invite Clooney back again so soon. He is not scheduled to appear at this year's edition of the Venice festival, which gets underay Wednesday.\n\nSTORY: President and Michelle Obama: George Clooney Is a 'Wonderful Guy' and 'Cute, Too'\n\nThe issue with Villa Oleandra concerns privacy -- or the lack of it, due to the scrum of paparazzi photographers camped outside the villa when Clooney is there. According to TG 24, the intrusiveness of the photographers got to the point where Stacy Keibler, Clooney\u2019s current girlfriend, gave Clooney an ultimatum: \"Villa Oleandra or me.\"\n\nThe news program quoted some of the paparazzi, who said they had done no wrong. \"None of us has received any legal notice and nobody has broken the law,\" the program quoted photographer Pierpaolo Ferreri as saying. \"Clooney is a public figure. We stay out of the house and try to photograph him when he comes out. What\u2019s wrong with that? Let us do our jobs.\u201d\n\nThe report that Clooney may withdaw from Italy comes just days after another high-profile star, Madonna, said she may look to move there: according to Italian media, the Material Girl has been eyeing property in Rome.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2012/04/George_Clooney_a_l.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2012/04/George_Clooney_a_l.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2012/04/George_Clooney_a_l.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eric J.
