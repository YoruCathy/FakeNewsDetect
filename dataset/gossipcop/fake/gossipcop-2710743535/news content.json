'He's proven time and again he can't be trusted.'\n\nFamily Feud funnyman Steve Harvey is facing a $400 million divorce bombshell \u2014 as his wife walked out because he was getting too close to showbiz pal Kris Jenner!\n\nThe love rat TV host, 61, and third wife Marjorie, 53, moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles last year to launch the former stand-up comic\u2019s self-titled talk show.\n\nBut according to insiders, Steve\u2019s cozying up to the Kardashian momager during closed-door business meetings, endless phone chats and nonstop text messages has sent Marjorie over the edge.\n\n\u201cThere was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,\u201d a source told Radar.\n\nPHOTOS; Steve Harvey Has Lunch With Kris Jenner\u2019s Beau Corey Gamble\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris \u2014 especially since he\u2019s proven time and again he can\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\n\nSteve and 62-year-old Kris, a two-time divorc\u00e9e, have been buddy-buddy for years .\n\nThey were pictured together during Paris Fashion Week in 2015. They\u2019ve also been seen out in Hollywood on multiple occasions and Kris appeared on his talk show to help boost ratings.\n\nTo further cement their relationship, Kris brought her brood to Family Feud.\n\nDespite their apparent closeness, a TV insider insisted Kris has \u201cno interest in Steve romantically.\u201d\n\nInstead, crafty Kris is stringing Steve along, hoping to manipulate him into sharing his TV smarts so she can use his advice to boost her own sagging empire.\n\n\u201cKris is pursuing Steve \u2014 but it\u2019s all about business,\u201d the source snitched. \u201cShe admires his TV success and wants to learn all his secrets.\u201d\n\nAlthough Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been a monster hit, the show was created by Ryan Seacrest, and Kris desperately needs guidance to grow her own showbiz brand, according to sources.\n\n\u201cKris has tried to produce a long list of shows, but they\u2019ve all been disasters,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Steve has the golden touch when it comes to TV. That\u2019s why Kris is looking to him for professional help.\u201d\n\nFurious over the pair\u2019s closeness, Marjorie got revenge by posting several videos of her working out with her hunky young personal trainer on Instagram.\n\nA few days later, Steve made a spur-of-the-moment decision to treat Marjorie to a no-expense-spared vacation in Europe.\n\n\u201cSteve has a wandering eye and he loves women!\u201d said a former employee on his talk show, who spoke with Radar on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man\u2019s weakness \u2014 knows everything about him! That\u2019s why she watches him so closely.\u201d\n\nSteve left his first wife, Marcia, in 1990 while she was pregnant to move in with Mary Shackelford, who became his second wife in 1996.\n\nBefore even filing for divorce, Steve ditched Mary in 2005 for Marjorie \u2014 and his bitter ex has never forgiven him.\n\nLast year Mary socked Steve with a $60 million lawsuit, claiming he bullied her out of a fortune during their divorce and his cheating triggered a breakdown that landed her in a mental hospital.\n\nMary\u2019s sister, Ruth Littrell, fumed: \u201cOnce a cheater, always a cheater. Steve\u2019s up to his old tricks \u2014 it\u2019s nothing new. Marjorie will end up divorcing him and taking him for everything he\u2019s got!\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
