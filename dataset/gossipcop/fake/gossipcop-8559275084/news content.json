Jordan maintains the break was sparked by a 1990 confrontation over Quaid\u2019s drug use.\n\nRyan, 38, implies that the problems with her mother go back much further \u2013 to the time, 23 years ago, when Susan walked out on her marriage. Ryan refused to comment for this story.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows Meg as this wonderful persona, the saving angel for poor Dennis,\u201d Jordan says, her voice trembling.\n\n\u201cBut I think it was a very handy thing for her to do, to present herself as a savior of this troubled soul who was a drug addict. How would it have looked if it came out that I had noticed this first? She had to discredit me to preserve her image.\u201d\n\nAnd, while Ryan may be estranged from Jordan, she is eerily following in her mother\u2019s footsteps with a similar marriage breakup.\n\nRYAN is about the same age as Jordan was when she left Meg\u2019s father, Harry Hyra, driving away from Bethel, Conn., in her old Ford Pinto in search of a career 50 miles away in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cTrust me, I know what it\u2019s like to be lonely in a marriage,\u201d Jordan says now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Russell Crowe from a hole in the wall, but I see them together in pictures and I can tell there is something there. I wish she finds the love she so desperately wants from him, and that she is finally happy.\u201d\n\nQuaid has reportedly threatened Ryan that he will do everything he can to keep their 8-year-old son, Jack. That leaves Ryan in much the same position her mother was when she and Hydra decided it was better for their three children to stay with their father until Jordan had the money to support them.\n\nThe children remained with Harry Hyra until the early 1980s, when Ryan went off to the University of Connecticut and the other children joined their mother, who was then teaching at a tony Connecticut prep school, Choate Rosemary Hall. Around that same time, Susan remarried, to journalist Pat Jordan, a man she calls the love of her life.\n\nRyan has said in interviews that her mother abandoned her kids to pursue an acting career in New York \u2013 something Jordan hotly denies.\n\nInstead, she maintains, she worked as an assistant to a casting director for about a year while waiting for a job to open up at Choate Rosemary Hall.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons I took that job was so I could meet all the agents and introduce them to Peggy,\u201d she says, using the family nickname for Ryan, who was then in high school.\n\n\u201cI tried out once for a part in a TV commercial to help pay for basic expenses that my job couldn\u2019t cover.\u201d\n\nAfter Ryan\u2019s graduation, Jordan began taking Ryan to casting agents, introducing her as a young actress, and Ryan began to get roles in commercials.\n\nIn 1978, when she received her Screen Actors Guild membership card, she took her mother\u2019s maiden name as her surname. In 1980, also through her mother\u2019s connections, Ryan won her first part in a feature film \u2013 \u201cRich and Famous,\u201d starring Candice Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset.\n\nFor her part in Ryan\u2019s rise to fame, Jordan says she got small thanks from her daughter.\n\n\u201cWhen I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1979, every member of my family came to see me in the hospital after my mastectomy except for Peggy,\u201d Jordan says, her voice quivering.\n\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t take one day off from college to come see me. She didn\u2019t even call. She said she just didn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nBUT the real rift, Jordan maintains, came in 1990, when she first met Dennis Quaid.\n\n\u201cMeg asked me what I thought of him, and I asked her, \u2018Do you want me to tell you what I think, or what you want to hear?\u2019\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Oh, no, Mom. I want to know your honest opinion.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, he strikes me as being childish, undisciplined \u2013 but maybe that\u2019s just Hollywood.\u2019\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t understand him, but I could see what Meg was attracted to. He has a certain boyishness and charm that is very sexy.\u201d\n\nWhat began as a mother\u2019s disapproval turned into a mother\u2019s worst nightmare when Jordan and her second husband, Pat, accepted an invitation from Ryan and Quaid to visit their home in Montana for Thanksgiving a little over a decade ago.\n\n\u201cI noticed some very strange behavior on the part of Dennis. He was jumpy, jittery, red faced, constantly rushing into the bathroom, coming back calm, getting up and rushing to the bathroom or outdoors again. I thought, God, what is wrong here?\u201d she recalls.\n\nJordan claims Quaid\u2019s behavior got even stranger during that visit. When she asked his advice about a trip to Florence, he became enraged.\n\n\u201cI spread some things on the kitchen countertop in an attempt to show Dennis, and he just shoved them off of the counter, snapping, \u2018I don\u2019t have time for this right now.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was so shocked I just stood there with my mouth open. Pat rose up from his chair \u2013 I thought he was going to grab Dennis by the shirt, he was so angry. I kept saying, \u2018No, no, it\u2019s OK,\u2019 to Pat, but I don\u2019t even think Dennis noticed.\n\n\u201cI suspect he didn\u2019t even know what he was doing. I just knew there was something terribly, terribly wrong with his behavior.\u201d\n\nTHE final straw came during Thanksgiving dinner, a meal punctuated with frequent silences \u2013 and one final creepy moment.\n\n\u201cThe Berlin Wall was just coming down, and Dennis made some crazy comment, and I remember piping up, \u2018Dennis, that is just ridiculous!\u2019 and he just stared at me with this incredibly jittery, almost wild look in his eyes.\n\n\u201cPat stood up at the table and said, \u2018Susan, come on, let\u2019s go.\u2019 Peggy looked terrified that I was leaving.\n\n\u201cI had no idea why until months later I thought she might have thought I knew about this [Quaid\u2019s] drug problem. Did she think, what is it going to look like if America\u2019s sweetheart is engaged to a drug addict?\u201d\n\nUpon returning to her home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Jordan says she worried about Quaid\u2019s behavior for months before confronting Ryan.\n\n\u201cI called a dear friend who is a physician, who told me Dennis\u2019 behavior sounded like cocaine addiction. I said, \u2018Oh my God, can you get over it?'\u201d\n\nThe final straw, Jordan says, was when she read a newspaper story report of Quaid attempting to kick a photographer at the premiere of \u201cJoe Versus the Volcano,\u201d causing Ryan to burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI called Peggy and asked, \u2018Is it possible Quaid has a problem with cocaine?\u2019 With that, she started to cry and said she didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I left it at that. I was very worried, but how can you intrude on a grown child?\u201d\n\nTension flared again on the eve of Ryan\u2019s planned wedding to Quaid in 1990. Jordan had phoned her daughter, who later called her back.\n\n\u201cI have no idea to this day what prompted her to call me back that afternoon,\u201d says Jordan. \u201cShe demanded to know why I thought Dennis was a drug addict. I said, \u2018I never said I thought he was a drug addict, I asked you if he had a problem with cocaine.\u2019\n\n\u201cPeggy said, \u2018Who are you to even ask me that?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m your mother! I have to ask you. I love you. I am concerned.\u2019 She slammed the phone down.\n\n\u201cShe called me back later that evening to tell me the wedding was off. I tried to say, \u2018Oh my goodness,\u2019 but she hung up on me. Those were the last words I heard from her.\n\n\u201cThen I began to read how I was the mother who had abandoned Peggy, that I was the woman who had left my marriage so I could pursue a coffee commercial. I never did say anything about Quaid\u2019s drug addiction, but shortly after our argument he went into a drug rehab program.\u201d\n\nRYAN and Quaid married in 1991 \u2013 but Jordan wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nAlthough she tried to make contact with her daughter, Ryan refused her phone calls and eventually instructed her siblings and handlers not to reveal her address and phone number to her.\n\nJordan claims Quaid contacted her right before Jack was born.\n\n\u201cHe told me I\u2019d never be able to see my grandson,\u201d she recalls sadly.\n\nOver the years, Ryan and Jordan grew more estranged. A 1992 article in Special Reports magazine in which Pat Jordan wrote about the family feud only exacerbated their problems.\n\nHis vengeful expose, titled \u201cThe Meg Ryan Nobody Knows\u201d portrayed the actress as a cold, spiteful child.\n\nIn it, he said: \u201cMeg is an ungrateful, manipulative, envious daughter who wouldn\u2019t take one day off school to look after her cancer-stricken mother.\u201d\n\nHe also wrote about Dennis Quaid\u2019s cocaine addiction. Ryan has told journalists she never read the piece.\n\nNow, Jordan says she wants to set the record straight \u2013 and someday make amends with Ryan.\n\n\u201cIf she called me now, I would tell her that I love her. It would give me peace to know that she is leading a happy life. She has always been a positive person \u2013 always the happiest and most generous child.\n\n\u201cThis is why I have been so befuddled all these years and why our estrangement has been so painful.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t blame Dennis Quaid, but I think it\u2019s strange it all started with him. Now, I hope it\u2019s not to much to pray that this separation ends with him, as well.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/spanx-sale.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/knewz_300x250.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png"], "top_img": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/nypost-2016/static/images/apple-icons/nypost/apple-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2000/07/24/mom-bares-her-soul-on-meg-of-her-heart-hopes-rift-is-healed-by-actress-split-with-quaid/", "title": "MOM BARES HER SOUL ON MEG OF HER HEART \u2013 HOPES RIFT IS HEALED BY ACTRESS\u2019 SPLIT WITH QUAID", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
