Geragos could accept on his client\u2019s behalf, but has refused. \u201cI\u2019m not here to help anybody increase their profile for self-promotion,\u201d the lawyer told TMZ on Wednesday, further saying Tran was only going after Brown to \u201cenhance\u201d her \u201cprofile.\u201d He insisted the model-actress\u2019 allegations are untrue, and said her case against him is \u201cdoomed to failure.\u201d\n\nTran\u2019s manager York is now firing back. \u201cMark should put up or shut up, but this sleight of hand he\u2019s trying to do, to distract from his client\u2019s current violent issues, is reprehensible,\u201d he tells Gossip Cop exclusively. York continues, \u201cThis is real life and real issues, and not a topic that should be used by Mark to spin press. Let them have their day in court and let the chips fall where they fall.\u201d\n\nAs Gossip Cop previously noted, one of Tran\u2019s friends also received a temporary restraining order against Brown in March, but has also been unable to face him in court. Most recently, just this week Brown was accused of punching a photographer at a nightclub in Florida. The photographer said he plans to press assault and battery charges. Geragos has not commented on that case.\n\nUPDATE: Mark Geragos responded to this story with a tweet saying, \u201cThey can\u2019t even serve CB with a lawsuit. Maybe they should ask their client to do it when she is following CB around the Country #teambreezy.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.iheart.com/v8.16.1/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28?ops=contain(740,0)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "//www.iheart.com/content/2017-04-20-karrueche-tran-manager-slams-chris-brown-attorney-domestic-violence-is-real-not-self-promotion/", "title": "Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "Karrueche Tran\u2019s manager is slamming Mark Geragos, Chris Brown\u2019s longtime attorney. | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28", "description": "Karrueche Tran\u2019s manager is slamming Mark Geragos, Chris Brown\u2019s longtime attorney. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-04-20-karrueche-tran-manager-slams-chris-brown-attorney-domestic-violence-is-real-not-self-promotion/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28"}, "description": "Karrueche Tran\u2019s manager is slamming Mark Geragos, Chris Brown\u2019s longtime attorney. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-04-20-karrueche-tran-manager-slams-chris-brown-attorney-domestic-violence-is-real-not-self-promotion/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion, karrueche, tran, manager, slams, chris, brown, attorney:, domestic, violence, is, real,, not, self-promotion", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58f8b9ee5fe69c85dadc1a28", "parsely-link": "http://www.iheart.com/content/2017-04-20-karrueche-tran-manager-slams-chris-brown-attorney-domestic-violence-is-real-not-self-promotion/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-04-20T13:40:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "trending-urban", "parsely-tags": "Chris Brown (33210)", "parsely-title": "Karrueche Tran Manager Slams Chris Brown Attorney: Domestic Violence Is Real, Not Self-Promotion", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492617600.0, "source": "http://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
