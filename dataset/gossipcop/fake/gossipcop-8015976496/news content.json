But huge career success aside, we\u2019ve heard there\u2019s trouble brewing at home, with tensions rising between Margot, 27, and her British husband Tom Ackerley, 28.\n\n\u2018Everything is going brilliantly in her career, but Margot\u2019s personal life is less than satisfactory,\u2019 explains a friend. \u2018She\u2019s at her wit\u2019s end. She\u2019s getting all the attention at the moment\u2013and Tom is so proud to be at her side \u2013 but it\u2019s obviously difficult with Margot\u2019s star power on the rise.\n\n\u2018This season, she\u2019s busier and more in-demand than any other, which has impacted on their couple time. Of course, it\u2019s only natural that they would want more time together. There has been a few disagreements, and he wants Margot to speak up for him in public, as a way of showing people that he matters to her.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve heard that Tom is being mega-supportive of Margot\u2019s big career achievements, and while the actress has said the pair \u2018don\u2019t really fight\u2019, it seems they\u2019ve been bickering over where to live long-term.\n\nMargot has previously said their future children would be raised Down Under, and also revealed that Tom \u2018[doesn\u2019t know] why anyone would leave Australia\u2019.\n\nBut, with her career going from strength to strength, sources claim the actress doesn\u2019t want to move just yet.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re in this for the long haul and they love each other wants very much,\u2019 reveals a friend.\n\n\u2018But Tom wants to keep their time in Hollywood to a minimum, believing that it\u2019s a toxic place with people willing them to fail. Margot is at the height of her career and, yes, she and Tom did talk about moving back to the UK or Australia, but now she wants to spend more time in LA and enjoy the ride while she can.\n\n\u2018The word is that she wants him to be more understanding about the demands of her career. And that she wants him to toughen up and ignore the pessimists, who seem to want to tear them apart.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s an exciting time for Margot, her bank account is soaring \u2013 she\u2019s currently estimated to be worth $12million \u2013 but I, Tonya alone is netting another $10million.\n\n\u2018Plus, she\u2019s signed on to a bunch of other money-spinning films and projects, with beauty ranges and fashion deals galore also in the works. She and Tom clearly love each other, but lately it\u2019s been push and pull between them.\n\nI don\u2019t think she thought it would be this hard \u2013 she wishes she\u2019d had prior warning.\u2019\n\nWith what is looking to be a very big and exciting year for Margot, we hope she and Tom sort this all out ASAP\u2026\n\nFor more celebrity news, check out this week\u2019s issue of LOOK.", "images": ["https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/02/margot-tom-920x690.jpg", "https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/02/margot-tom.jpg", "https://keyassets-p2.timeincuk.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2016/10/look-logo-footer.svg", "https://www.look.co.uk/wp-content/themes/simba-theme/assets/images/placeholder.png"], "top_img": "https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/02/margot-tom.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.look.co.uk/news/margot-robbie-career-husband-604909", "title": "Margot Robbie Is \u2018Torn\u2019 Between Her Career And Husband Tom Ackerley", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Her acting career coudn't be going any better, but behind closed doors, is Margot's personal life under strain?", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Margot Robbie Is 'Torn' Between Her Career And Husband Tom Ackerley - Look Magazine", "description": "Her acting career coudn't be going any better, but behind closed doors, is Margot's personal life under strain?", "url": "https://www.look.co.uk/news/margot-robbie-career-husband-604909", "site_name": "Look Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/02/margot-tom.jpg", "secure_url": "https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/02/margot-tom.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 750}}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2018-02-20T14:46:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Her acting career coudn't be going any better, but behind closed doors, is Margot's personal life under strain?", "title": "Margot Robbie Is 'Torn' Between Her Career And Husband Tom Ackerley - Look Magazine", "image": "https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2018/02/margot-tom.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 7693705627}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://img.ti-media.net/wp/prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/57/2016/10/cropped-look-icon-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519137969.0, "source": "http://www.look.co.uk", "summary": ""}
