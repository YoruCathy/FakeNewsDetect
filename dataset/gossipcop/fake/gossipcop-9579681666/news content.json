What she didn\u2019t expect was to spend a fun-filled day with four of his six children he shares with ex Angelina: Zahara, Shiloh and twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\nBrad\u2019s kids were playing outside when Jen showed up with her book. \u201cTaking the situation in stride, Brad casually introduced them to her as they played,\u201d claimed an insider. Then, they all went inside as Brad poured his kids some lemonade and Jennifer and him drank water.\n\nA source alleged that, \u201cJennifer was taken by how kind, well-mannered and unaffected they seemed.\u201d She was most impressed by one of the Jolie-Pitt\u2019s during her trip: Knox. \u201cShe especially got a kick out of Knox, who is the spitting image of a young Brad,\u201d claimed the same source.\n\nThis trip could be one of many, as the source claimed that Jen \"only stayed for about an hour but told the kids what a pleasure it was to meet them and extended an invite to them to come over sometime.\u201d If that doesn\u2019t work, she opted for another solution. \u201cOr they could go for a walk in the park someday and get some burgers and ice cream,\u201d continued the source.\n\nSo where does Angelina stand in all of this? Not good, according to the source. \u201cNo woman gets under Angie\u2019s skin like Jen,\u201d claimed an insider. \u201cShe\u2019s absolutely livid that Jen has come back into Brad\u2019s life in such a major way. She\u2019s the kids mother!\u201d\n\nIs this a reverse situation of what happened over a decade ago, where Jen was on the outs with Brad and Angie was in, only this time its the other way around? Although their divorce is almost finalized, a source claims that Angelina is a little jealous where Brad is concerned. \u201cWhile their divorce and child custody agreement is closer than ever to being signed, Angelina, who thrives on being in control, hasn\u2019t been totally able to let go of Brad,\u201d an insider alleged. \u201cShe\u2019s lonely and misses him.\u201d\n\nAngelina may need to think of that as just a thought for now, as Brad and Jen\u2019s friendship is its closest its been in years. \u201cHer meeting with the children is a clear indication that he wants to share every part of his life with the woman who will always be his greatest love- his soulmate,\u201d claimed an insider.", "images": ["https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD5.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD9.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brad-jen-pp.jpg.jpeg?fit=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD6.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brad-pitt-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brad-jen-pp.jpg.jpeg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD2.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD4.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD1.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD8.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD3.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BRAD7.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brad-jen-pp.jpg.jpeg?fit=800%2C400&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/jennifer-aniston-meets-ex-husband-brad-pitts-kids/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Meets Ex-Husband Brad Pitt's Kids: \u2018They\u2019re So Sweet!\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "The former couple was married for five years but never had any little ones of their own.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt Jennifer Aniston", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Meets Ex-Husband Brad Pitt's Kids: \u2018They\u2019re So Sweet!\u2019", "url": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/jennifer-aniston-meets-ex-husband-brad-pitts-kids/", "description": "Should Angelina Jolie be concerned? \u00a0After what was supposed to be a quick drop off at his place, In Touch Weekly reported that Jennifer Aniston decided to go inside ex-husband Brad Pitt\u2019s house an...", "site_name": "OK!
