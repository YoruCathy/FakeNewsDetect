Principles of freedom of speech and press may protect their prerogative to mock and degrade the LGBTQ community. But freedom to speak is not freedom to defame. Mr. Simmons, like every person in this nation, has a legal right to insist that he not be portrayed as someone he is not. Even the most ardent supporter of sexual autonomy and LGBTQ rights is entitled to be portrayed in a manner that is truthful.\n\n\u201cWhile we have not seen Mr. Simmons\u2019 complaint, we stand by our reporting about him, all of which was based on solid sourcing and material evidence,\u201d a spokesman for American Media Inc. said, according to NBC News. \u201cShould he choose to proceed with his lawsuit, we will defend it vigorously, and we look forward to the public vindication of our reports.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Rosie O\u2019Donnell feels sympathy for Joan Crawford after being accused of abuse by her own daughter, Chelsea\n\n\u201cPeople have a right to privacy, and just because someone is a public figure doesn't mean their right to privacy is gone.\u201d Simmons\u2019 manager, Michael Catalano said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cRichard is very glad get his side of the story out. This has been going on for a long time.\u201d\n\nSimmons has not been seen in public in nearly three years, but it was recently reported that he was hospitalized for severe indigestion. Upon his release from the hospital, Simmons posted to his official Facebook page to thank fans for their support and express his gratitude to those who cared for him during his hospitalization.\n\nRichard Simmons has sued the National Enquirer and Radar Online over a report he underwent surgery to transition from male to female.

He is in great spirits. He was laughing and joking and talking. He is very friendly, very funny.\n\n\ufeffKelcie Willis with the Cox Media Group National Content Desk contributed to this story.\n\n\n\nSupport real journalism. Support local journalism.
