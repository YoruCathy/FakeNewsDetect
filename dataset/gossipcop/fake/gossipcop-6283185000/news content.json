Since she rose up to the limelight, she has been quite busy making her fans happy. Her journey to fame was a long and turbulent one, and so was her love life. After one unsuccessful marriage, the artist has been dating country music artist Blake Shelton since 2015. The happy couple met on The Voice US. Although they got engaged, there have been rumors that Gwen called off the wedding because of \u2018cheating rumors\u2019. But, is this even true? You are about to find out in detail.\n\nGwen Stafani is an iconic figure in the world of music and show business, but how did she become so famous and adored? It was actually a long journey for her.\n\nGwen Ren\u00e9e Stefani was born on October 3, 1969, and she is not only a singer. Stefani is also a fashion designer, actress, and television personality!\n\nRemember her band No Doubt? That was her first start. Gwen was the co-creator and the lead singer of the band.\n\nThe band rose to fame in the mid-90s when they released their hit album Tragic Kingdom in 1995. Their hits included Just a Girl, Don\u2019t Speak, Hey Baby and It\u2019s My Life!\n\nShe soon found love in 1995, when she met Gavin on tour.\n\nThey got married in 2002.\n\nSadly, they divorced in 2016.\n\nThe couple has three children, but after 14 years of marriage, they divorced because of \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d.\n\nRumor had it what Gavin cheated on her with their nanny, Australian lady Mindy Mann.\n\nIn March of 2016, Gavin opened up about the breakdown in his relationship. He added that their divorce caused him \u201ca lot of pain and sadness\u201d.\n\nGavin said in an interview:\n\n\u201cIt really teaches you perspective on life. It\u2019s really health, happiness, and safety. After that, I don\u2019t know what there is other than that.\u201d\n\nAfter the divorce, Gwen found love once again.\n\nShe has been dating artist Blake Shelton since 2015.\n\nThey have been together for almost three years now. There was also a pregnancy rumor in 2017.\n\nAccording to Auntyacid, a source said:\n\n\u201cThey will get married one day but right now they are hyper-focused on getting pregnant. They believe there is still a chance for Gwen [to fall pregnant]. They are incredibly hopeful. Gwen and Blake started talking quickly about having a baby, but starting a family has not been easy for them. It\u2019s something that they really want and it\u2019s just not working out the way they wanted it to.\u201d\n\nThe source goes on:\n\n\u201cBlake told Gwen he does want kids of his own and Gwen was willing to try. With her, Blake has the exact relationship and family life he\u2019d hoped to have with Miranda. Gwen\u2019s everything he wants. They are so committed to one another.\u201d\n\nThe pair then got engaged.\n\nBut after months of planning and thinking about having the wedding in June, Gwen allegedly called the wedding off.\n\nThe rumors said that the mother-of-three called it off after worrying that Shelton had been unfaithful.\n\nAccording to a source, this confrontation caused a huge fight, and Gwen said there won\u2019t be a wedding.\n\nThe singer allegedly started feeling insecure and was bothered by the closeness of Blake and last year\u2019s The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski.\n\nChloe was on Blake\u2019s team, and Gwen saw more than a student-teacher relationship in them.\n\nA source went on to explain:\n\n\u201cShe started panicking about all the details \u2014 and about her future with Blake. Gwen and Blake had a massive fight and Gwen called off the wedding.\u201d\n\n\u201cGwen feels as if she loves Blake more than Blake loves her right now. She told Blake all about her insecurities and how she couldn\u2019t handle another heartbreaking divorce because of trust issues she needs to face.\u201d\n\nSources also claim that now they are trying to work things out.\n\n\u201cMost friends believe they will still walk down the aisle someday, but Gwen and Blake have some things to work on first. Trust is important and this isn\u2019t the right time for a dream wedding. The last thing Gwen or Blake wants is another divorce.\u201d\n\nHowever, according to the rumor-busting website, Gossip Cop, these rumors are false!\n\nThe website claims that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski and that Stef\u2019s rep told them the wedding is not off.\n\nAccording to the rep, the couple\u2019s relationship is not \u201con the rocks.\u201d\n\nThe site also adds that Chloe has a boyfriend.\n\nThe outlet also claims that Gwen isn\u2019t insecure at all.\n\nFans simply don\u2019t know who to believe right now, but one thing is for sure. Gwen and Blake are still together, and the pair went on a family holiday just before the new year.\n\nThey spent some quality time together with Gwen\u2019s kids.\n\nBlake even taught them how to drive in a field full of mud! Moreover, they have also been spotted on a holiday in Mexico.\n\nGwen uploaded a photo to Instagram on the 18th of January and it all looks pretty well between these two.\n\nBlake is also set to perform at Luke Bryan\u2019s Crash My Playa concert series.\n\nThe event takes place at the Riviera Maya in Mexico.\n\nIt seems like these two are having the time of their lives.\n\nHere is Gwen with her kids having a great time.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22650%22%20height%3D%22341%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22620%22%20height%3D%22827%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.metdaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/13-7.jpeg", "https://md.manaferra.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/md-logo.svg", "http://www.metdaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dandruff-vs-lice-180x180.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22650%22%20height%3D%221156%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://md.manaferra.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/md-black-logo.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22534%22%20height%3D%22600%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22245%22%20height%3D%22150%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221940%22%20height%3D%22500%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22500%22%20height%3D%22300%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22180%22%20height%3D%22180%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22245%22%20height%3D%22233%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22634%22%20height%3D%22559%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.metdaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01-118.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22650%22%20height%3D%22325%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22222%22%20height%3D%22300%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22650%22%20height%3D%22867%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22650%22%20height%3D%22434%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.metdaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/7-214.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20015427&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22615%22%20height%3D%22454%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%22650%22%20height%3D%22366%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.metdaan_com,DomainId.127693"], "top_img": "http://www.metdaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/01-118.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Metdaan Editorial Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.metdaan.com/gwen-stefani-wedding-blake-cheating/", "title": "Did Gwen Stefani Call Off Wedding To Blake Shelton Because Of \u2018Cheating\u2019?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Although they got engaged, there have been rumors that Gwen called off the wedding because of 'cheating rumors'.
