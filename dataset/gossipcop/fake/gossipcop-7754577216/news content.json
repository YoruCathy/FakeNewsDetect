And that feels really great to say that especially this year,\u201d West began. \u201cI came here to present my new video, but before I do that imma talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow later in the night, \u2018Famous\u2019 [West\u2019s music video] might lose to Beyonc\u00e9. But I can\u2019t be mad, I\u2019m always wishing for Beyonc\u00e9 to win,\u201d he alluded to the VMAs moment from years past, in which he swiped the mic from Taylor Swift in the great stage crash of 2009.\n\nWest, 39, referenced his ongoing feud with Swift, 26, saying, \u201cWe came over in the same boat, now we\u2019re all in the same bed. Well, maybe different boats, but \u2026 If you think about last week, there was 22 people murdered in Chicago. You know, like, people come up to me like, \u2018Man, that\u2019s right\u2026 Take Taylor? I love all y\u2019all. That\u2019s why I called her!\u201d\n\nHe continued to explain the music video, in which nude likeliness of Donald Trump, Anna Wintour, Amber Rose and other famous personalities are sprawled out in bed, \u201cBut for people to understand just how blessed we are, it was an expression of our now, our fame right now. Us inside of the TV \u2014 you just know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe audacity to put Anna Wintour right next to Donald Trump. I mean, I put Ray J in it bro!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nAfter giving wife Kim Kardashian\u2018s ex a shout out, he did the same for his former flame, Amber Rose.\n\n\u201cI see you Amber,\u201d he said to a smiling Rose in the audience. \u201cMy wife is a G \u2014 not a lot of people\u2019s wives would let them say that.\u201d\n\nWest continued to name drop, comparing himself once again to Steve Jobs and Walt Disney.\n\n\u201cI sit down and talk to older like rich people. A.k.a. white. And they tell me don\u2019t compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don\u2019t compare yourself to Walt Disney \u2026 They told me there are three keys to keeping people improving. Taking away their resources and role models. My role models are artists, merchants, Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West,\u201d he explained.\n\nWest then signed off with a few final words of his wisdom about the future of the industry.\n\n\u201cTonight we\u2019re here to have fun. I\u2019m standing in front of my idol Puff Daddy,\u201d West said. \u201cI\u2019m standing in front of my wife Kim Kardashian West. I\u2019m standing in front of the future, Chance the rapper. 2 Chainz, Jaden Smith. We are undeniably the influence, the thought leaders. I\u2019m gonna play y\u2019all a piece of my art and I hope y\u2019all have a good time.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kanye-west.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kanye-west.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/kanye-west.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2016/08/28/kanye-wests-ego-is-still-out-of-control/", "title": "Kanye West\u2019s ego is still out of control", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
