Get the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\nKylie Jenner, 20, can induce hype like no other. From her hugely successful Kylie Cosmetics brand to her reported pregnancy, people will stop everything to try to keep up with her \u2014 but apparently all of the attention surrounding the upcoming birth of her first child has even surpassed her own expectations. \u201cKylie is pretty blown away by quite how much people seem utterly obsessed with her pregnancy, it\u2019s like no other 20-year-old has ever given birth before,\u201d a source close to the Kardashian family told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nThe baby hype grew to new extremes on Jan. 12 when a rumor that the youngest KarJenner sister was in labor started gaining traffic on Twitter. While the gossip has since been debunked by TMZ and The Blast, the spike in interest surrounding her pregnancy didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cShe\u2019s been trying to keep off line as much as possible, but she couldn\u2019t escape all the speculation yesterday as her phone started ringing as soon as the rumors started,\u201d the source added. \u201cKylie just takes it all with a pinch of salt, and finds it pretty amusing, although she is hoping all the interest is going to ratchet down a notch once the baby is here, because otherwise it\u2019s just going to be insane every time she leaves the house.\u201d\n\nWhile the baby hype probably will continue once the child is born, it probably won\u2019t be as extreme considering the kid\u2019s existence will be the sort of confirmation fans have been dying for since her pregnancy was first reported in Sept. 2017. Of course, Kylie is under no obligation to share this part of her life with the world, but the massive interest in her life is to be expected. At least the freak out over her rumored labor was positive \u2014 some of the attention she\u2019s been given hasn\u2019t been as kind. Wendy Williams, 53, made some rude comments on her talk show about how getting lip injections won\u2019t change how Kylie\u2019s baby will look. Being enamored by Kylie\u2019s pregnancy is totally ok, but let\u2019s all make sure to be nice about it.\n\nHollywoodLifers, did you freak out over the false rumors that Kylie was in labor?", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F13%2Fkylie-jenner-labor-rumors-pregnancy-reaction%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2946953&comment_count=9", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-jenner-blown-away-by-pregnancy-hype-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-jenner-blown-away-by-pregnancy-hype-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/13/kylie-jenner-labor-rumors-pregnancy-reaction/", "title": "Kylie Jenner \u2018Blown Away\u2019 By People Being \u2018Obsessed\u2019 With Her Pregnancy After Labor Rumors", "meta_data": {"description": "Kylie Jenner is 'blown away' by the obsession surrounding her pregnancy.
