Yeezy reportedly already has a plan to \u2018crush\u2019 the competition!\n\nKanye West has reportedly been fuming because he didn\u2019t crack Forbes\u2018 top five most financially successful rappers in the world. \u201cKanye wants to be the GOAT of everything. Rap! Fashion! Producer! Endorsement deals! Everything,\u201d a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. The 39 year-old has reportedly decided that going off the grid could be the key to topping the list next year. \u201cHe got wind of the news that he wasn\u2019t even close to making Forbes Richest Top 5 Artist and that inspired him to get out of town and go to a place where he could be alone and write\n\nkiller bars!,\u201d the insider told us.\n\nYeezy reportedly had a rough time seeing some of the names on the list. \u201c\u2018Ye loves everybody on that list but doesn\u2019t think everyone should be there, mainly Drake, 30,\u201d the source said. Yikes! \u201cHe\u2019s happy for Jay Z, 47, but deep down he competes with HOVA on everything and that royally crushed his spirits when he learned Jay made it but he didn\u2019t,\u201d the insider told us. Could Kanye has still been upset over how long it took Jay Z to visit his family after Kim Kardashian\u2019s robbery.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Kanye fans because the rapper reportedly plans to come back better than ever. \u201c\u2018Ye\u2019s coming with it though,\u201d the insider continued, \u201che\u2019s on a mission to crush all these rappers and wants everyone to watch the throne because he\u2019s coming for it.\u201d Sean Diddy Combs, 47, topped the list this year with a whomping net worth of $820 million.
