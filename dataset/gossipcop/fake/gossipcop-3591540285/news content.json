Not sure why it takes that long, but whatever. This is less about the belated ceremony and more about what happened after it was over. Khloe Kardashian took to Instagram to post a picture commemorating the night. She was stuntin\u2019 for the \u2019Gram with her new bae, Cavs star Tristan Thompson. This raised a whole lot of questions for me.\n\nFor the past few weeks Khloe and her new man, Tristan, have been boo-lovin\u2019 all over Snapchat but this was his first appearance on her Instagram. They reportedly met at Kevin Hart\u2019s wedding this August when Tristan showed up with his pregnant girlfriend, Jordan Craig.\n\nSo, now the internet is abuzz with questions about the situation: Did Tristan leave a pregnant Jordan for Khloe? How is Khloe cool with all of this?\n\nSplash\n\nWe don\u2019t really know how or why Tristan and Jordan broke up, but it happens, right? But should Khlo\u00e9 accept this as baggage and continue to pursue the man she\u2019s really digging? Or, does she walk away because this complicates a very new relationship? This is way bigger than choosing locations for dinner and a movie on our fifth date.\n\nAll I want to know is, Khloe Alexandra Kardashian what are you doing girl? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to be mentally built like that. I don\u2019t want to be savage like Rihanna, cause there\u2019s levels to this ish, but I\u2019m currently too fuccboiphobic to play around in this rather mature arena.\n\nI could meet a man tomorrow, who\u2019s fine, smart, funny and believes that I\u2019m his soulmate but as soon as he forms his mouth to say, \u201cBut I\u2019m having a baby in three months with my ex!\u201d there\u2019s only one thing left for me to say: \u201cI\u2019m dipping out like Straight Up #g2g.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone has baggage and there\u2019s nothing to be mad or salty about, there would just be too many unknowns for me as I\u2019m trying to establish something with someone. Let\u2019s be clear, this is very different from dating someone that already has kids or a man that cheated on you and got someone else pregnant like Love and Hip Hop New York\u2019s ultimate love triangle Peter Gunz , Tara Wallace and Amina Buddafly .\n\nMy biggest concern is how do I fit in as a new girlfriend to two people co-parenting their first child? There\u2019s always going to be a discussion around my levels of comfort in terms of his interactions with his ex. I know he\u2019s going to have to do things like go to doctor\u2019s appointments but if she asks anything more and that\u2019s not okay with me, am I allowed to express it or do I just have to accept whatever her demands are of him for the sake of their child? Irregardless, every step of the way, there\u2019s a new obstacle.\n\nWhat if I\u2019m put in the middle of disputes between two first time parents like Kehlani was when Kyrie Irving\u2019s ex called her out on Instagram for not pushing him to spend more time with their daughter?\n\nHow can I trust that they are completely over each other and won\u2019t start rekindling anything like Nick Young and his baby mama?\n\nAm I prepared to be involved (in someway) of raising a child with a man that I went on my first date with a few weeks ago like Khloe and Tristan?\n\nKhloe just wants to have fun without any drama, but what part of this sounds like fun or drama-free? I don\u2019t think I could date a first time parent-to-be with a baby on the way with their ex because this doesn\u2019t seem like a fun way to get to know someone. No judgement here, that\u2019s just me.\n\nEither way, Jordan doesn\u2019t seem stressed.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?
