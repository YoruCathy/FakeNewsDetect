That\u2019s the claim in this week\u2019s tabloids. Gossip Cop, however, can reveal what\u2019s really going on.\n\n\u201cCarrie Underwood: Baby #2 To Save Marriage,\u201d reads a headline in the new issue of Star, which contends, \u201cThe country superstar pushed hubby Mike Fisher to quit pro hockey so they could work on their troubled relationship and having another child together.\u201d After Fisher announced his retirement earlier this month, the tabloid is now claiming Underwood \u201cmade sure Mike understood it was the right time\u201d to call it quits on his playing days.\n\nA so-called \u201csource\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cCarrie told Mike in no uncertain terms to hang up his skates, in a dramatic attempt to get more together time to mend their troubled relationship.\u201d But the gossip magazine\u2019s supposed snitch doesn\u2019t seem to have first-hand knowledge to back that assertion up. \u201cI heard that she had become really unhappy with the situation. Having Mike home will be one solution, and I believe she hopes that having another baby together will bring them even closer than when they first fell in love,\u201d the purported tipster is quoted as saying.", "images": ["http://www.iheart.com/v8.16.1/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07?ops=contain(740,0)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "//www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-19-carrie-underwood-forced-mike-fisher-to-retire-for-second-baby/", "title": "Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "His retirement has nothing to do with his wife forcing him to do it to have a baby | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07", "description": "His retirement has nothing to do with his wife forcing him to do it to have a baby | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-19-carrie-underwood-forced-mike-fisher-to-retire-for-second-baby/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby? | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07"}, "description": "His retirement has nothing to do with his wife forcing him to do it to have a baby | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-19-carrie-underwood-forced-mike-fisher-to-retire-for-second-baby/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby? | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby?, carrie, underwood, forced, mike, fisher, to, retire, for, second, baby?", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/599854a9bd5b9aab344d8e07", "parsely-link": "http://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-19-carrie-underwood-forced-mike-fisher-to-retire-for-second-baby/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-19T15:06:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "entertainment-news-country", "parsely-tags": "Carrie Underwood (89416)", "parsely-title": "Carrie Underwood Forced Mike Fisher To Retire For Second Baby?", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503072000.0, "source": "http://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
