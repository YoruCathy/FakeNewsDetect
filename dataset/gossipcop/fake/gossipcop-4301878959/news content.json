The police uncovered at least 10 rifles in Paddock\u2019s room, including hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Eric Paddock, the brother of the suspect, told reporters on Monday that Stephen Paddock legally owned \u201ca couple\u201d of handguns and may have owned one long gun, \u201cbut he had them in a safe.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear how Paddock came into possession of so many rifles.\n\nIn a ten-tweet-long thread, John Mayer laid out a passionate argument for immediate change with regards to gun control. \u201cI\u2019m going to state my thoughts without the words \u2018gun control\u2019 \u2018assault rifles\u2019 and others that stoke reflexive debate,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m a logic and reason guy.

That these are the new terms? That it\u2019s a fact of modern day life that from time to time we\u2019ll lose dozens of people in seconds? That daily life is a lottery system? And if you can\u2019t say that, if it\u2019s just too cold and brutal a thought to bear, then isn\u2019t that proof you haven\u2019t solved the problem yet?\n\nHe continue: \u201cIf you\u2019re not at least trying to fix this, you\u2019re effectively telling the country in your (in)actions that this somehow acceptable. There\u2019s two moralities: morality identity and morality-in-action. Our greater moral identity doesn\u2019t match our actions so far.9) If you\u2019re not open minded to solving this, you\u2019re morally surrendering us all to a very certain fate.
