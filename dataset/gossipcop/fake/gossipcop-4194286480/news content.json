People hated her constant smile, her theater-kid eagerness, her desperate and palpable thirst for approval.\n\n\u201cMy my,\u201d said Alexis Rhiannon on Crushable, in what would become the iconic manifesto of the Hathahater, \u201cwhat a large beautiful mouth. I don\u2019t like it. Look at those dark beautiful eyes. I don\u2019t like them. Listen to her skinny beautiful words. I don\u2019t like them. Shut up. Shut up, Anne Hathaway.\u201d\n\nThere was think piece after think piece about why everyone hated Anne Hathaway, and every interviewer who talked to her asked about them. They still do.\n\n\u201cIt comes up in every interview I do, just about,\u201d Hathaway said of the \u201cwhy does everyone hate her\u201d narrative, in an interview last week with Rich Juzwiak for Jezebel. \u201cI am \u2026 not eager, but I am ready for the conversation to move to a place beyond it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a thoughtful, graceful interview, one that ends with Juzwiak recognizing his own role in perpetuating Hathahate and repenting for it. Afterward, people approvingly passed around screencaps on Twitter, and talked about how unfair it is that people say mean things about Hathaway so often.\n\nIt\u2019s now culturally acceptable to say that 2013\u2019s Anne Hathaway hatred was based on systemic misogyny, just as it was culturally acceptable to say in 2013 that you hated Anne Hathaway.\n\nif you've always been aware of the ways gender bias affected how society treated Anne Hathaway, you are Hathawoke \u2014 Kevin O'Keeffe (@kevinpokeeffe) April 4, 2017\n\nBut that shift doesn\u2019t have all that much to do with Hathaway herself. Nor is it because we are all exponentially more woke now than we were in 2013. It has to do with where Hathaway is in her publicity cycle.\n\nYou can see her cycle repeated in what\u2019s been happening to Jennifer Lawrence and Taylor Swift over the past few years. It all follows a very familiar pattern, because the life cycle of a Hollywood starlet is fairly standard.\n\nPhase 1: This woman is pretty, and she\u2019s talented!\n\nThe earliest phase is the most basic, and some lucky starlets manage to stay there for their entire careers. It expresses itself in the form of a mildly condescending expression of bewilderment that a telegenic young woman is also good at her job: Jennifer Lawrence was so good in Winter\u2019s Bone, and she\u2019s a babe on the red carpet! Taylor Swift is a tall, skinny blonde, and she writes a catchy pop song!\n\nFor Anne Hathaway, that moment came in 2005 when she appeared in Brokeback Mountain. In review after review, Hathaway (one year removed from The Princess Diaries 2) and Michelle Williams (one year removed from Dawson\u2019s Creek) were both singled out with a faint note of surprise: Turns out those pretty girls from the teenybopper world can really act!\n\nPhase 2: This woman is absolutely everywhere, and I love her\n\nIt\u2019s when the starlet advances to phase two that she\u2019s in danger. This is where Jennifer Lawrence was in 2012, and where Taylor Swift was in 2014: the point where the starlet is up for major awards, on the cover of every magazine, featured on every talk show, and roundly declared to be the best thing since sliced bread.\n\nIn 2012, Lawrence was starring in The Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook, and she was killing it on the interview circuit. She was the celebrity everybody wanted to have brunch with. She was so beloved that Vice called up a bunch of hate groups to see if they had anything bad to say about J Law, and none of them did. (The Hathahaters were at their height at the end of that year, and many of the \u201cWhy does everyone hate Anne Hathaway?\u201d think pieces pitted Hathaway against the wildly popular Lawrence.)\n\nIn 2014, Swift had just released 1989, and the media was madly in love with her witchy in-on-the-joke \u201cBlank Space\u201d video, her kicky short hair, and her newly created girl squad. Rolling Stone declared that it was \u201ca year of power moves for Swift.\u201d\n\nFor Hathaway, phase two hit with 2008\u2019s Rachel Getting Married, the movie that definitively pulled her out of the Princess Diaries/Ella Enchanted/tiara movie ghetto, past the serviceable-wallpaper-for-Meryl-Streep Devil Wears Prada weeds, and into the A-list. The New York Times built an article around her smile; she got reviews with headlines like \u201cno priss, no prada, no princess \u2013 Hathaway comes of age.\u201d\n\nTellingly, it was Rachel Getting Married that got called out as Hathaway at her least hatable in Crushable\u2019s iconic Hathahater take, because phase two is inevitably followed by phase three.\n\nPhase 3: This woman is absolutely everywhere, and I hate her\n\nThe consequence of plastering a starlet\u2019s face everywhere \u2014 on all the magazine covers, all the talk shows, all the movie trailers \u2014 is that people get sick of her.\n\nGenerally, phase three is not a major danger for male stars. Even when Leonardo DiCaprio was launching his thirstiest Oscar-seeking campaign, showing up on every magazine and talk show, and was subject to much mockery, the ridicule was always tinged with affection: Oh, that Leo, he just wants it so badly. If you Google \u201cwhy does everyone hate Leonardo Dicaprio,\u201d you don't find think pieces about how he's such a try-hard. You get think pieces with the headline \"Why does the Academy hate Leo?!\" wondering why the Academy hasn't given him an Oscar yet when he clearly deserves one.\n\nBut when a certain type of female star reaches a certain level of exposure, the world is ready to turn against her. Any mistake she makes in the public eye becomes a massive liability, and the things that made people like her suddenly make them hate her.\n\nFor Lawrence, the moment came last year, when she told a \u201cfunny story\u201d that involved defiling sacred stones in Hawaii. Public opinion, already prepped to turn against her, swelled violently. Her lack of filter stopped being funny and became offensive. Now, she\u2019s considered that dreaded beast, a try-hard.\n\nSwift got hit last year, too. She was already on thin ice \u2014 the 1989 spell was wearing off \u2014 but then came her much-mocked Apple Music ad, and then the incredibly fake-seeming romance with Tom Hiddleston, and then the infamous \u201cKim exposed Taylor\u201d party. People started writing think pieces with titles like \u201cWhen Did You First Realize Taylor Swift Was Lying to You?\u201d\n\nPhase three came for Hathaway in 2011, the year she hosted the Oscars with James Franco. The pair bombed \u2014 LA Weekly dubbed the ceremony \u201cthe most embarrassing Academy Awards ever\u201d \u2014 and while everyone agreed that Hathaway, who at least had the grace to try, did better than a sleepwalking Franco, it marked the moment that people started regularly describing her as a \u201ctheater kid.\u201d It was not a compliment:\n\nQ: Was Anne Hathaway stoned, too? A: No. Q: So what was her deal? A: She suffers from \"theater kid.\"\n\n\u201cTheater kid\u201d means that Hathaway is too enthusiastic, that she wants her audience\u2019s approval too badly, that she\u2019s a little bit nerdy and way too desperate. The work ethic that impressed everyone back in her Brokeback Mountain and Rachel Getting Married days was starting to grate. And from \u201ctheater kid,\u201d it was a short descent into try-hard status.\n\nA try-hard, to be clear, is not just someone who works hard. Beyonc\u00e9 works hard, and she is not a try-hard. A try-hard is someone who works hard while you watch and secretly root for them to fail. It\u2019s in the eye of the beholder, and in the eye of the beholder, the behavior that\u2019s an admirable work ethic one year is incredibly annoying next year.\n\nIn 2012 Hathaway was starring in Les Mis\u00e9rables, and she wanted an Oscar bad. (She was, you might say, trying hard for it.) It made people furious.\n\nSo when Hathaway accepted her Oscar in the spring of 2013, with a too-earnest (and, she would later admit, totally fake) \u201cIt came true!\u201d she was at her popularity nadir. It was what should have been the peak of her professional achievement. Instead, everyone despised her.\n\nPhase 4: Personally, I think it\u2019s anti-feminist to hate this woman. And she\u2019s so pretty and so talented!\n\nEventually, the starlet\u2019s dominant narrative shifts away from the idea that everyone hates her and toward the idea that it is sexist how much everyone hates her. But for that to happen, the starlet has to lay low for a good long while.\n\nSince Passengers, Jennifer Lawrence has all but disappeared from the public eye. Taylor Swift has been so hard to find that she even skipped her traditional biannual music drop. And Anne Hathaway hasn\u2019t signed on to star in a major prestige movie since Les Mis\u00e9rables. The single exception was her reunion with Dark Knight Rises director Christopher Nolan in 2014\u2019s Interstellar, in which she was second lead \u2014 and her appearances on that press tour often ended up pivoting to the question of why everyone hates Anne Hathaway.\n\nIt was a deliberate strategy on Hathaway\u2019s part. \"My impression is that people needed a break from me,\u201d she said in 2014, to explain why she\u2019d been staying out of the public eye.\n\nShe\u2019s been making test runs instead. She\u2019s headlined a couple of movies, but only movies that come out during dead periods (2015\u2019s The Intern, this year\u2019s Colossal). And at each release, there\u2019s a small flurry of profiles and think pieces about whether or not everyone\u2019s over the Hathahatred.\n\nThis year, it looks as though Hathaway has been dormant long enough. She\u2019s getting headlines like \u201cYou Are Wrong and Also Dumb if You Hate Anne Hathaway\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s Not Cool to Hate Anne Hathaway Anymore.\u201d She disappeared long enough for us to miss her, and to get the creeping suspicion that we hated her before because of sexist reasons.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether our newfound love for Anne Hathaway will last through another round of phase two\u2013style omnipresence.\n\nThis cycle exists because we live in a very sexist world\n\nThe popularity cycle of a starlet that I\u2019ve been describing here is not confined to the world of celebrity. It\u2019s a cycle many women experience, in which they are beloved when they\u2019re defying low expectations, and despised as soon as they show ambition.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s popularity sank like a stone the second she announced she was running for president. Women who follow the popular advice to \u201clean in\u201d at work find themselves facing negative performance reviews and lower salaries, because their ambition is off-putting. It\u2019s as though we\u2019ve all been taught for a very long time that for women, accomplishment is only worth celebrating if it appears to be effortless. Once we can see the effort \u2014 once Lawrence\u2019s goofiness starts to seem like shtick, and Hathaway\u2019s nerdiness like a desperate need for approval \u2014 we start to hate it.\n\nBut successful men usually don\u2019t have to hide themselves away for fear of overexposure. Successful men, in fact, don\u2019t have to hide themselves away from much of anything, especially when they are also wealthy, well-connected, and white. Men can win Oscars after being sued for sexual harassment with very little pushback; they can headline multiple major blockbusters mere months after being accused of domestic violence.\n\nJohnny Depp allegedly cut off the tip of his finger and used the bloody stump to finger-paint the words \u201cEasy Amber\u201d on a mirror to terrorize his then-wife Amber Heard. He remains the face of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Anne Hathaway acted a little fake when accepting her Oscar and had to disappear for four years.\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to argue that 2013\u2019s hatred of Hathaway was based in our culture\u2019s deep-seated hatred of women. But the new trend of redemptive Anne Hathaway think pieces does not necessarily indicate that we are all stronger and wiser and better now, and that over the past four years we have magically learned to stop hating women. If we had, we wouldn\u2019t be repeating the whole procedure with a new string of starlets.\n\nIt just means that Hathaway played the publicity cycle well. And the next time she\u2019s up for a big award, we\u2019ll have a chance to see if we\u2019ve gotten any better.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k-gM_OjroQ4XCkN82343gRoHXDQ=/0x0:4168x2779/1200x800/filters:focal(2327x454:2993x1120)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54138639/659709692.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670451/1210070405.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CxxZajMFfZOmwsL2pFJoPax_Z_g=/0x0:1196x1428/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1196x1428):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301321/665015250.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670249/GettyImages_1218880371.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mo2AQm_hERCYRGEQH-6mAJ47mjo=/0x0:2083x3000/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2083x3000):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301245/162588862.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfmeIQpUCz3qGHdAorfqAiu4Ckw=/0x0:3000x1891/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x1891):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301227/83357974.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671059/GettyImages_1210050360.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KnJvHBt5qQZd6wp5qDS-LrD9pfo=/0x0:1954x3000/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1954x3000):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301219/56368259.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7z3Kp7Zaa2LpHUXMlg9A3IGFuv0=/0x0:3228x2456/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3228x2456):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8301283/533874520.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667959/1219262470.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670298/fionaapple3000.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pUnf9pEAqLD_jY9c8a8St-jIEGU=/0x0:4168x2345/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54138637/659709692.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670574/1210300395.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pUnf9pEAqLD_jY9c8a8St-jIEGU=/0x0:4168x2345/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54138637/659709692.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Constance Grady", "Jag Bhalla", "German Lopez", "Li Zhou", "Aaron Rupar", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Dylan Scott", "Apr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/4/10/15179082/anne-hathaway-publicity-cycle-hathahaters-jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift", "title": "Anne Hathaway\u2019s love-hate-redemption publicity cycle is a familiar (and sexist) one", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2017-04-10T09:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-10T09:00:02-04:00"}, "author": "Constance Grady", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "A timeline of hatred and redemption for celebrity women, featuring Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, and Taylor Swift.", "og": {"description": "A timeline of hatred and redemption for celebrity women, featuring Anne Hathaway, Jennifer Lawrence, and Taylor Swift.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pUnf9pEAqLD_jY9c8a8St-jIEGU=/0x0:4168x2345/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54138637/659709692.0.jpg", "alt": "'Colossal' New York Premiere -
