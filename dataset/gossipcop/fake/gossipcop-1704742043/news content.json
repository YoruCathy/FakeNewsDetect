Many artists use their life experiences as musical fodder, but THE CARTERS\u2018 situation is unique because they double as two of our greatest living musicians and one of the most famous power couples in the world. Jay and Bey\u2019s names and faces are plastered all over gossip sites\u2014yet they remain intensely private. When they went on stage this past weekend to announce their new album, Everything Is Love, was on TIDAL, they had successfully released one of the biggest albums of the year with virtually no rollout and no leaks.\n\nAlbum rollouts these days often consist of a media blitz. Most artists take to interviews or social media to give fans updates on their lives but also debunk rumors. Beyonc\u00e9 maintains a carefully curated Instagram, but has basically stopped doing interviews. Jay still does a high profile interview here or there, but has no social media footprint other than the Twitter account he hasn\u2019t touched in a year. The Carters tell their stories in their chosen format: music.\n\nOn their songs, they can reveal what they want and conceal what they want to keep hidden. Like everything else they do, it\u2019s calculated. When the time comes to unleash a new provocative detail, it always seems to come at the perfect and most commercially viable moment. Rather than giving outlets and social media the details of their private lives, they give us updates through their songs. They\u2019ve basically monetized their gossip.\n\nNowhere is that strategy more evident than on their new album. Everything Is Love completes The Carters\u2019 trilogy of albums that began with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 project Lemonade and continued with Jay\u2019s 2017 release 4:44. Each album has given us the plot twists, conflicts, and resolution we\u2019ve become accustomed to consuming through every form of media besides music. Taken together, they\u2019re the culmination of decades worth of perfecting the craft of controlling the narrative.\n\nThis is all seems to be part of a strategy that Beyonce addressed in her 2013 HBO documentary Life Is But A Dream, where she discussed Nina Simone\u2019s career, and how her art was the entertainment, not her life:\n\nPeople are taking pictures of you and exploiting your personal life as entertainment. When Nina Simone put out a record, you fell in love with her voice. \u2026 But you didn\u2019t get brainwashed by her day-to-day life, and what her child was wearing and who she is dating. All things that are really not your business. It shouldn\u2019t influence the way you listen to the voice and the art, but it does.\"\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s right, the personal and the day-to-day can influence how people listen to your voice. That\u2019s probably why no stone is left unturned on Everything Is Love. Throughout the album they address rumors about alleged love children, secret second weddings, and even hilariously awkward memes.\n\nOn \u201cHeard About Us,\u201d Jay addresses the rumors that he secretly fathered a lovechild a decade ago\u2014a story that\u2019s plagued him for years but found new relevance after Pusha-T brought up Drake\u2019s child on \u201cThe Story of Adidon.\u201d Jay has never addressed the rumor in any interviews or taken a paternity test. Instead, he adds a twist to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBillie Jean\u201d to deny the \u201cboy\u201d in question is his child:\n\nBillie Jean in his prime\n\nFor the thousandth time, the kid ain\u2019t mine\n\nOnline they call me \u201cdad,\u201d kiddingly\n\nYou\u2019re not supposed to take this dad thing literally\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Jay has denied such rumors. In fact, it\u2019s not even the first time he referenced \u201cBillie Jean\u201d to do it. He had a similar line on 2008\u2019s \u201cAmerican Gangster.\u201d And on 2006\u2019s \u201cTrouble,\u201d he was forced to denied the persistent rumor he had a baby by former BET host Free:\n\nSo I ain\u2019t gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B\n\nThat\u2019ll happen the day I have a baby by Free\n\nNot to say that anything is wrong with Free\n\nJust to say that ain\u2019t nothing wrong with me\n\nAfter those lines, that particular rumor died down. A few years later, Jay was dogged by the conspiracy theory that he was apart of the Illuminati, an idea he thoroughly dismissed on Rick Ross \u201cFree Mason.\u201d\n\nRather than giving outlets and social media the details of their private lives, they give us updates through their songs.\n\nNot every story Jay addresses on the new album is as over the top as a secret baby or a secret society. On \u201cApeshit,\u201d Jay confirms that he was offered the honor of performing at the Super Bowl halftime show by the NFL but turned it down. Although that story was widely reported at the time, many websites cited The Source which in turn cited the The Sun\u2014the same tabloid newspaper that ran the story about Jay\u2019s alleged love child. As Cardi B would say, that\u2019s not a reliable source. On the track, Jay clears the air about exactly what happened:\n\nI said no to the Super Bowl\n\nYou need me\n\nI don\u2019t need you\n\nEvery night we in the endzone\n\nTell the NFL we in stadiums too\n\nThese are the kinds of lines we\u2019ve come to expect from The Carters. Using music to control the story truly kicked into high gear for them after the leak of camera footage from their infamous elevator ride after the Met Gala after party in 2014\u2014Beyonce standing still and doing nothing as her sister Solange physically attacked Jay-Z. It was their most outrageous public moment as a couple. As tabloids went wild, The Carters went into radio silence, refusing to give credence to the drama. To date, Beyonc\u00e9 has never addressed the incident in any sort of interview. But she did reference it with a few bars a few months later on the \u201c***Flawless (Remix).\u201d It\u2019s essentially her only public acknowledgement that the incident even happened:\n\nOf course sometimes shit go down\n\nWhen it\u2019s a billion dollars on an elevator\n\nStill, questions remained unanswered. Two years after that incident, they began the trilogy that has captivated audiences and seemingly sparked personal growth for all parties involved. Beyonc\u00e9 released Lemonade in 2016 and on \u201cSORRY,\u201d Bey unleashed the couple\u2019s most scandalous confession yet: Jay-Z cheated on her with Becky With The Good Hair.\n\nLooking at my watch, he shoulda been home\n\nToday I regret the night I put that ring on\n\nHe always got them fucking excuses\n\nI pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is\n\nI left a note in the hallway\n\nBy the time you read it, I\u2019ll be far away\n\nInstead of hearing about Jay\u2019s infidelity on PageSix or TMZ, you heard it from Bey herself. Watching the visual film debut on HBO was a harrowing experience for fans. For the first half, on songs like \u201cDON\u2019T HURT YOURSELF,\u201d it seemed like Bey and Jay\u2019s marriage on still on the ropes. But before think pieces could pour out about whether Bey should forgive Jay or not, she did so herself towards the end of the album on \u201cAll Night.\u201d\n\nFound the truth beneath your lies\n\nAnd true love never has to hide\n\nTrue love never has to hide\n\nI\u2019ll trade your broken wings for mine\n\nTrade your broken wings for mine\n\nI\u2019ve seen your scars and kissed your crime\n\nSeen your scars and kissed your crime\n\nWhen Lemonade dropped, fans and media speculated if this was even a true story or just a marketing ploy to sell her album. But on 4:44\u2019s title track, Jay admitted to his infidelity, and apologized incessantly for his mistake.\n\nLook, I apologize, often womanize\n\nTook for my child to be born, see through a woman\u2019s eyes\n\nTook for these natural twins to believe in miracles\n\nTook me too long for this song, I don\u2019t deserve you\n\nThe trilogy seems to conclude on Love Is Everything, where they go into detail about their reconciliation and even divulge a few more details about just how rocky their marriage got. On the album\u2019s closer, \u201cLOVEHAPPY,\u201d the couple trades bars, and eventually lets loose that not only did Jay replace Beyonce\u2019s \u201ctainted\u201d wedding ring after his infidelity, but that she also came face to face with his mistress at some point:\n\nHe went to Jared, I went to JAR out in Paris\n\nYeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried\n\nYo, chill man\n\nWe keepin' it real with these people, right?\n\nLucky I ain\u2019t kill you when I met that b- (Nah, aight, aight)\n\nSoon after, it\u2019s even intimated that the family\u2019s move to a massive $88 million Bel Air home last year was sparked by the cheating:\n\nY'all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together\n\nTo get her back, I had to sweat her\n\nY'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather\n\nMove the whole family West, but it\u2019s whatever\n\nIn a glass house still throwing stones\n\nHova, Beysus, watch the thrones\n\nThe usage of \u201cwatch the thrones\u201d could be seen as a shot at Kanye West, whose relationship with Jay is another topic of much discussion. There are much more overt references to Kanye on the album. Again, The Carters are controlling the narrative without engaging with media, choosing what they deem worthy of a response or explanation. In April, Jay told David Letterman Kanye was still \u201clike a brother\u201d to him. But he had a more revealing take on his relationship with Kanye on the song \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nIn a verse that seems full of jabs at Kanye, Jay ends with a response to one of the most widely discussed incidents in their relationship. In 2014, when Kanye married his wife Kim Kardashian in a lavish ceremony in Italy, Jay and Bey were absent. Kanye has admitted that it hurt him, and Jay took a few bars to explain exactly why his trouble at home kept him from attending the wedding. He even caps things off by saying if Kanye doesn\u2019t understand that they aren\u2019t meant to be friends.\n\nI ain\u2019t goin' to nobody nothin' when me and my wife beefin'\n\nI don\u2019t care if the house on fire\n\nI\u2019m dyin', nigga, I ain\u2019t leavin'\n\nTy-Ty take care of my kids, after he done grievin'\n\nIf y'all don\u2019t understand that, we ain\u2019t meant to be friends\n\nThe Carters have always sprinkled intimate moments into their lyrics, so while it may have become more apparent recently, it\u2019s hardly new. Jay-Z once admitted he shot his own drug-addicted brother on the In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 cut \u201cYou Must Love Me.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 pulled off similar, revealing confessionals as well, famously addressing the lineup shuffling in her group, Destiny\u2019s Child, on the first single from the group\u2019s self-titled third album, \u201cSurvivor.\u201d And it\u2019s easy to forget, but back in the early 2000s they both denied even being a couple while collaborating on songs like \u201c'03 Bonnie & Clyde\u201d and \u201cCrazy In Love.\u201d They\u2019ve shared intimate details too, like when Jay admitted Bey had a miscarriage on his 2012 loosie \u201cGlory\u201d which celebrated Blue Ivy\u2019s birth.\n\nAs they continue this process on Everything Is Love, The Carters have found a happy medium of both scintillating reveals and boastful proclamations of their against-all-odds successes. The result is the kind of chemistry you\u2019d expect from a tested union as strong as theirs, and two musical geniuses who have cultivated a relationship nearly two decades strong. Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 don\u2019t need tabloids, interviews or social media confessionals. They tell the world everything they want on their albums, and it may soon be the only way to ever hear them.
