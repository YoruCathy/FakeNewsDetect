An international website went on to ask the readers if they think the duo has reconciled. The magazine even went on to add that there are reports that the couple has secretly rekindled their relationship earlier this year after Jennifer's split from Justin Theroux . The speculations went overboard when a ring was spotted on the actress\u2019s ring finger recently.But the rumours have been dispelled by another web portal which reported that the ring is perhaps a part of her role in the upcoming project \u2018Murder Mystery\u2019, wherein she is playing a married woman. There were some rumours that suggested Brad's parents have been insisting him to sort out differences with Jennifer. However, the web portal even refuted those rumours and currently there\u2019s no truth to the reports.", "images": ["http://static.toiimg.com/photo/34824568.cms", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/29439462.cms", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-75122434,imgsize-487760/75122450.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65165375,width-800,height-600,resizemode-75,imgsize-77291,pt-32,y_pad-40/65165375.jpg", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-75179621,imgsize-370756/75178246.jpg", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/34824568.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193563,imgsize-667722,width-401,height-300/75193563.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193066,imgsize-504987,width-401,height-300/75193066.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75194536,imgsize-224005,width-401,height-300/75194536.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65163579,width-65,height-47.cms", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/29251859.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75194587,imgsize-586711,width-401,height-300/75194587.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-61914123,width-91,height-128/61914123.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65163097,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193035,imgsize-555016,width-401,height-300/75193035.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75195269,imgsize-520028,width-401,height-300/75195269.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-59770138,width-166,height-124/59770138.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65165375,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-77291/65165375.jpg", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/29251859.cms?width=42&height=42", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65164363,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193794,imgsize-826665,width-401,height-300/75193794.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-61914123,width-94,height-124/61914123.jpg", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-320,msid-75177340,imgsize-1328894,resizemode-4/75177340.jpg", "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-75155826,imgsize-186161/75152992.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75194078,imgsize-967694,width-401,height-300/75194078.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65165375,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75191620,imgsize-72210,width-401,height-300/75191620.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-65165375,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-77291/65165375.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/has-brad-pitt-proposed-to-jennifer-aniston-again/articleshow/65165375.cms", "title": "Has Brad Pitt proposed to Jennifer Aniston again?", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "The Times of India", "title": "Has Brad Pitt proposed to Jennifer Aniston again?
