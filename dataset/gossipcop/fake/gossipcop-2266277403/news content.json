In anticipation of a potential end, NBCU only went for a one-season station renewal when the show\u2019s deal came up this past May. EndemolShine produced Steve Harvey, based in Chicago, which will wrap after completing its current fifth season in May. The comedian is teaming with a new producing partner, IMG, for the new talker, which will be based in Los Angeles. He also is gaining ownership and creative control, something he had been after.
