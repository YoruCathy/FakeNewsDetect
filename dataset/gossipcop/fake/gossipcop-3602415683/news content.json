However, it appears the \u201cFury\u201d actor is more thrilled about the perks that will come along with the new agreement.\n\nPitt, who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9, with Jolie, is reportedly excited about being able to spend more time with his children following the previous arrangement, which damaged their relationship.\n\n\u201cBrad was always an amazing dad. The kids have always been his life. He has flaws like most people, but so does Angie,\u201d a source told People.\n\n\u201cBrad must be so relieved that the court is now helping him,\u201d the insider added.\n\nPhoto: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images\n\nIn Pitt and Jolie\u2019s previous custody agreement, there wasn\u2019t \u201ca set schedule\u201d and the arrangement was \u201cunorganized,\u201d according to those close to the stars.\n\nHowever, the court has since ordered Jolie to allow the actor to repair his relationship with his children and has implemented a detailed schedule that divides custody between the parents.\n\nWhile the younger children are required to abide by the current arrangement in place, the courts consider Jolie and Pitt\u2019s 16-year-old son old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with his father. Even if Maddox opts not to spend much time with Pitt, seeing the other kids will be a relief for the actor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been obvious that he has been missing his kids like crazy,\u201d a source said. \u201cTo live so close to them, but not seeing them often, has definitely been painful for him.\u201d\n\nIn the summer months, Pitt is expected to divide his time between Los Angeles, where he will film \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d and London, where Jolie is filming \u201cMaleficent 2.\u201d\n\nAlmost two years after Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, Pitt reportedly began \u201ccasually dating\u201d and was most recently linked to MIT Professor Neri Oxman.\n\nIn May, sources told Us Weekly Pitt planned to cut down quality time with his rumored girlfriend in order to stay in Los Angeles and give his children his undivided attention.\n\n\u201cTheir busy schedules are going to be a huge challenge because Neri isn\u2019t going to give up her life in Cambridge or her job at MIT for anyone, even Brad Pitt,\u201d the insider said.\n\nWhile the actor hasn\u2019t confirmed the romance, it appears he has decided to spend the majority of his free time with his children over the summer.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/small-business-administration-chief-jovita-carranza-has-overseen.jpg",
