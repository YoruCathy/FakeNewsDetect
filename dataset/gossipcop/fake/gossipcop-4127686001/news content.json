'So when Jane saw that there was an opening for Brad and Jen to find love again, she urged him to give it another shot.'\n\nNow that Jen is back with Brad, the Hollywood starlet is happier than ever!\n\n'This is the epic news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for since their split in 2005,' a source tells the US publication. 'Forget about the royal wedding - this is the wedding of the century.'\n\nNeither Jen or Brad have responded to In Touch's report.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/28950/brad.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/28950/brad.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Georgia Mars", "Georgia Mars Is A Digital Content Editor At New Idea Magazine.
