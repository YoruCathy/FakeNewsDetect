Sulzberger to reason with President Trump over his attacks on the media went about as well as anyone could have expected. Sulzberger acknowledged the meeting, which he says the president requested, after Trump violated their off-the-record agreement by not only tweeting about the meeting more than a week later, but also mischaracterizing what they talked about.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast: \"Trump: Media Is \u2018Enemy of the American People\u2019 \" \u2014 \"President Trump on Friday afternoon tweeted, then deleted an outwardly hostile message calling various media outlets the people\u2019s real enemy. 'The FAKE NEWS media,' he wrote, citing The New York Times, CNN, and NBC News, among others,'is not my enemy. It is the enemy of the American people. SICK!' The message was deleted shortly after its posting, but numerous users screengrabbed the tweet for posterity. Several minutes later, the president re-posted the message, with slight tweakings: he added CBS and ABC to the roster of 'fake news' outlets, and removed the 'SICK!' from the back end.\"", "images": ["https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2016/06/icon-on-point.png", "https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2018/07/0730_trump-media-1000x674.jpg", "http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2018/07/0730_trump-media-1000x674.jpg", "https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2016/06/tile-bbc-news.jpg"], "top_img": "http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2018/07/0730_trump-media-1000x674.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2018/07/31/trump-labels-news-media-enemy-of-the-american-people", "title": "Trump Labels News Media 'Enemy Of The American People'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A president like no other has changed the way the media covers the White House.
