She even included ex-wife Kris Jenner.\n\n\u201cSo blessed to have so many amazing moms in my life!\u201d the 68-year-old Olympian gushed in her Instagram Stories on Sunday, May 13. Pictures included a never-before-seen image of daughter Kylie Jenner cradling her baby girl Stormi and a snap of Caitlyn hugging Kris. Though Caitlyn revealed in November 2017 that she hasn\u2019t spoken to Kim Kardashian in a year, she shared a selfie of herself with the reality star, 37, and grandson Saint.\n\nKhloe\u2019s social media snub comes after a February interview with U.K. morning show Lorraine, where she opened up about her estranged relationship with Caitlyn. When the then-pregnant 33-year-old was asked if having a child would mend her estranged relationship with Caitlyn, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that affects anything with Caitlyn. Things are just as they are.\u201d (Khloe welcomed daughter, True, on April 12, with boyfriend Tristan Thompson.)\n\nJenner\u2019s relationship with the Kardashian family has been rocky since April 2015 when she revealed her identity as a transgender woman. In her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, Caitlyn claimed that Kris, 62, was not supportive of her transition. Their divorce was finalized in 2015 after 24 years of marriage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost all relationship with them, yes, I don\u2019t talk to any of them anymore,\u201d Caitlyn told Piers Morgan in 2017. At the time, the former athlete revealed she hadn\u2019t spoken to Khloe in two years.\n\nWhile it is unlikely the Good American denim designer will respond to Caitlyn\u2019s diss, she did share her own Mother\u2019s day tribute to Kris on Instagram on Sunday. May 13. Dubbing the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch \u201cthe best mommy we could ask for!!\u201d Khloe gushed: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t imagine life without you!! You are the reason for it all!! Thank you for showing us what unconditional love and loyalty is.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caitlyn-jenner-ices-khloe-kardashian-in-mothers-day-post/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Seemingly Ices Khloe Kardashian in Mother\u2019s Day Post", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner excluded new mom Khloe Kardashian in her Mother\u2019s Day tribute \u2014 find out who made the cut", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Seemingly Ices Khloe Kardashian in Mother\u2019s Day Post", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner excluded new mom Khloe Kardashian in her Mother\u2019s Day tribute \u2014 find out who made the cut", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caitlyn-jenner-ices-khloe-kardashian-in-mothers-day-post/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-14T16:46:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-14T14:41:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-14T16:46:41+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner excluded new mom Khloe Kardashian in her Mother\u2019s Day tribute \u2014 find out who made the cut", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Seemingly Ices Khloe Kardashian in Mother\u2019s Day Post", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526308896.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
