Angie loves Target. It\u2019s one of her favorite stores, and it\u2019s where she buys lots of Christmas gifts. Walking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.\u201d\n\nGossip Cop stressed that there\u2019s no truth to such claims, and reiterated that it all started after Radar Online published a story about Jolie struggling with her finances. The tabloid claimed that Jolie has opted to buy discounted items at Target because of her money problems.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s also no truth to such rumors because the actress\u2019 net worth is roughly around $160 million. She has just completed a series of successful projects, namely, \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d and \u201cThe Breadwinner,\u201d which generated huge sums of money.\n\nMeanwhile, Jolie was also spotted at Target with her two kids, Shiloh, and Vivienne in August. The trio wanted to buy food at the store, but immediately left Target after they learned that it was no longer available.\n\nGossip Cop also stressed the fact that there\u2019s no truth to the claims made by the sister sites because even their statements contradicted each other. Last week, Radar Online quoted their source, \u201cWalking around with her shopping cart makes her feel normal again.\u201d\n\nNational Enquirer, on the other hand, wrote, \u201cWalking around with her shopping cart makes her feel happy.\u201d\n\nBut regardless of where Jolie wants to shop, the most important thing is that she gets to spend time with her six children. The single mom has joint custody of her kids with Brad Pitt. The actor only has visitation rights to see their children, but all six of them are living with Jolie under one roof.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/facebook-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-combat-misinformation.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/01/23/coronavirus-pets.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/29/angelina-jolie.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/there-are-growing-global-doubts-about-the-transparency-AFP_1QN6F7.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/03/05/massachusetts-senator-elizabeth-warrens-withdrawal-makes-the-democratic.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/10/12/louis-rocha-president-of-the-uaw-local-5960.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/golds-gym.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/03/convalescent-plasma-the-fluid-in-blood-teeming-with.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/kristi_l._noem_113th_congress.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/29/angelina-jolie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/angelina-jolies-secret-shopping-fix-not-target-source-says-2635077", "title": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u2018Secret Shopping Fix\u2019 Is Not Target, Source Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie secret shopping fix, angelina jolie shops target, angelina jolie movies, angelina jolie financial problems, angelina jolie brad pitt divorce, brad pitt angelina jolie kids, angelina jolie movies, angelina jolie dating, brad pitt dating", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/angelina-jolies-secret-shopping-fix-not-target-source-says-2635077", "title": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u2018Secret Shopping Fix\u2019 Is Not Target, Source Says", "description": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201csecret shopping fix\u201d is not Target and frequenting the place does not mean she is broke.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/29/angelina-jolie.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/29/angelina-jolie.jpg", "height": 396, "width": 594, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Camille Heimbrod", "modified_time": "2017-12-30T04:38:16-05:00", "published_time": "2017-12-30T04:38:16-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u2018Secret Shopping Fix\u2019 Is Not Target, Source Says", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/angelina-jolies-secret-shopping-fix-not-target-source-says-2635077", "description": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201csecret shopping fix\u201d is not Target and frequenting the place does not mean she is broke.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/29/angelina-jolie.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "angelina jolie secret shopping fix, angelina jolie shops target, angelina jolie movies, angelina jolie financial problems, angelina jolie brad pitt divorce, brad pitt angelina jolie kids, angelina jolie movies, angelina jolie dating, brad pitt dating", "author": "Camille Heimbrod", "description": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u201csecret shopping fix\u201d is not Target and frequenting the place does not mean she is broke."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514626696.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
