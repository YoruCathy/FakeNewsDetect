Highly detailed, movie-ruining spoilers.\n\n\u201cSomewhere out there, there\u2019s an 8-year-old girl dreaming of becoming a criminal,\u201d Debbie Ocean, played by Sandra Bullock, tells her mirrored reflection in one of the standout moments of \u201cOcean\u2019s 8,\u201d the highly anticipated sequel to Steven Soderbergh\u2019s iconic heist films. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this for her.\u201d\n\nThe film gives budding bad girls everywhere role models to look up to, but just how accurate is the example they depict?\n\nDuring her time in prison (five years, eight months and 12 days, to be exact), Bullock \u2015 erm, sorry, Ocean \u2015 painstakingly maps out a convoluted strategy to steal $150 million in jewels by nabbing the iconic Cartier \u201cToussaint\u201d diamond necklace off the neck of a famous actress at the Met Gala. Bullock writes the whole thing down on one very wrinkly sheet of paper, so viewers know she\u2019s not messing around.\n\nWhen granted parole, the savvy con artist wastes no time rendezvousing with her old partner-in-crime Cate Blanchett \u2015 ugh, right, Lou \u2015 to execute the plot and get that necklace. They bring on five more very skilled swindlers to help carry out their Gordian heist. No boys allowed.\n\nOver the course of a delightful one hour and 50 minutes, Sandra and friends demonstrate that with teamwork, a few million dollars and freakishly good luck, women can steal anything! But before you join a ragtag lady gang and hold up your local jewelry store, let\u2019s take a minute to consider how feasible this whole con job truly is.\n\nCould a 3D printer really produce a zirconium replica of a five-pound diamond necklace? Would a Hollywood starlet actually take a random art dealer as her date to the Met Ball? We asked a random assortment of (kinda sorta) experts these probing questions, and much more, below.\n\nHere\u2019s a fact-checked rundown of the \u201cOcean\u2019s 8\u201d heist:\n\nStep 1: Get the look.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cA lot of celebrities are crazy, so yeah, I think that could actually happen.\u201d\n\nThe kickoff of the entire heist hinges on the look. Basically, Bullock decides she needs Anne Hathaway\u2019s character \u2015 a major Hollywood starlet and host of the year\u2019s uber prestigious Met Gala \u2015 to wear the $150 million Cartier \u201cToussaint\u201d diamond necklace, previously locked in a vault 50 feet underground, to the big celebrity fete at New York\u2019s most prestigious museum.\n\n(So they can steal it, of course.)\n\nTo do that, Bullock recruits a designer to her team to convince Hathaway to don the big ol\u2019 jewels in the first place. Bullock lands on Helena Bonham-Carter for the job, a washed up \u201990s \u201cit\u201d designer who is millions of dollars in debt but is still somehow in the good graces of Anna Wintour.\n\nSo here\u2019s how they convince Hathaway \u2015 who, again, is one of the hottest stars of the moment \u2015 to choose a random ass designer for the big night: Bullock directs Bonham-Carter to appear in public with Dakota Fanning, i.e. Hathaway\u2019s famous person nemesis who plays no further role in this movie. They snap a photo of the brief encounter and hope a Page 6 placement (a) makes Hathaway think Fanning is attempting to hire Bonham-Carter for Met styling purposes and (b) that, as a result, she becomes jealous enough to scoop Bonham-Carter up as her own designer.\n\nSure enough, it works.\n\nAccording to Alexandra Miles, a celebrity nanny concierge who\u2019s worked with her fair share of actresses on the nights of big events, it\u2019s conceivable that a celebrity of Hathaway\u2019s caliber would opt for a lesser celebrated designer just to irk a rival celeb. \u201cA lot of celebrities are crazy, so yeah, I think that could actually happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a lot of big, celebrity rivalries that become very high school.\u201d\n\nStep 2: 3D printers are a girl\u2019s best friend.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cWe\u2019re probably not there yet.\u201d\n\nSarah Paulson, aka the heist team\u2019s \u201cfence,\u201d acquires a very fancy 3D printing machine that arrives with a pair of connected, high-tech glasses. The glasses can scan any object and upload their structure to the cloud \u2015 unless you attempt to use them while underground in a Cartier vault, as Bonham-Carter learns. (Due to the terrible internet service in vaults, of course.) The glasses wearer just has to observe the object in question from a variety of angles until the glasses flash \u201c100%\u201d inside the lens, letting Paulson know the deed is done. The fancy printer machine then makes an exact replica of the object in zirconium, which looks an awful lot like diamonds.\n\nContrary to my initial belief that this scene required a wildly implausible technology that was centuries from existing, a New York-based 3D printing lab verified that these glasses-scanner-printer trinities do, in fact, exist. Still, the technology in the film is a bit more advanced than what\u2019s possible in real life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably not there yet,\u201d Christina Perla, co-founder & CEO of Makelab, told HuffPost. \u201cIt might be feasible but there are questions that need to be addressed. Is the scale correct? A lot of times the object needs to be rescaled in a 3D printing program. Also, there might be some holes in the print. If you want a perfect print you have to check it on the computer and make sure there are no holes, no gaps, no inverted triangles. Is it possible? It could be. But it\u2019s a little ahead of our time.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Warner Brothers Entertainment Bullock, Blanchett, Rihanna, Mindy Kaling, Awkwafina, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway and Paulson ride the subway together, looking very suspicious and very cool.\n\nStep 3: Infiltrate the museum.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cNinety percent of the time those guards are just looking at porn on their phones.\u201d\n\nTo infiltrate the Met\u2019s security system in anticipation of the big night, Sandra Bullock decides to cause a breach to stir things up, but just a little one.\n\nWhile Paulson is distracting a guard at the museum by asking for directions, Bullock installs an unsanctioned artwork on the wall, a variation of Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze\u2019s \u201cWashington Crossing the Delaware\u201d with an all-women cast.\n\nEd Harris, a security guard for hire who has worked at art museums and art events in the past, said it\u2019s possible someone could sneak an unsanctioned artwork into the museum space. \u201cI mean, it really depends,\u201d Harris, who is not Ed Harris the actor, told HuffPost. \u201cThe artwork could fit in a backpack or someone could sneak it in a jacket. I would think security is not going to be searching everyone who comes in.\u201d\n\nBut could they install it on a wall? That\u2019s less likely. \u201cThe movies are the movies,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone would probably see that. But I can\u2019t make any promises. Honestly, that doesn\u2019t happen in real life,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, a preparator working at a Los Angeles art gallery, who prefers to remain anonymous, said he believes someone could easily hang up an unsanctioned artwork in a gallery or museum, adding, \u201c90 percent of the time those guards are just looking at porn on their phones.\u201d\n\nBullock\u2019s act of art vandalism is written up in the press as a stunt by renowned, anonymous street artist Banksy. How likely is it that an art blog would credit a work to Banksy without verifying it first? \u201cTypically, Banksy announces his new artworks on his website, so we would not report something as a definitive new Banksy unless he had claimed it as his own,\u201d Sarah Cascone, associate editor at artnet News, told HuffPost.\n\n\u201cBut an all-female \u2018Washington Crossing the Delaware\u2019 being hung guerrilla-style next to the real deal would be a news story regardless,\u201d Cascone said. \u201cWe would probably publish a story that included speculation over whether or not Banksy was responsible. In the past, however, I have worked with editors who would be eager to capitalize on the Banksy name for a big headline, even without verification, so it\u2019s not the most unrealistic thing.\u201d\n\nStep 4: Take out the trash, steal all the security secrets.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cRihanna can accomplish anything.\u201d\n\nFirst, Awkwafina (resident pickpocket) steals a badge from a cleaning crew, obtaining access to the building where a *very important security meeting* is happening in response to the Met Banksy debacle. Second, Rihanna (resident hacker) dresses as a janitor, uses the stolen badge to get into the building and proceeds to stick a recording device onto a trash can while pretending to take out the garbage during that *very important security meeting.*\n\nMission: accomplished. Now they know all the security secrets!\n\nCould it happen? Surely. Rihanna can accomplish anything she sets her genius mind on. Don\u2019t fight me on this. No expert information needed.\n\nCourtesy Warner Brothers Entertainment Paulson, Bullock and Rihanna deep in plot mode.\n\nStep 5: Puppy love, aka the Great Wheaten Terrier Phishing Scam.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cHmm.\u201d\n\nSo, we\u2019re still on the whole security thing. Rihanna looks up a man who handles surveillance at The Met on Facebook and finds out he fucking loves Wheaten Terriers. So she creates a faux Wheaten fan site and goads the guy into clicking on its link with an onslaught of cute puppy pics. Because of Rihanna\u2019s mythic hacking powers, this one click activates the desktop camera in his office and grants her access to everything on his computer, including files outlining the security cameras in The Met. (Also, there\u2019s a map on his office wall outlining the camera arrangement. Dude is not good at covert surveillance.)\n\nShe ultimately uses this information to locate an at least nine-foot area blind spot next to the Met\u2019s women\u2019s bathroom, which will later allow Awkwafina to pull some pickpocket magic with no cameras to catch her.\n\nI reached out to celebrity dog trainer Brandon Macmillan to ask how likely a dog lover would be to click on such a clearly phishy link. (The text was written in Comic Sans!) His publicist, however, stopped responding before I could ask the question. I also posted on the Wheaten forum on Reddit, asking the community whether their love of Wheatens is so ardent they would click any link for the mere possibility of seeing their furry faces. I only got one response:\n\nReddit Screenshot The lone, sad reply to my Reddit query.\n\nHmm.\n\nStep 6: Go Vogue.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cCompletely inconceivable.\u201d\n\nSarah Paulson \u2015 an ex-con turned stay-at-home mom \u2015 interviews for an open position at Vogue. Because she\u2019s shady, she fakes some stellar references and cover letters in preparation. Fortunately for Sarah, Wintour cannot personally vet her because she\u2019s immersed in a Roger Federer tennis match. Despite not being able to pronounce \u201cgala,\u201d Paulson is hired on the spot. She also starts the job that same day!\n\nMultiple reporters and editors employed at various Conde Nast publications including Vogue turned down my request for on-the-record comment. However, one brave soul volunteered his opinion that it is completely inconceivable that a Conde Nast publication would hire someone on the spot without first checking her references and confirming with the higher-ups. He prefers to remain anonymous, citing potential career ramifications for this bold statement.\n\nPaulson uses her new position to peek the seating arrangements for the big night, and learns that Hathaway doesn\u2019t yet have a date!\n\nStep 7: Matchmaker, matchmaker.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cThat would totally never happen.\u201d\n\nHathaway needs a date. And Bullock realizes that date should be her very own ex-boyfriend, a sketchy art dealer whose fuckery landed her in jail in the first place. So she works with (now Vogue employee) Paulson to invite the ex to a dinner she knows Hathaway will be attending. The two sit next to one another, hit it off, and voila! The most famous actress in the country is bringing an art dealer her date.\n\nCelebrity nanny concierge Miles is dubious that a major actress would bring a lowly art dealer as her date to the gala \u2015 no offense, art dealers. \u201cThat would totally never happen,\u201d she said. (It is worth noting, however, that Jennifer Lawrence is rumored to be dating an art dealer.)\n\nBut there\u2019s an even more serious red flag here. According to Jamie Feldman, a HuffPost reporter who\u2019s covered the Met Ball red carpet in the past, celebrities hardly ever bring random dates \u2015 i.e., not a longterm partners \u2015 to the event. \u201cThey are seated with the designers who dress them,\u201d Feldman said.\n\nStep 8: The mystery of magnets.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cI will focus on the implausibility of this other detail because I don\u2019t understand the magnets.\u201d\n\nBonham-Carter learns, while Hathaway is getting primped for the big night, that the Toussaint diamond necklace can only be removed from the celebrity\u2019s neck by using a special magnet, introduced by the hella buff Mossad agent hired to guard the Cartier gems.\n\nYou see, this whole time, the group has been planning on somehow plucking the necklace (hey Awkwafina!) right off Hathaway during the gala. But they did not plan for this magnet business.\n\nLuckily, Rihanna has a little sister who is a magnet genius and figures out some contingency plan I can\u2019t even begin to rehash. Over the phone, Rihanna discusses \u201cpolymagnet spring\u201d things with her sibling, who has perfect cell service despite being on the subway. Hmm. I will focus on the implausibility of this other detail because I don\u2019t understand the magnets.\n\nSide note: In the Mossad agent scene, Hathaway is doing her own makeup for the gala?!?! Celebrity nanny concierge Miles agreed with me: This would \u201cnever happen.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Warner Brothers Entertainment Hathaway doing her own makeup for the damn Met Gala while Bonham-Carter (like all of us) looks on aghast.\n\nStep 9: We\u2019ll need to see some ID.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cI\u2019m still reeling over the magnets.\u201d\n\nBullock and Paulson work together to get the Ocean\u2019s 8 crew fake identities for the gala and ensure they\u2019re on the list for the big night. They get fake IDs and fancy dresses, too. This is so easily accomplished in the \u201cOcean\u2019s\u201d universe that I\u2019m not even going to second-guess it. I\u2019m still reeling over the magnets.\n\nStep 10: Become a caterer, and bring poison.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cFully depends on the public\u2019s perceived importance of the guest at hand.\u201d\n\nBlanchett, disguised as a nutritionist hired for the night, slips a little bit of vomit-inducing liquid into Hathaway\u2019s vegan soup. Hathaway slurps it up and promptly runs to the bathroom to barf.\n\nJenna Amatulli, a HuffPost reporter who worked as a caterer in 2011, was skeptical that the soup poisoning could be executed unnoticed. \u201cThe mysterious substance in the soup would be hard to pull off without having someone on the inside who is complicit,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Sean Perry, a caterer with various elite catering companies throughout New York, the success of Blanchett\u2019s plan \u201cfully depends on the public\u2019s perceived importance of the guest at hand.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated: \u201cWould someone like me allow her ploy to affect someone so well-liked as Sir Elton John? Absolutely not. But if her attempted trickery targeted someone more loathsome, such as political luminaries, her actions would not only be purposefully unnoticed, but most likely encouraged.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Warner Brothers Entertainment Bullock feeds Blanchett at Veselka in New York. Going to mark this as feasible because you have to believe in something in this cruel world!\n\nStep 11: There\u2019s the rub.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cI think it\u2019d totally be possible to knick this.\u201d\n\nOK, things are heating up! Awkwafina, dressed as a bathroom attendant, locks all the other stalls in the bathroom, so she has Hathaway in there *alone*. She then soothes the frantic vomitress by rubbing her neck \u2015 and demagnetizing the diamond necklace in the process! She pockets the jewels as poor Hathaway pukes her Hathaguts out into the toilet.\n\nJ.D. Dillard is the writer and director of \u201cSleight\u201d \u2015 which, yes, is about sleight of hand. He also dabbles in the art himself. When asked about the plausibility of Awkwafina\u2019s big move, he replied, \u201cSo my first thought is five pounds seems a little heavy \u2014 turns out that\u2019s the weight of my Nespresso machine. I think it\u2019d totally be possible to knick this \u2014 but transporting it without it visibly weighing down your clothing is another thing.\u201d\n\nLuckily, Awkwafina doesn\u2019t hold on to the jewels for too long.\n\nStep 12: Dirty dishes.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cIt\u2019s a shit-show when dinner is over.\u201d\n\nAwkwafina takes the necklace and \u2015 in the blindspot carefully mapped out by Bullock and Rihanna \u2015 drops it onto a busboy\u2019s cart wheeling dirty dishes into the kitchen. To reiterate, she just drops the diamonds, uncovered, amongst all the nasty dirty dishes and food bits.\n\n\u201cI think the necklace on a cart of dirty dishes could easily happen,\u201d Amatulli said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shit-show when dinner is over and the staff is pacing their clean-off.\u201d\n\nPerry, however, offered a different interpretation. Because caterers often \u201ccan barely afford a Metro card, let alone a meal,\u201d as he put it, he hypothesized that a diamond necklace would surely be noticed when a caterer or busboy snuck a taste of the fancy leftovers.\n\nCourtesy Warner Brothers Entertainment The schemers, schemin'.\n\nStep 13: Break it down.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018long, detailed process\u2019 that could probably not be executed in a bathroom.\u201d\n\nMindy Kaling \u2015 a diamond expert dressed as a dishwasher who\u2019s been here the whole time! \u2015 takes the tray of dirty dishes and washes the Toussaint diamond off in the sink. She then surreptitiously takes the $150 million accessory to the employee bathroom in the back of the kitchen.\n\nShe sits on the toilet and pulls down the baby changing table \u2015 which has been transformed into a full-blown diamond inspection station! Kaling then breaks down the Toussaint necklace into nine pieces, eight to distribute amongst the ladies and one to frame that sketchy art dealer.\n\nJack Sutton, the owner of Jack Sutton Fine Jewelry in New Orleans \u2015 who, full disclosure, is my uncle \u2015 said that he would be able to cut up a $150 million necklace \u201cif it would be more desirable and profitable that way.\u201d However, he said it\u2019s a \u201clong, detailed process\u201d that could probably not be executed in a bathroom.\n\nHe added that if the jewels needed to be cleaned, a \u201ckitchen sink would work.\u201d\n\nStep 14: Search party.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cShe had some time to prep them on carrying jewelry weighing the same amount as a baby Maltese dog.\u201d\n\nAt this point, the agents assigned to guard the Toussaint diamond necklace notice it\u2019s missing from Hathaway\u2019s neck. They place the entire museum on lockdown to search for it.\n\nDuring this time, Paulson slips the fake zirconium replica of the necklace into the pool in the Met\u2019s Temple of Dendur. She then cries out that she found the missing jewels and the frantic search comes to an abrupt halt.\n\nHathaway puts on the fake necklace and the party resumes. (They don\u2019t show the Mossad guard removing the necklace later that evening, but it seems he doesn\u2019t realize the special magnet thingy is no longer necessary?)\n\nAwkwafina then surreptitiously passes out small chunks of the real Toussaint necklace to each member of the crew. They have been remade into earrings, bracelets and pendants to throw others off the scent. (The scent of diamonds.)\n\nThis part of the heist, Dillard believes, seems tenable. \u201cIf there\u2019s some system in place, I feel like she can... easily pass pieces to the others on the team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hope being she had some time to prep them on carrying jewelry weighing the same amount as a baby Maltese dog.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Warner Brothers Entertainment Tag yourself. I'm the Helena!\n\nStep 15: Fanning old flames.\n\nHow plausible? \u201cHair is like 70 percent of how I recognize people.\u201d\n\nBullock, also attending the gala but disguised in a blonde wig, waits for her ex beau to come to the bar. She then knocks into him and slips a small string of diamonds into his jacket pocket, thus framing him for the whole thing. He gives a brief \u2015 wait, was that? no, couldn\u2019t be \u2015 glance and then resumes his partying.\n\nClaire Fallon, a HuffPost reporter and person who has run into exes in the past, says she too might not recognize a former lover if he had such a dramatic hair change. \u201cThe wig would honestly throw me off a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cHair is like 70 percent of how I recognize people.\u201d\n\nStep 16: Ummm, wait what?\n\nHow plausible? \u201cThat\u2019s what you get for being greedy, Cate!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where things get even crazier and the whole plot actually falls apart.\n\nWhile museum security was busy frantically searching for the Toussaint diamond, Blanchett and Qin Shaobo, who played acrobat Yen in \u201cOcean\u2019s 11-13,\u201d sneak into the actual Met costume exhibition to \u2015 surprise! \u2015 steal more jewels!\n\nShaobo somersaults his way through the exhibit, grabbing up all the European royalty-themed jewels along the way. He puts them in a plastic baggie which he then attaches to a toy submarine. Cate Blanchett reels it in with a remote control through a moat that\u2019s part of the exhibition.\n\nHere lies the biggest plot hole of the film. Shaobo then replaces the stolen jewels with zirconium lookalikes, ostensibly made in the same 3D printer that yielded the necklace. But none of the \u201cOcean\u2019s 8\u201d crew ever did the glasses scanning thing with these jewels! The only one who saw the exhibition prior to its opening was Hathaway, who does a cute little promo video advertising the show. But she\u2019s certainly not wearing the prominent scanner glasses we 3D printing experts know and love.\n\nMaybe, I thought, the con artists somehow used Hathaway\u2019s promo video to make copies of the royal jewels. But Makelab\u2019s Perla confirmed that the 3D scanning glasses could not take stock of objects on film. Rather, the actual goods must be scanned so the glasses can record their depth and size. Sadly, this ruins the entire plot of the movie because there is no way Blanchett could be holding that bag-o-fake-jewels. That\u2019s what you get for being greedy, Cate!\n\nThere you have it. The plot of \u201cOcean\u2019s 8,\u201d thrilling and impressive as it may look, is beyond unfeasible \u2015 it\u2019s straight up impossible. Stay in school, kids. The grifter life is not sustainable no matter how good Rihanna makes it look! (Really good.)\n\nOh yes, and eventually Hathaway turns to the dark side and gets in on the grown-up bling ring herself. Hence \u201cOcean\u2019s 8,\u201d if you were keeping count.
