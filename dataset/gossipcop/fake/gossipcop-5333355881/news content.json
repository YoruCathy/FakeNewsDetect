It\u2019s fine, I\u2019m used to you cancelling on me, it\u2019s become ur staple! (sic).\u201d\n\nAnd Harris also dragged her into his public feud with Taylor Swift, after she started dating Tom Hiddleston and it was revealed that she had written the lyrics for his Rihanna collaboration \u2018This Is What You Came For\u2019.\n\nHe wrote at the time: \u201dI figure if you\u2019re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do.\n\n\u201dI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry. I won\u2019t allow it (sic).\u201d\n\nPerry said they hadn\u2019t spoken since but has now revealed when they met at the Vanity Fair Oscars party this year, they decided to forget about the past and Harris asked her to collaborate on new song \u2018Feels\u2019, which appeared on his recent album \u2018Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe told \u2018On Air With Ryan Seacrest\u2019, Katy said: \u201dWe\u2019d had little falling outs here and there. We\u2019d had some public Twitter spats \u2026 Time to put all that behind us.\n\n\u201dWe just bumped into each other and he said, \u2018I think I have a song that you should come check out\u2019. I was like \u2018cool\u2019 because we had always meant to work together for years and years and years. I came to the studio and he played me a bunch of unfinished but really solid moments for his new record.\n\n\u201dThen he played me this one part for this new song called \u2018Feels\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Oh yeah\u2019. This is like my favourite song off the record. I was just down to do it. I\u2019ve always wanted to collaborate with him for years and years and years.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Perry recently revealed that she has delayed the start of her \u2018Witness\u2018 world tour.", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_harrisperrycomp_getty_1000x635.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_harrisperrycomp_getty_1000x635-696x442.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_harrisperrycomp_getty_1000x635.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Damian Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/katy-perry-ends-six-year-beef-calvin-harris-2128100", "title": "Katy Perry ends six year beef with Calvin Harris", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0has finally buried the hatchet with Calvin Harris after they fell out six years ago.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Katy Perry ends six year beef with Calvin Harris | NME", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0has finally buried the hatchet with Calvin Harris after they fell out six years ago.", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/katy-perry-ends-six-year-beef-calvin-harris-2128100", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_harrisperrycomp_getty_1000x635.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_harrisperrycomp_getty_1000x635.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2017-08-24T08:13:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Katy Perry\u00a0has finally buried the hatchet with Calvin Harris after they fell out six years ago.", "title": "Katy Perry ends six year beef with Calvin Harris | NME", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_harrisperrycomp_getty_1000x635.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozv4q2ov3Mk?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1503562424.0, "source": "http://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
