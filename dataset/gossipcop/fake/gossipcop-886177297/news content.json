Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place,\" she said, adding, \"As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.\"\n\nA representative for Warner Brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for ABC, the network on which the show airs, referred a request for comment to Warner Brothers, since the incident deals with production.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Warner Brothers released a statement confirming that production on season four of the show had been suspended and \"appropriate responsive action\" would be taken following a \"thorough investigation.\"\n\nTwo days later, Chris Harrison, the host of the Bachelor franchise, urged fans to \"be patient\" and apologized for \"any inconvenience and disappointment\" caused by the show's suspension.\n\nLast week, ABC released the names of several Bachelor in Paradise contestants. In addition to Olympios, they included Raven Gates, Alexis Waters, Jasmine Goode and DeMario Jackson.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017, ABC Radio.
