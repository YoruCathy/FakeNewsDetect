I made that b**** famous.\u201d He claimed to have sought Taylor\u2019s approval before using her in the song, but her camp denied it.\n\nAnd Taylor wasn\u2019t done on the song, as she also references the phone call that Kim claimed to have recorded with Taylor approving the lyrics. The pop star sings, \u201cAnd therein lies the issue/Friends don\u2019t try to trick you/Get you on the phone and mind-twist you/And so I took an ax to a mended fence.\u201d Yikes.\n\nShe even goes as far as to diss Kanye for no longer having Jay Z on his side, after the two had a falling out reportedly over money as well as Kanye\u2019s relationship with Kim. Taylor sings, \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only friend you\u2019ve lost lately/Mm mmm/If only you weren\u2019t so shady.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-622555618.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jwoww-coparenting-roger-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-635165670.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/becca-kufrin-ben-higgins-phone-probe-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-11.37.31-AM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-2.18.36-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-633868912.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jax-taylor-tom-sandoval-wedding-regret-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-612327702.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-633868908.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kevin-dobson-rhylee-gerber-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ben-higgins-engagement-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kevin-dobson-cheap-or-chic-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/herotaylor.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/herotaylor.jpg?fit=1200%2C593&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-17-at-2.57.44-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-633868900.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/herotaylor.jpg?fit=1200%2C593&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["November"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/taylor-swift-new-song-cant-have-nice-things-diss-kanye-west-kim-kardashian/", "title": "Taylor Swift Slams Kanye West & Kim Kardashian In New Diss Track", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Taylor Swift is out for revenge!
