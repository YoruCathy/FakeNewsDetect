It is also, of course, designed to get her that paycheck. You might call the way it goes about attaining this goal brazen for anyone else but Rihanna: Tempting accusations of boringness, hackiness, and crimes against art, the song offers a hook that practically parodies pop\u2019s love of repetition\u2014and then repeats it, a lot. But there\u2019s something fascinating about the tune, something that elevates it beyond ringtone status. It doesn\u2019t really go anywhere. It approximates what work feels like.\n\nThe producer Boi-1da\u2019s bright, bubbly beat creates a see-sawing sensation out of a few sounds. A keyboard ping anchors the downbeat and then climbs up, up, down, down, returning to its starting point. Electronic notes on the low end burble out a more asymmetrical pattern recalling reggae, but they too have the general shape of ascending and descending. The percussion is subtle, rendered with a skittering sound that recalls the shaking of a kettle. When Rihanna\u2019s voice comes in, so do some signifiers of \u201980s and \u201990s dance and rap: digital handclaps, distorted shouting. It all adds up to the feeling of a lot of bustling in one spot\u2014activity, but not necessarily movement.\n\nRihanna\u2019s hook conjures a different kind of monotony. After a few quick notes in yet another up-and-back pattern, she gets stuck, like a needle in a groove, for \u201cwork work work work work.\u201d There\u2019s no stopping this getting in your head. \u201cWork\u201d becomes \u201cdirt\u201d becomes \u201clove\u201d becomes \u201cturn,\u201d but the modulations don\u2019t matter\u2014Rihanna has found her next great nonsense syllable, another \u201cooh na na\u201d or \u201cella ella eh.\u201d Her singing in the verses, where she dresses down some guy who isn\u2019t meeting her expectations, is actually rather pretty. I\u2019ve seen a lot of commenters say she\u2019s copying the mumbling trend that\u2019s taken hold among younger pop vocalists like Ariana Grande, but the truth is that Rihanna helped popularize the notion of liquifying words in the name of catchiness.\n\nAs for Drake\u2019s verse, it strikes me as pretty terrible\u2014the disappointed lounge singer schtick from \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d but without the silken melody or sense of surprise. \u201cIf you had a twin I would still choose you\u201d is the only real attempt at a memorable line. Whatever. Drake being as popular as he is right now will be yet another incentive for radio playlist makers to keep this song in rotation, possibly giving it the activating energy needed to become a hit.\n\nAnd to be sure, it will need a good deal of exposure to reach the success levels of Rihanna\u2019s previous smashes. The song\u2019s undeniably catchy, but it also has a strangely unfinished quality. To me, though, that\u2019s its charm. The verses, choruses, and bridge mostly bleed into each other, forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes. Boi-1da does create some sense of escalation\u2014another drum beat for the second chorus, flashes of flutes, autotuned harmonies, and far-off piano. But the shifts are subtle and fleeting. Unlike a lot of radio pop, \u201cWork\u201d is about small modulations, a singer and a producer and a rapper plugging along as we all must do. At the end, the song makes the unfashionable move of simply fading out. Rihanna put in her three and a half minutes of work; now pay her what you owe her.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
