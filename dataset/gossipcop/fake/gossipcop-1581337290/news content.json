We\u2019ve got the EXCLUSIVE details why she\u2019s not shocked by their separation.\n\n\n\nJennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux\u2018s sudden split shocked the world, with the exception of her arch-enemy Angelina Jolie. While the 42-year-old humanitarian has long been blamed for the former Friends star\u2019s 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, 54, she\u2019s now feeling a sense of vindication that she had nothing to do with America\u2019s Sweetheart\u2019s latest heartbreak. \u201cAngelina makes a point to not read or follow any celebrity gossip, but it was inevitable she would hear about Jennifer and Justin\u2019s break-up at some point. Angelina has never cared for Jen, even before she started dating Brad. She\u2019s always thought of her as very vanilla and shallow, and not on her level intellectually. Whereas Justin is quirky and edgy and super smart, so Angelina wasn\u2019t surprised at all to learn they had split,\u201d a source close to the Maleficent star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nWhile the now former couple vowed to remain close friends despite the breakup, numerous sources out of his NYC circle seem to be feeding the media that artsy Justin felt stifled by Jen\u2019s easy, breezy California lifestyle and longed to be back home full-time in the Big Apple. He always did seem like a somewhat strange fit for Jennifer, as the actor constantly wore nothing but black motorcycle jackets and had a gold gun pendant around his neck at all times. Everything about him seemed to exude dark, edgy rebel while the actress is a sunny yoga loving Cali-gal.\n\nAngelina has long been blamed for Jen\u2019s heartbreaking split from Brad after they allegedly fell in love while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while the actor was still very married. Even though Brangelina was together for 11 years, married in 2014 and has six children together, the United Nations humanitarian is reveling in the fact that she had nothing to do with Jennifer\u2019s current marriage demise.\n\n\u201cAngelina can\u2019t help feeling a degree of vindication, after all, she was painted as this evil home wrecker who lured Brad away from Jen, who was portrayed as this sweet and nice, poor helpless victim. But nobody can point the finger at Angelina this time, or any other \u2018wicked\u2019 third party, as by all accounts neither Justin or Jen were cheating. So this time around Jennifer can\u2019t blame somebody else for the failure of her marriage. It\u2019s all on her and Justin,\u201d our insider adds. Well, at least there won\u2019t be any more \u201cTeam Aniston\u201d and Team Jolie\u201d t-shirts being sold after Jen\u2019s latest heartbreak.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Jen will go on to find true love again after her split from Justin?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/angelina-jolie-not-surprised-about-jen-justin-split-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/angelina-jolie-not-surprised-about-jen-justin-split-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Fangelina-jolie-reacts-jennifer-aniston-split-justin-theroux-vindicated%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3004255&comment_count=25", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/angelina-jolie-not-surprised-about-jen-justin-split-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/20/angelina-jolie-reacts-jennifer-aniston-split-justin-theroux-vindicated/", "title": "Angelina Jolie \u2018Not Surprised\u2019 By Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Split: Why She Feels \u2018Vindicated\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Angelina Jolie isn't shocked by Jennifer Aniston's separation from Justin Theroux, and she feels vindicated that she had nothing to do with the split.", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie \u2018Not Surprised\u2019 By Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Split: Why She Feels \u2018Vindicated\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/20/angelina-jolie-reacts-jennifer-aniston-split-justin-theroux-vindicated/", "description": "Angelina Jolie is feeling vindicated by Jennifer Aniston\u2019s split from husband Justin Theroux.
