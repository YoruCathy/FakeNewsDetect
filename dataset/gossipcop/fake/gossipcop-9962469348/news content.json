An insider tells In Touch exclusively that the iconic singer, 68, is preparing a prenup to make sure his daughter is protected financially should the controversial duo tie the knot.\n\n\u201cLionel\u2019s preparing a $200 million prenup,\u201d the insider tells In Touch exclusively. \u201cHe hates Scott and has tried to tell Sofia to leave him, but she won\u2019t.\u201d With an estimated net worth of $200 million, Lionel is seeing fit that his daughter\u2019s beau never sees any of it, once she inherits it. \u201cLionel is a multimillionaire and Sofia has a huge trust fund,\u201d another source adds. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want Scott getting a cent of it!\u201d\n\nOf course, Scott doesn\u2019t really have any reason to be a gold digger; with 15 seasons of reality TV and countless hosting gigs under his belt, he\u2019s earned an impressive estimated net worth of $15 million himself.\n\nIn the past, Lionel has made his feelings about Scott and Sofia\u2019s relationship known \u2014 while trying his best not to alienate his teenage daughter. \u201cShe\u2019s 19. When you\u2019re 19, you know everything. Is it going to be for life? I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said in February. \u201cBut for right now, it\u2019s just a phase and I\u2019m going to stand real still in the corner, get me a good drink and not make too much noise.\u201d\n\nDespite Scott\u2019s long-standing issues with monogamy \u2014 and Lionel\u2019s objections \u2014 Scott and Sofia recently celebrated their one-year anniversary. The two were first linked to one another in May 2017 after they were spotted getting cozy aboard a yacht in Cannes during the city\u2019s revered film festival. The two have pretty much been inseparable ever since, with Sofia even spending a signifcant amount of time with Scott\u2019s three children, Mason, 8, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 3.\n\nFor more on this,
