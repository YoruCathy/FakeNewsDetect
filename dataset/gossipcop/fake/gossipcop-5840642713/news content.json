Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, her \u201clongtime\u201d tour promoter told Billboard, \u201cBy the time all the tickets are sold next week, I\u2019ll be celebrating Taylor\u2019s birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.\u201d But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.\n\nReputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post\u2019s headline, \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,\u201d is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company\u2019s \u201cVerified Fan\u201d program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents\u2019 credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could \u201cimprove [their] position in line to purchase tickets.\u201d And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.\n\n\u201cI paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,\u201d one fan wrote. \u201cNow for the same seats I have to pay about $500.\u201d\n\nIn related news, tickets to Katy Perry\u2019s Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/v690z8c0bm3idrsxuyly.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/v690z8c0bm3idrsxuyly.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://jezebel.com/tickets-to-taylors-reputation-tour-are-not-selling-swif-1821708456", "title": "Tickets to Taylor's Reputation Tour Are Not Selling Swiftly", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "qtdmeMUkQ1jhQhHGFHv6CO2FpKGPcUfc9TYEabpRR0A", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "keywords": "taylor swift, tour, music, new york post, Jezebel", "news_keywords": "taylor swift, tour, music, new york post, Jezebel", "twitter": {"url": "https://jezebel.com/tickets-to-taylors-reputation-tour-are-not-selling-swif-1821708456", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@jezebel", "title": "Tickets to Taylor's Reputation Tour Are Not Selling Swiftly", "description": "Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift\u2019s upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post.
