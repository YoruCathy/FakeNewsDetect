Ethan Hawke revealed to USA Today on Tuesday, Jan. 6, that he and his Taking Lives costar Angelina Jolie still keep in touch \u2014 via holiday cards!\n\n\u201cEvery now and then, I get a Christmas card,\u201d the Boyhood actor, 44, told the paper.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity holiday cards!\n\nHe then reflected on what it was like to work alongside Jolie over ten years ago, before she had even started her romance with now-husband Brad Pitt. In 2003 (when Taking Lives was filmed), Jolie had recently filed for divorce from Billy Bob Thornton and was raising her eldest son Maddox, then 2, on her own.\n\nA year later, the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider actress would meet the love of her life Pitt, with whom she would eventually share six children.\n\nPHOTOS: Brangelina's surprising BFFs!\n\n\u201cI worked with her at a very interesting moment in her life,\u201d Hawke, 44, recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome what she\u2019s doing. People wanted her to be Marilyn Monroe. They wanted her to burn out. She was about as punk rock as a movie star could be. I loved her for it.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Angie's Hollywood transformation\n\nPHOTOS: Celeb couples -- then and now!\n\nHawke praised the Unbroken director for her work as a humanitarian. \u201cShe\u2019s taken all that energy and turned that into being a substantive human being,\u201d the Before Sunrise star noted. \u201cThe fact that Angelina has transcended the way the world objectified her and is making serious films, she deserves all the positive things that are happening.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1420581008_ethan-angelina-zoom.jpg?w=200&h=113&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Ethan-Angelina-2004-467.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1420581008_ethan-angelina-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1420581008_ethan-angelina-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ethan-hawke-is-on-angelina-jolies-christmas-card-list-201561/", "title": "Ethan Hawke Is on Angelina Jolie\u2019s Christmas Card List", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Ethan Hawke praised his Taking Lives costar Angelina Jolie in a new interview, revealing that he's on her Christmas card list!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ethan Hawke Is on Angelina Jolie's Christmas Card List!", "description": "Ethan Hawke praised his Taking Lives costar Angelina Jolie in a new interview, revealing that he's on her Christmas card list!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ethan-hawke-is-on-angelina-jolies-christmas-card-list-201561/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T06:23:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1420581008_ethan-angelina-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1420581008_ethan-angelina-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Celebrity Quotes", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2015-01-07T03:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T06:23:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ethan Hawke praised his Taking Lives costar Angelina Jolie in a new interview, revealing that he's on her Christmas card list!", "title": "Ethan Hawke Is on Angelina Jolie's Christmas Card List!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/1420581008_ethan-angelina-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1420602300.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
