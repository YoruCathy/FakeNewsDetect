Dead and Company tweeted the news about 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe band and Mayer\u2019s next tour stop is Thursday in Orlando. It\u2019s unclear if that show will be postponed as well.\n\nLoynes said all tickets for Tuesday\u2019s show would be honored and later rescheduled as soon as possible.\n\nThe singer\u2019s representatives did not comment on his current condition.\n\nGet The Brief.
