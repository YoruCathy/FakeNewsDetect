The lawsuit accuses Rodriguez of mortgage and insurance fraud, among other things.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s totally out of control,\u201d Cynthia said in another text, \u201cbut I share 2 kids with him so I try to keep e (sic) everything good for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it all ends soon. It\u2019s revolting,\u201d Cynthia added.\n\nRodriguez and Cynthia divorced in 2008 after six years of marriage. The Daily News pointed out that Rodriguez definitely isn\u2019t hurting for cash. He was paid $21 million by the Yankees in 2016 \u2014 the final year of his 10-year, $275 million contract \u2014 without having to play. He currently has a gig as part of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Baseball\u201d team.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much money Rodriguez is required to pay each month for child support, the Daily News said.\n\nHe and Lopez started dating in February 2017, and the two have been high-profile about their coupledom. They sometimes post photos of their newly blended family which consists of his kids and hers; she has 10-year-old twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband Marc Anthony.\n\nRodriguez expressed disgust at the way his former brother-in-law was using his daughters in an effort to turn the media against him for his own gain.
