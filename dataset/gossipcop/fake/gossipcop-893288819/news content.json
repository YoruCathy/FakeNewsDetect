HL learned EXCLUSIVELY that the actor wants a \u2018relaxing\u2019 day with his infants & wife, and even cuter, he STILL can\u2019t believe he\u2019s a parent!\n\nGeorge Clooney, 56, is in for one memorable Father\u2019s Day! After all, a dad never forgets his first one. And although the actor doesn\u2019t want some big celebration on June 18, he\u2019s still apparently super psyched to just spend the whole day bonding with his and Amal Clooney\u2018s, 39, newborn twins Ella and Alexander. For him, quality time is the only gift he needs \u2014 is anyone else\u2019s heart melting?\n\n\u201cGeorge is still in awe that he is a father, and it really hasn\u2019t fully hit him yet that he is going to be celebrating Father\u2019s Day this year as a father himself,\u201d a George insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThe current plans are to stay at home and relax. Make it a complete bed day, and his focus will be on the babies and Amal. They will be getting the attention over him celebrating for himself.\u201d How sweet is that?\n\nSounds like George has the perfect Father\u2019s Day in store, which makes it hard to believe that until recently, he was dead-set on NOT having kids! \u201cI think it\u2019s the most responsible thing you can do, to have kids. It\u2019s not something to be taken lightly,\u201d George told People magazine back in 2006. \u201cI don\u2019t have that gene that people have to replicate.\u201d He also said in an interview with CBS\u2019 This Morning, \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it I suppose, but I haven\u2019t really \u2014 it hasn\u2019t been high on my list,\u201d when asked if he was ever planning on having kids. Talk about a total 180!\n\nNow, George is reportedly absolutely loving fatherhood \u2014 and he\u2019s had a major shift in priorities since he and Amal revealed in February that they were expecting.\u201cThis change is more profound than any change in his life, and he is excited,\u201d George\u2019s father Nick Clooney, 83, revealed soon after Ella and Alexander\u2019s June 6 birth. And already he can\u2019t imagine life without his two bundles of joy. \u201cGeorge feels he\u2019s replaced his carefree way of life with a new, more fulfilling one,\u201d an insider for Life & Style told the magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be majorly hands-on with the kids.\u201d\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think George\u2019s Father\u2019s Day plans sound sweet? Are you hoping to see a picture of the twins soon?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F06%2F16%2Fgeorge-clooney-fathers-day-plans-amal-baby-twins%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2640459", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/george-clooney-amal-clooney-twins-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/george-clooney-amal-clooney-twins-ftr.jpg?w=620", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/george-clooney-amal-clooney-twins-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/06/16/george-clooney-fathers-day-plans-amal-baby-twins/", "title": "George Clooney Planning \u2018Complete Bed Day\u2019 With Amal & Twins On Father\u2019s Day", "meta_data": {"description": "George Clooney's about to celebrate his very 1st Father's Day!
