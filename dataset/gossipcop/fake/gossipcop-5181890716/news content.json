Jamie Foxx is jeopardizing his relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Katie Holmes, by texting his ex. The 50-year-old actor was all smiles as he met up with a beautiful brunette for lunch in LA on Feb.17 \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t Katie, with whom he\u2019d just spent Valentine\u2019s Day. For the second time that week, the Oscar winner was hanging out with Kristin Grannis, the mother of his daughter Annalise. And according to witnesses, Jamie even brought her a gift: a black designer purse.\n\nNow Katie is starting to suspect that they\u2019re more than just friendly exes. \u201cShe recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings \u2014 and him admitting he still loved her,\u201d an insider exclusively tells In Touch of the relationship, which has reportedly caused problems for the actor in the past. And after nearly five years of dating Jamie under the radar following her 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, this latest betrayal is devastating to the 39-year-old actress. \u201cIt\u2019s taken her years to trust Jamie enough to publicly be seen with him,\u201d the insider explains, \u201cand he showed a blatant lack of respect.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nJamie doesn\u2019t want to give up either woman. \u201cHe insisted there was nothing more to the relationship than him and Kristin discussing their daughter,\u201d the insider says. Kristin was also spotted with the actor at a basketball game with friends on Feb. 11. To add insult to injury, the same day Jamie met up with Kristin, he was publicly dismissive of Katie. As he left a Feb. 17 event in Thousand Oaks, CA, he was caught on camera quipping, \u201cIt\u2019s Black History Month\u2026 No white girls till March 1.\u201d\n\nJust one day earlier, Jamie made headlines when he walked away during an ESPN interview after he was asked about spending Valentine\u2019s Day with Katie. \u201cJamie could\u2019ve handled the situation with much more dignity,\u201d the insider admits. \u201cKatie was totally dissed by him.\u201d\n\nStill, Jamie doesn\u2019t want to lose her. \u201cHe\u2019s desperately trying to make their relationship work. He\u2019s planning a make-or-break luxury vacation for them and begging Katie to hear him out,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work and e ort for Jamie to get back into Katie\u2019s good graces, because his behavior is unforgivable.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-1.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-ex.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-dating.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-show.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-ex.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/katie-holmes-baby.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jamie-foxx-ex.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/jamie-foxx-texting-ex-154934/", "title": "Jamie Foxx's Ex Is Threatening His Relationship With Katie Holmes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Three's company!
