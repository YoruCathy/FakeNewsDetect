The suspect did not enter their home.\n\n\u201cA witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim\u2019s vehicle and then flee the location,\u201d an LAPD PIO tells Us. \u201cA second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim\u2019s vehicle.\u201d\n\nThe cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff\u2019s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.\n\nA source tells Us, \u201cThe second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple\u2019s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian\u2019s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey\u2018s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.\n\nThe burglary at Kardashian and West\u2019s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star\u2019s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.\n\nKardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. \u201cEver since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,\u201d she explained.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-suspect-zoom.jpg?w=250", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kanye-burgalized-cars.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1305px%2C686px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized.jpg?w=218", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1305px%2C686px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized/", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Cars Burglarized", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's cars were burglarized on Friday, October 20, one year after the reality star's Paris robbery, Us Weekly confirms \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim and Kanye's Cars Burglarized One Year After Paris", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's cars were burglarized on Friday, October 20, one year after the reality star's Paris robbery, Us Weekly confirms \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:23:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1305px%2C686px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1305px%2C686px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-10-20T17:39:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:23:48+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's cars were burglarized on Friday, October 20, one year after the reality star's Paris robbery, Us Weekly confirms \u2014 details", "title": "Kim and Kanye's Cars Burglarized One Year After Paris", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-cars-burglarized.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1305px%2C686px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508521176.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
