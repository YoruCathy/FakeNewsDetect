Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim.\n\n\n\nCarey and Tanaka had split in April, but they're seemingly back together after recently being spotted on multiple dinner dates in Los Angeles. A photo even emerged of the two sharing an intimate kiss while cozying up in a booth. But the National Enquirer is now alleging that the singer is also seeing her ex-spouse. A supposed \"source\" tells the magazine, \"She can't seem to make up her mind which man she wants. She loves Nick, but she's got the hots for Bryan.\"\n\n\n\nThe outlet's dubious insider goes on to purport that Cannon \"came to the rescue\" when Carey initially broke up with Tanaka, and she then \"hooked up with Nick partly to make Bryan jealous\". The seemingly phony source further claims that Tanaka is \"eating out of her hands again\", but \"when things got rocky with Bryan, Mariah runs to Nick\".\n\n\n\nBut despite the magazine's attempt at complicating the singer's love life, a source close to Carey exclusively assures Gossip Cop she's simply \"not dating multiple people\". The tabloid's assertion that she's juggling both Cannon and Tanaka is entirely false. Unfortunately, publishing phony stories about Carey isn't exactly breaking new ground for the Enquirer.\n\n\n\nGossip Cop previously debunked the magazine's fabricated tale about Carey and Tanaka having sex in a restaurant bathroom. We also shot down the tabloid's allegation that Carey used drugs and alcohol before her 2017 New Year's Eve show. This latest report from the frequently discredited out is equally bogus.\n\n\n\n(Gossip Cop)\n\n", "images": ["http://www.mcarchives.com/images/logo.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/fotos/fotos10/211.jpg", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/thumb.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/upload/members/12_small.jpg?uid=4", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/comments.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/upload/members/382_small.jpg?uid=92", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/createanaccount.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/sluit_knop.png", "https://www.mcarchives.com/fotos/fotos10/211.jpg", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/login.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/newmessage.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/editaccount.png", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/facebook.gif", "https://www.adx.nl/update.asp?id=2&code=tDFt457q7u", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/rsslogo.gif", "http://www.mcarchives.com/images/streep.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mcarchives.com/fotos/fotos10/211.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mcarchives.com/index.asp?id=14039", "title": "Mariah not dating both Nick Cannon and Bryan Tanaka", "meta_data": {"description": "Mariah Carey isn't dating both ex-husband Nick Cannon and former backup dancer Bryan Tanaka at the same time, despite a bogus new tabloid report.
