Generally, when one celebrity is announced to be joining another star, the gossip magazines start spinning reports about (untrue) drama behind-the-scenes. So sadly, we won\u2019t be surprised if there are fake news stories filled with made-up quotes from unnamed sources about how Strahan is supposedly upset by Rodriguez\u2019s arrival or is battling the baseball player for scoops. Regardless, from what Gossip Cop hears from a mutual pal and network sources, Strahan is pretty pumped about Rodriguez joining the ABC team.\n\nIn addition to being athletes turned TV personalities, Strahan and Rodriguez have also both been the subject of a slew of inaccurate reports. Gossip Cop recently busted a magazine report that falsely alleged Strahan was feuding with Robin Roberts at \u201cGMA.\u201c As we noted, the reality is the two anchors get along great. And just a week ago, Gossip Cop corrected a tabloid cover story that wrongly maintained Jennifer Lopez was pregnant with Rodriguez\u2019s baby boy. Much like those articles and many others about Strahan and Rodriguez, there\u2019s often a lot of fabricated drama, yet zero truth to the claims.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5a53a824be73bf76263e8fef?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gossip Cop Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-01-michael-strahan-looking-forward-to-working-with-alex-rodriguez-at-abc/", "title": "Michael Strahan 'Looking Forward' To Working With Alex Rodriguez At ABC", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A-Rod is joining ABC, and no one could be happier or \u201clooking forward more\u201d than fellow athlete Michael Strahan.", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "Rumba 106.5, la rumba, tampa, radio, radio en espanol, radio latina, musica latina, Rumba 106.5, la rumba, tampa, radio, radio en espanol, radio latina, musica latina", "og": {"title": "Michael Strahan 'Looking Forward' To Working With Alex Rodriguez At ABC | Rumba 106.5", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://rumba1065.iheart.com/content/2017-06-01-michael-strahan-looking-forward-to-working-with-alex-rodriguez-at-abc/", "description": "A-Rod is joining ABC, and no one could be happier or \u201clooking forward more\u201d than fellow athlete Michael Strahan.", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "Rumba 106.5"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://rumba1065.iheart.com/content/2017-06-01-michael-strahan-looking-forward-to-working-with-alex-rodriguez-at-abc/", "site": "@Rumba1065", "creator": "@Rumba1065", "title": "Michael Strahan 'Looking Forward' To Working With Alex Rodriguez At ABC | Rumba 106.5", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "A-Rod is joining ABC, and no one could be happier or \u201clooking forward more\u201d than fellow athlete Michael Strahan.", "domain": "rumba1065.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Michael Strahan 'Looking Forward' To Working With Alex Rodriguez At ABC | Rumba 106.5", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-01-michael-strahan-looking-forward-to-working-with-alex-rodriguez-at-abc/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "Rumba 106.5, la rumba, tampa, radio, radio en espanol, radio latina, musica latina, Rumba 106.5, la rumba, tampa, radio, radio en espanol, radio latina, musica latina", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8yOS81OTJjMDE4ZDhjMDhlMDMyY2M3YzU2MTMvNTkyYzAxOGQ2NzA5ODQwNDdjN2E4MTZkXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "Rumba 106.5", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "fb": {"pages": 1518345998474288, "app_id": 588619324622531}, "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-01T13:43:00Z", "parsely-author": "Gossip Cop Staff", "parsely-section": "entertainment-news-national-gossip-celeb-etc"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496246400.0, "source": "http://rumba1065.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
