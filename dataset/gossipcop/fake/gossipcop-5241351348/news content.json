The album produced four megahits Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time, She Bop, and All Through the Night. Her next two albums were also successes. Lauper went on to sell more than 25 million albums. Then she faded away. However, Cyndi is far from being a failure. She has worldwide record sales of 50 million and has won Grammy, Emmy, and Tony awards, which is a rare feat.\n\nMichigan native Madonna Louise Ciccone released her first single in 1982 and is still a big name in music 30 years later. She's sold more than 300 million records worldwide. She's the best-selling female recording artist of all time according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Not only is she a successful singer, she's an entrepreneur, actress, author and director. She's become a musical icon and has influenced many of today's young female artists.\n\nSo, why did Cyndi Lauper fade away while Madonna continues to have commercial success and iconic status?", "images": ["https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubacct13477-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1787391795", "https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/8437876_f260.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14093073_f120.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14252139_f120.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/13468393_100.jpg", "https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/13840380_f120.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14733045_f120.jpg", "https://assets.hubstatic.com/x/anon_100.png", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/14646157_f120.jpg", "https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/8437876.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/13664915_f120.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/7848851_100.jpg", "https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/14686758_f120.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27019031&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=hubacct13477-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00136RVP2", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/13043512_f120.jpg", "https://usercontent2.hubstatic.com/8437877_f520.jpg"], "top_img": "https://usercontent1.hubstatic.com/8437876_f260.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Learn Things Web", "Alex Dino", "Kelley Marks", "Sherry Hewins", "Andrea Lawrence", "Liz Elias", "Robert Ortman", "Updated On November"], "canonical_link": "https://spinditty.com/genres/Why-Madonna-Succeeded-Where-Cyndi-Lauper-Failed", "title": "Why Madonna Succeeded Where Cyndi Lauper Failed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Madonna and Cyndi Lauper appeared on the music scene around the same time.
