They\u2019re not dating.\u2019\n\nAnd if anyone was thinking this was a romantic getaway for two then they\u2019d think wrong as Raquelle was also along for the weekend along with a number of other friends.\n\nBut at least she had some good company to take her mind off any possible thoughts of \u2018what if\u2019 when it came to Biebs.\n\nHer break in the country with Caleb came at the same time as her ex Justin Bieber sparked engagment rumours with Hailey Baldwin \u2013 with the couple later confirming the news (Picture: Justin Bieber/Instagram)\n\nJustin officially announced his engagement on Instagram this week, after speculation ran rife, where he posted a black and white photo of him and Hailey hugging with a heartfelt caption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe wrote: \u2018Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindLY. I promise to lead our family with honor and integrity letting Jesus through his Holy Spirit guide us in everything we do and every decision we make.\n\n\u2018My heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first! You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn\u2019t want to spend it with anybody else. You make me so much better and we compliment eachother so well!! Can\u2019t wait for the best season of life yet!.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s funny because now with you everything seems to make sense! The thing I am most excited for is that my little brother and sister get to see another healthy stable marriage and look for the same!!! Gods timing really is literally perfect, we got engaged on the seventh day of the seventh month, the number seven is the number of spiritual perfection, it\u2019s true GOOGLE IT! Isn\u2019t that nuts? By the way I didn\u2019t plan that, anyways My goodness does feel good to have our future secured! WERE GONNA VE BETTER AT 70 BABY HERE WE GO! \u2018\u201dHe who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains FAVOR from the Lord!\u201d This is the year of favor!!!! (sic)\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
