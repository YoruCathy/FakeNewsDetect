Other images also surfaced, showing Thompson and the brunette, leaving and entering a Four Seasons hotel.\n\nA woman claiming she had spent the night with Thompson in New York City also posted, then quickly deleted a sex tape, along with a number of raunchy messages she said she exchanged with the NBA star, TMZ reported earlier. The woman also claimed she was pregnant, the Daily Mirror added. But TMZ subsequently reported that the woman had no connection to Thompson and that she was just trolling him and Kardashian.\n\nBut as if all that weren\u2019t bad enough, TMZ also revealed that Thompson was captured on a surveillance video at a Washington, D.C., hookah lounge in October 2017, kissing and letting himself be groped by at least two women. Kardashian would have been around three months pregnant at the time, TMZ said.\n\nPage Six quoted a Kardashian family source as saying that Khloe was \u201cdevastated when she saw the pictures of Tristan with that girl.\u201d The source said Kardashian went \u201cabsolutely ballistic at him.\u201d\n\nThompson should be back in Cleveland Wednesday, as the Cavaliers have a home game Wednesday night, TMZ said. He had been in New York City over the weekend after the Cavaliers played in Philadelphia Friday night and played the Knicks in New York on Monday.\n\nThe source added to Page Six that a \u201churt\u201d and \u201chumiliated\u201d Khloe was worried for the well-being of her baby.\n\n\u201cHow could he do this, and so publicly, when their baby daughter could arrive within a week?\u201d the source asked.\n\nKhloe Kardashian and her family have yet to say anything about the Thomson cheating allegations. But the source told Page Six that the family wasn\u2019t completely surprised to learn that Thompson might not have been entirely loyal.\n\nAfter all, Thompson broke up with his pregnant girlfriend Jordan Craig in 2016, possibly to date Khloe Kardashian. His son with Craig was born after he started dating Khloe.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that he has a bad reputation, they had warned Khlo\u00e9 about him, he\u2019s done this before,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut she didn\u2019t want to hear it, she loves him.\u201d\n\nThe story is developing.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloekardashian1.jpg?w=1024&h=704", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/khloekardashian1.jpg?w=1024&h=704", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
