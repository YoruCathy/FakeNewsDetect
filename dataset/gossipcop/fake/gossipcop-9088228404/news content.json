The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!\n\nDid Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions? After deciding that she just can\u2019t let go of this hunk, Mariah reportedly decided to make it happen \u2013 an engagement, that is! \u201cWord is Mariah took matters into her own hands,\u201d a source tells OK! magazine, \u201cIt was an unusual proposal but it did the trick. She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she\u2019s ready for them to make their relationship official.\u201d\n\nBryan gave a \u201chearty yes,\u201d as the insider says, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe his luck!\u201d It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby. These two aren\u2019t waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. \u201cMariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,\u201d the insider told OK!, \u201cwhere she and Bryan first went public with their romance.\u201d Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d\n\nMariah\u2019s \u201calso toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,\u201d the source says. \u201cAfter all, she is the queen of Christmas!\u201d Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she\u2019s always wanted, saying \u201cThank God I found you\u201d to her honey, her all? Whenever Mariah decides to get married, don\u2019t forget about us when it comes to the wedding invitations!\n\nThis alleged engagement would be the third time Mariah walked down the aisle, as she was previously married to Tommy Mottola, 68, and Nick Cannon, 37. After dealing with a pair of heartbreakers, MiMi isn\u2019t fooling around, especially when it comes to her $520 million fortune. She\u2019s working on an ironclad prenup, according to OK! magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s had tow failed marriages already,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to take any risks here.\u201d Speaking of Nick, expect to see him during Mariah\u2019s big day.\n\nNick and Mariah\u2019s twins \u2013 son Morocco and daughter Monroe, 6 \u2013 will be featured in his wedding, and sources say Mariah\u2019s thinking of asking Nick to walk her down the aisle. \u201c[He] will always be a big part of her life,\u201d the source added. Considering Mariah, Nick and the twins recently made an adorable appearance at the 2018 Kids\u2019 Choice Awards, it makes total sense that Mariah\u2019s ex would be on hand to see her say \u201cI Do\u201d again.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-propose-ftr.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-propose-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F28%2Fare-mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-engaged-wedding-plans%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3056575", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-propose-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/28/are-mariah-carey-bryan-tanaka-engaged-wedding-plans/", "title": "Mariah Carey Reportedly Proposed To BF Bryan Tanaka With Super Romantic Song: Wedding Plans Revealed", "meta_data": {"description": "Is Mariah Carey about to get married for a third time?
