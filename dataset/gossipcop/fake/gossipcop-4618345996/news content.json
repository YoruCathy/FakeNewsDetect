It's like, we're good, everything's great, what's going on? Am I staying or am I\u2026?\"\n\nIf A-Rod and J-Lo do tie the knot, it seems likely that it'll happen sooner than later. J-Lo asked Fallon how long he dated his wife before their engagement, and Fallon revealed that the couple had been together for three years.\n\n\"That's a lot. I feel like you know after\u2026 fairly quickly. So the rest is just like you being scared and whatever. But don't go by me, I've made tons of mistakes.\"\n\nInterestingly, A-Rod will be a guest on Thursday's episode of The Tonight Show. Could he possibly be planning an on-air proposal?\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple, who have an incredible (and slightly awkward) first-date story.\n\nvia Vanity Fair:\n\n\"She told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,\" Rodriguez says. \"I had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\"\n\n\"So I'm sitting there and he's walking back, and I get a text,\" Lopez continues. \"It says . . . \" She looks significantly at Rodriguez. \"You can tell her!\" he says. \" 'You look sexy AF,' \" she tells me.\"\n\nMORE:\n\nThere's no logical reason why 3 of the NFL's best free agent safeties are still available\n\nMike Trout's broken bat hit an umpire, so he stopped to apologize before running to first\n\nFormer Cavs GM tells story proving LeBron James is a literal basketball genius\n\nJustin Thomas surprised a young fan by letting him hit a shot at TPC Sawgrass\n\nRed Sox manager downplays concern David Price got carpal-tunnel syndrome from Fortnite", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d28a43c2d4a2060fb7ceff387e01c78674e63489/c=0-19-1000-581/local/-/media/2018/05/10/USATODAY/usatsports/jlo.jpg?width=1000&height=562&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/13/USAT/be550041-0541-42a3-abc0-2fd0f776e676-16x9_4.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d28a43c2d4a2060fb7ceff387e01c78674e63489/c=0-19-1000-581/local/-/media/2018/05/10/USATODAY/usatsports/jlo.jpg?width=1000&height=562&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/05/jennifer-lopez-says-theres-no-pressure-on-alex-rodriguez-to-propose", "title": "J-Lo: 'No pressure' on A-Rod to propose", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "J-Lo: 'No pressure' on A-Rod to propose", "description": "Jennifer Lopez gave Alex Rodriguez a not-so-subtle hint.", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/05/jennifer-lopez-says-theres-no-pressure-on-alex-rodriguez-to-propose", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d28a43c2d4a2060fb7ceff387e01c78674e63489/c=0-19-1000-581/local/-/media/2018/05/10/USATODAY/usatsports/jlo.jpg?width=1000&height=562&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1000, "height": 562}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Nick Schwartz", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Jennifer Lopez gave Alex Rodriguez a not-so-subtle hint.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d28a43c2d4a2060fb7ceff387e01c78674e63489/c=0-19-1000-581/local/-/media/2018/05/10/USATODAY/usatsports/jlo.jpg?width=1000&height=500&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "J-Lo: 'No pressure' on A-Rod to propose", "description": "Jennifer Lopez gave Alex Rodriguez a not-so-subtle hint."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525881600.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
