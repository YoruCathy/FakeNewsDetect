Nick Viall may have thought he was \u201cliving [his] nightmare\u201d with Liz (the one-night stand he booted on Monday night's episode), but things are about to get even more nightmarish as Life & Style recently reported that the reality star is having a baby with a woman that\u2019s not his Bachelor winner!\n\nNick \u201cpicks a \u2018good girl\u2019 as the winner at the end of the series, but what she doesn\u2019t know is that right now one of the other girls he slept with thinks she\u2019s pregnant and that it\u2019s his,\u201d a source told Life & Style. \u201cTalk about a nightmare!\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to this mystery girl, \u201cNo one truly knows how many people Nick slept with during his Bachelor run,\u201d a source revealed. \u201cBut he definitely tried to make moves on every single girl. Some of the women went to first base, some second base and other hit a home run.\u201d\n\n\u201cNick definitely sleeps with his three finalists and one other girl, and there are probably at least a few more,\u201d dished a source.\n\nThe insider told the mag, \u201cWhen the booze is constantly flowing, protection is not usually on people\u2019s minds. And while there are always condoms in the house, with all the drinking going on, there\u2019s really no remembering if they were actually used.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe winner is already not happy about how much of a pig Nick has been,\u201d said the source. \u201cNick has slept with a good chunk of the contestants but she fell in love with him for other reasons.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jwoww-coparenting-roger-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/becca-kufrin-ben-higgins-phone-probe-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-11.37.31-AM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-03.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-2.18.36-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jax-taylor-tom-sandoval-wedding-regret-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-hero.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kevin-dobson-rhylee-gerber-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-10.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kevin-dobson-cheap-or-chic-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ben-higgins-engagement-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-08.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-04.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-hero.jpg?resize=734%2C365&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-05.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-11.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-hero.jpg?fit=734%2C365&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-17-at-2.57.44-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy-hero.jpg?fit=734%2C365&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/nick-viall-bachelor-winner-pregnant-other-woman-bad-boy/", "title": "Vile Viall!
