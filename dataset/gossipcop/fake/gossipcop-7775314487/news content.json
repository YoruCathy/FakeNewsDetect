When KoKo gave him a call to wish him a happy birthday on June 8, he took the opportunity to beg her to dump her baller beau, a source told In Touch exclusively.\n\n\u201cKanye\u2019s received Happy Birthday phone calls from everyone in the Kardashian family, but it turned ugly when he talked to Khlo\u00e9 and told her to stop dating basketball players,\" the source explained. While Kanye tried to be as nice as possible by explaining that she was \"too pretty and too smart to be with a man who's proven he\u2019s going to cheat for life,\" she was pissed.\n\n\"He asked how many times does she want to be heartbroken,\" the insider continued. \"Obviously Khlo\u00e9 was offended and gave Ye a piece of her mind.\" However, the source said she didn't \"go in on him too much\" because it was still his special day.\n\nYeezy definitely has a sore spot when it comes to ballers (Kim married one before him, after all) an he even rapped about Khlo\u00e9's situation on his new album, Ye. \u201cAll these thots on Christian Mingle, that\u2019s what almost got Tristan single. If you don\u2019t ball like him or Kobe, guarantee that b\u2014h gon\u2019 leave you,\" he said, which made it seem like he thought KoKo was only staying with TT because of his career.\n\nYeezy thinks that Khlo\u00e9 staying with Tristan will give her younger sisters the wrong idea. \"He told Khlo\u00e9 that her sister Kendall is looking up to her and that by getting rid of Tristan she\u2019d be setting a strong example,\" said the source. Kendall already seems to be dating her own baller, 76ers player Ben Simmons. Hopefully Kanye can learn to tolerate Tristan as long as Khlo\u00e9 has decided to give him another shot!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kanye-west-khloe-kardashian.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tristan-thompsn-rob-kardashian.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kanye-west-khloe-kardashian.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/khloe-kardashian-baby-weight-teaser-image.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lani-blair-apology-khloe--kardashian.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kanye-west-khloe-kardashian.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kanye-west-khloe-kardashian-dump-tristan-thompson-161569/", "title": "Kanye West Tells Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian to Dump Tristan Thompson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It seems like everyone is hoping Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian will eventually dump her cheating baby daddy Tristan Thompson, and that includes brother-in-law Kanye West!
