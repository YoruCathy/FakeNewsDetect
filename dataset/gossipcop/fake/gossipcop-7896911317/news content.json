A source added that the relationship \u201cran its course.\u201d\n\nThey were together in late March for her 25th birthday on a yacht in St. Bart\u2019s with pals, including Orlando Bloom.\n\nBut last Tuesday, the couple was seen at West Hollywood sushi restaurant Itacho, sources tell Page Six, where it seemed that the thrill was gone. Witnesses said that PDA was \u201cminimal.\u201d\n\nBut Agdal doesn\u2019t seem too broken up about the split, posting a provocative bikini shot on Wednesday with the caption, \u201cRooftop season ready.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, DiCaprio, 42, was seen Saturday in Malibu with friends.\n\nDiCaprio and Agdal were first spotted together in May 2016 at a club, then in June on a weekend getaway in Montauk. They were later seen around the globe at various hot spots, but the pair never officially confirmed they were a couple.\n\nBefore dating Agdal, DiCaprio split with another blonde, Sports Illustrated babe Kelly Rohrbach, and has been linked to a litany of leggy catwalkers like Gisele B\u00fcndchen, Bar Refaeli, Erin Heatherton and Toni Garrn.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/leo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/leo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/leo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/05/18/its-over-for-leonardo-dicaprio-and-nina-agdal/", "title": "It\u2019s over for Leonardo DiCaprio and Nina Agdal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
