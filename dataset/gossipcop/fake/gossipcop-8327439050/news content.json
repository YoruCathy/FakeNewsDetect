According to Daily Mail royal correspondent Rebecca English, Meghan and Harry are expected to still receive funds from the Duchy of Cornwall, a private fund managed by Prince Charles, which amounts to $2.5 million (\u00a32.3 million) a year.\n\nThey also plan to pay back the sovereign grant for the $3 million, taxpayer-funded renovation of Frogmore Cottage, which will still be their UK family home even as they move into the new role in the spring, according to the statement.\n\nSo, their lifestyle will effectively no longer be maintained by the crown \u2014 but that doesn't mean they don't already have financing separate from it.\n\nBefore marrying Prince Harry, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama \"Suits,\" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Money.com reported in 2018 that her total net worth was estimated to be $5 million.\n\nTheir combined net worth, however, is more than five times that. Prince Harry's net worth is at least $25 million (\u00a319 million) and as much as $40 million (\u00a330 million), according to 2018 estimates from Money.com.\n\nHere's where all that money comes from.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5e178033b2e66a66516b3264?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e178254b2e66a687723d9d6?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5ae73e5619ee861e008b466d?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e177b13f442315f052aab49?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5adf80d219ee8649008b486f?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e17a41df442310841655b42?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5e66afa554f25c184644f893?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/587e7963dd0895651c8b4beb?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e177e87b2e66a648e2a3e63?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5e1780bab2e66a66a45b2110?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5adf80d219ee8649008b486f?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-net-worth-2018-4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e177a4424fe125a18712e2c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5e66afa554f25c184644f893?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback", "Taylor Borden", "Darcy Schild"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-net-worth-2018-4", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan to become 'financially independent,' but they're already worth about $30 million \u2014 and none of that money belongs to the crown", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan to become 'financially independent,' but they're already worth about $30 million \u2014 and none of that money belongs to the crown", "date": "2020-01-19", "news_keywords": "Royal Family, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Net Worth, Arts & Culture, Features, BI Select, Tanza Loudenback, Taylor Borden, Darcy Schild", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are effectively cutting themselves off but he's already worth at least $25 million and she's worth at least $5 million.", "author": "Tanza Loudenback, Taylor Borden, Darcy Schild", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Life", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan to become 'financially independent,' but they're already worth about $30 million \u2014 and none of that money belongs to the crown", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are effectively cutting themselves off but he's already worth at least $25 million and she's worth at least $5 million.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-net-worth-2018-4", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5e66afa554f25c184644f893?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle plan to become 'financially independent,' but they're already worth about $30 million \u2014 and none of that money belongs to the crown", "sailthru.date": "2020-01-19", "sailthru.tags": "Royal Family, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Net Worth, Arts & Culture, Features, BI Select, Tanza Loudenback, Taylor Borden, Darcy Schild", "sailthru.description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are effectively cutting themselves off but he's already worth at least $25 million and she's worth at least $5 million.", "sailthru.author": "Darcy Schild", "sailthru.verticals": "thelife", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5e66af9554f25c18304cad66?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5e66af9554f25c18304cad66?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@LifeInsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "variant", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "variant", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "5adf7edf19ee8620008b4815", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1579363200.0, "source": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
