You heard that over and over \u2014 we heard that for decades. And nothing was done,\" the actor said.\n\nWhen asked why no one had come forward if they were aware of the alleged incident, Baldwin replied, \"Rose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him. And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.\"\n\nThe actor referenced a New York Times article on the subject of paying off sexual assault victims and posed the question, \"Do the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change?\"\n\nAdded Baldwin, \"When women take money, and are silenced by that money \u2014 even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told beyond the money it was the right thing for them to do, keep quiet, don't make too many waves, it's going to hurt your career \u2014 when they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the course of change? That's an issue, I think.\"\n\n.@AlecBaldwin on a culture of complicity in Hollywood after allegations of sexual harassment and assault by fmr movie mogul #HarveyWeinstein pic.twitter.com/jHeWAhEuOg \u2014 PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) November 3, 2017\n\nOne of Weinstein's numerous accusers, Asia Argento, took to Twitter to slam Baldwin for his comments on victims who are silenced.\n\n\"You're either a complete moron or providing cover for your pals and saving your own rep,\" she wrote.
