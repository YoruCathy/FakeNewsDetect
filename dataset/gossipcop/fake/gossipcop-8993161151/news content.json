In response, the Kardashians have done something that they are known for and Chyna should have seen it coming.\n\nThe Kardashians hired a private investigator to follow Blac Chyna. Certainly, they\u2019re hoping that an investigator can dig up enough dirt to either prove Chyna wrong or to make her not want to continue with her lawsuit. Whichever way gets this hanger-on off the Kardashians backs is probably okay with them.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BayH3W1FSqS/?hl=en&taken-by=blacchyna\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that one of the Kardashians hired a private investigator to follow around the partner or former partner of one of the KUWTK stars. Remember several seasons ago when Kim Kardashian hired someone to follow Scott Disick around when she thought he was up to something shady.\n\nThat drama played out over several episodes of Keeping Up With The Kardashians and featured plenty of confrontations between Kim and Scott about it.\n\nThis time around, it\u2019s not quite as cute as the former KUWTK storyline. As a matter of fact, this isn\u2019t a storyline for the show at all and is something that the Kardashians tried to avoid when Rob started dating Chyna. It\u2019s crazy how much chaos one person can cause for a family in such a short amount of time.\n\nAccording to Radar Online, this time around, it\u2019s Kris Jenner who was put in charge of the spying. Khloe and Kourtney are reportedly helping their mom with the private investigator and Kim is supportive.\n\nThe actual dollar amount wasn\u2019t shared but it was reported that Kris has spent \u201ca small fortune\u201d hiring the best PIs that money can buy in order to find something, anything that will get Blac Chyna off their backs.\n\n\u201cIt was Kris\u2019 idea to hire private detectives to tail Chyna\u2019s every move, take pictures and damaging video,\u201d a source reportedly told Radar. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the inside track of what Chyna\u2019s doing 24/7 and won\u2019t rest until they see Chyna go down in flames.\u201d\n\nBack when Rob Kardashian started dating Blac Chyna, the family was afraid that it would end something like this. Rob was obviously an easy target and Chyna has shown time and time again that when one money scheme fails, she\u2019s got several other ideas.\n\nThis is what sisters are for \u2764\ufe0f Don't miss @nbcthisisus when it returns tomorrow at 9/8c only on @nbc! A post shared by Kardashians on E! (@kuwtk) on Sep 25, 2017 at 2:09pm PDT\n\nMuch like her lawsuits against the Kardashians. At first, it was all about Dream Kardashian and child support. Once that was settled and Chyna got less than she wanted, she waged a flurry of lawsuits against Rob and the Kardashian family as a whole.\n\nBlac Chyna wants to ensure she gets rich off her time with the Kardashians and she\u2019s going to fight tooth and nail until she gets that payout. Likewise, the Kardashians are so upset about what she\u2019s doing and the PR nightmare that this has caused that they want to make sure she walks away with as little as possible.\n\nWant your voice heard?

When all the dust settles and Chyna runs out of things to sue for, she may find that she would have been better off if she had left the KUWTK family alone from the start.", "images":
