Right after it comes out, she posts on her Instagram Story that she's listening to Summer Walker's \"I'll Kill You.\" Baldwin denies any connection between her musical statement and Gomez's. Gomez urges her fans to \"be kind\" on Instagram Live later that day.\n\nBy the following day, things appear to be squashed. Baldwin likes an IG of Gomez celebrating her new music. A source tells E! that while Bieber and Baldwin have heard the song, \"they are both trying to not give any reaction to her lyrics referencing Justin.\" The insider continues, \"It isn't ideal for Hailey, but she understands the creative process of writing music and that Justin had a past. Justin has completely moved on from that chapter of his life and understands that Selena is allowed to reflect on the past in her own way. Justin and Hailey both want Selena to be happy and in a good place and aren't fazed by it.\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dkhytv8voaa-dvd-1530290698.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jb-new-york-daily-news-archive-1530220271.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Holly Rhue", "Savannah Walsh", "Elle.Com Contributor", "Holly Rhue Is A Writer", "Editor In New York City.", "Editorial Fellow", "Savannah Walsh Is An Editorial Fellow At Elle.Com."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g21991424/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-relationship-timeline/", "title": "A Very Comprehensive 10-Year Timeline of Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin's Relationship", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "A Very Comprehensive 10-Year Timeline of Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin's Relationship", "description": "From their youthful meeting to \"Yummy.\"", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g21991424/timeline-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-relationship/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2020-01-22 09:23:34", "published_time": "2020-01-22 09:18:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2020", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin's Complete Relationship Timeline", "description": "From his first cringe-worthy meet with Hailey Baldwin in 2009 to their present Grand Makeout Tour of the United States\u200b\u200b\u2122\u200b, it appears as if Justin Bieber has made Hailey Baldwin one less lonely girl by asking her to marry him.
