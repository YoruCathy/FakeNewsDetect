This is a return to prime form for the EJAF, welcoming a big up-and-coming band heralded as a savior of guitar rock, not a nostalgia act. Because all 42 of the headlining dates on their first U.S. tour sold out in advance and they\u2019re headed to Coachella, the four Michigan boys are a choice dessert on the evening.\n\nByron Allen\u2019s Second Annual Entertainment Studios Gala\n\nBeverly Wilshire\n\nLogline: Katy Perry and Jamie Foxx will perform at the benefit for Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles.

He\u2019s shipping 2,400 bottles to the Dolby, some of which are a limited edition production of \u201cDirector\u2019s Cut Oscars 90th Edition\u201d bottles.
