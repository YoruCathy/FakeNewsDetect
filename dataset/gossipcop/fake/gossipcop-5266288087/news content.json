It was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve done, but it was the best thing I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nSelena On Dialectical Behavior Therapy: \u201cDBT has completely changed my life. I wish more people would talk about therapy. We girls, we\u2019re taught to be almost too resilient, to be strong and sexy and cool and laid-back, the girl who\u2019s down. We also need to feel allowed to fall apart.\u201d\n\nSelena On Interacting With Fans In Public: \u201cSomebody I used to hang out with would always get very frustrated with me. But I have a hard time saying no to children.\u201d\n\nSelena On Moving Beyond Disney: \u201cI worked with Disney for four years. It\u2019s a very controlled machine. They know what they represent, and there was, 100 percent, a way to go about things\u2026 For a guy there\u2019s a way to rebel that can work for you. But for a woman, that can backfire. It\u2019s hard not to be a clich\u00e9, the child star gone wrong. I did respect my fans and what I had, but I was also figuring out what I was passionate about and how far I was willing to go.\u201d\n\nSelena On Life Changing In The Spotlight: I\u2019m a late bloomer. I grew up around adults, but in terms of getting out, having friends. At times I really didn\u2019t know anything but my job\u2026 My mom gave up her whole life for me. Where we\u2019re from, you don\u2019t really leave. So when I started gaining all this success, there was a guilt that came with it. I thought, Do I deserve this?\u201d\n\nSelena On Not Feeling Career Pressure Right Now: \u201cFor a change,\u201d she says, \u201cit feels like I don\u2019t have to be holding my breath and waiting for somebody to judge a piece of work that I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not eager to chase a moment. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a moment for me to chase.\u201d\n\nSelena On Limiting Her Network, Privately And Publicly: \u201cI think seventeen people have my phone number right now. Maybe two are famous\u2026 As soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out. It had become so consuming to me. It\u2019s what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn\u2019t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn\u2019t want to care about. I always end up feeling like shit when I look at Instagram. Which is why I\u2019m kind of under the radar, ghosting it a bit\u2026 Look, I love what I do, and I\u2019m aware of how lucky I am, but, how can I say this without sounding weird? I just really can\u2019t wait for people to forget about me.\u201d\n\nThe article notes Gomez declined to discuss her relationship with The Weeknd, with the writer saying, \u201cShe tells me that everything she has said about her relationships in the past has come back to bite her, and that she will never do it again.\u201d The full issue of Vogue will hit newsstands on March 28.", "images": ["http://www.iheart.com/v8.16.1/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "//www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-16-selena-gomez-vogue-cover-story-see-interview-highlights/", "title": "Selena Gomez Vogue Cover Story: See Interview Highlights!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "Selena Gomez covers the April 2017 issue of Vogue, the first time she\u2019s the magazine\u2019s cover star. | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn", "description": "Selena Gomez covers the April 2017 issue of Vogue, the first time she\u2019s the magazine\u2019s cover star. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-16-selena-gomez-vogue-cover-story-see-interview-highlights/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Selena Gomez Vogue Cover Story: See Interview Highlights! | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn"}, "description": "Selena Gomez covers the April 2017 issue of Vogue, the first time she\u2019s the magazine\u2019s cover star. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-16-selena-gomez-vogue-cover-story-see-interview-highlights/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Selena Gomez Vogue Cover Story: See Interview Highlights! | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Selena Gomez Vogue Cover Story: See Interview Highlights!, selena, gomez, vogue, cover, story:, see, interview, highlights!", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wMy8xNi81OGNhOTBkNGNlYmNlYTQyOTMwMzY4ZmMvNThjYTkwZGFmOGM1ODA3NDBmODc4MjU1XzEyODB4NzIwX0ZfdjEuanBn", "parsely-link": "http://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-16-selena-gomez-vogue-cover-story-see-interview-highlights/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-03-16T14:10:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "trending-pop", "parsely-tags": "Selena Gomez (57706)", "parsely-title": "Selena Gomez Vogue Cover Story: See Interview Highlights!", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489593600.0, "source": "http://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
