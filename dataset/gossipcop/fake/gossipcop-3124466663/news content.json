Why are they spending time apart?\n\nHaving a boyfriend in the music business has been a blessing and a curse for Selena Gomez. The Weeknd totally has a crazy schedule like her, but it means they can\u2019t always be together. \u201cSelena misses her boyfriend dearly as she is hard at work with her music career which is taking off again,\u201d a source in the industry revealed EXCLUSIVELY to HollywoodLife.com. \u201cSelena\u2019s music obligations mean time away from her amazing boyfriend Abel whose own music career is just as busy.\u201d\n\nSelena totally knocked it out of the park with her latest single \u201cFetish,\u201d but she reportedly has been thinking of her BF a ton. \u201cIt is bittersweet for Selena who feels accomplished with all of the great music she is putting out,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cShe just wishes Abel could be by her side every step of the way. They both have down time coming soon and have made plans for another romantic rendezvous and she can\u2019t wait to be back in his arms.\u201d Long distance relationships have got to be super stressful for any couple, but that just makes the time together all the more special. \u201cWhile the time apart is tough, the reunions are always explosive. Abel really turns Selena on and she gets giddy just thinking about spending another night with him,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nThe \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d singer has got so much going with her music right now, you can\u2019t blame her for making the most of it. Thankfully The Weeknd has been in the business for a long time like Sel so they\u2019ve probably bonded over it. \u201cSelena is proud of her art which she knows is important and she has equal respect for Abel and his ambitions. She is OK with them both chasing their dreams and goals in life. But that doesn\u2019t mean she still doesn\u2019t miss him every minute they are apart and she looks forward to when she can be with him every single day again,\u201d the source told us.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Selena and The Weeknd are meant to be? Are you super excited to them reunited?", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F07%2F14%2Fselena-gomez-the-weeknd-reunion-apart-relationship%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2693867&comment_count=8", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s0.wp.com/i/mu.gif", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-love-nest-ftr.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-love-nest-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Sadlier", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/14/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-reunion-apart-relationship/", "title": "Selena Gomez Eager For \u2018Explosive\u2019 Reunion With The Weeknd After Tough Time Apart", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez has been missing The Weeknd like crazy, HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned!
