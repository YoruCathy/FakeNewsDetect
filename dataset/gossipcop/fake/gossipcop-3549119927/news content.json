Scott Disick is \u201cTeam Tyga\u201d all the way and doesn\u2019t want to stop being friends with him. In fact, he wants to make sure Kanye West, 39, keeps Tyga, 27, on his record label so the rapper can sustain a good income. However, Kim Kardashian is \u201cTeam Kylie\u201d and pressuring her husband to drop Tyga fast.\n\n\u201cKim is pressuring her husband to move on from Tyga. Kim always had questions about Kylie\u2019s relationship with Tyga and wishes Kanye would follow Kylie\u2019s lead and separate ties with the struggling rapper. Kim feels like Kanye has enough stress in his life and managing her sister\u2019s ex is something Kanye doesn\u2019t need in his life,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nObviously, Kanye is the head of his record label so the final decision rests with him, but if we were Tyga, we\u2019d be worried. \u201cHis loyalty is going to be with Kylie and the family over Tyga,\u201d another source told us. And we hear that if Kylie were to ask him to drop Tyga from his label, he\u2019d do so in a heartbeat. \u201cIf Kylie wanted to be petty, she could probably get Kanye to drop Tyga from his label. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s going to do that, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s that bitter. But if it came down to it and that\u2019s what the family wanted, I\u2019m sure Kanye wouldn\u2019t even question it,\u201d the source added.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do YOU think? Should Kanye West drop Tyga from his record label?
