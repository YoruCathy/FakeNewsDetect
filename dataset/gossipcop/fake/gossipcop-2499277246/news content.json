As it was, she controlled her mild bouts of queasiness with pasta and pizza, but if she\u2019d been just a notch sicker every once in a while, she might have felt too bad to eat at all. Who knows? Maybe she would have even thrown up.\n\nThe thought occurred to her, she sheepishly concedes, at a celebratory brunch in Brooklyn with her husband and another couple who are expecting a child. The other mother-to-be, already a stick before she was pregnant, was telling the group how miserable her morning sickness had been and how she\u2019d lost eight pounds so far in her first trimester.\n\n\u201cAnd I was saying,\u201d Tenenbaum recalls, \u201chow that\u2019s not my experience. And she said, \u2018You should be grateful you\u2019re not sick.\u2019 Then she went on to say, \u2018I never wore maternity clothes during my first pregnancy.\u2019 \u201d Tenenbaum, who in neat, distressing symmetry had already gained eight pounds, hastens to note that she doesn\u2019t think her friend was being rude. \u201cI keep telling myself, We\u2019re different body types. But it\u2019s hard. I\u2019m not thinking, It\u2019s okay to get bigger. I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019m thinking, This is depressing.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Margot Tenenbaum is not the fat girl. Though, at 38, she\u2019s had \u201cchubby periods,\u201d for the past seven years or so, she\u2019s been happy with her size-8 self (that\u2019s at Barneys or Jeffrey, she clarifies; size 6 at Old Navy). Beyond that, Tenenbaum is the kind of New York woman other New York women get girl-crushes on. She\u2019s exuberant and witty and sexy, managing to look like those Citizens of Humanity jeans aren\u2019t fashiony but her own brilliant discovery, and she seems to know everybody. Raised in Savannah, Georgia, she\u2019s friendly with the director Wes Anderson, who named The Royal Tenenbaums and the Gwyneth Paltrow character after Margot and her family. (Though she shares a uniquely cool style with her fictional doppelg\u00e4nger, the real Margot is dark-haired, dark-eyed, and the opposite of laconic.) By day, she runs a mentoring program in Harlem; by night, she hangs out with a large circle of friends from the University of Wisconsin, when she\u2019s not joining her family for one of their regular jaunts to the Breakers in Palm Beach or the Four Seasons in Maui.\n\nI\u2019m not thinking, It\u2019s okay to get bigger. I\u2019m pregnant,\u201d says one mother-to-be. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, This is depressing.\u201d To be pregnant and obsess over your size in New York today, says another expecting mom, is to be, merely, \u201cconscious.\u201d\n\nAll this is to say that Tenenbaum is so confident, so popular, so evolved, that you wouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d waste much time obsessing over gaining weight \u2026 while pregnant. Then again, as Pam Berger, another expecting mom and a friend of Tenenbaum\u2019s, said to her recently, to be pregnant and obsess over your size in New York in the year 2004 is to be, merely, \u201cconscious.\u201d\n\nPerhaps at no time and in no place in history have so many women been under so much pressure to stay thin and gorgeous while simultaneously producing a human life. You can still find the woman who welcomes pregnancy as a time \u201cto let herself go,\u201d but more common are those like Tenenbaum, who grabs her thighs and grimaces and confesses to nightmares of becoming a \u201cdumpy, Pea-in-the-Pod woman.\u201d Women fret endlessly about what they eat and how much they weigh from the moment they conceive\u2014and earlier (some diet before they get pregnant to keep their ultimate weight total to a minimum). Julie Tupler, founder of Maternal Fitness and one of the city\u2019s top pregnancy-exercise gurus, has seen her business grow from a few private clients in 1990 to twice-weekly classes that have to be booked weeks in advance, and moms-to-be sweating away at Equinox, Crunch, and New York Sports Club are as ubiquitous as Bugaboo strollers. Chic maternity shops, meanwhile, offer sizes and styles that are definitely not your mother\u2019s muumuu. Comparing what sells most briskly at her Madison Avenue location with her Beverly Hills boutique, Liz Lange, the designer of the country\u2019s first upscale maternity line, says, \u201cWe find that our New York women are the skinny minis who can fit into everything. We thought it was going to be the opposite\u2014you think of L.A. as the capital of plastic surgery and skinniness.\u201d Lange\u2019s clothes used to start at size 1; now they begin at zero.\n\nOn New York\u2019s UrbanBaby, a popular Website where women share and kvetch about everything from baby names to real estate to the intricacies of sonograms, \u201cweight polls\u201d regularly erupt:13 weeks, 4 lbs\n\n24 weeks, 20 lbs!\n\n13 weeks, 0 pounds (Okay, I might have gained a pound or two in the very beginning but that\u2019s at most. Should I be concerned?)\n\nCheck with your doctor but probably fine\u2026 .\n\n13 weeks, 12 lbs! I feel like a hippo compared to you!\n\n25 weeks, 24 lbs! (No wait. Did the math wrong. 22 lbs. Wow. I feel better.)\n\n\n\nOccasionally, a naysayer will interrupt the endless flow: \u201c148 weeks, three thousand pounds. Just f\u2013kin\u2019 eat, gain weight, get fat if you want, have a healthy baby, lose the weight if you want, get on with your life!!!\u201d But libertines are quickly put in their place\u2014\u201cIt sounds like somebody is unhappy about the weight she has gained\u201d\u2014and the expectant mothers happily return to plugging in their weeks and weight, weeks and weight.\n\nNo one has formally examined what pregnant New Yorkers are thinking about their bodies\u2014or putting into them\u2014but in a Johns Hopkins study published last year, 21 percent of the well-educated, affluent Baltimore-area women surveyed reported engaging in \u201cweight-restrictive behavior\u201d: trying not to look pregnant early in pregnancy, attempting to limit weight gain one month after they\u2019d gained \u201ctoo much\u201d the month before, and fasting before visiting a doctor. The study also unearthed this disconcerting tidbit: Those who\u2019d \u201cundergained\u201d (as measured by widely followed Institute of Medicine guidelines that say women of normal weight should add 25 to 35 pounds; those who are underweight, 28 to 40; and those who are overweight, about 15) had the most positive body images. If those are the numbers in Baltimore, imagine what\u2019s happening on our narrow isle.\n\nOne telling rumor circulating in New York offices is that several of the city\u2019s most fabulous mothers have had Cesarean sections early in the eighth month to avoid putting on the last extra dollop of fat. Removing a baby at that stage for a nonmedical reason would be malpractice, but in the era of the \u201ccosmetic Cesarean\u201d\u2014in which the surgery is performed for women frantic about childbirth damaging their vaginal elasticity or appearance\u2014who knows?\n\nMargot Tenenbaum, now 21 weeks pregnant. (Photograph by Katherine Wolkoff)\n\nManhattan, of course, has long been proudly gaunt, inhabited as it is by legions of celebrities, socialites, fashionistas, and those who would be them (remember Edith Wharton\u2019s ethereal creatures, Lily Bart of the \u201clong, light step\u201d and the \u201cslender pink nails\u201d? Slender nails?). Only in the past few years, however, have the \u201cbump,\u201d the \u201cbasketball,\u201d and the \u201cbelly on two sticks\u201d entered the local lexicon. Blooming stars now strut the red carpet at the Oscars and pregnant supermodels flaunt their exposed bellies, while Us Weekly, People, and the Star intrepidly report on who has stayed admirably attenuated (Gwyneth Paltrow, Sarah Jessica Parker) and who has not (Debra Messing, Kate Hudson). In late spring, the hot gossip swirled around paparazzi shots of Paltrow emerging smilingly (triumphantly?) svelte from a London hospital. The conspiracy theory was that she hid out in the hospital for a few weeks after giving birth\u2014there\u2019s just no way she could\u2019ve lost so much weight so quickly. The pregnant-celeb watch is about to reach a new peak this fall, as Julia Roberts waddles\u2014she\u2019s having twins; she can\u2019t help it\u2014toward a January due date. Toss into this roiling mix the Atkins and South Beach diets\u2014the latest devotionals in New York\u2019s Church of Divine Diminishment\u2014and you\u2019ve got a freshly minted group neurosis. You\u2019ve also got an unnerving question: Are women starving their babies by starving themselves?\n\nWay back when, in the late fifties, a woman as tortured as Sylvia Plath could be at her sunniest when she was \u201ccow-heavy and floral.\u201d Today, the prevailing attitude toward the extra flesh of maternity verges on disgust. A sampling of what women tell me they do not want to be while pregnant: \u201ca fat slob,\u201d \u201ca huge blob,\u201d \u201csloppy,\u201d \u201chorrible like Kate Hudson,\u201d \u201cfucking gross.\u201d Tenenbaum\u2019s language is less harsh (\u201cmushy\u201d is her preferred pejorative), but she has the same fear of becoming almost offensive, of not measuring up. She keeps worrying, she says, about an upcoming vacation with her husband\u2019s family. There\u2019s no way she wants to expose her girth in a bathing suit, but then she wonders if they\u2019ll think she\u2019s \u201cashamed\u201d of her body if she swims in shorts and a shirt. \u201cAnd maybe I am ashamed,\u201d she says.\n\nBerger sympathizes. \u201cThe last time I got weighed [at the OB\u2019s], I was really pleased the nurse just wrote the number in my chart and didn\u2019t say it out loud, because it was so \u2026 If you knew how much I weighed, you\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn conversations with several dozen more pregnant women and new mothers, I was repeatedly struck by how fixated they are on the new pregnancy ideal, how much they lap up the praise if they \u201cachieve\u201d it, how anxious they are if they don\u2019t. It\u2019s a jungle out there, and only the scrawniest survive.\n\nBeth Dorfman, a second-trimester periodontist, was so concerned about blowing up, and about eating healthy in general, that she consulted nutritionist Tanya Zuckerbrot early in her pregnancy (Zuckerbrot says she\u2019s seen a significant increase in the number of women who come to her for weight-related reasons). \u201cI remember shopping with my mother and I thought, \u2018These random people walking past me on the street, I wonder if they think \u201cHmm, that girl might be pregnant,\u201d or \u201cThat girl might just have eaten seventeen cupcakes an hour ago,\u201d \u2019 \u201d Dorfman says.\n\nZuckerbrot advised Dorfman to eat more protein and fiber (pregnant women can go Atkins, by the way, as long as they eat some carbs) and turned her onto the miracle that is Scandinavian fiber crisps. \u201cThey\u2019re like sixteen calories a cracker,\u201d Dorfman says. \u201cThey\u2019re not the tastiest\u2014a nice bagel or bread would taste better\u2014but they satisfy some of the craving and fill me up.\u201d Dorfman promptly began eating three of the Scandinavian crisps topped with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast. Even her peanut butter is diet, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not Skippy Reduced Fat; it\u2019s even lower fat than that, like 2.5 grams per serving.\u201d All the calorie counting is a necessary evil, says Dorfman. \u201cWhen you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re only supposed to eat 300 more calories per day,\u201d she says, citing a common recommendation. \u201cThat\u2019s not much. One of those Dannon Light \u2019n Fit yogurts, that\u2019s 100 calories right there.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to exercise, so many women rhapsodized to me about spotting a sublimely trim pregnant woman exercising her butt off at the local Equinox that I began to wonder whether clever health-club marketers were fitting trainers with fat pads. Meredith Paley, a vice-president at Kenneth Cole whose daughter, Ava, was born in July, is one of those who attracted gawkers. Her pregnancy-workout schedule: spinning on Tuesdays, body sculpting Wednesdays, one or two other random gym visits a week, and five-mile Central Park runs on Wednesdays, Fridays, and both weekend days. Because Paley knows that doctors recommend that pregnant women keep their heart rates under 140 beats per minute (to keep sufficient oxygen flowing to the baby), she says she always wore a monitor and walked when the number got close. A serious runner, Paley volunteers several times that intense exercise is natural for her, what makes her feel good. Still, she says, \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit that I didn\u2019t see pregnancy as an excuse to sit on my ass and let the pounds come.\u201d\n\nOne maternity researcher says she \ufb01nds her subjects\u2019 weight-restrictive behaviors unnerving. \u201cThe pregnancy and delivery is all about them. If you can\u2019t invest in your baby by gaining weight, I think it\u2019s a harbinger for lack of investment in the child.\u201d\n\nDorfman, also an avid exerciser, is frustrated by the heart-rate cutoff. \u201cIf the doctor says 140, I want to go to 137\u2014that\u2019s just the type of person I am. I\u2019m not going to jeopardize the health of my child, but I\u2019m on the treadmill like, God, I\u2019m not even sweating. I feel like it\u2019s not doing anything.\u201d\n\nThis kind of superfit patient has become increasingly common, says Upper East Side obstetrician Shari Brasner, during the ten years she\u2019s been in practice. She mentions a third-trimester patient who blew by her running in the park recently (\u201cIt was unbelievable\u201d), and one who, after developing a painful nerve cluster in her foot, cut a hole in her sneaker rather than step off the treadmill. The doctor says it\u2019s not hard to spot which patients are tormented by their expansion: \u201cThey take ten minutes to remove every last bit of clothing, down to the rubber band on their ponytail, before getting on the scale.\u201d\n\nJulie Tupler disavows the idea that women should be skinny or diet during pregnancy, but there\u2019s no denying that her classes attract those who are serious about flab. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to gain ten pounds in the first trimester,\u201d says Patty Surak, who was eight months along, \u201cbut I did.\u201d On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Surak and five other very pregnant women were assembled for a Tupler session, outfitted in oversize T-shirts and black exercise pants. One staple of Tupler\u2019s class is a sort of pregnancy-safe sit-up. The group\u2019s homework is 500 a day.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the magic word for next week?\u201d Tupler asked.\n\n\u201cOne thousand,\u201d the group replied in unison.\n\n\u201cYou can start doing these again right after the placenta comes out,\u201d Tupler said. \u201cI had one student who even did it before!\u201d\n\nAs is probably obvious by now, it\u2019s not just how much weight women gain but where they gain it. Like Dante\u2019s levels of hell, there\u2019s a hierarchy of bad to worse. Level 1: All extra adipose tissue is smartly confined to the stomach. (\u201cThat\u2019s the baby\u2019s body, not yours,\u201d says mother and academic body watcher Susan Bordo, author of the recently rereleased Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.) Level 2: Your breasts get big, too, but nothing else. (\u201cI know a lot of women who get pregnant who are very flat-chested, and it\u2019s like heaven to them,\u201d says Tenenbaum, who\u2019s already well endowed and hasn\u2019t felt the thrill, though her husband apparently can\u2019t get enough: \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Your boobs! They\u2019re so big! It\u2019s great!\u2019 \u201d) Level 3: Your butt and thighs puff up, or become \u201crumply\u201d (one UrbanBaby mother\u2019s lament). And finally, Level 4: Your face and ankles swell, a fate that befell 34-year-old publicist Katie Pottinger. \u201cMy entire body widened. My face, I wouldn\u2019t even say it was puffy; I mean, it really blew out. There was a thickening,\u201d she says, \u201cthat happened all over.\u201d\n\nThe skinny-pregnancy set also lives to be told they\u2019re having a boy. Under the old anti-feminist canard straight out of Grimm\u2019s, girls \u201csteal\u201d their mother\u2019s looks. \u201cI was like a preening peacock when people told me \u2018You must be having a boy,\u2019 \u201d says Kate Walsh, an associate editor for Metropolitan Home and the new mother of a very female Evelyn. Diana Becker, a soft-spoken 28-year-old legal secretary, got the other end of the deal: \u201cYou must be having a girl,\u201d a neighbor lady informed her. \u201cWhy?\u201d Becker na\u00efvely asked. \u201cBecause people get fat all over when it\u2019s a girl.\u201d\n\nThe truly chic aim to avoid maternity clothes\u2014even Liz Lange\u2014for as long as possible. A fashion-marketer lady-who-lunches who asked me not to use her name led me from floor to floor of Barneys on a tour of what\u2019s in her pregnant-waif\u2019s wardrobe: clingy Missoni halter dresses, anything Diane Von Furstenberg, Pucci hot pants teamed with Hanes T-shirts, and terry-cloth Juicy dresses. At five months pregnant, she was wearing size-27 Seven jeans.\n\nProving that no one, no matter how tiny, is immune from wanting to be tinier, my Barneys guide also indulged in what I\u2019ll call gestation-inflation. She said she\u2019d gained nine pounds at six months, but when she gave me her due date, I discovered she was just over five. Now, I have no idea whether this was conscious, unconscious, or just bad math, but I recognized the move because I, too, was a fairly skinny pregnant person with my first baby, and I vaguely remember shaving off a few weeks here and there. I never planned to do it, but when asked for the umpteenth time \u201cHow far along are you?,\u201d a rounded-up number just popped out of my mouth.\n\nKate Walsh never allowed her husband to remain in the examining room for her weigh-ins, and the effort to keep the top-secret number from him eventually reached sitcom-ish proportions. \u201cMatt had no idea how much I\u2019d put on until I was getting the epidural and the anesthesiologist asked, \u2018How much do you weigh?\u2019 I knew I couldn\u2019t lowball, because then I wouldn\u2019t get enough drugs, so in the middle of a contraction I\u2019m trying to whisper the number to the doctor, and he\u2019s saying, \u2018What? I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t hear you.\u2019 So I blurted it out and whipped around to see Matt\u2019s reaction. He didn\u2019t even blink, bless him.\u201d\n\nSo to cut to the elephant in the room: Is all this downsizing hurting kids? While the medical literature is flecked with horrifying case histories of a bulimic vomiting immediately after delivery and tearing out her episiotomy, of another exercising so compulsively as to require hospitalization, the consensus is that women with actual eating disorders tend to get a grip on them while they\u2019re pregnant. (Most true anorexics stop menstruating and can\u2019t get pregnant in the first place.) \u201cIt\u2019s almost like, \u2018This foreign object in there\u2014let me take care of it,\u2019 \u201d says Mount Kisco psychotherapist Kristin Lore, an eating-disorders specialist. \u201cBut once the baby\u2019s out of there, it\u2019s about them again.\u201d\n\nThe real question, then, is: Would gaining the bare minimum of recommended weight, or perhaps even a tad less, harm a developing child? The answer from obstetricians and nutritionists is, basically, no, though the topic has surprisingly controversial aspects. The goal isn\u2019t to hit a specific weight, experts say, but to eat a well-balanced diet, including some carbs (Tenenbaum\u2019s dreaded \u201cwhite foods\u201d). \u201cBabies don\u2019t need their mothers to gain that much,\u201d says Mount Sinai maternal-fetal-medicine specialist Larry Rand, who\u2019s been so struck by the anguish of new mothers left with a \u201cbig chunk of weight\u201d that he\u2019s launching a study to investigate the association between mild postpartum depression and gain during pregnancy. \u201cThe general gist you get in medical school is that even in times of famine, it\u2019s never so bad.\u201d\n\nWhat he means is that it practically takes a famine for things to get bad. The Ur-study on the subject of maternal weight gain is the Dutch famine project. Surveying the health of babies born to women pregnant during a Nazi-induced famine in the Netherlands in 1944\u201345, Columbia University husband-and-wife researchers Zena Stein and Mervyn Susser found that women exposed to the famine during the third trimester gave birth to babies who were on average 10.6 ounces lighter than others. (Fetuses exposed in the first or second trimesters were not born smaller; most fetal weight gain occurs in the third trimester.)\n\nNow, chopping ten ounces off average birth weights across a population is dangerous business. \u201cLow birth weight\u201d (under five pounds, eight ounces) and, worse, \u201cvery low birth weight\u201d (under three pounds, five ounces) babies have higher rates of everything from cerebral palsy and blindness to infant mortality. Smaller babies also seem to have lower IQs, but only by a point or two. And, in a cruel irony for pregnant punys, there\u2019s also a tentative finding that smaller babies are more likely to become obese adults. The theory is that the exquisitely malleable fetal brain adapts to some sort of prenatal nutritional deprivation that is then out of sync with the supersize American diet.\n\nWhat makes this all complex, however, is the extent to which\u2014outside of famine\u2014a mother\u2019s caloric intake causes low birth weight. Most light babies, for one, are simply born too early, and the amount women eat doesn\u2019t seem to be a major factor in prematurity, at least not in the United States. What\u2019s more, a baby\u2019s growth can be impaired by anything that alters blood flow through the placenta, such as smoking, maternal infections, and exposure to toxic substances like lead. Doctors also believe each child has a genetically set \u201coptimal birth weight,\u201d which may well be smaller for smaller mothers, yet there\u2019s no way to know what that ideal is. Doctors and nutritionists also say genetics plays a part in how much weight an expectant mother gains. While there are no studies that pinpoint the degree of influence, the conventional wisdom is that some portion of weight gain is essentially out of women\u2019s control. One thing is for sure, says Tufts maternal-nutrition expert David Rush: He knows of no successful attempt to \u201cfeed women up.\u201d In one oft-cited example, he and Mervyn Susser tried to enrich the diets of poor African-American women in Harlem in the early seventies. \u201cThe [women] gained maybe a pound or two,\u201d Rush says. \u201cTrivial stuff.\u201d With babies, he adds, \u201cthe typical increment we\u2019ve been able to make, even with aggressive feeding, has been an ounce to an ounce and a half.\u201d Rush\u2019s fellow eminence in the field of maternal nutrition, McGill University pediatrician Michael Kramer, is no less convinced that a physician could get a woman to gain more than she\u2019s predisposed to gain. \u201cIn the U.K., they don\u2019t weigh women during pregnancy because there\u2019s no evidence that knowing how much weight you\u2019re gaining actually affects the outcome of the pregnancy. It has no effect, other than to make a woman feel bad.\u201d So why the Institute of Medicine guidelines? \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to recommend a range,\u201d says Barbara Abrams, a University of California, Berkeley, public-health professor and co-author of the Institute of Medicine recommendations. \u201cWe owe women and their doctors as much guidance as possible.\u201d\n\nFinally, is there any meaning behind the desire not to look too fat in pregnancy other than the desire not to look too fat in pregnancy? It\u2019s a truism that everyone in New York came here to make it big (preferably metaphorically)\u2014and women\u2019s discomfort about the threat children pose to their identities can thus only be more acute. Larry Rand says he often hears this from patients: \u201cI\u2019ve waited until now to have this baby. I\u2019m very accomplished, I\u2019m fit, I go to the gym five times a week, and I really don\u2019t want this pregnancy to change my life.\u201d Going home from the hospital in the jeans you wore before you got pregnant becomes a \u201csymbol,\u201d he says: You\u2019re the same person you used to be.\n\nI recognize in myself a certain resistance to letting a child change my life, and I hear glimmers of it from other women. \u201cI want to look like myself again,\u201d says Diana Becker. \u201cSoon.\u201d\n\nJohns Hopkins psychologist Janet DiPietro says she finds her subjects\u2019 weight-restrictive behaviors unnerving. \u201cThe pregnancy and the delivery is all about them; it\u2019s almost like they can\u2019t see that they\u2019re going to get a baby out of this deal,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t invest in your baby by gaining weight, I think it\u2019s a harbinger for lack of investment in the child.\u201d\n\nBut surely that is going too far, at least not without understanding each weight-worrying mother. Rand, in fact, believes the focus on staying thin is largely benign. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feed into the culture of \u2018You must be skinny,\u2019 \u201d says the self-described fat kid. \u201cBut I have a lot of empathy for what it feels like to lug around too much weight. If we lived in a world where nobody gave a crap \u2026 but we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn her 1996 book Mother Love, Mother Hate: The Power of Maternal Ambivalence, British psychoanalyst Rozsika Parker observes that health professionals under the sway of Freud have treated \u201cdisliking the physical changes of pregnancy\u201d and experiencing symptoms like nausea as a rejection of motherhood. The thesis of her book is that all women experience strong feelings of dislike and resentment toward their children, feelings that recede and advance, from conception to adolescence and beyond. But that doesn\u2019t mean nobody\u2019s a \u201cgood enough mother,\u201d of course.\n\nNot long ago, I had breakfast with Margot Tenenbaum and Pam Berger. At one point, Tenenbaum began chastising herself for being preoccupied about her weight when there are so many more important things for a mother-to-be to be preoccupied about. Berger should know. She almost lost her first child, Louise, to a rare infection during pregnancy.
