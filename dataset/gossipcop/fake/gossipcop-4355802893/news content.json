So excited to share that I\u2019m officially back for my 20th season of Dancing With the Stars!\u201d wrote Burke, 33.\n\n\u201cThis dance floor will always be my home and I\u2019ve got my eyes on that mirror ball \u2b50\ufe0f,\u201d she continued, adding the hashtags \u201c#bringonthespraytans #dwts.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Chloe Lukasiak On New \u2018Dance Moms\u2019 Coach Cheryl Burke: \u2018She Was Incredible\u2019\n\nBurke is joining 12 fellow pros that were announced last week: Alan Bersten, Keo Motsepe, Artem Chigvintsev, Maks ChmerkovskiyVal Chmerkovskiy, Gleb Savchenko, Mark Ballas, Lindsay Arnold, Peta Murgatroyd, Emma Slater, Sharna Burgess and Witney Carson.\n\nBurke, who has taken home two Mirrorball Trophies throughout her time on the ABC series (season 2 with Drew Lachey and season 3 with Emmitt Smith), last competed on season 23 with Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte.\n\nPEOPLE\u2019s special issue 25 Seasons of \u2018Dancing with The Stars\u2019 is out Sept. 15.\n\nImage zoom\n\nAfter it was confirmed in February that Burke would not be returning for the 24th season of DWTS, PEOPLE learned that she joined Dance Moms as dance after instructor Abby Lee Miller abruptly quit and announced her departure on social media, claiming she had been \u201cmanipulated and disrespected\u201d by producers.\n\nSince taking over the reins of the Lifetime series in March, Burke has taken a vastly different approach to teaching her Dance Moms students.\n\n\u201cI am approaching it differently.
