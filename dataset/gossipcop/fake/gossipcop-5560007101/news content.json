David, 42, on the other hand, is enjoying his retirement from soccer and often \u201cdoes his own thing,\u201d adds the insider. \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual for couples to change and grow apart.\u201d\n\nEven when the pair are in their countryside home in Oxfordshire, England, at the same time, they can be worlds apart. The house has been designed with \u2018his and hers\u2019 wings,\u201d a source tells Us. \u201cI think they quite like having somewhat separate lives. When you\u2019ve been married that long, some regular distance does you both good!\u201d\n\nThe couple, who wed in July 1999, have four children together: sons Brooklyn, 19, Romeo, 15, Cruz, 13, and 6-year-old daughter Harper.\n\n\u201cThe kids are the common bond that will keep them united,\u201d the insider says of the pair, who recently celebrated Brooklyn\u2019s birthday together in NYC. They also spent Easter weekend as a family in Miami.\n\n\u201cThey are like every married couple I know \u2014 some days lovey-dovey, other days cold,\u201d says a second insider. \u201cIt comes with being together so long.\u201d\n\nAnd though they can seem frosty in public, \u201cthey\u2019re really fun,\u201d adds the insider. \u201cVictoria is tough at first, but once you break the wall she\u2019s super funny and cool. David\u2019s just awesome.\u201d\n\nFor more on David and Victoria\u2019s relationship, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly on newsstands now.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/us-weekly-cover-issue-17-brad-pitt.jpg?w=222", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/david-and-victoria-beckham.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/david-and-victoria-beckham.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/david-and-victoria-beckham.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-beckham-victoria-beckham-lead-different-lives-but-it-works/", "title": "David and Victoria Beckham Lead \u2018Very Different\u2019 Lives, But It \u2018Works for Them\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "David and Victoria Beckham may lead \u2018very different lives,\u2019 but it \u2018works for them,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "David and Victoria Beckham Lead \u2018Very Different\u2019 Lives, But It \u2018Works for Them\u2019", "description": "David and Victoria Beckham may lead \u2018very different lives,\u2019 but it \u2018works for them,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-beckham-victoria-beckham-lead-different-lives-but-it-works/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-11T13:18:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/david-and-victoria-beckham.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/david-and-victoria-beckham.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-11T12:00:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-11T13:18:50+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "David and Victoria Beckham may lead \u2018very different lives,\u2019 but it \u2018works for them,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 read more", "title": "David and Victoria Beckham Lead \u2018Very Different\u2019 Lives, But It \u2018Works for Them\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/david-and-victoria-beckham.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523448023.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
