And you\u2019ve got a good reason to! These 2 have been friends forever, they\u2019re some of the hottest celebs in Hollywood and together they\u2019d be the best couple ever! And now we\u2019re now hearing that this reported bit of PDA didn\u2019t come out of nowhere! According to our sources, Rob has been after Katy for a long time! Head here to take a look back at Katy and Rob\u2019s friendship!\n\n\u201cRob has been majorly crushing on Katy for ages, but she was insistent on them being just friends,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cRob wasn\u2019t going to take no for an answer though, and he was determined to win her over. Sure enough, after a prolonged charm offensive, Katy finally gave in, and they\u2019ve been casually dating for a while now. It\u2019s nothing serious at this point, although Rob would definitely love to take things to the next level\u2014 but he\u2019s happy to go at Katy\u2019s pace, for now. Rob is crazy about Katy, she\u2019s pretty much his ideal woman\u2014Strong, independent, creative, smart, and sexy\u2014she\u2019s the full package.\u201d We wholeheartedly agree!\n\nAs we previously reported, Rob and the pop songstress were seen kissing at the Taix French Restaurant in LA. \u201cThey were making out,\u201d a witness told Wonderwall.com. Their onlooker also shared they were being cute and \u201ctotally a couple.\u201d Wow! Now we\u2019re dying to see photos of these 2 together!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you loving these details as much as us?!
