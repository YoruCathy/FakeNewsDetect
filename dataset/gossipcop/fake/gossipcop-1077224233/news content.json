Rich kids will get into good colleges no matter what.\n\n\n\nIt's just the Republican way to look at any social program/invaluable need and say, \"Now how can we make this into a business so we can make even more fucking money?\"\n\n\n\nSmall government= we want to run everything like a business. \"Invest\" in what makes them money, close up what doesn't, people's lives be damned.\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\nExpand\n\nLink\n\nI went to a private school and I really hate to say it, but their holier than thou mentality is common.

It makes me feel ugly, the amount of hate I have for her.\n\n\n\nThis whole fucking charting school thing & her talking about individual investment.

Queen Lesley not letting DeVos's incompetence slide and exposing her for the ignorant asshole she is!\n\n\n\nThe reason the Stormy Daniels thing is a big deal is because it could legitimately be a problem with campaign finance.

We can hope that Mueller is playing some sort of long ended chess game, but I'm ready for Trump and his entire cabinet out yesterday and I just have to accept that he'll finish his first term and then we'll have to deal with Ivanka running in another election cycle or two.\n\n\n\nBetsy on the other hand, Congress APPROVED her, that's how horrific our entire system is.

They did it without a college education so obviously college is just a scam and a waste, right?? And flat-out refuse to see that a) the world doesn't work that way anymore, b) education is vital now, and c) THEY ALSO GOT REALLY FRUCKING LUCKY\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nMy friend and I were talking about this last week. She thinks that as more and more people (POC, women, WOC, those from low income backgrounds) are getting educated, for some people, education is becoming less and less valued. I might take it a step further and suggest it's because they want to show they're better than the groups I just named. They've rebranded willful ignorance as not being manipulated by the media, speaking from the heart, whatever.\n\n\n\nIt's ridic but it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nI live in an area right now that's very..... poorly educated and proud of that.
