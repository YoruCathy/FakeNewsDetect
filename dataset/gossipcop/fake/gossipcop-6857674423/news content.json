But their divorce still isn\u2019t final, a new report says, because they still haven\u2019t agreed to terms about their six children.\n\nAccording to E! News, Jolie is resentful of Pitt for essentially locking her down in Los Angeles, because he\u2019s chosen a film that will be shot in LA to be near his kids. Jolie, meanwhile, had planned on taking them to Europe. \u201cBrad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in LA for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule,\u201d a source told E.\n\nHe currently sees his children - Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne - a few times a week. Jolie, according to the report, is \u2018furious\u2019 at the situation.\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in September 2016.

But she can\u2019t leave with the kids for several months.\u201d\n\nJolie had initially filed for sole physical custody of the kids, but in November 2016, Pitt filed for joint custody. By December, they\u2019d reached a temporary agreement, after the FBI concluded their investigation of Pitt regarding an alleged incident of child abuse on a private plane. No charges were filed and Pitt was cleared.\n\nPitt opened up about the custody battle in his 2017 interview to GQ Style, his first since the split. \u201cI was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you know, after that, we\u2019ve been able to work together to sort this out. We\u2019re both doing our best. I heard one lawyer say, \u2018No one wins in court\u2014it\u2019s just a matter of who gets hurt worse.\u2019 And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you\u2019re right and why they\u2019re wrong, and it\u2019s just an investment in vitriolic hatred. I just refuse. And fortunately my partner in this agrees. It\u2019s just very, very jarring for the kids, to suddenly have their family ripped apart.\u201d\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie take their children Pax, Zahara and Shiloh to a park in Budapest, Hungary in 2010. ( Shutterstock )\n\nAn US Weekly report goes on to say that Pitt is committed to staying in LA, even if that means staying away from his rumoured new girlfriend, the MIT professor, Neri Oxman. \u201cBrad and Neri are still very much in each other\u2019s lives, although not as much as he would like,\u201d the US Weekly source said.\n\nBut without even a draft of the settlement being written by either side, it just goes to show \u2018how at odds they continue to be,\u2019 the report continued.\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more", "images":
