Find out here why he\u2019s not forcing things!\n\nBlake Shelton, 41, has gushed about being a \u201cstepdad\u201d to Gwen Stefani\u2018s, 48, three sons countless times. He\u2019s made it clear that he not only fell in love with Gwen over two years ago, but he also fell hard for her children \u2014 and it shows too! But that doesn\u2019t mean the country crooner isn\u2019t game to have a baby of his own with Gwen. In fact, Blake would reportedly \u201clove\u201d to become a biological father. So what\u2019s holding him back? He\u2019s apparently leaving it all up to Gwen! Click here to see pics of Gwen and Blake\u2019s relationship milestones.\n\n\u201cBlake has fallen in love with Gwen\u2019s kids and has a complete blast with them,\u201d a source close to Blake shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe of course would love to be a father of his own but he is also a little scared about doing it as well. He is currently content with being a stepdad and is happy in that role.\u201d If Gwen wants to get pregnant again though, Blake would be the first person to hop on board! After all, he\u2019s been open about how much he enjoys \u201cfatherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing that would make things different is if Gwen wanted to try having a baby with him, then Blake would be completely on board,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cHe is not going to pressure her one bit but if she wants another, he will be gladly the one to try, and his hopes would be to have a boy. But the decisions on all of that are on Gwen and he is going to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, on Easter Sunday, Blake and Gwen were spotted at church with Gwen\u2019s boys: 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 4-year-old Apollo. The fivesome certainly looked like one happy family all dressed up, and as they left the church, Blake even carried Apollo to the car \u2014 SO sweet! Recently commenting on his life with Gwen and the boys, Blake admitted that at one point, he thought he had missed his opportunity to be a father figure.\n\n\u201cAt this point in my life, I kind of put that\u2014well, I guess that wasn\u2019t meant to be\u2014and then all of a sudden it happens one way or another, and I\u2019m like, wow, I really missed out on a lot, you know,\u201d he shared with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb last month. \u201cHaving them around is, I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. It\u2019s so much fun.\u201d Aw!", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake_gwen-new-embed.jpg?w=620&h=901", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F03%2Fblake-shelton-happy-stepdad-baby-kids-with-gwen-stefani%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3063213", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake_gwen_kids-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake_gwen_kids-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake_gwen_kids-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/03/blake-shelton-happy-stepdad-baby-kids-with-gwen-stefani/", "title": "Blake Shelton Would Love To Have A Baby With Gwen Stefani, But He\u2019s Also Perfectly Happy As \u2018Stepdad\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "There's no doubt Blake Shelton's content being a stepdad, but he'd also be thrilled to have a kid of his own with Gwen Stefani!", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton Would Love To Have A Baby With Gwen Stefani, But He\u2019s Also Perfectly Happy As \u2018Stepdad\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/03/blake-shelton-happy-stepdad-baby-kids-with-gwen-stefani/", "description": "There\u2019s no doubt Blake Shelton\u2019s content being a stepdad, but he\u2019d also be thrilled to have a kid of his own with Gwen Stefani.
