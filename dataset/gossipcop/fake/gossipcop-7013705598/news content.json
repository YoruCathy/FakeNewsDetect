That\u2019s the latest rumor to emerge in the tabloids about the royal family. Gossip Cop, however, can bust the untrue claims.\n\nThe story in question appears in the Australian edition of Woman\u2019s Day, which exclaims in a headline, \u201cThe Queen Is Not Amused!\u201d The piece begins by asserting Prince Harry and Markle \u201ccouldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other\u201d at the Royal Foundation Forum last month, and contends that \u201cwhile their affectionate behavior may be adorable to many, one person isn\u2019t so thrilled: Harry\u2019s grandmother.\u201d It\u2019s specifically alleged the queen has \u201cwarned Harry to tone down the public displays of affection\u2026 and start acting more prim and proper like other royals,\u201d namely Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\n\u201cBeing affectionate just comes naturally to Harry and Meghan, but it\u2019s totally against royal protocol,\u201d claims a so-called \u201cinsider,\u201d who further alleges, \u201cThe queen isn\u2019t thrilled about it at all and word is she summoned Harry to the palace to remind him what\u2019s expected of a royal.\u201d This supposed tipster maintains, \u201cAll the hand-holding just isn\u2019t the royal way at all.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the outlet asserts Prince Harry understands \u201che and Meghan will have to tone things down from now on.\u201d Alleges the publication\u2019s purported source, \u201cHarry has so much respect for his grandmother, and while he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with what they\u2019re doing in public, he certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as disobeying orders.\u201d But Queen Elizabeth, Gossip Cop has learned, has never given Prince Harry and Markle any such \u201corder.\u201d\n\nContrary to the assertions here, there are no official royal protocols against PDA. In fact, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla were photographed sharing a kiss last year. They also regularly hold hands in public. In contrast, his oldest son and daughter-in-law tend to avoid showing PDA while in the public eye, though Prince William and Middleton have held hands on occasion, such as when they were photographed arriving for a Christmas service in December. Simply put, it is up to each couple to decide what conduct is appropriate for them and under which setting. Prince Harry and Markle like to hold hands, although it\u2019s possible their decorum will change once they officially wed.\n\nRegardless, they haven\u2019t engaged in any behavior that is actually out of line. And if the tabloid\u2019s \u201cinsider\u201d really had inside knowledge, he or she would know that not only isn\u2019t there any official protocol against PDA, but that Prince Charles and Prince William have shown affection to their respective significant others without repercussion. It\u2019s also worth noting that Prince Harry and Markle even held hands during the official photos taken following their engagement announcement (see above). Clearly this kind of PDA is a non-issue.\n\nRelated slideshow: Debunking the week's tabloid stories:\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo1E.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjAuh.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBMqL1A.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=267&y=87", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=2cd84b6f6a104ccdbbdc65b0cc1a9606&rnd=636708417327508713&rf=&tp=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fprince-harry-meghan-markle-ordered-to-%25E2%2580%259Ctone-down%25E2%2580%259D-pda-by-queen-elizabeth%252Far-BBKyFCg&di=395&lng=en-us&activityId=2cd84b6f6a104ccdbbdc65b0cc1a9606&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=entertainment-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=entertainment&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBKjyya.img?h=400&w=266&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=737&y=735", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBMqEtR.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=239&y=76", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBMqyQs.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=292&y=126", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAopNLw.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjNi0.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=636708417327508713&c7=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fprince-harry-meghan-markle-ordered-to-%25E2%2580%259Ctone-down%25E2%2580%259D-pda-by-queen-elizabeth%252Far-BBKyFCg&c8=&c9=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=395&pi=&ps=&su=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fprince-harry-meghan-markle-ordered-to-%25E2%2580%259Ctone-down%25E2%2580%259D-pda-by-queen-elizabeth%252Far-BBKyFCg&mkt=en-us&pp=False&cv.partner=Gossip%2BCop&cv.publcat=Gossip%2BCop%2BMedia&st.dpt=entertainment-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636708417327508713&rf=&rid=2cd84b6f6a104ccdbbdc65b0cc1a9606&cvs=Browser&subcvs=entertainment&cv.entityId=BBKyFCg&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AAdsRm7&ar=0&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=2cd84b6f6a104ccdbbdc65b0cc1a9606&pm=&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&ex=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo11.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBKs9pz.img?h=175&w=270&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=282&y=124", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAsZMRM.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo11.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBKs9pz.img?h=175&w=270&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=282&y=124", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005532/https://www.gossipcop.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-pda-queen-elizabeth-reaction/", "title": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle Ordered To \u201cTone Down\u201d PDA By Queen Elizabeth?", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle Ordered To \u201cTone Down\u201d PDA By Queen Elizabeth?", "cq": "passed", "description": "Is Queen Elizabeth ordering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to tone down the PDA?
