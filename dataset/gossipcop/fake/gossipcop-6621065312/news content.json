American Media Inc., which runs the sites Howard works for, conducted its own investigation at the time via a third party and welcomed Howard back to the company after deeming the accusations baseless - a claim which his accusers contest. Still, Crews went after Howard on Twitter bringing up a recent email he received for a story that never went to print.\n\n\u201cThe same guy who runs @radar_online and @NatEnquirer who threatened me with the false prostitute story 1 day after my @GMA interview now accused of SEXUAL MISCONDUCT,\u201d he wrote on Twitter with a link to the story. \u201cABUSERS PROTECT ABUSERS.\u201d\n\nCrews was referencing a tweet he posted in mid-November in which he shared a screenshot of an alleged email from RadarOnline asking him to comment on a story about him hiring two prostitutes while he was in Monte-Carlo, Monaco in 2015. Crews believes the story was a threat to silence him after he spoke on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d about his sexual assault experience involving his former WME manager, Adam Venit. The story was never published on RadarOnline, which Crews attributes to the fact that it\u2019s untrue.\n\nCrews response happens to come on the same day that Deadline reports he filed an official lawsuit against Venit for sexual assault.\n\n\u201cIt is now time to hold Venit accountable for his sexual predatory behavior and to hold WME accountable for its conduct in condoning, ratifying, and encouraging Venit\u2019s sexual predatory behavior,\u201d the Brooklyn Nine-Nine star said in a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Cour. \u201cIndeed, a message needs to be sent to those in power who abuses those over whom they can exert influence and control that abuse and sexual predatory behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d", "images":
