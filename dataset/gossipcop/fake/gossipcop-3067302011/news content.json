In October 2015, Vance Jr. declined to press charges after an investigation into whether Weinstein groped Italian model Ambra Battilana.\n\nSome said Friday that it was remarkable to see Weinstein face charges. Asia Argento, who said Weinstein sexually assaulted her, said on Friday: \u201cWe, the women, finally have real hope for justice.\u201d\n\nThe New York charges are the first against Weinstein, even though several other cities opened up investigations into the producer in the wake of the reporting on the allegations.\n\nHere are the other probes:\n\nFederal probe into Weinstein allegations\n\nFederal prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Weinstein\u2019s alleged sex crimes, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The New York Times reported that the investigation will examine whether Weinstein violated federal stalking laws.\n\nThe investigation is being run by the U.S. District Attorney\u2019s Office in the Southern District of New York. Weinstein\u2019s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, told the Journal that he met with federal prosecutors to attempt \u201cto dissuade them from proceeding.\u201d According to the Journal, federal prosecutors had already been looking into Weinstein for potential fraud.\n\nLos Angeles probe into Weinstein allegations\n\nThe Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office is currently reviewing five investigations into Weinstein \u2014 two from the Beverly Hills Police and three from the Los Angeles Police department, according to the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles Police Captain Billy Hayes confirmed on Oct. 19, 2017 that the department was investigating Weinstein after an unnamed woman told police that the Hollywood mogul sexually assaulted her in a hotel in 2013, according to the Times.\n\nNo charges have been filed against Weinstein in Los Angeles as of Friday. The Los Angeles Country District Attorney\u2019s office did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein\u2019s criminal attorneys Blair Berk and Benjamin Brafman have said that a fair investigation of the allegations of criminal wrongdoing will prove they are without merit,\u201d a spokesperson for Weinstein told the Los Angeles Times of the Los Angeles investigation.\n\nLondon probe into Weinstein allegations\n\nLondon\u2019s Metropolitan Police confirmed in February 2018 that it was investigating Weinstein after 10 women came forward with sexual assault allegations, according to the Associated Press.\n\nNo charges have been filed against Weinstein in London as of Friday. The London Metropolitan Police did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
