We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she might have to bail on the festivities this year.\n\nBlake Shelton, 41, and Gwen Stefani, 48, have always made holidays together a big priority in their relationship. In 2016 they spent Thanksgiving at his Oklahoma ranch and rang in Christmas at her LA home. They were hoping to do turkey day at his country pad again, but she might have to skip out on the festive meal. \u201cGwen had the best time with Blake and his family last year at Thanksgiving and she would love to do it all over again. Last year she promised that she\u2019d be back again for this Thanksgiving, but she might have to break her promise. She\u2019s got so much work on her plate all month, it\u2019s going to be very hard for Gwen to pull it all off,\u201d a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time for promoting her Christmas album, she\u2019s got so many interviews lined up she\u2019s even doing a meet and greet in LA on Black Friday. She keeps insisting that she can do it all, that she can have the big traditional feast with Blake and his family on Thanksgiving and then race back to LA for work,\u201d our insider continues. Gwen just dropped her first ever holiday album You Make It Feel Like Christmas, on Oct. 6 and as the season draws closer, she\u2019s going to be everywhere in support of it.\n\nSince the Blakester is the BEST BOYFRIEND EVER, he\u2019s agreed to change up his Thanksgiving plans in Oklahoma if she can\u2019t make it there to spend it with him. \u201cBlake absolutely wants her there with his family, but he\u2019s told her if she needs to stay in LA he\u2019ll be with her. Either way they\u2019re going to be together, but Gwen\u2019s goal is to be superwoman and make it all happen. She doesn\u2019t want to miss out,\u201d our source says. See Blake and Gwen\u2019s relationship milestones in pics, here.\n\nBlake played a big part in Gwen deciding to record a Christmas album, as the idea came to her while going for a run on her boyfriend\u2019s ranch. \u201cWhat if I did write a Christmas song? What would it be?\u201d she told Billboard magazine. She said that within minutes she came up with a melody and lyrics that she laid down in a voice video as soon as she got back to his house. A few weeks later, she recorded her first ever holiday tune \u201cChristmas Eve.\u201d The title track is a duet between Blake and Gwen that we\u2019re sure will be a total holiday classic for years to come.\n\nHollywoodLifers, have you listened to Gwen\u2019s Christmas album yet? Did it get you in the holiday spirit?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-ranch-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F27%2Fgwen-stefani-thanksgiving-blake-shelton-oklahoma-promise%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2847472&comment_count=3", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-ranch-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-ranch-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Kristen Lopez", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/27/gwen-stefani-thanksgiving-blake-shelton-oklahoma-promise/", "title": "Gwen Stefani: She Might Have To Break Promise To Celebrate Thanksgiving With Blake Shelton In OK", "meta_data": {"description": "Gwen Stefani was hoping to spend Thanksgiving with BF Blake Shelton at his Oklahoma ranch, but may not be able to make it back there this year.", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani: She Might Have To Break Promise To Celebrate Thanksgiving With Blake Shelton In OK", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/27/gwen-stefani-thanksgiving-blake-shelton-oklahoma-promise/", "description": "Gwens Stefani had the best time spending her 2016 Thanksgiving with boyfriend Blake Shelton and his family in Oklahoma.
