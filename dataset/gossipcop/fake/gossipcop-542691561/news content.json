She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music's top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008 and the couple has three children.\n\nEarly Life\n\nSinger and actress Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her singing and dancing abilities.\n\nDestiny's Child\n\nTeaming up with her cousin Kelly Rowland and two classmates, Knowles formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band's manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records. Destiny's Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts with \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" off their second album. The recording also featured another smash hit, \"Say My Name.\"\n\nWhile enjoying her group's success, Knowles began exploring other projects. She made her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in Carmen: A Hip Hopera.

The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.\n\nMarriage to Jay-Z\n\nIn 2008, Knowles married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Knowles' mother, Tina Knowles; father, Matthew; sister, Solange; Destiny's Child members Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nThe newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, promoting her latest effort, I am...

She decided to drop her father as her manager in March 2011. Later that year, Knowles reached the top of the album charts with her latest solo release, 4.\n\nIn January 2013, Knowles generated some negative headlines for her performance at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. She was criticized for reportedly pre-recording a version of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and lip-syncing to her own track during the outdoor ceremony. Despite wide media coverage, in the days following the incident, Knowles did not publicly address the controversy.\n\nNot long after, prior to her appearance at Super Bowl XLVII, Knowles performed the song live at a press conference. She explained to reporters that she had used a \"backing track\" at the inauguration, adding that she would \"absolutely be singing live\" at the NFL's biggest event of the year, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nIndeed, Knowles more than redeemed herself in the public eye at the Super Bowl on February 3, 2013.
