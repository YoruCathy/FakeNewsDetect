Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he\u2019s a total douchebag. I can\u2019t help it though \u2013 there\u2019s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can\u2019t always explain why we\u2019re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he\u2019s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.\n\nKendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music\u2019s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky \u2014 and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer\u2014 who counts Katy Perry as an ex \u2014 at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by \u00adKendall\u2019s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: \u201cKendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other\u2019s company and hanging off everything the other \u00adperson said. Diplo was \u00adstroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone \u00adwondered whether there could be something more going on between them.\u201d The pair\u2019s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall\u2019s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party \u2014 thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald\u2019s \u2014 basketball star Blake walked straight past \u00adKendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood \u2014 although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: \u201cKendall has a lot of male interest and isn\u2019t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very \u00adflattered at the attention he was showing her.\u201d I also hear Kendall is being paid around \u00a3450,000 per \u00adepisode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.\n\n[From The Sun]\n\nI\u2019m sure some of you will be like \u201cKendall wasn\u2019t flirting with Diplo because she\u2019s gay.\u201d First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It\u2019s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it\u2019s more than likely she\u2019s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it\u2019s likely that she\u2019s the most \u201cquiet\u201d about her love life among the sisters. So\u2026 basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it\u2019s true love. And she\u2019s probably ashamed of herself and she\u2019ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f\u2013king hot).\n\nAlso: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nEmbed from Getty Images", "images":
