HL learned exclusively she\u2019s having a hard time adjusting & is desperate for attention.\n\nIt seems like North West, 4, only JUST got used to her little brother Saint West, 2, and now she already has another younger sibling in the fam! Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West, 40, welcomed their third child, a little girl, on Jan. 15 via surrogate, and while the two couldn\u2019t be happier about having another daughter, Nori is apparently not very pleased. We\u2019ve heard the youngster loves her new sister, but is having a tough time accepting that she\u2019s no longer the only daughter in the house. On top of that, the new baby is obviously getting all of her parents\u2019 attention right now.

However, even Kim has been super open about North not being the best sibling to baby Saint. In fact, Kim had to stop breastfeeding her son because North was getting too jealous!\n\nIn an effort to avoid such problems this time around, Kim and Kanye tried their best to prep their eldest. But so far, it looks like their methods haven\u2019t been working. \u201cKim has been preparing to help North adjust to having a baby sister, but the four-year-old is quickly acting out and seeking attention,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cKim is being patient with North hoping that her oldest daughter adjusts to the new baby. Kim even bought both North and Saint presents \u2014 stuffed animals and new dolls she said were from the new baby \u2014 hoping to smooth over the transition of having a baby in the family.\u201d\n\nNow that the child has arrived, \u201cKim is even letting the older sister hold the new baby hoping to create a bond that will help North enjoy being a big sister again,\u201d the source added. Even this past summer in Aug. 2017, Kim admitted that North was STILL not being the nicest to little Saint. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s \u2019cause she\u2019s the older sister\u2026I don\u2019t know what it is; I thought it was a phase. She does not like her brother. It\u2019s so hard for me,\u201d Kim said while appearing on Live! With Kelly and Ryan. \u201cI thought it was like, \u2018Ok, a couple months; she\u2019s just warming up to it.\u2019 She got so jealous when I would breastfeed and all that stuff. Now, the phase isn\u2019t going away!\u201d Yikes! Could history be repeating itself?\n\nOn top of that, in February, Kim revealed that cute moments between her kids were \u201crare.\u201d Responding to a fan\u2019s tweet that referred to a sweet pic of North and Saint together, Kim said, \u201cThis was a rare moment. She is really amazing at pushing him and crying when I hold him though.\u201d Hopefully things will go more smoothly with this new little one though. After all, North is older now and the baby is a girl, which Nori had reportedly been wanting all along.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 are you surprised North is reportedly not responding well to her little sister?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/north-west-acting-out-baby-sister-arrival-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F17%2Fnorth-west-struggling-with-baby-sister-acting-out-wants-attention%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2951664&comment_count=4", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/north-west-acting-out-baby-sister-arrival-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/north-west-acting-out-baby-sister-arrival-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/17/north-west-struggling-with-baby-sister-acting-out-wants-attention/", "title": "North West\u2019s \u2018Struggling\u2019 With Her Baby Sister\u2019s Arrival: She\u2019s \u2018Acting Out & Seeking Attention\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "North West's a big sis again -- but HL learned exclusively she's having a hard time adjusting.
