The Sunday, January 21, episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians saw more friction between Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick and it also featured a brief but chilling moment as Kris Jenner sat down with old friend Faye Resnick to discuss O.J. Simpson\u2018s upcoming parole.\n\nThe author of the controversial book Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted, said that the Juice\u2019s upcoming parole, \u201cScares the death out of me.\u201d Kris\u2019 longtime pal, who wrote the book in 1994 after Simpson\u2019s ex-wife and Ron Goldman were murdered, added, \u201cI\u2019ve been having nightmares about that.\u201d\n\nKris \u2014 whose late husband, Robert Kardashian, was a friend of Simpson\u2019s and served as his defense attorney during his 1995 murder trial \u2014 admitted to being \u201cin denial\u201d about what was, at the time, his upcoming parole hearing.\n\nKourtney Tells Scott About Her New Boyfriend\n\nLater, Kourtney vented to sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian about a recent phone call she\u2019d had with Scott. After he called her at 2 a.m., Kourtney revealed she told Scott, \u201cI have a boyfriend. He\u2019s 24 years old.\u201d Kourtney, who met beau Younes Bendjima in late 2016, said that Scott immediately hung up on her. Kourtney shrugged, \u201cI just thought he knew.\u201d\n\nKourtney Says Scott Is \u2018On\u2019 Something\n\nScott seemed to fly off the handle a bit after Kourtney\u2019s relationship status update. After recapping a heated interaction with Scott, Kourtney told Khlo\u00e9 that she asked him what he was \u201con\u201d and told her sister that he said \u201cf\u2013king everything.\u201d She then said he behaved aggressively toward her after she visited his house to see if he was all right.\n\nThe duo clearly patched things up by the end of the episode as Scott arrived at Kourtney\u2019s to pick up son Mason, 8, for a sleepover. After putting an entire carton of milk in his backpack, the father of three left, saying, \u201cLove you, partner\u201d to Kourtney on his way out.\n\nKris Says She\u2019s \u2018Definitely Getting Into Heaven\u2019\n\nThe episode also followed Kris exploring the option of having your cremated ashes pressed into a memorial diamond. After debating the idea with several of her children, she decided against the complicated and morbid jewelry plan. While contemplating the choice she revealed to the camera, \u201cI believe that I\u2019m definitely getting into heaven.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E!
