In an announcement on Twitter she posted, \u201cI\u2019m so bummed I won\u2019t be able to make it to China this year. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year!\u201d\n\nUp until Thursday, it was understood that Gigi would be joining her sister and walking the show for the third year in a row. The abrupt announcement has many fans speculating as to why she will not be there. While some have cited other models having issues with Visa\u2019s, the majority feel that it might have something to do with a viral video of her that was posted to Snapchat a few months ago. In the video, Gigi is shown squinting her eyes while holding a Buddha, which was seen as extremely offensive. With the show taking place in Shanghai, commenters called for the model to drop out almost immediately after news broke that she was joining the 2017 model cast. Despite a written apology several months after the incident, it appears several fans were still held a grudge.\n\nAfter she announced on social media that she wouldn't be walking in Shanghai after all, one person replied to her post, stating: \u201cIt\u2019s what you deserved after that offensive video, and your white ass couldn\u2019t even publicly apologize. We got Bella, we\u2019re good sis.\u201d Another reiterated, \u201cChina did what was right! This is the consequences to her actions. May this be a lesson for her. Apologies doesn\u2019t erase the actions.\u201d\n\n[twitter: https://twitter.com/LeeOlivia4ever/status/931358940641632257]\n\nOthers are highly upset that Gigi is out of the show, and they're blaming Victoria's Secret for her absence using the hashtag #VSShowIsOver.\n\nWhile it does seem likely that the blowback from the video could have caused Gigi's absence this year, neither Victoria\u2019s Secret nor Gigi have confirmed the rumors. This isn't the only setback Victoria's Secret staff is facing while producing the 2017 show in Shanghai, according to reports. Media outlets are alleging that Katy Perry is out as a performer because she was denied access into China after wearing a costume with sunflowers \u2014 an anti-China symbol \u2014 during a performance in Taiwan. It's been reported that four models and several bloggers were denied Visas to enter China, and Adriana Lima's visa is in purgatory.
