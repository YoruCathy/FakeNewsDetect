That\u2019s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much 'Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock' \u2014 I am so not that.\"\n\nOnce swift, angry blowback followed the publication of the piece, Cyrus took to Instagram to share her side of the story, or her account of what didn't make it into print: She stressed that the comment was made in a broader conversation and that she's an \"artist without borders\" who was asked about her thoughts on rap for this particular conversation.\n\n\"A lot of the time publications like to focus on the most sensationalized part of the conversation,\" she writes. \"So, to be clear I respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music (country, pop, alternative .... but in this particular interview I was asked about rap) I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop as I've collaborated with some of the very best! At this point in my life I am expanding personally/musically and gravitating more towards uplifting, conscious rap!\"\n\nShe closes by reminding her followers that she's got new music coming \u2014 her single, \"Malibu,\" from her forthcoming album is set to drop on May 11 \u2014 and that she hopes that her words \"encourage others to LOVE.\" Her note is way closer to her mission than the comments she made in passing, that's for sure, so we'll wait and see if any \"uplifting, conscious rap\" makes it way onto the record.", "images": ["https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:233290?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:233290?width=385&height=217&quality=.05&format=jpg"], "top_img": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:233290?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Hughes"], "canonical_link": "http://www.mtv.com/news/3010143/miley-cyrus-rap-comments/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": 320, "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtv.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "call_config": "{\"omniture\":{\"pageName\":\"/news/3010143/miley-cyrus-rap-comments/\",\"channel\":\"news\",\"events\":\"event16, event18\",\"prop1\":\"Miley Cyrus\",\"prop8\":\"none\",\"prop9\":\"\",\"prop11\":\"\",\"prop12\":\"Celebrity\",\"prop14\":\"\",\"prop15\":\"no-franchise\",\"prop18\":\"Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments [Celebrity]\",\"prop19\":\"05.06.2017\",\"prop20\":\"Hilary Hughes\",\"prop21\":\"ALLTRAFFIC:MTV\",\"prop28\":\"News article\",\"prop38\":\"mtv.com\",\"prop44\":null,\"prop55\":\"news:News\",\"prop65\":\"News Article\",\"eVar6\":\"none\",\"eVar9\":\"/news/3010143/miley-cyrus-rap-comments/\",\"eVar10\":\"ALLTRAFFIC:MTV\",\"eVar68\":\"no-franchise\",\"hier1\":\"/news/3010143/miley-cyrus-rap-comments/\"}}"}, "og": {"site_name": "MTV News", "image": {"identifier": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:233290?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "author": "Hilary Hughes", "type": "article", "description": "'I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop'", "title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "url": "http://www.mtv.com/news/3010143/miley-cyrus-rap-comments/"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.mtv.com:3010143"}, "thumbnail": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:233290?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:233290?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop'", "title": "Miley Cyrus Says She Respects 'ALL Artists Who Speak Their Truth' After Negative Rap Comments", "url": "http://www.mtv.com/news/3010143/miley-cyrus-rap-comments/"}, "author": "Hilary Hughes", "article": {"author": "http://www.twitter.com/hilmonstah"}, "fb": {"app_id": 122150691493, "admins": "unset"}, "asset_url": "http://www.mtv.com/news", "expression": "shownav", "description": "'I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop'"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.com", "summary": ""}
