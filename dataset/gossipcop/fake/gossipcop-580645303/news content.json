We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she would love to have Tay come on \u2018American idol\u2019 so they could perform together.\n\nNow that Taylor Swift, 28, and Katy Perry, 33, have buried the hatchet in their years long feud, the \u201cRoar\u201d singer would love to have her former enemy join her on American Idol. \u201cKaty was a little taken back when Taylor made the world aware that the feud was over, but is very happy that it seems to be actually 100% over. Katy would love Taylor to come on Idol, she would love to perform with each other and really go all in on working together since they are both such powerful women in the industry. She had mixed emotions at first, but realized how important their friendship can be because what they can do as a team instead of enemies,\u201d a source close to Katy tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nAs for when this amazing duet could happen, \u201cIf Taylor wanted to come this season for the finale since she has the night off she would be invited, and if she wanted to do it next year that would be fine as well. It is an open door policy,\u201d our insider adds. The AI 2018 season finale is a two night affair starting on May 20, and Tay will be in between playing dates at Pasadena\u2019s Rose Bowl and Santa Clara\u2019s Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nTay shocked the world when on the opening night of her North American stadium tour on May 8, she revealed that Katy sent her a literal olive branch and a handwritten note. She showed off a video off on social media and writing \u201cThank you Katy\u201d, and saying \u201cSo, I just got to my dressing room and found this actual olive branch. This means so much to me.\u201d While only the start of the note can be seen, it appears to read \u201cHey Old Friend \u2014 I\u2019ve been doing some reflecting on past miscommunications and hurt feelings between us. I really want to clear the air\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nTaylor made it clear she had accepted whatever else Katy had to say in her letter and now the pair\u2019s long feud is over. It all started when Katy allegedly lured away three dancers from Taylor\u2019s Red tour in 2013 to work on her Prismatic tour and Taylor vented about it to Rolling Stone, albeit not naming Katy directly. They\u2019ve since gone at each other in song, with Tay\u2019s \u201cBad Blood\u201d and Katy\u2019s \u201cSwish Swish,\u201d but the AI judge as softened up over the past year, openly wishing that they\u2019d put their past differences aside.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/katy-perry-thrilled-taylor-swift-feud-over-ftr.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/katy-perry-thrilled-taylor-swift-feud-over-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F10%2Fkaty-perry-taylor-swift-american-idol-feud-over%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3138046", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/katy-perry-thrilled-taylor-swift-feud-over-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/10/katy-perry-taylor-swift-american-idol-feud-over/", "title": "Katy Perry Thrilled Taylor Swift Feud Is Over: She Wants Her To Come On \u2018American Idol\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Katy Perry is hoping that since her feud with Taylor Swift is finally over, the singer will come on 'American Idol' where they can perform together.", "news_keywords": "Katy Perry, Taylor Swift", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Katy Perry Thrilled Taylor Swift Feud Is Over: She Wants Her To Come On \u2018American Idol\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/10/katy-perry-taylor-swift-american-idol-feud-over/", "description": "Katy Perry is so happy that her feud with Taylor Swift is now in the past.
