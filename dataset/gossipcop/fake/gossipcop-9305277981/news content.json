That\u2019s the claim coming from the tabloids. Gossip Cop looked into the story.\n\n\u201cPrince Harry Triggers \u2018Battle Royal\u2019 By Squiring Meghan To Pippa\u2019s Nups,\u201d reads a headline in the current edition of the National Enquirer. In ridiculous language, it\u2019s said, \u201cBrit royal watchers from grrlies to grannies are nervously clutching their pearls at the big question looming over the upcoming wedding of Kate Middleton\u2019s pouty lil\u2019 sis, Pippa: Will Prince Harry be permitted to parade TV sex siren Meghan Markle at the nuptials?!\u201d\n\nA so-called \u201croyal spy\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cPippa flat out does NOT want Meghan at her wedding! Why? She fears the Hollywood star\u2019s presence would absolutely upstage her \u2014 but Harry\u2019s adamant! He insists Meghan will be at his side, or he\u2019ll skip the whole affair.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince William\u2019s siding with brother Harry, while Kate\u2019s totally sympathetic to Pippa\u2019s view,\u201d continues the supposed source. \u201cBut interestingly, Prince Charles and Camilla are wholeheartedly backing Ginger Prince simply to stick it to Kate\u2019s social-climbing mother, Carole, where there\u2019s no love lost\u2026 because it could get a lot worse: Nixing Meghan from the nuptials could explode into a headline-grabbing \u2018royal boycott\u2019 PR nightmare!\u201d\n\nPlease. Pippa\u2019s wedding is not going to lead to a \u201croyal boycott,\u201d regardless of who does or doesn\u2019t attend. And there\u2019s a few fatal flaws in this article. First off, it has never been confirmed that anyone in the royal family will be at the wedding. Second, Markle has yet to attend a family event with Prince Harry. So to speculate about Markle\u2019s attendance at a wedding that the royals themselves may not even attend when the future of the relationship isn\u2019t even clear is, quite simply, absurd.\n\nIt seems the National Enquirer just wants to pretend it has royal insight. That\u2019s why, in October, the supermarket tabloid ran an outrageous story about Kate Middleton taking Pippa to Las Vegas for a wild bachelorette party. Both articles should be filed under creative fiction, not news.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nGet the recap on 'The Bachelor'\n\nKim and Kanye didn't have a bad holiday week\n\nCarrie Fisher's sisters open about their late sister", "images": ["http://www.wonderwall.com/cache/img/gossipcop_1520380848.png", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAX4AAAAyAQMAAABh+SIcAAAAA1BMVEXl5eX7Oj7PAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAABlJREFUeAHtwQEBAAAEACD/V3sBVNEMAIAECZIAAY3qJn4AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAMAAAAECAAAAABuRtrbAAAAAnRSTlMA5abz288AAAANSURBVHgBY3zKwICMASBsA5nUrAQKAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/07/19/109-187351_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74", "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/07/19/104-187351_Actual.jpg?x=577&y=800&icq=74&sig=5b2810a02efc9740dbfc5a8d64332e69", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAL0AAAAaAQAAAADKtWDLAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAAOSURBVHgBYxgUYBSMAgACigABeXQ0YAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/07/19/109-187351_FacebookShare.jpg?x=700&y=367&icq=74&sig=3fc04f34c14b10d84b88248aac689678"], "top_img": "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/07/19/109-187351_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "http://www.gossipcop.com/pippa-middleton-wedding-meghan-markle-invited/", "title": "Pippa Middleton Refuses To Invite Meghan Markle To Wedding?", "meta_data": {"description": "Is Pippa Middleton refusing to invite Meghan Markle to her wedding?", "pubdate": "2017-01-03T00:29:01-08:00", "title": "Pippa Middleton Refuses To Invite Meghan Markle To Wedding?", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/07/19/109-187351_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "title": "Pippa Middleton Refuses To Invite Meghan Markle To Wedding?", "description": "Is Pippa Middleton refusing to invite Meghan Markle to her wedding?", "type": "article", "site_name": "Wonderwall.com", "url": "https://www.wonderwall.com/celebrity/photos/pippa-middleton-refuses-to-invite-meghan-markle-to-wedding-1952263.article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-01-03T00:29:01-08:00", "section": "Celebrity"}, "fb": {"app_id": 111376106992, "pages": 61348233862}, "twitter": {"site": "@Wonderwall", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pippa Middleton Refuses To Invite Meghan Markle To Wedding?", "description": "Is Pippa Middleton refusing to invite Meghan Markle to her wedding?", "image": "https://www.wonderwall.com/photos/2016/07/19/109-187351_FacebookShare.jpg?icq=74"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "p": {"domain_verify": "6bd7ca8def87b619f395211fb9be7755"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fb1896", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wonderwall.com/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ededed"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1483432141.0, "source": "http://www.wonderwall.com", "summary": ""}
