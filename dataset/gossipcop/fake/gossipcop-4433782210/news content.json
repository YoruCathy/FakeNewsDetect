Since his aunt, the famed Rosemary Clooney, had such a stellar singing career, the producers assumed he, too, would have a solid set of pipes.\n\n\n\n\"Then we got into the recording studio and I sang 'Man of Constant Sorrow' with all the music playing, and I finished and looked up and there's that glass booth with all of them in it and no one would look me in the eye,\" he told Travers.\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the rumor that Clooney did not sing for this film was totally true. \"They played it back and it was pretty bad. It was so bad that I made them destroy it.\"", "images": ["http://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/e96/0,155,460,242/x/1218258/image.jpg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg"], "top_img": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/e96/0,155,460,242/x/1218258/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Araceli Cruz", "Meg Whitman", "Lydia Wang", "Kaitlin Reilly", "Sarah Midkiff", "Becca Rose", "Ineye Komonibo", "Mon\u00e1 Thomas", "Alyssa Milano", "Biggest George Clooney Rumors - Feud With Dicaprio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2014/04/66981/george-clooney-rumors", "title": "Biggest George Clooney Rumors", "meta_data": {"title": "Biggest George Clooney Rumors - Feud With DiCaprio", "description": "George Clooney's been the subject of many a Hollywood rumor.
