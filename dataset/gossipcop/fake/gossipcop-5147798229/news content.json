He\u2019s worked this out so Gwen has to sleep in the same house where he cheated on her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cruel, cold and brilliant \u2014 in a twisted sort of way.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s 13-year marriage ended in 2015 after sordid details of the British rocker\u2019s affair with their sons\u2019 nanny, Mindy Mann, made headlines. The mansion was put on the block in 2016, and the couple agreed to split the profits, insiders said.\n\n\u201cGwen was worth about $75 million before the divorce, but she had to give Gavin half of that.
