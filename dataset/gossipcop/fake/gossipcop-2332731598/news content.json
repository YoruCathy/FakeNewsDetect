I\u2019m not attached to this \u201clife\u201d so you can\u2019t touch me.\n\n\u2018I know who i am where i\u2019m from and where i\u2019m going and that bothers you. only one opinion matter The one of my Lord. Have a wonderful day.\u2019\n\nHowever The Shade Room captured a comment from Kim that allegedly read: \u2018Nice pics from your \u201cboys trip\u201d.\u2019\n\nKourt and her now ex-beau began dating back in 2016 when she met the Givenchy and Balmain model during Paris Fashion Week; just days before Kourtney\u2019s sister Kim was the target of a horrific raid.\n\nBut rumours of a rift have been rife for weeks after Bendjima threw major shade at his then-girlfriend on Instagram, posting a comment on a photo of Kourtney in a thong bikini which simply read: \u2018Thats what you need to show to get likes?\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, sources claimed that the comment was just Younes\u2019 attempt at humour.\n\nA source told Us Weekly: \u2018It was him trying to make a joke, and it wasn\u2019t perceived well on Instagram. He doesn\u2019t realise that making a joke could be perceived as something totally different or negative.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
