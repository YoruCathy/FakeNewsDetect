And already, the rom com star is in a bit of a real-life love triangle: two guys are contending for her affection. The first hopeful is a tech titan, as the outlet describes him, that a friend introduced her to. \u201cHe recently split from his wife and is trying to win over Jen,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe second \u201cis an industry creative she met when they started working on a project together several months ago,\" another source said. (Aniston is working on at least three projects currently: Murder Mystery, that morning talk show drama Apple TV series with Reese Witherspoon, and that Netflix series where she'll play the President with Tig Notaro as her First Lady.)
