The new Duchess of Sussex has managed to shake things up since joining the royal family, but she would be breaking royal protocol if she were to throw a bash before any future baby is born. This rule might be a bummer for Meghan, but it actually makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u201c[The royals] are clearly very wealthy, and a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate,\u201d ABC News\u2019 royal expert Vickie Arbiter said back in 2013 when Kate Middleton was pregnant with Prince George. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t go out and buy themselves.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Meghan could accept baby-related gifts is murky. According to British rules, \u201cGifts offered by private individuals living in the United Kingdom not personally known to the Member of the Royal Family should be refused where there are concerns about the propriety or motives of the donor or the gift itself.\u201d (This is why she and Prince Harry had to return more than $9 milion worth of wedding presents.) Gifts from strangers have to be turned down, but what about offerings from her friends? The answer seems unclear, but it\u2019s possible the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would return everything, including gifts from friends, just so they can\u2019t be accused of being improper.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle also have the option of just asking for donations in lieu of gifts, so they don\u2019t have to deal with the issue of acceptability. They did this at their wedding, although they received gifts anyway \u2014 including their new titles.\n\nBaby showers aren\u2019t quite as popular in the United Kingdom as they are here in America, so throwing a baby shower might also be odd in addition to inappropriate. Because Meghan is known for her rule-breaking streak, we guess that she\u2019ll at least have her dear friends visit to celebrate. Even a heartfelt congratulations over the phone would suffice.\n\nOf course, we won\u2019t have to worry about any of this until Meghan announces that she\u2019s expecting (if she ever does!).\n\nMore From Woman\u2019s World\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s New British Accent Confuses Fans \u2014 But She\u2019s Not the Only Celeb to Change Her Voice\n\nWhy You\u2019ll Never See Meghan Markle Wearing Wedges Around the Queen\n\n4 Heartwarming Ways Meghan Markle Has Paid Tribute to Princess Diana", "images": ["https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/queen-elizabeth-birthday-cake.jpg?w=415", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/reading-in-bed.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/queen-elizabeth-brooch-cullinan-v.jpg?w=350", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8187616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Suzys-family.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-harry-meghan-california.jpg?w=415", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kelly-clarkson-montana-cabin.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meghan-markle-baby-shower.jpg?w=724", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/how-to-wash-face-masks.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1205430833.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/womans-world-horoscopes.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/diy-gray-hair-dye.jpg?w=415", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1052439222.jpg?w=325", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/matthew-mcconaughey-bingo.jpg?w=415", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/goldie-hawn-postive-tips.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://bauerxcel.imgix.net/ww_cover.jpg?auto=compress&q=55&w=149", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-charles-favorite-food.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meghan-markle-baby-shower.jpg?resize=1024,759", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kfc-fried-chicken-recipe.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-696894546.jpg?w=350", "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1142244433.jpg?w=350"], "top_img": "https://www.womansworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/meghan-markle-baby-shower.jpg?resize=1024,759", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melanie Aman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.womansworld.com/posts/entertainment/meghan-markle-baby-shower-163579", "title": "Why Meghan Markle Won\u2019t Be Able to Have a Baby Shower", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "We can't wait to see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's kids, but Meghan won't get to celebrate with a baby shower.
