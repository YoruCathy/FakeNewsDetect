With new music, appearances and more, Harry was everywhere. Here\u2019s why we picked him!\n\nHarry Styles, 23, is having what\u2019s sure to be one of the best weeks of his life\u2026and HollywoodLife.com is naming him our Star of the Week because of it. The first reason, of course, is because of the release of his very first solo album, Harry Styles. Just a month and a half after he announced he\u2019d be putting out solo music, Harry dropped his debut record, and it immediately soared to the top of the charts. Fans are going completely crazy over the album\u2019s ten songs, and we couldn\u2019t be prouder of the 23-year-old!\n\nAside from putting out a record, Harry also started doing solo public appearances to promote the music. Fans started lining up for his Today Show concert almost TWO full days in advance, and the crowd went on for SIX New York City blocks when he took the stage on May 9. Harry looked hotter than ever while performing \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d \u201cCarolina\u201d and \u201cEver Since New York\u201d for the crowd, and he totally proved he can own that stage, even without his One Direction band mates.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s been a totally hectic few days for Harry \u2014 he was in New York for the first half of the week, then jetted back to London for the album release. Still, he\u2019s made sure to stop and spend time with his fans, posing for selfies and chatting with his loyal supporters. He even sweetly sent pizza out to those waiting in the Today show line all night long. How cute is that?!\n\nThings aren\u2019t slowing down for Harry any time soon, either. He\u2019ll be promoting his music for the next few weeks, and then his first movie, Dunkirk, is set to hit theaters on July 21. After the press run for that is over, he\u2019ll have to start prepping for his tour in the fall. That tour, by the way, sold out in SECONDS when the tickets went on sale last week. GO HARRY GO!\n\n[interaction id=\u201d5915b588f5b27d4e18d6cb92\u2033]\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Harry is a good pick for Star of the Week?! What\u2019s your fave thing he did this week?", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F05%2F12%2Fharry-styles-new-music-album-solo%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2586267", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/harry-styles-celeb-of-the-week-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/harry-styles-celeb-of-the-week-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/12/harry-styles-new-music-album-solo/", "title": "Harry Styles: Why He Rules As HollywoodLife\u2019s Star Of The Week", "meta_data": {"description": "With the release of his new music, a performance on the 'Today' show and more, Harry Styles is the obvious choice for our Star of the Week!", "news_keywords": "Harry Styles", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harry Styles: Why He Rules As HollywoodLife\u2019s Star Of The Week", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/12/harry-styles-new-music-album-solo/", "description": "The choice for HollywoodLife.com\u2019s Star of the Week this week is pretty obvious \u2014 who else could it be besides Harry Styles?!
