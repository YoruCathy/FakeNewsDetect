It\u2019s an achievement that has bolstered her profile as a hot celebrity but it has also made her vulnerable to plastic surgery rumors.\n\nEver since Kate\u2019s fame skyrocketed because of her magazine covers, people have been closely checking every flaw or perfection on her face and body. Some wonder about her cup size, while others think she has fake boobs.\n\nStories about Kate having breast implants and rhinoplasty have been written about numerous times. She has also been the subject of lip fillers rumors.\n\nCosmetic surgeons from the United States and other countries have also joined in the fray to give their opinions about Kate\u2019s alleged boob job. Her large breasts have been a talking point in many discussions and forums online.\n\nBlessed with striking beauty, Michigan-born and God-loving Kate Upton perhaps never anticipated the impact of her many front covers. She has not acknowledged the rumors about her augmentations, but you\u2019ve got to wonder if she has actually done it.\n\nBefore & After Photos\n\nSo what\u2019s real or fake in Kate Upton? Did she really get any cosmetic surgery?\n\nLet\u2019s examine a bunch of photos before and after she became famous. Perhaps, there\u2019s an answer that will satisfy people\u2019s curiosity about her amazing physique.\n\nLet\u2019s get started\u2026\n\nDoes Kate Upton Have Breast Implants?\n\nKate\u2019s boobs are size 34D. The stunner never admitted to a boob job but she said in an interview with The Sun that she wished for smaller boobs every single day of her life.\n\nHaving big breasts apparently limited her clothing choices. She can\u2019t wear spaghetti straps without a bra when she just wants to chill. Her sentiments about big boobs suggested that her bust size is all natural.\n\nBut there are those who believe that Kate had breast implants. It sprung from a rumor that she supposedly was a 32D before she hit fame. Can you see any difference in her bust size in these photos?\n\nDid She Get A Nose Job?\n\nSome years back, Kate mocked the Kardashian sisters for their nose job. Her silly joke on Snapchat became news-worthy but it also led others to wonder if the model didn\u2019t have one herself. The fact that she made a joke out of it suggests that Kate\u2019s nose hasn\u2019t been altered. It\u2019s also a telling remark as it seems she doesn\u2019t believe in plastic surgery.\n\nIf you look closely in these before and after pictures, the size and shape of her nose appear similar. Kate might have also used makeup to minimize her nose\u2019s tip and slim down the bridge.\n\nHas Kate Had Lip Injections?\n\nYounger Kate had thinner upper and lower lip but those became fuller in shape and size when she matured into a sexy woman, as seen in these photos. Did she simply learn to choose the right lipstick or does lip injections have a lot to do with her transformation?\n\nWhile keeping mum about any procedures done to her face, Kate\u2019s lips used to be prominently on many ad campaigns as she was the spokesmodel for Bobbi Brown lipstick.\n\nWhat About The Rest Of Her Body?\n\nKate\u2019s body looked slimmer when she was just starting out with modeling. She looked taller and had noticeable long legs, too. A couple of years down the line, Kate appeared to pack a few pounds and wore a lot of baggy outfits when she was not working. Then she shaped up yet again.\n\nPeople thought Kate had liposuction to help regain her slim body. Cosmetic surgery expert Dr. Tal Roudner, however, told Life & Style mag that he thinks Kate is a natural beauty. The expert doesn\u2019t believe Kate got any procedure at all.\n\nBeauty expert Jennifer Leebow of Beauty Bar also doesn\u2019t think Kate had any work \u2014 such as a butt lift \u2014 done on her. If anything, the model could have lost weight through a workout or diet rather than plastic surgery.\n\nSpeaking with Cosmopolitan, Kate\u2019s trainer Ben Bruno said that the model does a lot of strength training to keep her body in the best shape and form. As much as possible, she also stays away from sugar and processed food.\n\nKate Upton\u2019s Beauty Transformation\n\nLet\u2019s see how the gorgeous model\u2019s looks and styles have changed through the years. This ensures that we will not miss any cosmetic surgeries or beauty enhancements.\n\nEarly Childhood\n\nSource: Pinterest\n\nPretty Kate looked so adorable when she was young. As a child, she wore her hair long and her teeth were spaced out unevenly that she might have gotten braces to fix it. But look closely at those prominent cheekbones \u2014 she already had the makings of a model back then.\n\nTeenager Days\n\nSource: Reddit\n\nKate was a stunner as a teen and here\u2019s the evidence from her yearbook photo in high school. Blonde with long hair and a gorgeous smile, it seems Kate didn\u2019t have an awkward teenager phase growing up.\n\nYear 2008\n\nSource: Facebook\n\nKate moved to Miami to sign up with the Elite Model Management and she was already a standout at 16 with her beautiful eyes and fetching smile.\n\nThe model had a small face shape then that made her nose and chin noticeable. But similar to her appearance as a little girl, her cheeks remained distinct. She had prominent gumlines, too, and it was part of her appeal.\n\nYear 2010\n\nSource: Twitter\n\nThis polaroid photo of Kate at 18 kicked off her career in a big way, as she nabbed the ad campaign for Guess. She looked so real and natural in this photo, even with her busty frame.\n\nHer breast size was so obvious in this white dress that hugged her upper body in all the right places.\n\nYear 2012\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty\n\nKate showed up at a Vanity Fair Oscar party looking rather elegant with her earrings and hairdo. She had gorgeous eye makeup on and her eyebrows were perfectly brushed in place. Her pink lips were a lovely contrast to the red dress she wore.\n\nPeople speculated she had a nose job because of this look. Do you agree or do you think it\u2019s just good makeup?\n\nYear 2014\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\n\nKate looked like a French maiden during the Met Gala. The dress emphasized her cleavage and boobs but she also made sure to draw attention to her colorful matching earrings and necklace.\n\nShe capped her look with a stylish hair piece and yet people still can\u2019t help but speculate she had breast implants because of this look.\n\nYear 2016\n\nImage Credit: Getty\n\nThe supermodel goes for simple fashion as her street look, yet she\u2019s still a knockout in these basic jeans and black top. Her shoes worked to accentuate her shapely long legs and height.\n\nYear 2018\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images\n\nKate attended the recent Sports Illustrated Swimsuit party wearing a sequined outfit that emphasized her chest. She also had a brushed up hairstyle that showed off her face, which had the bare amount of makeup.\n\nHer dress made people do a double take. It had them wondering about her bra size, for sure. In the same way, that the mole on her face also likely drew attention.\n\nDo you think she had lip fillers here?\n\nWhat Does Kate Have To Say About Plastic Surgery?\n\nWhile the supermodel has never directly addressed any rumors about her appearance, it\u2019s interesting to know that she wasn\u2019t always confident about her body.\n\nAfter my first cover, critics were discussing whether I was fat or not. I had this huge moment in my career and they were tearing it apart.\n\nThankfully, she didn\u2019t let the haters get the better of her.\n\nI have to thank the people who did that because it really made me sit back and find out who I was and what meant something to me and how I thought about my body.\n\nSurprisingly, she wasn\u2019t always happy about her breasts, but after reportedly telling a UK media about wanting smaller size boobs, she told a different story on an Australian radio station, 2DayFM.\n\nI actually didn\u2019t say that. I love my body\u2026\n\nAnd yes, it was on video so check it out:\n\nShe even reiterated her statements on Twitter.\n\nreport this ad\n\nUnfortunately, what was said about my body is completely made up to try and drum up controversy where there is none. Like every woman, \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) April 16, 2014\n\nI have moments of insecurity, but I love and am proud of my body \u2014 every part of it \u2014 and wouldn't change a thing. \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) April 16, 2014\n\nWhile we know she won\u2019t be getting a breast reduction any time soon, she made a mockery of the Kardashians by writing this on her snapchat caption with pouty lips.\n\nI look like a Kardashian, nose job and all.\n\nPerhaps this was her way of telling the world she has nothing to do with plastic surgeries?\n\nMore Information About Kate Upton:\n\nReal Name: Katherine Elizabeth Upton\n\nBirthday: 10th June 1992\n\nStar Sign: Gemini\n\nBirth Place: St. Joseph, Michigan, United States\n\nNationality: American\n\nRace / Ethnicity: English, Scottish, German, Dutch\n\nOccupation: Model, Actress\n\nNet Worth: $20 Million\n\nRelationship: Married to Justin Verlander\n\nChildren: None\n\nHeight: 1.78 m (5 ft 10 in)\n\nAverage Weight: 64 kg (141 lb)\n\nBody Measurement: 39-28-36 Inches\n\nBra Size: 34D\n\nDress Size: 6 (US)\n\nShoe Size: 8.5 (US)\n\nNatural Hair Color: Blue/green\n\nNatural Eye Color: Blonde\n\nConclusion\n\nThe first thing people notice about Kate Upton is her boob size and it would make sense for some to think she had breast augmentation because of how large it is compared to her body.\n\nBut Kate has suggested that she hasn\u2019t had any plastic surgery. Top beauty experts also don\u2019t think she had any other unnatural changes to her face and body. So, all those talks about her nose surgery and lip injections have no bearing.\n\nRather, Kate\u2019s beautiful face and hot shapely body are naturally enhanced through makeup and a good exercise and diet. She also has a trainer who makes sure she works out and follows a meal plan. She\u2019s likely to appear on more Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issues with the way she takes care of her physical assets.\n\n(Featured Image Source: Facebook)\n\nSee more Famous Celeb\u2019s Before & After", "images": ["https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-featured.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cardi-b-featured.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-lips.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kellyanne-conway-featured.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-2010.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-2018.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/victoria-beckham-featured-218x150.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-nose-job.jpg", "https://go.ezoic.net/utilcave_com/img/ezoic.png", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-2014.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/psp-logo.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31iz6hfFutd16.gif?labels=Domain.plasticsurgerypeople_com,DomainId.107302", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/niykee-heaton-featured-218x150.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-kardashian-snapchat.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-2012.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-body-transformation.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/psp-logo-footer.png", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/psp-logo-mobile.png", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/britney-spears-featured.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/angelababy-featured-218x150.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-2016.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20015427&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-high-school-teen.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/young-kate-upton.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-boob-job.jpg", "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-2008.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-featured.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/kate-upton-cosmetic-surgery/", "title": "Kate Upton Cosmetic Surgery \u2013 Boob Job, Nose Job & Lip Fillers?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-featured.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kate-upton-featured.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 520}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Upton Cosmetic Surgery - Boob Job, Nose Job & Lip Fillers?", "description": "American model Kate Upton is one of the very few who can say that they have been on the cover of the special Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue at least four times.
