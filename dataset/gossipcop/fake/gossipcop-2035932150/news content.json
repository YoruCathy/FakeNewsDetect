Outside of acting she is is notable for her marriage to writer/director Christopher Guest (which earned her an inherited English title), as well as for writing a string of best-selling children's books. Even though being the daughter of two movie stars, the down-to-earth Jamie Lee Curtis successfully managed to establish herself outside of their shadows. Actually, she was truly one of a kind actress, setting herself apart from her peers with her freedom from vanity, i.e., not being afraid to pose without makeup or retouching for a magazine, openly discussing her struggles with addiction, or even being comfortable to allow her hair to go gray. Not only an award-winning, but also striking, fun-loving actress with memorable parts in a variety of genres. Jamie Lee Curtis proved the world she is a star of her own making, despite her acting legacy.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jamie-Lee-Curtis.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jamie-Lee-Curtis.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/jamie-lee-curtis-net-worth/", "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Jamie Lee Curtis Net Worth: Jamie Lee Curtis is an American actress, producer and author who has a net worth of", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "cnw_share_fb_count": 59, "cnw_share_tw_count": 34, "fb": {"app_id": 241750049176605, "admins": 194602255, "pages": 135556409817901}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis Net Worth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/jamie-lee-curtis-net-worth/", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jamie-Lee-Curtis.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity Net Worth", "description": "Jamie Lee Curtis Net Worth: Jamie Lee Curtis is an American actress, producer and author who has a net worth of"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CelebrityNetWorth", "modified_time": "2019-07-06T17:36:28+00:00", "published_time": "2010-01-17T00:21:33+00:00", "section": "Actors", "tag": "richest actresses"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@celebnetworth", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Jamie-Lee-Curtis.jpg", "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis Net Worth", "description": "Jamie Lee Curtis Net Worth: Jamie Lee Curtis is an American actress, producer and author who has a net worth of"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1263687693.0, "source": "http://www.celebritynetworth.com", "summary": ""}
