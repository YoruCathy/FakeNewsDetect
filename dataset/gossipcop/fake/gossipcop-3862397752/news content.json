Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate-chip cookies and a bowl of M&Ms.\n\nThe world\u2019s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit-down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind-the-scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do a lot of media. I don\u2019t want to be seen everywhere,\u201d the 68-year-old Jenner says on a recent afternoon, her bare feet up on a lounge chair. \u201cToday, I\u2019m very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don\u2019t stick my nose into everything publicly.\u201d\n\nJenner\u2019s low-key lifestyle and muted public profile stand in sharp contrast to the days when her much-talked-about 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer, in which she revealed plans to transition from a man to a woman, attracted a staggering 17 million viewers. Next came the cover of Vanity Fair and her own reality TV show, \u201cI Am Cait.\u201d\n\nHer newfound fame put enormous pressure on Jenner \u2014 who had lived the first 65 years of her life as Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner \u2014 to be the perfect transgender role model. She had difficulty living up to those expectations, especially after coming out as something more controversial than being transgender: a Republican in Hollywood. On her reality show, Jenner expressed support for Ted Cruz and sparred with activists, who were as experienced in trans-politics as she was unversed. She voted for Trump in the 2016 election (but is no longer a fan).\n\nHer conservatism made her a pariah in the left-leaning entertainment industry, where she\u2019s been criticized for not doing enough to help the transgender community. Jenner spoke candidly with Variety about the pain of that rejection.\n\n\u201cNo matter what you say or do, they think you don\u2019t get it because you\u2019re this kind of white, privileged person,\u201d says Jenner. She disputes the notion that she hasn\u2019t worked hard, or that her wealth disqualifies her from being an advocate. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my back on anybody,\u201d she says. But Jenner has received a cold shoulder from some of her peers: \u201cI\u2019ve felt it big time, and it hurts. Sometimes this community can be really tough.\u201d\n\nJenner, who briefly considered running for senator, decided she could be more useful fighting for trans rights as a Republican liaison on Capitol Hill. She likens the civil rights battle to what the gay community faced 40 years ago on the road to marriage equality.\n\nEvery few weeks, Jenner travels to Washington to tell her story. She\u2019s held long meetings with members of Trump\u2019s White House and roughly 50 members of the House and Senate \u2014 to personally make the case for equality.\n\nShe\u2019s patiently endured invasive questions about her body and genitalia, all in an effort to change people\u2019s minds.\n\nShe says that these meetings are conducted away from the cameras. \u201cI met with Paul Ryan,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren\u2019t supportive of transgender rights.\u201d What do they say to her? \u201cI\u2019ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,\u201d says Jenner, who did not want to elaborate on conversations that were confidential.\n\nMargaret Hoover, the president of the American Unity Fund, a Republican-funded group that advocates for LGBTQ rights, says that Jenner is uniquely positioned to educate. \u201cThink of your average Republican in Washington,\u201d Hoover says, noting that the party is getting older and less diverse. \u201cIt\u2019s basically like every white friend of your 70-year-old dad. At the 1976 Olympic Games, they were all in the prime of their life, and Bruce Jenner was their hero. They idolized Bruce.\u201d As a result, Jenner has been an effective ambassador. When they hear the word \u201ctransgender,\u201d they might imagine a man in a dress. But when they see Caitlyn, they agree that she should use the women\u2019s bathroom.\n\nJenner was originally hopeful about Trump, given that he promised to make LGBTQ rights part of his platform. But since taking office, he\u2019s stoked fears by rolling back protections in schools and vowing to ban transgender people from the military. Jenner says her message to Trump, whom she met during the campaign but hasn\u2019t spoken with as president, is simple. \u201cGet over it! I honestly don\u2019t know what happened when he got in there. It was extraordinarily disappointing,\u201d she says.\n\nIn February 2017, Jenner lashed out against Trump on Twitter for withdrawing federal guidelines that allowed transgender youths to use the bathroom that matched their gender identity. \u201cFrom one Republican to another, this is a disaster,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cYou made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.\u201d\n\nJenner says Trump never reached out. (A source with knowledge of her thinking says Jenner would like to meet with the president after the midterm elections, but not in front of the press.) \u201cHe\u2019s not been doing a very good job, but it\u2019s not over yet,\u201d she says.\n\nJenner believes that the United States should pass a law that allows transgender citizens to enlist in the armed forces. \u201cWe need hard-core legislation, laws on the book of equality,\u201d she says, pointing to measures passed by other countries, from Israel to England. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time, but we\u2019re working on it.\u201d\n\nJenner wants everyone to know that she\u2019s found happiness. \u201cMy life is so simple,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just to be myself all day. I think people think when you transition, it is this tremendous thing, and now you\u2019re a totally different person. I\u2019m still the same person. Caitlyn lived inside me all my life.\u201d\n\nAs a member of America\u2019s most notorious reality TV family (\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d for those of you living under a rock), Jenner gets asked to be photographed a lot in public. \u201cIf I\u2019m out, I take a minimum of 30 selfies with people,\u201d she says. \u201cIt drives everyone around me crazy.\u201d This isn\u2019t done out of vanity. She\u2019s trying to prove a point. \u201cThat may be the first time they\u2019ve met anybody who\u2019s trans,\u201d Jenner says about her interactions with her fans. \u201cI want that to be a pleasurable experience. I want to be nice to people. I want to have a smile on my face. And they walk away and say, \u2018Oh, my God! Caitlyn was so nice.\u2019 That\u2019s the way I want them to think of trans people. That we\u2019re nice.\u201d\n\nvictoria stevens for Variety\n\nShe\u2019s disappointed that \u201cI Am Cait\u201d got canceled in 2016. \u201cI wish we could\u2019ve done more,\u201d she says. She regrets talking about politics on the show. \u201cReality TV loves drama.\u201d She\u2019s certainly dealt with her share of that. The tabloids are reporting that she\u2019s dating a 22-year-old transgender woman named Sophia Hutchins, whom she took to the ESPYs a few weeks ago. Hutchins is at her house on the day of our interview, and she follows us into Jenner\u2019s office to listen to our conversation. Although they sound like a couple \u2014 Jenner asks Hutchins for the name of the last great movie they saw together (Hutchins suggests \u201cI, Tonya\u201d) \u2014 they deny that they are. \u201cWe are not going to get into that,\u201d Jenner says. \u201cBut we are very close. We do a lot of things together. We\u2019re kind of inseparable. We\u2019re the best of friends.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the nature of their personal relationship, Hutchins is the executive director of the Caitlyn Jenner Foundation, which was formed last year to advance transgender rights. Jenner auctioned off a Porsche that she owned to raise funds. But her efforts there, too, have been kept under the radar. \u201cComing from a reality show, where every detail of your life is documented, to not seeking any press is kind of a big change,\u201d Hutchins says. \u201cCaitlyn is not working on these issues for press attention. She\u2019s doing it because she genuinely wants to help the community.\u201d\n\nJenner hasn\u2019t found it easy to parse the PC rules of transgender politics. For example, she talks about how much she loved \u201cThe Danish Girl,\u201d the 2015 biopic starring cisgender actor Eddie Redmayne as the artist Lili Elbe. \u201cI thought it was good to have it out there,\u201d Jenner says. \u201cGLAAD talked to me and said, \u2018Don\u2019t mention you even saw the movie!\u2019 And then all the flak came down about Eddie Redmayne doing it. I went to the Vanity Fair Oscar party, and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018What if he\u2019s there? I can\u2019t even be seen with him.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible!\u201d\n\n(\u201cGLAAD shared concerns that transgender community members voiced about the film as a courtesy so that Caitlyn would be aware of them,\u201d said a GLAAD rep.)\n\nBefore transitioning, she once auditioned for \u201cSuperman\u201d and co-starred on TV\u2019s \u201cCHiPs.\u201d She\u2019s open to acting again. She says she\u2019s working on something that would employ an all-transgender cast and crew. \u201cYou have to wait and see,\u201d says Jenner, declining to give specifics. She reveals that her fantasy role would be as a comic-book villainess. \u201cIn a Marvel movie, I want to play the baddest-ass lady you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. They got the wicked queen or the wicked lady. Just do the makeup and the outfit. And I got the deep voice.\u201d\n\nJenner, whose autobiography, \u201cThe Secrets of My Life,\u201d was published in 2017, sees her 10 kids as often as she can. She concedes that some of them are closer to her than others. She beams at Kylie being on the cover of Forbes as the youngest \u201cself-made\u201d almost billionaire. Although she didn\u2019t attend her son Brody\u2019s June wedding in Indonesia, she\u2019ll see him soon. She\u2019s supportive of her stepdaughter Kim\u2019s recent visit with Trump, in which she convinced him to commute the sentence of a woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. \u201cI thought they did the right thing,\u201d Jenner says. \u201cI was very proud of her.\u201d As for her ex-wife Kris, they aren\u2019t as friendly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked in a long time.\u201d\n\nJenner could see herself doing another reality TV show \u2014 maybe one where she parachutes into parts of the world as a transgender rights explorer. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll appear in future episodes of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d \u201cAt this point, no,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you never know.\u201d\n\nWatch more from Variety\u2018s interview with Caitlyn Jenner below.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fpolitics%2Ffeatures%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-trans-rights-advocate-1202896320%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202896320&comment_count=76", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/caitlin-jenner-variety-trans-hollywood.jpg?w=1000", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/trans-hollywood-refer.png?"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/caitlin-jenner-variety-trans-hollywood.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ramin Setoodeh"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/politics/features/caitlyn-jenner-trans-rights-advocate-1202896320/", "title": "How Caitlyn Jenner Is Secretly Fighting Trump\u2019s White House on Transgender Rights", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The most famous transgender woman in America has transformed herself into a political advocate for her community on Capitol Hill.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202896320, "author": "Ramin Setoodeh", "pmc-category": "Features,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-08-07T06:30:32"}, "pmc-tag": "caitlyn jenner,Transgender Hollywood", "title": "How Caitlyn Jenner Is Secretly Fighting Trump\u2019s White House on Transgender Rights", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "politics", "pmc-primary-category": "Features", "pmc-primary-vertical": "politics", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How Caitlyn Jenner Is Secretly Fighting Trump\u2019s White House on Transgender Rights", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/politics/features/caitlyn-jenner-trans-rights-advocate-1202896320/", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree-lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home.

I can\u2019t even be seen with him.\u2019 That\u2019s horrible!\u201d\r\n\r\n(\u201cGLAAD shared concerns that transgender community members voiced about the film as a courtesy so that Caitlyn would be aware of them,\u201d said a GLAAD rep.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore transitioning, she once auditioned for \u201cSuperman\u201d and co-starred on TV\u2019s \u201cCHiPs.\u201d She\u2019s open to acting again. She says she\u2019s working on something that would employ an all-transgender cast and crew. \u201cYou have to wait and see,\u201d says Jenner, declining to give specifics. She reveals that her fantasy role would be as a comic-book villainess. \u201cIn a Marvel movie, I want to play the baddest-ass lady you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. They got the wicked queen or the wicked lady. Just do the makeup and the outfit. And I got the deep voice.\u201d\r\n\r\nJenner, whose autobiography, \u201cThe Secrets of My Life,\u201d was published in 2017, sees her 10 kids as often as she can. She concedes that some of them are closer to her than others. She beams at Kylie being on the cover of Forbes as the youngest \u201cself-made\u201d almost billionaire. Although she didn\u2019t attend her son Brody\u2019s June wedding in Indonesia, she\u2019ll see him soon. She\u2019s supportive of her stepdaughter Kim\u2019s recent visit with Trump, in which she convinced him to commute the sentence of a woman serving life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense. \u201cI thought they did the right thing,\u201d Jenner says. \u201cI was very proud of her.\u201d As for her ex-wife Kris, they aren\u2019t as friendly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked in a long time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJenner could see herself doing another reality TV show \u2014 maybe one where she parachutes into parts of the world as a transgender rights explorer. She doesn\u2019t think she\u2019ll appear in future episodes of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d \u201cAt this point, no,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you never know.\u201d\r\n\r\nWatch more from\u00a0Variety's interview with Caitlyn Jenner below.", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533648632.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
