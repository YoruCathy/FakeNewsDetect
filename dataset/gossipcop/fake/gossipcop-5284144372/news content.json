You can now get Castle Lite, Eagle, Club Pilsner, Nile Special Stout, and Nile Special when you order on www.beernow.ug How \u201cBeer Now\u201d works\n\nOne has to punch in www.beernow.ug in their browser so as to access the \u201cBeer Now\u201d platform and be able to place their order(s) for their brand of choice.\n\nKeeping in mind that \u201cAlcohol is not for consumption for persons under the age of 18\u201d, NBL wants to make sure you are legal and are over eighteen to be consuming; the website therefore requests a user to fill in their date of birth to check for legality.\n\nHaving passed through this stage, you are officially in and can now place your order; but first, you are to fill out your location details in terms of district, town and suburb; and are only available for people who reside in the areas of Kampala and Wakiso Districts for the meantime.\n\nYou are then requested to choose your beer you wish to have; either Nile Special Stout, Club Pilsner, Nile Special, or Castle Lite; whichever tickles your thirst buds. You are then taken to the \u201cShop\u201d section of the platform where you are shown the price of each, and are at liberty to choose whether you wish to order a crate, just a couple of bottles as the minimum has to be 6. You are then free to \u201ccheck out\u201d (finalize with your order) and that\u2019s about it. Billing options are then availed to you; whether you wish to pay via Mobile Money or pay cash on delivery (C.O.D).\n\nDelivery happens within 60 minutes of placing an order or even less; depending on your location. Orders and deliveries however are to stop by 1Pm; in line with the government\u2019s guidelines on movement.\n\nNote: Once delivery is made, you are to give back an equivalent of the number of beers bottles you will have ordered in the form of \u201cempties\u201d. For example, if I ordered 8 Castle Lite(s), once delivery is made to my doorstep, I have to give the delivery person 8 empty bottles to replace those I will have taken. In case you do not have empty bottles on you, it\u2019ll cost you an extra cost of Ugx. 600/= per bottle as compensation for each.\n\nwww.beernow.ug is a stress free, fast, efficient, and affordable beer delivery service.\n\nLoading...\n\n(Visited 1 time, 1 visit today)\n\nShare\n\nWhatsApp\n\nTweet\n\n", "images": ["https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/14997874-9f75-4563-88e2-cf680b2ce98a-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/728x90_mobile_money.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spl383107_002.jpg", "file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/5BE03EB9-CCFD-4E08-832D-7F190F6F7D3E/Library/Caches/Media/thumbnail-p1999-1334x1334.jpeg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/newbanner.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2126143654382858&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6467-2-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6527-1-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6580-2.jpg", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b9e9eb56d37576a3f8637a5d18b3a607?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6722-2.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6468-400x240.jpg", "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/f18b50e32044e81ec5d02c9969234901?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6467-2-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/66811c32-becd-4fa8-ab30-95587f3b3b0a-8666-000003e2b2e6f3e0-80x80.jpg", "http://bigeye.ug/wp-content/plugins/page-views-count/ajax-loader.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HFB_Safebanking_300x250.png", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/KFC-WEB-BANNER-300X255.png", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6535.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/side-300x257.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5438afcf-4c26-4cc2-9462-6d70e91a28d2-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6721.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/66811c32-becd-4fa8-ab30-95587f3b3b0a-8666-000003e2b2e6f3e0-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6468-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6527-1-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/0cd63e3a-c626-4255-ae52-a33887362eec.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6527.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/8ff42182-943a-4161-9e10-3713203ea2c6.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-2.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Redcross-01.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/14997874-9f75-4563-88e2-cf680b2ce98a-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6475-1-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eebf3e5a-5b34-468d-84e8-2d7d6be08f4e-1-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/img_6475-1-80x80.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/eebf3e5a-5b34-468d-84e8-2d7d6be08f4e-1-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5438afcf-4c26-4cc2-9462-6d70e91a28d2-400x240.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/7444118b-557d-4115-acbd-9a9e7187b4ec.jpg", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/300x250_mobile_money.gif", "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Bigeye-Logo-min.jpg"], "top_img": "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spl383107_002.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://bigeye.ug/justin-bieber-selena-gomezs-rekindled-romance-ended-when-he-couldnt-promise-her-marriage/", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez\u2019s Rekindled Romance Ended When \u2018He Couldn\u2019t Promise\u2019 Her Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "lJDxciuEsdLMBCmQ3AkfM85a-oAOcQSaGiMrCBH5zXU", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez\u2019s Rekindled Romance Ended When \u2018He Couldn\u2019t Promise\u2019 Her Marriage - BigEye.UG", "description": "Selena Gomez had to walk away from Justin Bieber when he couldn\u2019t promise her a serious future that included marriage.
