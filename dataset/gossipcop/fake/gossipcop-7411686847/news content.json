Kylie Jenner just said that she lives with her bestie, Jordyn Woods, instead of with her baby daddy, Travis Scott. Does this mean there\u2019s trouble in paradise?\n\nGasp! Are Travis Scott, 27, and Kylie Jenner, 20, on the rocks? Probably not, but what the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said while filming a makeup tutorial for Vogue raised some eyebrows \u2013 pun intended. \u201cI test out most of my stuff on Jordyn [Woods, 20] because we live together,\u201d Kylie said, revealing that she shares a home with her BFF instead of her BF and baby daddy. \u201c So I\u2019m like, \u2018Jordyn, I need you.\u2019 Everyone that comes in my house has tinted red arms from swatches and shadows.\u201d\n\nActually, Kylie didn\u2019t make it clear whether or not Travis lives with Kylie and Jordyn. Considering that Kylie owns a 13,000-square-feet home with eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms (one she reportedly paid $12 million for in 2016, according to House Beautiful), it\u2019s not beyond reason to think her boyfriend has a space of his own. To be sure, fans better keep an eye on Travis\u2019s arms. If he\u2019s walking around with \u201ctinted red\u201d stripes, then it\u2019s clear his \u201croommate\u201d got a hold of him for some makeup experiments.\n\nKylie and Travis seem to be going strong, as they\u2019re one of Hollywood\u2019s \u201cMost In Love Couples\u201d at the moment. It\u2019s easy to see why. While Kylie has decided to keep baby Stormi out of the spotlight, it is hard for her to keep her love for Travis a secret. She was spotted boarding a private jet with her daughter, flying off to a romantic getaway with Travis. A month before that, the two found a babysitter so they could take in a NBA Playoffs game. They two didn\u2019t need a kiss cam \u2013 they were spotted smooching in the front row!\n\nWill it be long before Kylie and Travis take the next step? After seeing Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson get engaged after just a few weeks of dating, Kylie is ready for Travis to get down on one knee. \u201cKylie is a bit jealous of Ariana,\u201d a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cShe is now pressuring Travis to pop the question ASAP and she wants a massive ring too.\u201d Well, if Travis proposes, does that mean he\u2019ll finally move in with Kylie (if he hasn\u2019t already?)", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F29%2Fkylie-jenner-travis-scott-living-apart-jordyn-woods-roommate%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3225654", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-split-living-with-jordyn-woods-rex-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-split-living-with-jordyn-woods-rex-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/29/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-living-apart-jordyn-woods-roommate/", "title": "Are Kylie Jenner & Travis Scott Headed For A Split? \u2014 She Reveals She\u2019s Living With Her BFF, Not Him", "meta_data": {"description": "Wait a minute.
