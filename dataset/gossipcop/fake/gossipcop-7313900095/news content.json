We learned exclusively the star is determined to go ALL out this year to ensure her kids have the \u2018ultimate\u2019 holiday.\n\nAngelina Jolie, 42, began her Halloween season with a bang when she took a trip to Glendale Halloween with a few of her children earlier this week. Impressively, the actress reportedly dropped a whopping a $1,000 at the Halloween store \u2014 and it\u2019s all to ensure her six kids: Maddox, 16; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh, 11; and the twins Knox & Vivienne, 9, have the Halloween of a lifetime! As it turns out, the newly single mom is pulling out all the stops to please her and Brad Pitt\u2018s, 53, youngsters \u2014 even considering their pleas for her to dress up in full Maleficent garb! Click here to see pics of Brad Pitt with his kids.\n\n\u201cAngelina came into the store and absolutely spoiled the kids to the tune of around $1,000,\u201d a source close to Glendale Halloween told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe looked like a supermom \u2014 incredibly happy and delighted to be out with the kids. She bought a bunch of lights, bloody knives, multiple scary masks, and a straight jacket. A few of the customers insisted she should get a fog machine too, but she passed on it.\u201d Apparently Angelina only visited the store with Zahara and one of the twins, but it seems like she has something major cooking for ALL the kids judging by the amount of stuff she bought. There\u2019s no question these kids are in for a Halloween treat!\n\n\u201cShe mentioned that she wanted to treat the kids to what she called \u2018the ultimate Halloween,\u2019 complete with decked out decorations and costumes, and that she was still planning a spooky get-together with their friends,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cShe definitely looked to be taking care of everything on her own, and it\u2019s evident she\u2019s doing an amazing job as a single parent.\u201d We love how the Jolie-Pitt kids are fully embracing Halloween with the help of Angie. After a particularly tough year, it finally seems like things are at least starting to get back to normal.\n\n\u201cThe kids asked her to throw a party with a haunted house, but she was reluctant to go that far with the arrangements, so she settled for setting up the house to make it look haunted instead,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe was in incredibly great spirits, which comes from the excitement that she has about returning to the big screen in Maleficent 2. The kids were begging for her to dress up in full character as well, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she did. She looked like she was all for making sure the kids had their tricks and their treats.\u201d How sweet is that?\n\nMaleficent 2 will serve as a sequel to Maleficent, the 2014 film starring Angie. It\u2019s set to hit theaters in 2018, and it already sounds like a winning part two! \u201cI am now the breadwinner for the family so it\u2019s time,\u201d the actress-turned director joked to Deadline about returning to acting after two years away. \u201cWe have been working on the script and this is going to be a really strong sequel.\u201d We can totally see her being Maleficent this year for Halloween as a way to get her kids \u2014 and other fans \u2014 even more pumped for the new movie!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 doesn\u2019t Angelina\u2019s Halloween party sound pretty awesome? Do you think she\u2019ll actually dress up as Maleficent?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/angelina-jolie-malificient-rex-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F12%2Fangelina-jolie-halloween-party-kids-haunted-house-dress-as-maleficent%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2824685&comment_count=2", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/angelina-jolie-malificient-rex-embed.jpg?w=620&h=530", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/angelina-jolie-malificient-rex-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/12/angelina-jolie-halloween-party-kids-haunted-house-dress-as-maleficent/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Planning Epic Halloween Party For The Kids: \u2018They\u2019re Begging Her To Be Maleficent\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Angelina Jolie &amp; her kids are in for a spooky Halloween!
