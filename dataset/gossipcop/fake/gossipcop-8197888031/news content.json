I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free, and healthy way I knew how. There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d\n\nShe also releases an 11-minute video documenting her pregnancy and the days leading up to the birth of her daughter:\n\nTravis confirms the baby news on Twitter:\n\n2.1.18\n\n4 ever\n\nNew rager in town. !!! \u2014 TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) February 4, 2018\n\nKylie\u2019s family and friends also share welcome messages for the baby on social media:\n\nGod is SO good!!

I want him to be him. I don\u2019t want it to be Kylie and Trav.
