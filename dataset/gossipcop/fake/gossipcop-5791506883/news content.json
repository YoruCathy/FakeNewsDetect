The longtime Hollywood actors are already parents to six kids: three biological children, including eight-year-old Shiloh and six-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, and three who were adopted, 13-year-old Maddox from Cambodia, 11-year-old Pax from Vietnam, and 10-year-old Zahara from Ethiopia.\n\n\u201cAngie wanted to adopt all three, but when she got back to the United States, and told Brad about it, he said no,\u201d the source said. \u201cGoing from six children to nine was just way too much, and Brad was concerned about how it would impact their other kids.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for the actors have not responded to outlets\u2019 requests for comment, according to The Daily Mail.\n\nOnce the adoption is finalized, the source added, \u201cIt could take at least another four to five months before the child is brought to the United States.\u201d\n\nJolie was appointed to her role as special envoy for refugees in 2012, having served as a goodwill ambassador for several years prior, according to the UN.\n\nWhile much of the world didn\u2019t come to pay attention to the ongoing crisis until this summer as headlines of European border struggles came to light, the celebrity has been pleading with political leaders to provide more aid for years.\n\nIn April, Jolie criticized the UN Security Council for its inaction over the conflict, imploring the foreign minister of each of the 15 council member countries come to the table to negotiate a political solution, reported The Associated Press. \u201cShe also urged council members to visit Syrian refugees and see the crisis for themselves.\u201d\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
