Especially, Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nAccording to an August 1 report by People Magazine, a brand new sneak peek was released of the upcoming season, and it appears that Kim and Kourtney will be at each other\u2019s throats.\n\nIn the clip, Kim Kardashian is trying to set up a photo shoot and is having a hard time moving things around to fit it into her very busy schedule. Meanwhile, Kourtney is complaining that she needs to be out of the shoot by four o\u2019clock, which is making her younger sister increasingly angry.\n\nThe girls\u2019 mother, Kris Jenner, enters the picture and tries to calm tensions by telling Kourtney to \u201cbe nice.\u201d However, she doesn\u2019t help matters. The sisters begin screaming at one another.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m out by four [o\u2019clock], that\u2019s all I need. If [I get there] and no one\u2019s ready, and I\u2019m, like, lingering around, I\u2019m leaving at 4 p.m., and I don\u2019t care what anyone says,\u201d Kourtney Kardashian states in the clip.\n\nWhen Kim Kardashian tells her sister that she is supposed to having a meeting and can only schedule it for 7 a.m., Kourtney tells her to reschedule the meeting in an unsympathetic way. This is the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back, and Kim gets fed up.\n\n\u201cNo one wants you in the f\u2014ing shoot. Get the f\u2014 out of here and go. \u2026 We don\u2019t want you in the shoot,\u201d Kim tells her sister. Kourtney replies that she has no interest in doing the photo shoot anyway, and Kim says, \u201cGood, \u2019cause you\u2019re so f\u2014ing annoying.\u201d\n\nKris Jenner takes Kim Kardashian\u2019s side in the argument, telling her oldest daughter that she is being \u201cannoying\u201d and that she has a way of \u201crubbing people the wrong way.\u201d\n\nKim then throws the fact that she has the busier schedule and career in Kourtney\u2019s face, saying that she doesn\u2019t have a business to run, so she could never understand how hard it is for her to schedule multiple things.\n\n\u201cMaybe if you had a f\u2014ing business that you were passionate about \u2026 but you don\u2019t, so don\u2019t even act like you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d At this point, Kourtney Kardashian gets up and leaves the room to gather her things.\n\nKim Kardashian then goes for the final blow, saying that Kourtney Kardashian doesn\u2019t need to be in the photo shoot anyway, because she\u2019s the \u201cleast exciting to look at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need Kourtney to not be so f\u2014ing annoying with a stick up her a\u2014 like she f\u2014ing runs this s\u2014, because she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s the least exciting to look at,\u201d Kim states as Kourtney leaves and slams the door behind her.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians premieres on E!
