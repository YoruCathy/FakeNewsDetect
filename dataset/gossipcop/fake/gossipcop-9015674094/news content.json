Well, sort of\u2026\n\nJustin Bieber doesn\u2019t owe HollywoodLife.com. OK so technically,doesn\u2019t owe Selena Gomez anything when her birthday comes around this July 22. The singer will be turning 26, and there\u2019s one thing she really wants from her ex \u2014 but it\u2019s not exactly a gift. Well, not a physical one, anyway. \u201cThe one thing Selena hopes Justin will give her for her birthday this weekend is peace and quiet . She is finally in a good place, having really moved on from their relationship, so Selena kinda hopes Justin does not stir anything up with her by sending her a gift, flowers, or even trying to reach out with a phone call or text,\u201d a source close to Selena tells\n\nConsidering Justin\u2019s now engaged to another woman, we don\u2019t think Selena will have to worry about Justin sending her anything in the mail. But irregardless, \u201cSelena totally respects Justin and his relationship with his new fiancee, Hailey [Baldwin] , so she feels it would be awkward and maybe even disrespectful to Hailey for Justin to wish Selena a happy birthday. So the only thing Selena really wants from Justin for her birthday this year, is for him to be happy and not reach out in anyway,\u201d our source adds.\n\nFor the sake of everyone in this longstanding love triangle, we hope Justin respects Selena\u2019s wishes and hold back from sending her anything on her birthday. Not only would be it disrespectful to Hailey, but it would just play with Selena\u2019s emotions.\n\nAnyway, we\u2019re super excited for Selena\u2019s birthday and can\u2019t wait to see how she celebrates her big day! Who knows \u2014 maybe she\u2019ll link up with BFF Taylor Swift and they\u2019ll have some fun together. That would be awesome. Or maybe Selena will finally meet her future \u201cperfect boyfriend\u201c.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/birthday-gift-selena-gomez-wants-from-justin-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/chrisrogers.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/birthday-gift-selena-gomez-wants-from-justin-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F19%2Fselena-gomez-justin-bieber-birthday-gift%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3246941", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/birthday-gift-selena-gomez-wants-from-justin-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Rogers", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Deputy Editor Of Los Angeles"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/19/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-birthday-gift/", "title": "Selena Gomez: The One Birthday Gift She Wants From Justin Bieber Despite Their Split", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber may have broken up, but here's the birthday gift she wants from him.", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez: The One Birthday Gift She Wants From Justin Bieber Despite Their Split", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/19/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-birthday-gift/", "description": "Justin Bieber may be engaged to Hailey Baldwin, but his ex, Selena Gomez, still wants a birthday gift from him when she turns 26 on July 22.
