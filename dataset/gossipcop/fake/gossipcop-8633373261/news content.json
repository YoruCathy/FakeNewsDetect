Tom Ends Val's Cancer Horror With Bizarre Scientology Powers Eyewitness claims Val was healed just by touching Cruise's finger.\n\nRadarOnline..com can reveal exclusively Scientologist Tom Cruise miraculously healed Val Kilmer of cancer on the set of Top Gun 2!\n\nEyewitnesses on the set \u2014 starring both Val and Tom \u2014 told Radar Tom accomplished the incredible feat by using a flaky \u201claying-on-of-hands\u201d method available only to the cult\u2019s top members!\n\n\u201cTom is a high-ranking Operating Thetan VI member of Scientology and insists he can cure illnesses and injuries with his touch,\u201d dished a snitch.\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t wait to use his hands-on approach on Val. It was very simple. Tom used the \u2018touch assist\u2019 method by touching Val and instructing him to \u2018feel my finger.\u2019\n\n\u201cTom ended the bizarre session by saying, \u2018End of assist.\u2019 And poof! Val started to feel a whole lot better.\n\n\u201cSome may say it\u2019s mind over matter, but Val is saying Tom\u2019s a miracle worker!\u201d\n\nAs Radar reported, Val has been grappling with a years-long cancer nightmare that\u2019s left him a wasted shell.\n\nThe Tombstone star, 58, repeatedly denied he was ill, but swaddled himself in scarves and bandannas in a desperate bid to conceal the ravages of a throat tumor.\n\nVal finally fessed up to the illness \u2014 and insiders are struck by the irony that The Doors star, a devout Christian Scientist who relied on the power of prayer to heal his body, was cured through Tom\u2019s magic touch.\n\n\u201cVal agrees he\u2019s feeling great since Tom used his spiritual powers on him. It\u2019s made them closer,\u201d dished a source.\n\n\u201cThey sit and chat about their kids, art and movies. Val\u2019s shown Tom some of his artwork and Tom\u2019s encouraged him to do more. They\u2019re the best of friends now.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
