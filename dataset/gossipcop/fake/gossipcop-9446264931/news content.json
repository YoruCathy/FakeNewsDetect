But instead of turning his newborn twins to gold, George Clooney sweetly calms them when they\u2019re crying, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned.\n\nGet a man who can do both. One of Hollywood\u2019s sexiest actors is also the world\u2019s greatest father. Where do we get one of those? George Clooney, 56, \u201cis such a natural parent \u2014 it\u2019s amazing how he is with the twins,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cAfter all the years he protested that he wasn\u2019t cut out for parenthood, it\u2019s mind blowing how good he is. George is so patient and calm around the babies, even when they\u2019ve been on an hour-long crying tear! When he picks the babies up they immediately calm down.\u201d Not even wifey Amal Clooney, 39, can understand his magical touch.\n\nWhat\u2019s even sweeter is that the Hail, Caesar! actor isn\u2019t afraid of getting his hands dirty \u2014 literally! There\u2019s no task too daunting whether it\u2019s diaper changes or midnight feedings. \u201cGeorge will be an absolutely wonderful father, Amal will be \u2014 and already is \u2014 a magnificent mother,\u201d his father Nick Clooney gushed to Good Morning Britain on June 8. \u201cHe will be hands on entirely and he will do it with humor and with joy.\u201d That\u2019s incredible news for the human rights activist too, who took a break from court hearings and official law business to enjoy maternity leave for the next few weeks.\n\nWith Amal expected to head back to work in January, she\u2019s trying to get all the rest she can. Of course that isn\u2019t easy with two newborn babies in the house. The couple \u201care beyond tired,\u201d our source continues. \u201cSometimes they feel like zombies they\u2019re so tired, but they wouldn\u2019t change their new life for all the money in the world. George really didn\u2019t think he could be this happy and content, it\u2019s like his whole life has been preparation for being a dad.\u201d Awww! Hearts currently melting.\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you blown away by George\u2019s amazing parenting skills? Did you ever expect that from him?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/140c0e0fd0ad702646ff54aed53914eb?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/george-clooney-amal-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/sheree-whitfield-secretly-married-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/george-clooney-amal-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F07%2F30%2Fgeorge-clooney-magic-touch-twins-amal-parenting%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2717373", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/danielle-bregoli-5-years-probation-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/popular-iphone-cases-recalled-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/george-clooney-amal-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Radvan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160831/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/30/george-clooney-magic-touch-twins-amal-parenting/", "title": "George Clooney Has A Magic Touch With Twins \u2014 He Sweetly Calms Them When Crying", "meta_data": {"description": "He's the man with the Midas touch!
