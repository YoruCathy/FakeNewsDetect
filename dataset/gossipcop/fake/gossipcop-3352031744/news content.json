The pop queen emotionally told the jury that David Mueller \u2018definitely grabbed\u2019 her butt at a 2013 meet-and-greet.\n\nTaylor Swift, 27, finally took the stand on August 10 in a Denver court to testify against the Colorado JJ, David Mueller, 55, who she\u2019s accused of sexual assault. Taylor went in front of the eight-person jury to state that David allegedly groped her at a concert meet-and-greet in Denver in 2013, and to take a stand \u201cfor all women\u201d against sexual assault. \u201cIt was a definite grab,\u201d \u200bTaylor told the court, according to reporters live tweeting the trial. \u201cHe stayed latched on to my bare \u200bas\u200bs ch\u200beek as I moved away from him visibly uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nTaylor reportedly told the jury that it was \u201ca very long grab,\u201d that lasted, \u201cLong enough for me to be completely sure that it was intentional,\u201d court reporter Clayton Sandell of ABC News tweeted. Taylor testified that at first, she thought it was a mistake, so she \u201cgot as far away from his as I could.\u201d But David allegedly didn\u2019t let go, and allegedly kept his hand on her butt. \u201cHe was busy grabbing my ass underneath my skirt,\u201d Taylor reportedly said on the stand. She also reportedly appeared to sound agitated with the prosecutor for their line of questioning, according to Sandell, telling the attorney, \u201cYour client could have taken a normal photo with me.\u201d\n\nSandell continued to tweet from the courtroom. Taylor reportedly explained to the jury that she didn\u2019t say anything about David allegedly groping her while at the meet-and-greet because it would\u2019ve cut things short for the fans waiting to see her. Taylor and David\u2019s attorney reportedly went back-and-forth about whether or not her bodyguard, Greg Dent, saw anything happen. She said she didn\u2019t blame him for not stopping the alleged groping \u2014 she blamed David. She also shockingly stated on the stand that David and his then-girlfriend Shannon Melcher, who was standing on Taylor\u2019s other side in the photo, allegedly \u201cappeared to be drunk\u201d at the meet-and-greet.\n\nAfter more sparring with the prosecution over her bodyguard, Taylor adamantly disagreed that David accidentally touched her. David claimed earlier that he simply hand his hands on her \u201crib cage or ribs,\u201d and Taylor was having none of that. \u201cHe did not touch my rib,\u201d Taylor reportedly testified. \u201cHe did not touch my arm, He did not touch my hand. He grabbed my bare ass\u2026This was not jostling\u2026\u201dHe was too busy grabbing my ass underneath my skirt,\u201d she said, according to Buzzfeed\u2018s Claudia Rosenbaum, to allegedly grab her ribs. \u201cIt was a very shocking thing that I have never dealt with before\u2026He grabbed my ass underneath my skirt. It was underneath my skirt\u201d\n\nShe reportedly later said that she had \u201cno reaction\u201d to David getting fired from the radio station. \u201cI just wanted to never have to see him again\u2026It was a product of his decisions, not mine.\u201d\n\n\"He was busy grabbing my ass underneath my skirt,\" Swift says. She seems to be making a point of repeating the word \"ass\". \u2014 Clayton Sandell (@Clayton_Sandell) August 10, 2017\n\nMcFarland on the photo: \"Why isn't the front of your skirt someplace else?\" SWIFT: \"My ass is located on the back of my body.\" \u2014 Clayton Sandell (@Clayton_Sandell) August 10, 2017\n\nTaylor Swift says there's no question it wasn't Mueller. \"I have a 3-D recreation in my brain,\" she says. \"He had a handful of my ass.\" \u2014 Clayton Sandell (@Clayton_Sandell) August 10, 2017\n\nSwift on Mueller: \"He did not touch my rib. He did not touch my arm, He did not touch my hand. He grabbed my bare ass.\" \u2014 Clayton Sandell (@Clayton_Sandell) August 10, 2017\n\nSwift: \"He stayed latched on to my bare ass cheek as I lurched away from him.\" #TaylorSwiftTrial \u2014 Clayton Sandell (@Clayton_Sandell) August 10, 2017\n\nSupport from the Swifties across the street for #taylorswift pic.twitter.com/dBcbibNFK5 \u2014 Claudia Rosenbaum (@CJRosenbaum) August 10, 2017\n\nShe corroborated her mother, Andrea Swift\u2019s testimony, that she was the first person she told after the alleged assault. She, again, vehemently stated that David allegedly grabbed her. \u201cI have a 3-D recreation in my brain,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had a handful of my ass.\u201d She then reportedly became agitated with the prosecutor for pressing her about the photo taken of the alleged incident. \u201cThis is a photo of his hand up my dress on my ass. I\u2019ve never said anything different.\u201d The prosecutor reportedly asked her, why isn\u2019t the front of your skirt someplace else?\u201d Taylor was just as baffled by that question as we are. \u201cMy ass is located on the back of my body. My skirt is lifted in that photo.\u201d she reportedly said.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long journey for Taylor to get to this point. The trial has been two years in the making, with David first suing her for $3 million in 2015 for defamation, after Taylor publicly accused him of allegedly groping her butt at the 2013 backstage event. One month after David filed his suit, she countersued for alleged sexual assault and battery, claiming that he \u201ctook his hand and put it up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek.\u201d She only asked for $1, stating that she wanted the case to serve as an \u201cexample to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s mom, Andrea Swift, took the stand on August 9. It was an extremely emotional testimony; Andrea broke down crying as she recounted the alleged 2013 incident. She said, according to courtroom reporters, that she could tell by the look on Taylor\u2019s face during the photo op that something was wrong. She claimed that in the photo taken, you can allegedly tell that Taylor\u2019s faking her smile, and that David was allegedly grabbing her butt. She said she was \u201cupset to extent that I wanted to vomit,\u201d when Taylor told her what allegedly happened. A reporter tweeted that Taylor got emotional listening to her mother speak.\n\nAs Hollywoodlife.com previously reported, Taylor was learning on her mother for support during the court case. She knows that her mom supports her unconditionally, and was gathering strength from that love to get through the trial. This whole situation has been pretty upsetting and stressful, but Taylor is adamant that she is not going to allow a man to get away with disrespecting her, in any way,\u201d a source told us EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nThis story is still developing.
