Brown also requested to terminate the court\u2019s ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafonte\u2019s behalf.)\n\nAmid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nanny\u2019s relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion.\n\nShe was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel B\u2019s Restraining Order Against Her Ex\n\nMeanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafonte\u2019s marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout \u201cmuch to most\u201d of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets.\n\n\u201cMiss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage,\u201d Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Brown\u2019s allegations, claiming they are \u201cnothing more than a smear campaign.\u201d\n\nAlso in court in October, Brown\u2019s lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were \u201cof a sexual nature,\u201d according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Brown\u2019s legal team, said \u201c90 percent\u201d of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Brown\u2019s consent.
