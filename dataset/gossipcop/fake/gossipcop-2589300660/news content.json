But on Wednesday\u2019s Real Housewives of New Jersey, the mother of four got back to her table-flipping ways when rumors surfaced that she was cheating on her husband Joe Giudice.\n\nAs viewers know, Joe is currently away serving a 41-month prison sentence \u2014 giving Teresa an opportunity to find romance with other people, longtime RHONJ guest Kim DePaola claimed. \u201cI hear since Joe went away that she\u2019s rekindling old frames,\u201d she told Housewives Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania while prepping for the fashion show at her fashion boutique, Posche.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a rumor \u2019cause you\u2019re going to find out it\u2019s not,\u201d DePaola added. \u201cI\u2019ll bet Posche on it right now. I think he treated her horribly and I was happy that she\u2019s moving on!\u201d\n\nShe may have been certain with her allegations, but Teresa sure found fault with the claims when Flicker and Catania passed them back to her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f\u2014\u2014 fuming right now. I\u2019m f\u2014\u2014 fuming,\u201d Teresa, 45, told the duo while at a group dinner with fellow New Jersey Housewives Melissa Gorga, Margaret Josephs and Friend of the Housewives Danielle Staub.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s such a f\u2014\u2014 bitch!\u201d Teresa screamed of DePaola, later throwing a glass against the restaurant\u2019s wall behind her. \u201cIt\u2019s not f\u2014\u2014 true! Are you kidding me, it\u2019s not true!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Teresa and Joe Giudice Paul Zimmerman/Getty\n\nFlicker and Catania sure didn\u2019t believe DePaola when they first heard the claims. \u201cWhat are you talking about right now? Doesn\u2019t matter, \u2019cause you know what rumors are? Just rumors!\u201d Flicker said. \u201cThat\u2019s all rumors. He\u2019s not cheating and there\u2019s no proof of it. Anybody can say anything, unless you have a picture of the wee-wee entering the cookie, who gives a s\u2014? \u2026 People need to mind their own business. This woman has been through hell and back and she\u2019s out there doing events, making money, and working her butt off for her children!\u201d\n\n\u201cKim D\u2019s always been a good friend to me, but spreading rumors about people\u2019s marriages or their children is hitting below the belt,\u201d Flicker told viewers.\n\nAdded Catania: \u201cThere aren\u2019t any old flames \u2014 Joe\u2019s the only man she\u2019s ever been with!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kim DePaola Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images)\n\nStill, when she heard about DePaola\u2019s claims from her friends, Giudice was certain that Catania \u2014 whom she has known for 20 years \u2014 hadn\u2019t had her back. \u201cYou should have f\u2014\u2014 stuck up for me,\u201d Giudice yelled at Catania. \u201c[Siggy] said [she] did, I don\u2019t know if [you] did.\u201d\n\nThat accusation pushed Catania off the ledge. \u201cI did! When is enough enough? Huh? When is it a-f\u2014\u2014 \u2019nuff?\u201d Catania asked, bringing up Giudice\u2019s decision to believe Danielle Staub over her in a previous argument. \u201cI stuck up for you. Did you stick up for me against Danielle? I did and you didn\u2019t. I did, and don\u2019t think I will again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did stick up for you!\u201d Flicker reinforced. \u201cI yelled, \u2018It\u2019s a rumor and it\u2019s heresy, shut your mouth!\u2019 We said it wasn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Dolores Catania and Siggy Flicker Marcus Owen/startraksphoto.com\n\nTheir words weren\u2019t enough for Giudice and Gorga, who have a long history of feuding with DePaula and were angry that Flicker and Catania were still going to walk in DePaola\u2019s upcoming fashion show \u2014 an event thrown to help raise money for charity.\n\n\u201cThis is so crazy to me. Not only has Kim D done what she\u2019s done for all these years to hurt me and my family, but now on top of it, she\u2019s saying that Teresa\u2019s a cheater. And Siggy and Dolores still are gonna go and support this woman?\u201d Gorga asked viewers. \u201cI\u2019m completely baffled by it. Everything that they say they stand for to me is bulls\u2014.\n\n\u201cYous two are f\u2014\u2014 going and walking in her f\u2014\u2014 show? Are you f\u2014\u2014 kidding me?\u201d Giudice asked.\n\n\u201cDolores, we don\u2019t live in Switzerland. You gotta pick a side. This is your friend. Welcome to New Jersey,\u201d Gorga said. \u201cI have been called a stripper, a whore, I have been told my husband is a piece of s\u2014 and that my children are a piece of s\u2014. Don\u2019t you see what this vile human is?\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: What Advice Would Teresa Giudice Give Herself Before Joining \u2018RHONJ\u2019?\n\nBut Catania wasn\u2019t backing down. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what to do,\u201d she told Gorga, before walking out with Flicker. \u201cI pity Teresa for not seeing that I am the truest friend that she has. Teresa, guess what \u2014 you\u2019ve been much closer to Kim D than I\u2019ve ever been. Not too long ago, you and Kim D were spreading rumors about Melissa. So now the hypocrites that they are are turning on me. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nWithout them by her side, Giudice decided that she, Gorga, Josephs and Staub were going to go to the Posche show next week and confront DePaola. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that f\u2014\u2014 bitch said that. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re f\u2014\u2014 supporting her after what she did to you, what she did to me. It\u2019s just pretty screwed up,\u201d Giudice said. \u201cI think I need to go there and confront this f\u2014\u2014 bitch.\u201d\n\nHer friends were by her side. \u201cThe line in the sand has been drawn!\u201d Staub said.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F11%2Fsiggy-flicker-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fteresa-joe-giudice-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fjoe-guidice-teresa-guidice.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F03%2Fkim-de-paola-1-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fteresa-joe-giudice-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/rhonj-did-teresa-giudice-cheat-on-joe-giudice/", "title": "RHONJ: Did Teresa Giudice Cheat on Joe Giudice?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Danielle Staub,Dolores Catania,Joe Giudice,Joe Gorga,Margaret Josephs,Melissa Gorga,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Siggy Flicker,Teresa Giudice,TV", "news_keywords": "Danielle Staub,Dolores Catania,Joe Giudice,Joe Gorga,Margaret Josephs,Melissa Gorga,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Siggy Flicker,Teresa Giudice,TV", "description": "On Wednesday's\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey, Teresa Giudice got back to her table-flipping ways\u00a0when rumors surfaced that she was cheating on her husband Joe Giudice", "og": {"title": "Teresa Giudice Flips Out as Accusations that She's Cheating on Husband Joe Arise", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/rhonj-did-teresa-giudice-cheat-on-joe-giudice/", "description": "Teresa Giudice has been known for her zen, namaste attitude after returning&nbsp;from her 11-month prison stay.&nbsp;But on Wednesday\u2019s&nbsp;Real Housewives of New Jersey, the mother of&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fteresa-joe-giudice-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/rhonj-did-teresa-giudice-cheat-on-joe-giudice/", "description": "On Wednesday's\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey, Teresa Giudice got back to her table-flipping ways\u00a0when rumors surfaced that she was cheating on her husband Joe Giudice", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fteresa-joe-giudice-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/rhonj-did-teresa-giudice-cheat-on-joe-giudice/", "title": "Teresa Giudice Flips Out as Accusations that She's Cheating on Husband Joe Arise", "description": "On Wednesday's\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey, Teresa Giudice got back to her table-flipping ways\u00a0when rumors surfaced that she was cheating on her husband Joe Giudice", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fteresa-joe-giudice-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
