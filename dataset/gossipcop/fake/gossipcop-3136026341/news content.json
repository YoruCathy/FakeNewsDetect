They are going to use this time to see if they should continue to be broken up or get back together down the line. There is still a chance if they end up missing each other. So there is still hope, but they definitely need time away [from each other],\u201d a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, following the couple\u2019s confirmation of their breakup on March 13.\n\nAfter rumors ran rampant earlier this morning, Zayn, 25, and Gigi, 22, released separate statements on social media, confirming the heartbreaking split after over two years of dating. Zayn tweeted, \u201cGigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend. She has such an incredible soul. I\u2019m grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time, we wish this news could have come from us first. We love you all. xZ.\u201d And Gigi added, \u201cBreakup statements often seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few year..not only in the relationship, but in life in general. I\u2019m forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense respect and love for. As for the future, whatever\u2019s meant to be will alway be.\u201d\n\nThis sad breakup confirmation comes after a report by The Sun started going viral. If you\u2019ll recall, Zayn and Gigi started dating in November 2015 \u2014 just three months after he ended his engagement to Little Mix\u2018s Perrie Edwards, 24. Their relationship also started just weeks after Gigi broke up with Joe Jonas, 28, which was seen as controversial at the time. We\u2019re sad to see any couple part ways, but at least there\u2019s hope for a reunion down the line! Whatever makes each of them happy, we\u2019ll fully support.", "images": ["https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F13%2Fzayn-malik-gigi-hadid-split-getting-back-together%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3035180", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/zayn-gigi-split-but-why-theyll-reunite-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/chrisrogers.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/zayn-gigi-split-but-why-theyll-reunite-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Rogers", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "Deputy Editor Of Los Angeles"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/13/zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-split-getting-back-together/", "title": "Zayn Malik & Gigi Hadid\u2019s Shocking Split: Why There\u2019s A Chance They\u2019ll Reunite \u2018Down The Line\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "We're still crying over the fact that Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid's pillow talk has come to an end, but we've learned there's hope for a reconciliation!", "news_keywords": "Gigi Hadid, Zayn Malik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Zayn Malik & Gigi Hadid\u2019s Shocking Split: Why There\u2019s A Chance They\u2019ll Reunite \u2018Down The Line\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/13/zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-split-getting-back-together/", "description": "We\u2019re still crying over the fact that Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid\u2019s pillow talk has come to an end, but we\u2019ve learned there\u2019s hope for a reconciliation!", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/zayn-gigi-split-but-why-theyll-reunite-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-13T20:49:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-18T15:24:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Zayn Malik & Gigi Hadid\u2019s Shocking Split: Why There\u2019s A Chance They\u2019ll Reunite \u2018Down The Line\u2019"}, "image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/zayn-gigi-split-but-why-theyll-reunite-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/ChrisRogers86/", "title": "Zayn Malik & Gigi Hadid\u2019s Shocking Split: Why There\u2019s A Chance They\u2019ll Reunite \u2018Down The Line\u2019", "description": "We're still crying over the fact that Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid's pillow talk has come to an end, but we've learned there's hope for a reconciliation!"}, "author": "Chris Rogers", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520870400.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
