This is completely fake news. The false rumors say that the model is worried about the Kardashian-Jenner clan driving the NBA star away, but there is no truth to any of this.\n\nGossip Cop was the one that found out where things really stand between the two.\n\nMarni to the rescue A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 15, 2017 at 10:59am PDT\n\nKendall and Blake haven\u2019t even confirmed yet that they are dating, but the pair was indeed spotted together on various outings in the past few weeks.\n\nOn Ok!\u2019s website there was an article posted where she says that she is worried about her family interfering in her love life and as a result, she advised Blake to stay away from her sisters and mom.\n\nA so-called source tells the magazine, \u2018He\u2019s been invited over to Kris\u2019s for dinner numerous times, but Kendall\u2019s told him to ignore the invites and keep away.\u2019\n\nThe outlet\u2019s dubious insider goes on to say Griffin isn\u2019t totally comfortable shunning the Kardashians because he\u2019s \u2018worried he\u2019s being rude, but ultimately he trusts Kendall\u2019s judgment because the last thing he wants is to be cursed like Caitlyn [Jenner], Lamar Odom and so many others.\u2019\n\nit's here! LIMITED EDITION DropThree available exclusively @saks #KK\u2764\ufe0fSAKS A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on Sep 12, 2017 at 9:41am PDT\n\nAs for Griffin\u2019s inner circle, the seemingly phony source further alleges, \u2018His friends don\u2019t think much of Kendall, who they see as stuck up and annoying.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGossip Cop also checked in with a source close to the whole situation who assures everyone that the outlet\u2019s article is completely bogus. This is not the first time that the magazine presents false reports surrounding Kendall and Blake\u2019s apparent relationship.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ellen-DeGeneres-Shawn-Mendes-More-Send-Their-Love-To-Mexico-After-Earthquake-Kills-Over-130-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kylie-Jenner-travis-scott-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kourtney-Kardashian-and-Reign-700x466.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kourtney-kardashian-2-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kendall-Jenner-Didnt-Warn-Blake-Griffin-To-Stay-Away-From-Family-Despite-Reports.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kendall-Jenner-Didnt-Warn-Blake-Griffin-To-Stay-Away-From-Family-Despite-Reports.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kendall-jenner-didnt-warn-blake-griffin-to-stay-away-from-family-despite-reports-68743/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Didn\u2019t Warn Blake Griffin To Stay Away From Family, Despite Reports", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "blake griffin, kendall jenner, the kardashians,", "keywords": "celebrity news, blake griffin, kendall jenner, the kardashians,", "description": "There is a new report that claims Kendall Jenner warned her rumored new boyfriend Blake Griffin to stay away from her family.
