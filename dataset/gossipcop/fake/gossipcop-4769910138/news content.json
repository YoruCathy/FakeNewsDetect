John Lewis took to Twitter to chime in and they overwhemingly congratulated ABC on their decision to give Roseanne the heave-ho:\n\n\n\nThank you, @ABCNetwork. You did the right thing. There is not any room in our society for racism or bigotry. \u2014 John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nFor the record, this is Channing Dungey. Sitting on top of your world like a Queen in full judgement of your garbage and taking it out. #Roseanne pic.twitter.com/GxEP2B61uq \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@ava) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nTon of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America....umm..now don't bug Bob but maybe someone else find out if I'm still banned from all of @ABCNetwork for calling Roseanne Barr out first on her racist conspiracy tweets? \u2014 Tom Arnold (@TomArnold) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nHey @ABC, Roseanne Barr compared Valerie Jarrett to an ape. There is no apology she can make that justifies @ABC turning a blind eye to this bigotry by airing another second of her show.\n\nEven in the Age of Trump, there are red lines that can never be crossed. This is one. \u2014 Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nI bet FOX will pick it up & pair it with Tim Allen's show. https://t.co/5MyZf9UT3X via @thr \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nRoseanne woke up with a million dollar job and lost it before lunchtime in LA. Life comes at you fast. \u2014 Tour\u00e9 (@Toure) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nBut honestly she got what she deserved. As I tell my 4 year old, one makes a choice with one\u2019s actions. Roseanne made a choice. A racist one. ABC made a choice. A human one. \u2014 shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nadios\n\nRoseanne!\n\n\n\ngood\n\nriddance.\n\n\n\nhashtag\n\nNOT Winning.\n\n\n\nthe\n\nrunway is\n\nnow clear\n\nfor\n\nOUR reboot.\n\n\n\n\u00a9#CharlieHarperReturns pic.twitter.com/HcqMvIoxCM \u2014 Charlie Sheen (@charliesheen) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\nFrom Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment: \"Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show.\"\n\nThere was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing. \u2014 Robert Iger (@RobertIger) May 29, 2018\n\nSupport real journalism.
