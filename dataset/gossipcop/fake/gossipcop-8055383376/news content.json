Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.\n\n\u201cTeresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe\u2019s deportation and she agreed to do it,\u201d an insider revealed. \u201cHalf a million dollars to share the story on camera.\u201d\n\nAnd this story is believable because this isn\u2019t Teresa\u2019s first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!\n\n\u201cIt is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,\u201d added the source.\n\nIS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE\u2019S DEPORTATION?\n\nEarlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that \u201crecords show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.\u201d\n\nA source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.\n\n\u201cTeresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,\u201d the source stated.\n\nJoe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.\n\nUPDATE \u2013 Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe\u2019s possible deportation.\n\nPhoto Credit: WENN Ltd/Alamy Stock Photo", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Shiva-Safai-new-boyfriend-Niels-Houweling-plus-Mohamed-Hadid-e1574892714519-400x283.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kristen-Doute-and-Katie-Maloney-plus-James-Kennedy-400x286.jpg", "http://realityblurb.com/2018/07/27/report-rhonjs-teresa-giudice-getting-500k-to-film-spinoff-special-about-joes-deportation/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-twitter-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Erika-Jayne-and-Denise-Richards-plus-RHOBH-Cast-Photo-400x286.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teresa-Giudice-and-Joe-Giudice-News.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brittany-Cartwright-and-Jax-Taylor-2019-e1554656234797-400x285.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teresa-Giudice-and-Joe-Giudice-News-e1530120231871.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RHONJ-Joe-Giudice-and-Teresa-Giudice-News-400x281.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/white-logo1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/profile-sola1-120x120.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1B.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teresa-Giudice-and-Joe-Giudice-News-e1530120231871-1024x609.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Melissa-Gorga-Getting-Her-Mail-Photos-3-400x250.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/feed-logo.png", "http://realityblurb.com/2018/07/27/report-rhonjs-teresa-giudice-getting-500k-to-film-spinoff-special-about-joes-deportation/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-facebook-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kyle-Richards-plus-Lisa-Vanderpump-400x257.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blurb-logo-1@2x.png", "http://realityblurb.com/2018/07/27/report-rhonjs-teresa-giudice-getting-500k-to-film-spinoff-special-about-joes-deportation/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-pinterest-pink.png", "http://realityblurb.com/2018/07/27/report-rhonjs-teresa-giudice-getting-500k-to-film-spinoff-special-about-joes-deportation/ https:/realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/social-instagram-pink.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kenya-Moore-News-Update-e1577372761358-400x289.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Kathryn-Dennis-plus-Thomas-Ravenel-News-400x263.jpg"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teresa-Giudice-and-Joe-Giudice-News-e1530120231871.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/07/27/report-rhonjs-teresa-giudice-getting-500k-to-film-spinoff-special-about-joes-deportation/", "title": "REPORT: Teresa Giudice Getting $500K to Film Joe Deportation Spinoff", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#db0a5b", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "REPORT: RHONJ's Teresa Giudice to Get $500K to Film Spinoff Special About Joe's Deportation", "description": "According to a new report, RHONJ star Teresa Giudice is getting paid $500,000 by Bravo to film a spinoff special about the deportation proceedings of her incarcerated husband Joe Giudice.", "image": {"identifier": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Teresa-Giudice-and-Joe-Giudice-News-e1530120231871.jpg", "width": 1516, "height": 902}, "url": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/07/27/report-rhonjs-teresa-giudice-getting-500k-to-film-spinoff-special-about-joes-deportation/", "site_name": "Reality Blurb", "updated_time": "2018-07-31T11:43:56-05:00"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/realityblurb", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/realityblurb", "published_time": "2018-07-27T13:51:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-31T11:43:56-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "REPORT: Teresa Giudice Getting $500K to Film Joe Deportation Spinoff", "description": "Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we're talking about here!
