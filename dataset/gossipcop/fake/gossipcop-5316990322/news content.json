The three-judge panel, in a 2-1 ruling, noted that Rio police, not Lochte, had initiated the investigation and that the story he first told NBC did not meet the standard of a false report.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors could still challenge the ruling, and they have 15 days to do so. Lochte\u2019s lawyers have been pressing for a dismissal of the case, but a lower court had ruled 2-1 to uphold the charge.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the court has finally dismissed the criminal prosecution against Mr. Lochte, while at the same time, appropriately recognizing that he committed no crime,\u201d Jeff Ostrow, a Florida-based attorney for Lochte, told USA Today. \u201cIt has been a long year, but in the end, justice prevailed.\u201d\n\nLochte had said that he and three other U.S. swimmers, Jimmy Feigen, Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger, were on their way back to the Olympic Village from a party when their car was pulled over by gun-toting robbers pretending to be police officers. Citing surveillance video footage and eyewitness accounts, Brazilian authorities claimed that Lochte and his teammates vandalized and urinated on a gas station, after which security guards pointed a gun at them and demanded recompense before they left.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLochte subsequently said that he \u201cdefinitely had too much to drink\u201d that night, adding that he was still intoxicated when he provided false details to NBC\u2019s Billy Bush the day after the incident. While he was able to leave Brazil quickly, his three teammates were detained, with Feigen agreeing to pay a fine of nearly $11,000 to expedite his departure.\n\nIn the wake of the firestorm, which overshadowed the second week of the Olympics, Lochte lost several sponsors. His suspension left him unable to compete at last month\u2019s U.S. nationals, making him ineligible for the world championships later this month in Budapest.\n\nThe notoriety Lochte earned from the incident resurfaced at the ESPY awards this week, when host Peyton Manning joked that last year\u2019s host, professional wrestler John Cena, \u201cis an athlete the same way that Ryan Lochte is a reliable witness.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eVOflfnHlttWqjGkgrNtLcvlsGY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4H6J6Z5LAYDTMFW2ISSFXN464.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/1d50dc4c-a975-4747-a9ce-cbaf1a59cea9.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F5V5P3QJ2E7FFBR5UQPPGP2TVY.jpg&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eVOflfnHlttWqjGkgrNtLcvlsGY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4H6J6Z5LAYDTMFW2ISSFXN464.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Des Bieler", "Sports Reporter Covering National Topics", "Including Fantasy Football", "As Well As Supporting Coverage Of D.C.-Area Teams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/07/14/ryan-lochte-cleared-of-false-report-charge-after-incident-at-rio-olympics/", "title": "Ryan Lochte cleared of false-report charge after incident at Rio Olympics", "meta_data": {"description": "The U.S. swimmer had caused a firestorm at the Rio Olympics with a tale of getting robbed at gunpoint that he later admitted he had \u201cover-exaggerated.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/07/14/ryan-lochte-cleared-of-false-report-charge-after-incident-at-rio-olympics/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eVOflfnHlttWqjGkgrNtLcvlsGY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4H6J6Z5LAYDTMFW2ISSFXN464.jpg", "title": "Ryan Lochte cleared of false-report charge after incident at Rio Olympics", "description": "The U.S. swimmer had caused a firestorm at the Rio Olympics with a tale of getting robbed at gunpoint that he later admitted he had \u201cover-exaggerated.\u201d"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ryan Lochte cleared of false-report charge after incident at Rio Olympics", "description": "The U.S. swimmer had caused a firestorm at the Rio Olympics with a tale of getting robbed at gunpoint that he later admitted he had \u201cover-exaggerated.\u201d"}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-29T07:52:35.155Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499961600.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
