Whether it was dressing as a punky tomboy during her years as the frontwoman for No Doubt or embracing her love for Japanese fashion with Harajuku, Stefani has always found a way to stand out.\n\nRecently, the rocker has been embracing her feminity, wearing things that recall old-school Hollywood glam, and that\u2019s much to do with her relationship with country crooner Blake Shelton. During a conversation with supermodel Heidi Klum for InStyle, Stefani was asked to describe her current style.\n\n\u201cMore feminine than ever before,\u201d Stefani shared. \u201cIt\u2019s probably because I\u2019m super in love and have a really manly man [Shelton]. I enjoy letting that part of me come out now because when I was in No Doubt, I never thought of myself as sexy. Even in my 30s, I was a tomboy. I hardly ever carried a purse.\u201d\n\nHer affection for the \u201cI Lived It\u201d singer carried over to her answer to the question of \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite thing that you\u2019ve ever worn?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe red Yanina Couture dress I had on when Blake and I stepped out [together] for the first time,\u201d Stefani explained. \u201cThat was a magical night, and I loved the flowers.\u201d\n\nShelton\u2019s inspiration influenced Stefani\u2019s Las Vegas residency show, Gwen Stefani \u2014 Just a Girl, when she sported a cowgirl-inspired ensemble for \u201cMake Me Like You.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat part of the show is my super love note, my, \u2018I am so grateful, this is how much you influenced me and gave me life,\u2019\u201d she told Extra\u2019s Mark Wright.\n\nThe couple continues to support one another through their separate endeavors, as Shelton flies back and forth to Vegas for Stefani\u2019s show while filming season 14 of NBC\u2019s The Voice.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=260180471043367&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=X2NWm1aMp4Z352", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Voice-1586448075-1000x667.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-2-1586877924-1000x563.png", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-1531238200.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Blake-SHelton-Gwen-Stefani-1531238046.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-1495464916-940x470.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/themes/soundslikenashville-v2/assets/images/brand/logo-mini-w.png", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tim-McGraw-Carly-Pearce-Blake-Shelton-1586197144-1000x714.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Store-Ad-1573510267.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Blake-SHelton-Gwen-Stefani-1531238046.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/blake-shelton-inspires-gwen-stefani-sexy/", "title": "Blake Shelton Inspires Gwen Stefani to Feel Sexy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Gwen Stefani is excited to embrace her feminine side by dressing sexier, thanks to her manly-man boyfriend, Blake Shelton.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton Inspires Gwen Stefani to Feel Sexy", "description": "It's because Shelton is a \"manly man.\"", "url": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/blake-shelton-inspires-gwen-stefani-sexy/", "site_name": "Sounds Like Nashville", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Blake-SHelton-Gwen-Stefani-1531238046.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Blake-SHelton-Gwen-Stefani-1531238046.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 631}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/soundslikenashville", "author": "lafferlauren", "tag": "Gwen Stefani", "section": "News", "published_time": "2018-07-10T20:05:19+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Gwen Stefani is excited to embrace her feminine side by dressing sexier, thanks to her manly-man boyfriend, Blake Shelton.", "title": "Blake Shelton Inspires Gwen Stefani to Feel Sexy", "site": "@SoundsLikeNash", "image": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Blake-SHelton-Gwen-Stefani-1531238046.jpg", "creator": "@laurlaff1"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "p": {"domain_verify": "99dae4a28a5644b1db204730b5be7ccc"}, "fb": {"pages": 58155286816}, "google-site-verification": "UIk94odLuKBOAyMvPay3LTMGDzELhrLFtwppaywdaiw"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531253119.0, "source": "http://www.soundslikenashville.com", "summary": ""}
