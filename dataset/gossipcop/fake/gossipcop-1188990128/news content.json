During a six-minute clip, Jenner admits that she \"bounced back fast,\" but that her body is not how it was pre-pregnancy.\n\n\"I feel like people think that I bounced back super fast, which I guess I did,\" she said. \"People can get the wrong idea on Instagram sometimes.\"\n\nShe listed off her most significant changes, which most likely have moms everywhere nodding their heads in agreement. \"My boobs are definitely three times the size, which bothers me,\" she said. \"I have stretch marks on my boobs. My stomach isn\u2019t the same, my waist isn\u2019t the same, my butt\u2019s bigger, my thighs [are] bigger.\u201d\n\nKylie\u2013who is known for wearing ab-baring crop tops, skintight dresses, and teeny bikinis\u2013also mentioned that she had to switch up her signature look because her old clothes aren't fitting the same way. \"I'm finding I have to change my style a little because nothing in my closet fits me from before,\" she added.\n\nEven though the beauty mogul looks ah-mazing, the youngest KarJenner announced that she has planned her first workout on Monday. \"I really want to get my core back,\" she explained.\n\nShe continued: \u201cI feel like I have fake abs now, it\u2019s just like, genetics. But I want real abs. I know I can have a super fit body. And just for my health\u2014I want to do this. I want to feel good.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe're sure sister and also first-time mom Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian would welcome Kylie as a her new workout buddy ever since she lost Kourtney at sea somewhere in Italy.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F030618-kylie-jenner-lead_1_0.jpg%3Fitok%3DANtiBFbp"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F030618-kylie-jenner-lead_1_0.jpg%3Fitok%3DANtiBFbp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alicia Brunker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kylie-jenner-post-baby-body-insecurities", "title": "Like Every Mom, Kylie Jenner Struggles with Post-Baby Body Insecurities", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,latest,Celebrity,Kardashian Korner,Celebrity Moms,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Body Confidence,Body,Health & Fitness,Kylie Jenner", "news_keywords": "News,latest,Celebrity,Kardashian Korner,Celebrity Moms,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Body Confidence,Body,Health & Fitness,Kylie Jenner", "description": "While her older sisters prove that their bodies have only become stronger postpartum, Kylie Jenner is still struggling to accept her new curves after giving birth to her first child, Stormi Webster.", "og": {"title": "Like Every Mom, Kylie Jenner Struggles with Post-Baby Body Insecurities", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kylie-jenner-post-baby-body-insecurities", "description": "\"My boobs are definitely three times the size.\"", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F030618-kylie-jenner-lead_1_0.jpg%3Fitok%3DANtiBFbp"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kylie-jenner-post-baby-body-insecurities", "description": "While her older sisters prove that their bodies have only become stronger postpartum, Kylie Jenner is still struggling to accept her new curves after giving birth to her first child, Stormi Webster.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F030618-kylie-jenner-lead_1_0.jpg%3Fitok%3DANtiBFbp"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kylie-jenner-post-baby-body-insecurities", "title": "Like Every Mom, Kylie Jenner Struggles with Post-Baby Body Insecurities", "description": "\"My boobs are definitely three times the size.\"", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F030618-kylie-jenner-lead_1_0.jpg%3Fitok%3DANtiBFbp"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lzt0YW-itOg?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
