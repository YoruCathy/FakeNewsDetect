And no-one could be happier.\n\n\u2018Meghan\u2019s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.\u2019\n\nThe royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.\n\n\u2018Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,\u2019 revealed a source. \u2018But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.\n\nLast month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: \u2018They\u2019re desperate to have a family as soon as possible\u2019.\n\nSo keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.\n\nGetty\n\nGiven the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn\u2019t want to wait to start a family.\n\n\u2018They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,\u2019 a source told Hollywood Life.\n\nAnd Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. \u2018I\u2019ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,\u2019 he said back in 2012.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.\u2019\n\nIn their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: \u2018We will start a family in the near future,\u2019 he said.\n\nThankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.\n\n\u2018Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,\u2019 she said.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/29282/harry-meghan.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/29282/harry-meghan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
