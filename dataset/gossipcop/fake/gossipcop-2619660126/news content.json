I don't have words. [sic]\"[17] The tweet briefly became the most-liked tweet in history.[18] Grande subsequently suspended her tour and flew to her mother's home in Boca Raton, Florida.[19][20] On 26 May, she announced that she would host a benefit concert in Manchester for the victims of the attack.[21]\n\nBefore main event [ edit ]\n\nDevelopments and planning [ edit ]\n\nPromotional poster for the concert\n\nEvent tickets were made available on 1 June 2017 for \u00a340, and sold with no booking fees.

The application ended on 31 May at 17:00, but was extended till 22:00 to allow as many people at the concert on the 22nd to apply to be there as possible.[8][23] Metrolink offered free travel for concertgoers to and from the Old Trafford tram stop.[24] Uber also said that fares of passengers travelling to and from the concert will be donated to charity.\n\nFollowing the London attack that occurred a day before the show, Greater Manchester Police announced that security would be tighter than planned. They also advised attendees not to bring bags into the venue for security reasons.[25]\n\nTickets for the concert were found to be listed for sale on the online auction site eBay, at prices above the original sales price.

He appeared with other musicians in the pre-recorded video sending best wishes to Manchester.[31]\n\nSet list [ edit ]\n\nBroadcast [ edit ]\n\nThe concert was broadcast live on BBC One, BBC Radio and Capital FM networks.[7] Television coverage on BBC One was presented by Sara Cox and Ore Oduba, with Nick Grimshaw and Anita Rani hosting from backstage and within the crowd.

However, approximately 10,000 additional applications, from people ineligible for free tickets, caused delays in ticket processing.[81]\n\nThe concert averaged 10.9 million viewers on BBC One, peaking at 14.5 million viewers.[80][82] 22.6 million people watched at least three minutes of the programme on BBC One, making it the UK's most-watched television event of 2017.[82] The concert reached an audience share of 49.3 percent in overall viewers, 69 percent of adults 16\u201324 and 61 percent in the demographic of 25\u201334 year-olds.[82] Consolidated 7-day figures put the average UK viewership at 11.63 million.[83] BBC iPlayer registered more than one million live-stream requests, making One Love Manchester the biggest non-sports programme in iPlayer\u2019s history, surpassing the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.[84]\n\nMoney raised [ edit ]\n\nThe British Red Cross received \u00a32.35 million in donations during the three-hour concert for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund. By the next day, the British Red Cross announced it had received more than \u00a310 million since the attack,[13] and subsequently, reports have set the total at more than \u00a317 million.[85]\n\nGrande also donated all proceeds to the fund from a re-release of her single \"One Last Time\" and a live audio version of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" that she performed during the concert.[85]\n\nTicket sale Original concert ticket holders General ticket holders Total attendance 14,158[86] 50,800[86][87] 55,000[87][88]\n\nMoney raised Ticket sale British Red Cross EIF Facebook Fundraising Total amount raised \u00a32 million[ citation needed ] \u00a310 million[13] \u00a3358.5 thousand[ citation needed ] \u00a317[89] million +[85]\n\nReactions [ edit ]\n\nFrancis Wilkinson, in Bloomberg.com, wrote that Grande offered \"a face that was brave and kind in the wake of terror while accomplishing several useful goals \u2013 raising money for victims, bolstering courage and making the attacks look both puny and pointless. Whatever the terrorists had hoped to produce in Manchester, it certainly wasn't this party.\"[90] She received praise for her \"grace and strength\" in organizing, hosting and performing at the concert.[91][92] Madeline Roth of MTV News wrote that the performance \"bolstered courage among an audience that desperately needed it. ... Returning to the stage was a true act of bravery and resilience\".[93] The City of Manchester named Grande as an honorary citizen of the city following the singer's \"great many selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit\" and will be the first to be awarded from the city.[94]\n\nKory Grow in Rolling Stone, wrote \"It felt incredibly safe. As I made my own way to the tram, I wrote in my Apple Notes app, 'Helicopter hovering overhead,' which to me signified that the fans were being watched over. Then two policemen stopped me and asked me who I was with and whether I'd written anything about a helicopter into my phone, without explaining the technology of how they'd read my Notes app. After a friendly back-and-forth, they looked through my bag, checked my ID and business card and determined I wasn't a threat. 'You have to understand, tensions are running high,' one of the men said with a smile and a handshake, allowing me through the gate. Manchester was secure tonight.\"[95] Dee Lockett, in New York's Vulture section, ranked the event as the No. 1 concert of 2017, noting:\n\nLess than two weeks after the attack, and with only a few days to privately process and mourn, Ariana returned to Manchester with an entire benefit concert she coordinated. ... She called in every favor, pulling in famous friends like Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber to show up for the grieving city. After meeting with a parent of one of the victims, Grande said she shifted the tone of the show from somber to celebratory because she understood that it was what her fans needed. ... All night, Ariana performed without breaking, but that was when she had others by her side. ... When it was just her alone with her fans for her finale cover of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\", the floodgates opened. In what will likely go down as one of the defining moments of her career, she paused the song, looked out to her audience, which was already sobbing along with her, then resumed the music to nail yet another impossible note.[16]\n\nIn an interview with Billboard magazine, Grande's manager Scooter Braun remarked that \"the City of Manchester was the Hero.\"[96]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/be/Flag_of_England.svg/24px-Flag_of_England.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/One_Love_Manchester_Logo_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/45/One-Love-Manchester-poster.png/220px-One-Love-Manchester-poster.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/BBC.svg/24px-BBC.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/24px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Audio-input-microphone.png/21px-Audio-input-microphone.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/England_Greater_Manchester_numbered.svg/24px-England_Greater_Manchester_numbered.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/One_Love_Manchester_Logo_2.jpg/250px-One_Love_Manchester_Logo_2.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Blank_television_set.svg/24px-Blank_television_set.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/One_Love_Manchester_Logo_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Love_Manchester", "title": "One Love Manchester", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/One_Love_Manchester_Logo_2.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
