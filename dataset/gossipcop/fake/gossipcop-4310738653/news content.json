The \u201cGenie in a Bottle\u201d singer is currently engaged to longtime love Matthew Rutler.\n\nIn addition to spilling the tea, Aguilera shared some advice with the aspiring drag performers.\n\n\u201cOnce you obtain a certain level of success, you can become jaded and you can see certain people around you change,\u201d she said. \u201cThat can make you change and feel guarded or shut down and weird. But I think as long as you keep remembering who you are as a person \u2014 and keep remembering the good and the good around you \u2014 then nothing can stop you.\u201d", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-74703753.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-74703753.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-74703753.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["March"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/03/23/christina-aguilera-outs-ex-boyfriend/", "title": "Christina Aguilera outs ex-boyfriend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
