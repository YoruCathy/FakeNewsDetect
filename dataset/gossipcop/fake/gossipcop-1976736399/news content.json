You see, since Kanye and Kim later married, Kanye\u2019s past becomes important to Kim\u2019s future. And that time he grabbed the mic from Taylor\u2019s hands during her 2009 VMAs acceptance speech is the root of so much more.\n\nA lot was said about this incident over the years from both sides, from apologies to non-apologies, but Kim didn\u2019t have much to say on the matter \u2013 yet.\n\nNOVEMBER 2012: JUST CHILLING\n\nAt the 2012 MTV EMAs, Taylor hung out with Kim \u2013 who had just started dating Kanye a few months before. They also spent time with Rita Ora, who was dating Rob Kardashian at the time. Yes, yes we were ever so young.\n\nThere was also a moment when Kim took a photo for Taylor.\n\nFEBRUARY 2015: GOOD VIBES\n\nTaylor and Kanye were reunited at the 2015 Grammys, and there was no drama to be seen. Taylor enjoyed some nice conversation with Kim. Everyone smiled.\n\nThey also embraced! This could really be the start of something beautiful.\n\nThey also took a group shot with JAY-Z, because, why not?\n\nThe whole lovefest sparked rumors of a potential collaboration that West was quick to humor in an interview with Ryan Seacrest. \u201cShe wants to get in the studio, and we\u2019re definitely going to go in,\u201d he said. \u201cAny artist with an amazing point of view, perspective, fan base, I\u2019m down to get in the studio and work. I don\u2019t discriminate.\u201d\n\nSadly, that day never came \u2013 but if it had, we would have expected backup vocals from Kim, the artist best known for \u201cJam (Turn It Up).\u201d\n\nFEBRUARY 2015: PARTY TIME\n\nThe two reunited at the 2015 Brit Awards. Kim shared a group photo with Taylor, Kanye and Sam Smith.\n\nThey also had a beautiful moment with Karlie Kloss and Derek Blasberg.\n\nPlus, when Kanye performed, Kim was treated to a front-row view of The Taylor Swift Award Show Dancing Extravaganza. Lucky Kim!\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nJUNE 2015: SISTERLY BOND\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/4c9IgIDvAL/\n\nThe squad joined forces at Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 World Tour stop in London, kicking off a summer full of guest appearances up on the stage. One certain member of the squad to note: Kendall Jenner, Kim\u2019s sister.\n\nIn fact, a few members of Taylor\u2019s friend circle are also friendly with Kim, including Gigi Hadid and Cara Delevingne (who also go by Slay-Z and Mother Chucker).\n\nAUGUST 2015: BEST NIGHT EVER\n\nSix years after that original night at the VMAs, Taylor took the stage to present Kanye with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. \u201cI have been a fan of his since I can remember because Kanye defines what it is to be a creative force in music, fashion and, well, life,\u201d Taylor said in her introduction. \u201cI\u2019m really happy for you, and I\u2019mma let you finish, but Kanye has had one of the greatest careers of all time!\u201d\n\nShe then settled in next to Kim in the audience to watch Kanye give an 11-minute speech/rant/proclamation to run for president. Their expressions throughout it all pretty much confirmed their status as #squad.\n\nThey laughed.\n\nThey applauded.\n\nThey looked at one another lovingly.\n\nThey hugged.\n\nAnd for a brief moment, Tay was basically one of the KarJenners.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2015: EVERYONE LOVES FLOWERS\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/7OZIdGDvFT/\n\nAfter that night, Kanye sent Taylor flowers, which pretty much led to her assertion that she would, indeed, be his running mate. She captioned the Instagram photo, \u201cAwww Kanye sent me the coolest flowers!! #KanTay2020 #BFFs.\u201d\n\nInterestingly enough, these flowers beared a striking resembling to his and Kim\u2019s floral wedding wall.\n\nThis also resembles the flower wall Kanye got Kim for her first Mother\u2019s Day. Basically, if Kanye loves you, you get a flower wall.\n\nFEBRUARY 2016: THOSE LYRICS\n\nThen things started to get \u2026 complicated. At Kanye\u2019s Yeezy Season 3 fashion show (which doubled as a listening party for his new album, The Life of Pablo), fans first heard his song \u201cFamous.\u201d In it, Kanye raps, \u201cFor all my Southside n\u2014-s that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why, I made that bitch famous / Goddamn / I made that bitch famous.\u201d\n\nAfter some reactions from the Internet (including squad members Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss and Jaime King, plus brother Austin Swift), Kanye took to Twitter to clear up his side of the story. According to him, both Taylor and Kim approved the lyrics prior to the song\u2019s debut.\n\n\u201cI called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line, and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings,\u201d Kanye wrote. He went on to say his lyrics about Taylor were \u201cendearing\u201d and that she herself was actually the source of a contentious line. According to him, she was at a dinner with one of their mutual friends when she allegedly said, \u201cI can\u2019t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous!\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Taylor told PEOPLE, \u201cKanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single \u2018Famous\u2019 on her Twitter account.\u201d\n\nHer rep also said, \u201cShe declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, \u2018I made that bitch famous.'\u201d\n\nFEBRUARY 2016: TAYLOR\u2019S RESPONSE\n\nThe 2016 Grammys came just a few weeks later. Taylor took home the biggest prize of the night \u2013 album of the year \u2013 and used that moment to make a powerful speech that many saw as a dig to Kanye.\n\n\u201c[A]s the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammys twice,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cI want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIf you just focus on the work, and you don\u2019t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you\u2019re going, you\u2019ll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment.\u201d\n\nJUNE 2016: KIM HAS SOME OPINIONS ON THAT\n\nIn her cover interview with GQ for their July issue, Kim said that Taylor did green-light the verse mentioning her. \u201cShe totally approved that,\u201d she said. \u201cShe totally knew that that was coming out. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn\u2019t. I swear, my husband gets so much s\u2014 for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cWhat rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?\u201d\n\nKim also shared that \u201cso many respected people in the music business\u201d heard the phone conversation and that West always keeps cameras rolling while he is recording an album, in case he decides to make a documentary (as one does).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why she just, you know, flipped all of a sudden,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt was funny because [on the call with Kanye] she said, \u2018When I get on the Grammy red carpet, all the media is going to think that I\u2019m so against this, and I\u2019ll just laugh and say, \u2018The joke\u2019s on you, guys. I was in on it the whole time.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, wait, but [in] your Grammy speech, you completely dissed my husband just to play the victim again.\u201d\n\nKim said Kanye and Taylor have not been in touch since the latest bout of drama, but he did receive an attorney\u2019s letter from Taylor\u2019s team asking for the video footage to be destroyed.\n\nJUNE 2016: TAYLOR SEES THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY\n\nGQ reached out for comment from Taylor\u2019s side on the whole debacle. A spokesperson for her declined to directly answer questions seeking clarification on the matter, but instead provided the following statement:\n\n\u201cTaylor does not hold anything against Kim Kardashian, as she recognizes the pressure Kim must be under and that she is only repeating what she has been told by Kanye West. However, that does not change the fact that much of what Kim is saying is incorrect. Kanye West and Taylor only spoke once on the phone while she was on vacation with her family in January of 2016, and they have never spoken since. Taylor has never denied that conversation took place. It was on that phone call that Kanye West also asked her to release the song on her Twitter account, which she declined to do.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cKanye West never told Taylor he was going to use the term \u2018that bitch\u2019 in referencing her. A song cannot be approved if it was never heard. Kanye West never played the song for Taylor Swift. Taylor heard it for the first time when everyone else did and was humiliated. Kim Kardashian\u2019s claim that Taylor and her team were aware of being recorded is not true, and Taylor cannot understand why Kanye West, and now Kim Kardashian, will not just leave her alone.\u201d\n\nJUNE 2016: THE MUSIC VIDEO\n\nKanye finally released his NSFW music video for \u201cFamous\u201d \u2013 and per usual, it got the people talking.\n\nInspired by Vincent Desiderio\u2019s 2008 Sleep painting, Kanye literally stripped down 12 of the biggest pop culture figures, including Taylor. The video also opened with a snippet of her and background audio from that fateful night at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nJULY 2016: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\n\nOn an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, the family discussed the longstanding feud between Kanye and Taylor in great detail, as well as Kanye\u2019s controversial rant during his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he was recorded backstage calling Taylor fake.\n\nWhen Kanye\u2019s assistant called Kim to let her know about the leaked audio recording from SNL, she got upset, though Kanye didn\u2019t seem too bothered. \u201cMy full-time job is your publicist,\u201d she told Kanye. \u201cI care what people think.\u201d\n\n\u201cKanye says what he wants and he has no filter \u2026 and some people may not understand that,\u201d Kim added during her interview. \u201cUsually I try to stay neutral and just give moral support.\u201d\n\nKim was finally ready to take action when it came to that GQ interview, and she explained to sister Kourtney Kardashian exactly why she felt the need to speak out.\n\n\u201cI never talk s\u2013t about anyone publicly, especially in interviews. But I was just like I had so had it,\u201d she said \u201cI wanted to defend him in it. She legitimately quote says, \u2018As soon as I get on that Grammy red carpet I\u2019m gonna tell all the press. Like I was in on it.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then she just didn\u2019t like the reaction?\u201d Kourtney asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, and you know just another way to play the victim,\u201d Kim added. \u201cIt definitely got her a lot of attention the first time,\u201d \u2013 referencing when Kanye jumped on VMA stage \u2013 \u201cI just don\u2019t think he should be punished for it still to this day,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had it with people blatantly treating my husband a certain way and making him look a certain way, and I\u2019m gonna say how I feel,\u201d Kim said during her interview. \u201cKanye is always so honest and speaks his mind. And you know, when we were first dating, people would always talk s\u2013t and he always had my back. At this point, I really don\u2019t give a f\u2014 so I\u2019ll do whatever to protect my husband.\u201d\n\nShe then went on to add that Taylor even helped Kanye rewrite the lyrics within the song.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that you said the truth,\u201d Kourtney told Kim. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just speaking the truth,\u201d Kim replied.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Kim sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the controversial interview and issues surrounding it. Kris tried to play peacemaker, asking, \u201cWhat would happen if you just called Taylor up and say \u2018What happened? How did this go so south?\u2019 I guess I don\u2019t understand the motivation to flip \u2026 maybe she took it the wrong way. My advice would to be give Taylor Swift a call.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for your lovely advice,\u201d Kim told her mother, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to take it.\u201d\n\nJULY 2016: THE VIDEO FOOTAGE\n\nImmediately following that episode of KUWTK, Kim took to Snapchat to provide the proof, sharing a series of videos of that phone call between Kanye and Taylor, discussing the \u201cFamous\u201d lyrics \u2013 as well as their history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a compliment,\u201d Taylor is heard saying in the video after Kanye reads the lyrics to her (which include, \u201cFor all my Southside n\u2014\u2013 that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex\u201d).\n\n\u201cWhat I give a f\u2014 is you as a person, and as a friend, I want things that make you feel good,\u201d Kanye said, and thanked Swift \u201cfor being like, so cool about it\u201d after she told him she appreciates the \u201cheads up\u201d on the lyrics.\n\n\u201cI never would\u2019ve expected you to like tell me about a line in your song,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think anybody would listen to that and be like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a real diss.\u2019 You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it.\u201d\n\nShe went on to add, \u201cIf people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, \u2018He called me and told me before it came out \u2026 Joke\u2019s on you, guys. We\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\nWhy might Kim do such a thing, you ask? \u201cKim is super loyal to Kanye and will always do anything to have his back,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cShe is even more protective of him than she is of herself. She thinks he\u2019s misunderstood and couldn\u2019t stand that people thought he was a liar.\u201d\n\nThe Internet immediately seemed to side with Kim, and #KimExposedTaylorParty started trending.\n\nJULY 2016: TAYLOR SPEAKS AGAIN\n\nTaylor wasn\u2019t about to sit back and watch all this happen \u2013 she quickly responded to the videos with a post on Instagram.\n\n\u201cWhere is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me \u2018that bitch\u2019 in his song? It doesn\u2019t exist because it never happened. You don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world,\u201d she wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cOf course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot \u2018approve\u2019 a song you haven\u2019t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009,\u201d Taylor continued. She captioned the post, \u201cThat moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Taylor Swift-Kim Kardashian Feud: Internet Sides with Kim on #KimExposedTaylorParty\n\nJULY 2016: THE AFTERMATH\n\nAt this point, the whole situation extends far past Taylor, Kim and Kanye \u2013 the whole squad is getting involved.\n\nTaylor\u2019s BFF Selena Gomez tweeted, \u201cThere are more important things to talk about Why can\u2019t people use their voice for something that f\u2014\u2014 matters? Truth is last thing we need right now is hate, in any form.\u201d\n\nChlo\u00eb Grace Moretz spoke out against Kim\u2019s actions, too, which led Kim\u2019s sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian to clap back against her.\n\nThen, Ruby Rose, another member of the squad, chimed in with: \u201cYo Khloe I thought you were rad when I met you but this is awful and this is a 19 year old girl. Nobody likes being bullied or made to feel worthless.. Yet so many people will go above and beyond to make others feel that way.\u201d\n\nPlenty more people weighed in \u2013 while some of Kim and Taylor\u2019s friends stayed noticeably quiet.\n\nJULY 2016: WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS\u2026\n\nAside from the drama with Kimye, Taylor hasn\u2019t had the cleanest breakup from her ex Calvin Harris (considering he recently slammed her on Twitter and all).\n\nThe two worlds collided over the weekend during Jennifer Lopez\u2018s birthday celebration at her show in Las Vegas. French Montana shared an Instagram photo in which a whole group \u2013 Harris included \u2013 posed with Lopez and a cake.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BIPD1qegmiD/\n\nKim also shared several Snapchats during her night at Hakkasan nightclub in the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, which included dancing along and lip syncing to songs played at the club \u2013 and there\u2019s one song in particular she chose to share with her followers.\n\nKim shared a video of herself and friend Carla DiBello dancing and singing along to Kanye\u2019s now-infamous song, \u201cFamous,\u201d specifically at the moment where he says, \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.\u201d\n\nJULY 2016: SELENA SPEAKS AGAIN\n\nSelena also had a birthday to celebrate over the weekend (which Taylor, of course, observed on Instagram), but it didn\u2019t seem quite as positive. Just before performing her hit single \u201cKill \u2018Em With Kindness\u201d to end a show, Selena got emotional and said to the crowd, \u201cThe next song, before I go home, is a song that\u2019s so important to me, because I get really frustrated. I get stupid sometimes. I say things that I don\u2019t mean, or that come out wrong, just because I care so badly.\u201d\n\nShe continued her message, perhaps alluding to the recent feud Taylor has been dealing with versus Kimye, or the negative reaction from fans when she stepped in to defend her BFF. \u201cBut the thing is, at the end of the day, no war in anger was ever won,\u201d she said, quoting her hit song. \u201cI do know that deep down in my heart, that I have to believe that we can love each other and always be kind, no matter what it takes in us. I believe that we can do that, no matter what.\u201d\n\nThings took an even more emotional turn later that night when Selena posted a note on her Instagram reflecting on her performance.\n\n\u201cTonight I felt extremely unauthentic, unconnected to both myself and my music. I\u2019ve never really felt like my materials, wardrobe or a video could define me. I act on a moment and fear that something hasn\u2019t happened. I\u2019m stagnant, I stay still and don\u2019t just sit with myself first and ask \u2018Is this where I am, whole heartedly?\u2019 I\u2019ve always told the truth. I\u2019m always true to my word, I\u2019ve shown who I am but I need to rethink some areas of my life creatively and personally.\u201d\n\nShe captioned the screenshot, \u201cnot being negative about anything I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m grateful for every single moment I get here \u2013 Indonesia you were LOUD and clearly inspiring. Love you so much.\u201d\n\nAUGUST 2017: SENDING A MESSAGE\n\nAhead of Taylor releasing her first single since Kim leaked a phone call between the \u201cShake It Off\u201d singer and Kanye on Snapchat, the reality star banned commenters from using the snake emoji on her Instagram. In the edited clips of the call, the pop star appeared to give the rapper her blessing for his \u201cFamous\u201d lyrics. But on Instagram, Taylor asserted that Kanye never told her he was going to call her \u201cthat bitch\u201d in the song. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe promised to play the song for me, but he never did.\u201d\n\nStill, haters flooded Taylor\u2019s social media pages with the reptile last summer.
