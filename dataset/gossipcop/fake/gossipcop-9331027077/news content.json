The Oscar-nominated actress recently took to Twitter to slam her Good Will Hunting co-star about his recent comments about sexual assault.\n\nIn the wake of the deluge of sexual misconduct accusations involving Harvey Weinstein and Ben Affleck, two men who Damon has worked closely with, the Downsizing actor spoke to Peter Travers on ABC on Thursday about the cloud of allegations hovering over Hollywood. He pointed out that the men being accused are being put into \u201cone big bucket\u201d and then said that there is a \u201cspectrum of behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cBoth of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right?\u201d\n\nRelated Story Commission On Sexual Harassment Formed By Hollywood Heavyweights; Anita Hill Will Chair\n\nWhen Driver received word of his comments, she took to Twitter saying, \u201cGod God, SERIOUSLY?\u201d From there, she did not hold back and continued to drag Damon and other men who share the same opinions.\n\n\u201cGosh it\u2019s so interesting how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem (profoundly unsurprising),\u201d she tweeted.\n\nGosh it\u2019s so *interesting how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem( *profoundly unsurprising) \u2014 Minnie Driver (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017\n\nThis was followed by an enormous amount of support from other women. In an interview with the Guardian, Driver said that she felt the need to say something and that men \u201ccannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse,\u201d continued Driver. \u201cA man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d\n\nOther women in Hollywood came forward to criticize Damon\u2019s clouded point of view including Alyssa Milano. In a series of tweets, Milano addressed Damon in a series of tweets saying that women are outraged \u201cbecause we were silenced for so long.\u201d She went on to compare sexual harassment, misconduct, assault, and violence to cancer saying that it is a \u201csystemic disease.\u201d She concluded, \u201cThe tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers.\u201d\n\nDear Matt Damon, It\u2019s the micro that makes the macro. (Thread) \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nWe are in a \u201cculture of outrage\u201d because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nI have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt. And they are all connected to a patriarchy intertwined with normalized, accepted\u2013even welcomed\u2013 misogyny. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nWe are not outraged because someone grabbed our asses in a picture. We are outraged because we were made to feel this was normal. We are outraged because we have been gaslighted. We are outraged because we were silenced for so long. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017\n\nThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer. \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/driver-damon-milano.jpg?w=650", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2Fminnie-driver-matt-damon-alyssa-milano-sexual-harassment-1202228942%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202228942&comment_count=51", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/driver-damon-milano.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dino-Ray Ramos"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/12/minnie-driver-matt-damon-alyssa-milano-sexual-harassment-1202228942/", "title": "Minnie Driver, Alyssa Milano Call Out Matt Damon For \u201cTone Deaf\u201d Comments About Sexual Assault", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Minnie Driver and Matt Damon are reconnecting \u2014 but it's under circumstances that could be better.
