Now, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the former co-stars used to be \u2018friends with benefits\u2019 but Jared wouldn\u2019t commit. Here\u2019s what we know!\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a better looking couple than Brangelina, but since Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, are officially over we have to open our minds to seeing her with someone else. And if that someone else is Jared Leto, 45, we\u2019re not mad at it.\n\nWe absolutely loved them in Alexander and who could forget Girl, Interrupted. But it tuns out these two shared more than just the screen. \u201cJared and Angelina had a very casual relationship years and years ago, it was a friends with benefits situation,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com\n\nSo, why didn\u2019t they ever get serious? According to our source Jared was just too much of a player. \u201cIt might have turned into more but Jared was too noncommittal at the time, he just wasn\u2019t ready to be with one woman, not even Angelina. Then Brad came on the scene and she fell in love and that was that. I know Jared always had regrets about letting her slip away.\u201d Yup, big mistake Jared. Huge.\n\nLuckily for the Suicide Squad hottie he may just be getting another shot with the world\u2019s most beautiful woman. \u201cJared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in Sep.,\u201d an insider told Star in the magazine\u2019s Feb. 27 issue. \u201cThe word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they\u2019ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.\u201d We can totally see these two as a couple.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Jared was a fool for not hanging on to Angelina the first time around? Do you think they\u2019ll get more serious this time? Or will he play her all over again?
