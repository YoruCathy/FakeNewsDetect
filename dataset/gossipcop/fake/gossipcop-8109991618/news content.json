Photo: Getty Images\n\nTwo years ago, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie dropped a bombshell: the Hollywood power couple was splitting up after two years of marriage but roughly 12 years together. What followed were months of back and forth between the (former) couple in the press. There were leaks about custody battles and Pitt\u2019s reported drinking and weed smoking; meanwhile, Pitt gave a candid interview with GQ about the split and his new passion for sculpture and R&B music.\n\nLast summer, there were a slew of new stories, court filings, and suspicious tabloid take-downs in this seemingly never-ending saga. But on Friday, a judge reportedly declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single \u2013 though their divorce settlement has not yet been finalized.\n\nHere, a look at all that has happened with Brangelina\u2019s divorce.\n\nFirst, can we look back at their \u2026 uh \u2026 happier \u2026 days?\n\nSure. The coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie is already Hollywood legend. The pair met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004 \u2014 back when Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston. Rumors about what may or may not have gone down between Pitt and Jolie on set ran rampant. Eventually, he and Aniston split up, and his relationship with Jolie (officially) came to light. But despite their, erm, salacious start, Pitt and Jolie proved to be the real deal. They were involved for 12 years, and had six kids and a French vineyard together.\n\nSo what went wrong?\n\nBack in September 2016, we learned that an \u201cincident\u201d reportedly went down on a private plane, and that the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services and FBI got involved. That \u201cincident,\u201d which reportedly involved Pitt and son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, is said to be what prompted Jolie to file for divorce. But in an interview with Vanity Fair in 2017, Jolie made it pretty clear she didn\u2019t want to talk on the record about what happened.\n\nAh, okay. But what\u2019s happened since then?\n\nWell, a lot. Just on the personal front, Pitt is said to have allegedly sobered up in rehab following the divorce announcement. He also was either involved or just friends with MIT professor Neri Oxman for a while (their exact relationship has always been unclear, despite making countless headlines). Jolie, meanwhile, has kept up with her humanitarian work for the United Nations. But divorce-wise, the Pitt and Jolie hadn\u2019t been able to agree on custody or child-support arrangements \u2014 which means they\u2019re still technically married.\n\nAwkward. So, what went down last summer?\n\nAs I said, Jolie and Pitt just couldn\u2019t seem to come to an understanding over custody or seemingly anything else tied to their split. The kids had been living in London as Jolie filmed in the U.K., though Pitt is still based in Los Angeles. Back in June, a judge established a schedule for Pitt to spend time with the kids (other than Maddox, who at 16 the court determined was old enough to decide if he wanted to see his dad or not). As a result, Jolie and the kids returned to Los Angeles.\n\nThen, over the summer of 2018, there were a ton of new stories about the couple. It was nearly impossible to keep all these threads straight, so we organized them for you in handy lists:\n\nJolie\u2019s lawyer drama:\n\n\u2022 In early August 2018, TMZ cited a \u201csource connected to Brad\u201d in reporting that Jolie has been so \u201chostile\u201d in the divorce proceedings that her allegedly fed-up attorney \u2014 celebrity divorce lawyer Laura Wasser \u2014 is quitting.\n\n\u2022 Then, Jolie\u2019s spokesperson denied TMZ\u2019s report to People, saying Wasser is not quitting \u201cnow or in the future. But an \u201cinsider\u201d did say the divorce was \u201centering a new phase.\u201d\n\n\u2022 By late August, Jolie confirmed that she was parting ways with Wasser. A spokesperson for Jolie, Mindy Nyby, told People in a statement: \u201cAngelina has decided to change counsel to Samantha Bley Dejean, as Samantha\u2019s expertise is the protection and best interest of children.\u201d Then, a \u201csource\u201d told People that Jolie picked the new attorney as the lead counsel in the case \u201ca month ago.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth about Pitt\u2019s child support payments:\n\n\u2022 In legal documents filed on August 7, Jolie\u2019s attorney claimed \u201cPitt has paid no meaningful child support since separation.\u201d Jolie also asked the court to order Pitt to pay her the money she is owed, CNN reports.\n\n\u2022 But that same day, a \u201csource\u201d told People that Pitt has actually paid \u201ceasily millions\u201d toward child support since the 2016 split.\n\n\u2022 Around that same time, documents obtained by the Daily Mail, Pitt said that he has paid more than $1.3 in \u201cbills\u201d for the children and loaned Jolie $8 million \u2014 and he wants to collect interest on the loan.\n\n\u2022 Jolie countered that a loan \u201cis not child support.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, the petty tabloid stories:\n\nA constant in the battle between Jolie and Pitt were the seemingly never-ending tabloid stories attacking one party at a time. Here are a select few:\n\n\u2022 \u201cPage Six\u201d reported on August 7 that a \u201csource\u201d close to Pitt slammed Jolie\u2019s child support filing as a \u201cpublicity stunt.\u201d\n\n\u2022 On August 15, Us Weekly had an \u201cexclusive\u201d on how Jolie is attacking Pitt because she knows joint custody is a \u201cdone deal.\u201d The story paints Pitt as the victim.\n\n\u2022 \u201cPage Six\u201d had a bizarre story on August 20 about how Jolie is jealous of Amal Clooney. It also says that the Clooneys have taken Pitt\u2019s side in the divorce battle. Hmmm \u2026\n\n\u2022 A \u201csource\u201d told Entertainment Tonight on August 23 that Pitt is \u201csickened\u201d that Jolie is letting their custody battle be aired in public.\n\n\u2022 Again, \u201cPage Six\u201d went for Jolie on August 25 \u2014 with a story about how she is not the \u201csaint\u201d she appears to be. Lainey Gossip points out that by now, it\u2019s clear how these stories about Jolie keep getting out.\n\nLuckily, they eventually reportedly reached a \u201ctruce,\u201d which sounds nice.\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported in September that Jolie and Pitt had a reached a \u201ctruce.\u201d A \u201csource\u201d told ET: \u201cBrad and Angelina actually set up a secret meeting at her house. It\u2019s the first time they have truly gotten together to make things work since their group therapy with the children. Brad and Angie\u2019s meeting was a success. They are going to stay with the plan set forth through the courts.\u201d This reportedly means that they are going to \u201ccreate a calmer situation for the kids.\u201d Good.\n\nThen, they headed to court in early December.\n\nAccording to TMZ, a custody hearing date has finally been set for Pitt and Jolie in early December in California. The former pair have reportedly filed docs asking a judge to give them until June to sort out the final details of their divorce (with the use of a private judge, who will also help them figure out the division of property), but on December 4, their custody trial is set to start. TMZ notes that Jolie still wants sole custody, while Pitt wants joint custody of their children. The trial will reportedly take two to three weeks.\n\nAnd now, they\u2019re both legally single (though not yet technically divorced).\n\nE! News reports that as of Friday, a judge has declared both Pitt and Jolie to be legally single. The judge issued a bifurcated judgment, according to The Blast, which means that their marriage is essentially over, even though they are still finalizing their divorce settlement and custody agreement.\n\nThis post has been updated throughout.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/08/08/08-brad-angelina.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/08/08/08-brad-angelina.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/08/08/08-brad-angelina.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Ryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-latest-news.html", "title": "What\u2019s Going on With Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s Divorce?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Are Officially Single", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2019/04/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce-latest-news.html", "description": "Although their divorce settlement has yet to be finalized.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/08/08/08-brad-angelina.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Are Officially Single", "description": "Although their divorce settlement has yet to be finalized.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/08/08/08-brad-angelina.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@lisarya", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-04-15T09:16:00.000-04:00", "tag": "brangelina divorce, culture, celebrity, brad pitt, angelina jolie", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split two years ago, but news stories about their divorce and custody problems continue to come out.
