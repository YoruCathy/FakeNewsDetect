I really liked playing Warhammer, but I never actually figured out the rules. I just made up my own. So I never played with anybody else, because I was playing by my own rules. I was alone a lot.\"\n\nPattinson starred alongside on-screen and ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart [Bella Swan] in the popular vampire saga, and whilst he enjoyed doing the first film because he was able to \"create his own footprint\" with his alter ego, the four subsequent movies made him want to \"break out\" of doing the same character.\n\nIn an interview with Deadline, he recently said: \"When I came to doing the first 'Twilight', I actually felt I had a lot more control over my performance, because I didn't really realize what it was. And that was because of Catherine Hardwicke, as well - she made it so malleable, which it can be when nobody knows what something is.\n\n\"I really liked doing all of those films, but on the first one I definitely felt like, because we hadn't set the footprint for the thing ... I feel like, as soon as you set a footprint your instinct immediately is to want to break out of it, and you can't. There are too many reasons you can't just throw it all up in the air. The only hard thing about doing that series was doing the sequels.\"", "images": ["https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/8038293-robert-pattinson-was-a-dork-growing-up/", "title": "Robert Pattinson was a dork growing up", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 200654546635181}, "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Robert Pattinson admitted he was a", "og": {"title": "Robert Pattinson was a dork growing up", "url": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/8038293-robert-pattinson-was-a-dork-growing-up/", "description": "Robert Pattinson admitted he was a \\", "type": "Article", "site_name": "BramptonGuardian.com", "image": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/Contents/Images/Communities/Brampton_1200x630.png"}, "article": {"section": "WhatsOn-Celebrity", "published_time": "2018-01-05T12:00:06Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-05T13:37:22Z"}, "parsely-title": "Robert Pattinson was a dork growing up", "parsely-link": "https://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/8038293-robert-pattinson-was-a-dork-growing-up/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "http://media.zuza.com/5/1/51b62829-01a0-4a87-9a26-4d88799aca90/BS2BS1508470_Image1_Thumbnail.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-01-05T12:00:06Z", "parsely-section": "whatson|celebrity", "parsely-tags": "subcategory:whatson|celebrity,category:whatson,news_source:bangshowbiz,primary_publication:bramptonguardian,video:no,images:1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Communities/bramptonguardian/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515153606.0, "source": "http://www.bramptonguardian.com", "summary": ""}
