This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nHello right back to you, Julia!\n\nAnd if just seeing her causes you to fall in love with her cashmere sweater, you can pick one up from Chinti & Parker for a mere $425.\n\nOver the years, Roberts has actively shunned social media; in 2013 she told Marie Claire that it was like \"cotton candy: it looks so appealing and you can't resist getting in there, and then you just end up with sticky fingers and it lasted an instant.\"\n\nShe also doesn't Google herself. That same year she told E! News she worries what she'd find online. \"I have too much potential for collapse,\" she said. \"There's an anonymity that makes people safe to participate in hatefulness. I like a good old-fashioned fistfight if people are pissed off at each other.\"\n\nWell, we're glad to see Roberts has joined the fray \u2014 in whatever capacity!\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201704/x_tdy_OV_STYL_JULIAROBERTS_170419-02.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201806/tdy_pop_klg_chat_insta_180628_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_26/1349320/julia-roberts-today-tease-180628_ac55fe1cdf60700251e21cfb61dab34d.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_26/1349320/julia-roberts-today-tease-180628_ac55fe1cdf60700251e21cfb61dab34d.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/julia-roberts-joins-instagram-simple-message-love-t132079", "title": "Julia Roberts joins Instagram with a simple message of love", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/julia-roberts-joins-instagram-simple-message-love-t132079", "title": "Hello, Julia Roberts!
