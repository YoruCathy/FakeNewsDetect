Soon after, she writes, he got married, and \u2018I couldn\u2019t help but think that his wife had a similar body type to me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat sparked buzz that the unnamed rapper was West \u2014 now married to curvy reality queen Kim Kardashian.\n\nBut rap fans may have to keep guessing.\n\nA pal of Kanye\u2019s shot down any such rumors by telling us: \u201cThat is not within the realm of possibility.\u201d Lepore did not get back to us to confirm or deny the identity of the rapper of her alleged \u201cassignation.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for West responded that the rapper has never met Lepore, and has never even heard of her.\n\nMeanwhile, West is also being talked about in the Hamptons this week. A year ago, it was announced that he\u2019d perform a special piece at the arty Watermill Center Summer Benefit & Auction with its influential artistic director Robert Wilson \u2014 but it was pulled last minute, and Ja Rule filled in.\n\nAt the time, a source explained to us that West couldn\u2019t attend because \u201cit was all too last-minute.\u201d\n\nAnd reps for the event added, \u201cRobert Wilson and Kanye West have made an artistic decision to postpone their collaboration\u201d until 2017.\n\nBut an updated tip sheet for this year\u2019s benefit, which takes place July 29, went out Thursday with no mention of West. The benefit this year will honor French star Isabelle Huppert and late rocker Lou Reed, with a performance of a \u201cpoem with musical accompaniment\u201d by Reed\u2019s widow, Laurie Anderson.\n\nA Watermill rep explained of West\u2019s absence: \u201cWith the decision to make this year\u2019s benefit a tribute to Lou Reed, it was natural curatorial progression to highlight a special performance by our honoree Laurie Anderson.\u201d\n\nWest has kept a low profile since his breakdown last year.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/lepore-kanye.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/lepore-kanye.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/lepore-kanye.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/07/20/was-kanye-involved-with-amanda-lepore-before-kim-k/", "title": "Was Kanye involved with Amanda Lepore before Kim K.?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
