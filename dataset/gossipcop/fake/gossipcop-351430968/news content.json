She will be an amazing mother.\n\n\u2018Meghan will get pregnant in her first year of marriage if she can. For certain she will be trying for a baby on their honeymoon \u2013 she is going to be a brilliant mum.\n\nErin Specht\n\n\u2018Having a family is going to be a priority for her in their first year of marriage. She also has the pressure of being a royal now as well!\n\n\u2018But being a mum is something which she really wants and she has all the perfect qualities. Patience, kindness and a wonderful nature. And she is just great with kids already.\u2019\n\nErin reveals that she\u2019s seen Meghan\u2019s beautiful and intuitive maternal side in person, impressed as she watched the actress play with her young nephews Ty and TJ.\n\n\u2018She was great with them, playing games, running around,\u2019 Erin tells New Idea. \u2018She was a teenager at the time. They adored her and she was clearly a great aunty. She has a good heart.\u2019\n\nWhile Erin says Meghan has always loved children, it\u2019s only since meeting Harry that she\u2019s had her heart set on becoming a mum.\n\nThe actress was married to film producer Trevor Engelson for two years, but Erin says it wasn\u2019t the time to start a family.\n\n\u2018He just wasn\u2019t the right man for her \u2013 when you know you know,\u2019 Erin says. \u2018And then being a mum was not something she talked about really when they were together.\n\n\u2018She said she wanted a family, but never in the way she wanted it now. I think she knew it wasn\u2019t right at that time, which is why she concentrated on work.\n\n\u2018Now she is with the right person. She really wants a family and Harry is perfect for her.\n\nThey are going to be great parents together.\u2019 Erin \u2013 who dated Meghan\u2019s brother Tom for 16 years \u2013 says she first met Meghan at Easter in 2001 at a family gathering, just after she started dating the royal-to-be\u2019s brother, commenting that she was immediately struck by her poise and grace.\n\n\u2018Meghan was sweet and kind and had a lovely graceful manner about her,\u2019 says Erin, adding that the former Suits actress was immediately drawn to her pet bunnies.\n\n\u2018I kind of go by how my animals react to people. She had all the bunnies sitting out here with her nephews. You know when somebody naturally mothers something?\n\n\u2018You could just feel someone, feel their heart, their nurturing, their cuddling.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s that nurturing spirit that is sure to make Meghan a wonderful royal mum, says Erin \u2013 and an even better \u201cpeople\u2019s princess\u201d.\n\n\u2018The royal family is lucky to have her,\u2019 Erin says of Meghan.\n\n\u2018She absolutely could be more popular than Diana.\n\n\u2018Meghan is just a normal, everyday person who\u2019s gotten to live a fairytale \u2013 not because she chased that or made it, it just came true for her.\n\n\u2018It couldn\u2019t have happened to a better person.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23888/meghan-markle-prince-harry-1.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23888/meghan-markle-prince-harry-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/meghan-markle-prince-harry-expecting-a-baby-erin-specht", "title": "Meghan and Harry: We're having a baby already!", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Kensington Palace is preparing to hear the pitter patter of royal feet, with confirmation a baby is on the way for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.", "news_keywords": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Prince Harry wedding, Meghan Markle wedding, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle royal baby, Meghan Markle pregnant, royal baby, royal baby news, latest royal baby, Meghan Markle pregnancy, pregnancy, the royal family, royal family news, latest royal family news, Meghan Markle baby, Prince Harry dad, Prince Harry to be a dad, pregnant royal, royal preganancy announcement", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/meghan-markle-prince-harry-expecting-a-baby-erin-specht", "title": "Meghan and Harry: We're having a baby already!", "description": "Kensington Palace is preparing to hear the pitter patter of royal feet, with confirmation a baby is on the way for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23888/meghan-markle-prince-harry-1.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 800}}, "twitter": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle reportedly having a baby", "description": "Kensington Palace is preparing to hear the pitter patter of royal feet, with confirmation a baby is on the way for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23888/meghan-markle-prince-harry-1.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/meghan-markle-prince-harry-expecting-a-baby-erin-specht"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520194058.942, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
