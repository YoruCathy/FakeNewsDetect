The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.\n\nBefore the show, she posted a video on her Instagram, in which she learned how to style a hijab and expressed her desire to wear it traditionally. \u201cI think it needs [to be] a little bit more tighter in the [back]. I don\u2019t want it to come off and show too much,\u201d the once risqu\u00e9 woman told her hijab-tutor in the video.\n\nPhoto: BBC News\n\nWhen someone suggested she switch wrapping styles so she could wear it as tight as she wanted, she said she wanted \u201cto do traditional Saudi wrap. \u2026 That\u2019s what I\u2019d rather learn to do so I know. \u2026 I want to learn how to do it properly.\u201d This could be because she\u2019s set to film an all-female movie in Saudi Arabia. She then told the woman that she had been living in Dubai for three years.\n\nShe also posted a video from the fashion show and spoke to BBC Minute about modest apparel. \u201cFashion doesn\u2019t always have to be so naked and can be adventurous and still beautiful, with a strong group of women behind it,\u201d Lohan said.\n\nNot only did she wear the right clothing, she also wore the right makeup. According to halal/vegetarian/vegan makeup retailer HawaCosmetics, Lohan stopped by their booth and told them about \u201chow she\u2019s into halal cosmetics and what she\u2019s actually wearing on her face today was all halal!!\u201d according to their social media post. They were referencing the Muslim diet and referring to avoiding non-halal makeup.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nLohan\u2019s efforts to respect Muslim traditions are getting mixed reactions. Some people really into this look were impressed by her interest, including the designers.\n\n@lindsaylohan is getting fitted for a hijab on her insta live right now and I am LIVING #Traditional \u2014 Evan \u2615\ufe0fBlackWhite (@EvBenjamin) February 17, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we deep, a whole fabulous @lindsaylohan repping at London Modest Fashion week @HauteElan!

One user accused Lohan of \u201cnormalizing Islamic misogyny.\u201d\n\nSince when did promoting oppressive articles of clothing become a thing?

Lifestyle. She gives the actress credit for exploring another religion. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually pretty cool that she is touching this part of the Islamic faith. If she wants to wear it, even if it\u2019s occasionally, that\u2019s her personal choice, I don\u2019t see what the issue is,\u201d the Muslim mom stated. \u201cShe\u2019s expressed her interest in Islam and perhaps wants to experience the Hijab aspect of it and that\u2019s kind of a no-brainer. So many Muslim women and those studying Islam take this step in their spiritual journey as Hijab is a pivotal part of a Muslim women\u2019s identity. It\u2019s just unfortunate her journey has to be so scrutinized and watched by the thousands since she\u2019s a public figure.\u201d\n\nWhile LiLo does love to shock, anyone who\u2019s been following her shouldn\u2019t be that surprised. She expressed an interest in Islam before this. She changed her Instagram bio in January to \u201cSalam Aleikum,\u201d a standard greeting among Muslims. \u201cIn Islamic culture, I feel like it\u2019s a family to me, a lot of my friends are Arab, and they\u2019ve been really good people to me,\u201d she said in an interview on Good Morning Britain in 2017.\n\nLohan also told Piers Morgan about the time she got stopped at an airport while wearing a headscarf. She referred to it as the first time she was \u201cracially profiled.\u201d She had to remove her headscarf, and while she was OK with that, she was still shaken. \u201cWhat scared me was, in that moment, how would another woman who doesn\u2019t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I mean, I was kind of in shock,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen pressed about her interest in the religion, she said she had a soft spot for Islam. \u201cI do study it, nothing is confirmed yet\u2026\u201d she said of converting.\n\nThe actress went to Turkey in 2016 to visit with Syrian refugees and was spotted wearing a floral headscarf. Then there was the time she hit the beach in Thailand wearing a burkini.\n\nAnd she sparked rumors that she\u2019d be designing her own hijabs in 2017 when she posted a black-and-white photo of herself wearing one, with a caption reading, \u201cNew Fashion Line coming soon \u2026. #fashion.\u201d The post has since vanished, as have any signs of her hijab fashion line.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NVY_LtEPYZX9BHpdgjy6BA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYAoOl8ruQ.KVh_RyqA9_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/p7mhKIwKAg.NBKGJyIB9yg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE2NjtoPTQ4/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/aa5a87b0-7e4e-11ea-bdfd-b9950c4c15e2", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_life_en-US_h_p_lifev2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_life_en-US_h_w_lifev2.png"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYAoOl8ruQ.KVh_RyqA9_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lindsay-lohan-wears-hijab-social-media-mixed-feelings-214247444.html", "title": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media", "meta_data": {"description": "The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.", "og": {"description": "The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.", "site_name": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media", "title": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/lindsay-lohan-wears-hijab-social-media-mixed-feelings-214247444.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYAoOl8ruQ.KVh_RyqA9_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "width": 1200, "height": 800}}, "keywords": "Lindsay Lohan, modest fashion, fashion show, hijab", "oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Lindsay Lohan, modest fashion, fashion show, hijab", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=488be383-c829-3dd5-aa41-2c05b7f6d290&src=web", "twitter": {"title": "Lindsay Lohan wears a hijab, sparking mixed feelings on social media", "description": "The actress attended the second annual London Modest Fashion Week over the weekend, and she dressed the part.", "site": "@Yahoo", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYAoOl8ruQ.KVh_RyqA9_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kYAoOl8ruQ.KVh_RyqA9_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mZrYtn7olE.DESwWdKiddQ--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/0aa169ed2fda44bb5ebd0c655f834dbc"}, "player": {"identifier": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle-news/lindsay-lohan-wears-hijab-sparking-173401893.html?format=embed&region=us&lang=en-US&site=lifestyle&player_autoplay=1&expName=y20", "width": 500, "height": 281}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=488be383-c829-3dd5-aa41-2c05b7f6d290&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=488be383-c829-3dd5-aa41-2c05b7f6d290&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDpwcE9ylZU?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
