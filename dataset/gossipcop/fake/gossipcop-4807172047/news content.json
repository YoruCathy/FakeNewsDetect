Take a look back at their relationship over the years right here!\n\n\u201cSelena and Justin know better than to pay any attention to rumors about them and their relationship, they\u2019re used to people constantly speculating and they just ignore it,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cTheir relation is very important to them, and they share very traditional values when it comes to family and children, so they want to make sure they have a stable and committed home life together.

And in return, she is totally down to support him at his hockey games, his dad\u2019s wedding, and everything else important in his life. They are doing everything together and things are really working this time around.\u201d So cute!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you loving these juicy details as much as us?!
