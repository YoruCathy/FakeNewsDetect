Network declined to offer the couple another season of their reality show Rob & Chyna due to their relationship being \u2018beyond repair\u2019.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Chyna was paid \u2018$92,500 for every 60 minute episode and $112,350 for every 90 minute episode in which she appeared\u2019.\n\nHe also claims that she then trashed the house,which he was renting from his sister Kylie Jenner and which was documented on a later episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nIn the documents he alleges that she broke a door, damaged the walls, destroyed cell phones, damaged a TV \u2013 and perhaps most upsetting of all, smashed a gingerbread house that had been created for the Christmas holidays.\n\nKylie is also a plaintiff on the lawsuit Picture: Valerie Macon/Getty Images for Taste of Beverly Hills)\n\nIn the same lawsuit, Kylie has reportedly estimated the damage to the house was in excess of $100,000 (\u00a374,000) and is also suing Chyna for the costs.\n\nThe suggested attack took place in December but four months later it was discussed on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians in which Kylie said: \u2018My mum calls me and apparently Chyna threw something at my television.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a little disrespectful and I wouldn\u2019t do that to someone else\u2019s home.\u2019\n\nThe pair split in July 2017 after months of unrest between the two.\n\nRob revealed the split by going on an a furious Instagram rant about his ex, and mother of his child, in which he shared Chyna\u2019s alleged new man\u2019s phone number and claimed that Rob had paid $100,000 for weight loss surgery after she welcomed her baby Dream.\n\nHe also accused her of cheating in their home and shared explicit photos that she had privately shared with Rob.\n\nChyna later won a temporary restraining order against Rob; in the order he was barred from any further cyberbullying of Chyna, including posting photos or videos of her, or making any personal comments about her.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Rob for comment. Chyna\u2019s rep declined to comment.\n\nMORE: Amber Rose calls Rob Kardashian a \u2018f***boy\u2019 over Blac Chyna revenge porn\n\nMORE: Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna \u2018still haven\u2019t
