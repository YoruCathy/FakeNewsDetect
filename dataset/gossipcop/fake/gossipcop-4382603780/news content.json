much for my attempted photobomb,\u201d he captioned the photo, adding the hashtags #HiMyName IsAlex and #TrustMeIAmBackThere.\n\nEarlier this month, sources close to the couple told PEOPLE exclusively the duo are planning a long-term future together.\n\n\u201cAll the kids want Jennifer and Alex to get married,\u201d a Lopez source told PEOPLE exclusively. \u201cThere are definitely talks about
