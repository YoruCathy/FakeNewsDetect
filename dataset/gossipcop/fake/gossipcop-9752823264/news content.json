Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton\u2018s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa\u2019s dress than Kate\u2019s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.\n\nSince then, Pippa\u2019s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride \u2013 and in this particular circumstance, it\u2019s almost a given that it will happen to her.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry\u2019s friend\u2019s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry\u2019s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she\u2019s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.\n\nSources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, \u201cShe saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan\u2019s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.\u201d\n\nAccording to the same source, Pippa is now employing a \u201cno ring, no guest\u201d policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses \u2013 which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it\u2019s Prince Harry we\u2019re talking about, you think he wouldn\u2019t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law\u2019s wedding, given that he took her to a friend\u2019s wedding?\n\nWhat do you guys think?
