Mariah Carey\u2019s old mirrors have all been thrown in the trash and replaced with new \u201cskinny\u201d mirrors that make her look 20 pounds lighter, an insider exclusively tells In Touch.\n\n\u201cShe loves them and spends hours looking at her reflection,\u201d the source says of the 48-year-old pop star, who was recently attacked for her weight earlier this summer after flaunting a much filler figure at a concert in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201c[Mariah] has been in a much better mood\u201d since the mirrors were installed, the insider continues, adding that the Grammy winner is \u201cvery much in denial about her weight right now.\u201d But TBH, if skinny mirrors make Mimi feel better, then more power to her!\n\nMariah Carey in a photo from February 2017 (left) and at Caesars Palace on July 18.

than her performance. \u201cSome audience members immediately started whispering about her appearance \u2014 her costumes were incredibly revealing and tight,\u201d a witness exclusively told In Touch at the time. \u201cShe looked bigger all over, but Mariah was flaunting every curve.\u201d\n\nThe body shamers were ruthless, too. \u201cOne audience member said she looked like a sausage encased in glitter,\u201d said the witness, \u201cand others were saying she needs to change her clothes.\u201d Social media haters were even more cutthroat. \u201cShe\u2019s a big fat lump,\u201d one commenter wrote, while another compared the Glitter actress to a sumo wrestler. \u201cI feel sorry for those dancers who have to pick her up.\u201d\n\nMariah\u2019s weight is obviously a touchy subject these days \u2014 and her entourage knows to never bring it up around her. \u201cNo one on her team would dare tell her that an outfit is too snug or that she should lay off the late-night cocktails, sweets and refrigerator raids,\u201d an insider previously told In Touch. \u201cIf they did, they\u2019d be looking for a new job.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on
