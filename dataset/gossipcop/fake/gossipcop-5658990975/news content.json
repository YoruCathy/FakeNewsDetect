Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise\u2019s 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he\u2019s still struggling to salvage what\u2019s left of his marriage.\n\nThe Enquirer\u2019s source claimed at the beginning of 2017, \u201cRachel and Daniel haven\u2019t been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.\u201d The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in \u2018554 days\u2019.\n\nAccording to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple\u2019s rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York\u2019s Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, \u201cThe whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don\u2019t buy it for a minute.\u201d\n\nWhen you consider Daniel Craig\u2019s own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, \u201cBeing on your own would be sad, sick, and weird. I don\u2019t trust myself. I need that balance.\u201d If these reports are to be believed, then Daniel Craig previously turned down starring in more Bond films to spend time with his family, but now \u2013 all of a sudden \u2013 he\u2019s back to working on James Bond?\n\nEither the report was never accurate to begin with, or he\u2019s giving up on his marriage to Rachel Weisz. One would hope that the two have worked out whatever was troubling them in the first place, but given their own relationship and marriage histories \u2013 and how they\u2019ve both jumped ship on long-term relationships at the drop of a hat \u2013 one wouldn\u2019t be faulted for assuming that they are on their way to getting a divorce.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz having marriage troubles, and is Daniel\u2019s decision to take on the role of 007 again an indication that he\u2019s giving up on his marriage? Or just a chance to have more career stability and/or cash in on a major paycheck?
