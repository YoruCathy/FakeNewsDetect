Simpson has the hots for Kris Jenner. The former NFL star is currently serving time in prison for armed robbery and battery but his time in prison is possibly coming to an end. Now that O.J. is about to be up for a parole and a new report claims he wants to date the famous momager because he\u2019s \u201calways had a crush on her.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s supposedly been pining for her while behind bars and his crush goes back 30 years. \u201cO.J. has had a crush on Kris forever,\u201d Ian Halperin, author of Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America\u2019s Royal Family told The Sun. \u201cHe believes the relationship that Kris is in now with Corey Gamble is a sham. He believes he is the man for her and intends to pursue her when he gets out of prison,\u201d Halperin continued. \u201cThere is definitely a long history there.\u201d But the report claims that is O.J. is unable to date Kris, he wants to date Caitlyn Jenner! \u201cO.J. is obsessed with Caitlyn,\u201d he claims. \u201cHe is struck by how she has captured the hearts of the world and said with a straight face, \u2018When I get out of here I would consider dating her too\u2019.\u201d\n\nBut it also turns out that O.J. has his sights set on KUWTK! \u201cO.J. definitely has a plan when he gets out of prison and he intends to be around the Kardashians,\u201d Ian said. \u201cHe is going to pitch to them about getting a spot on the show. He is broke, he needs money and he feels his only chance to get back on TV \u2014 which is his dream \u2014 is to hook up with his old \u2018family.\u2019\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think O.J. has a chance with Kris?", "images": ["http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kris-jenner-oj-simpson-dating-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/chloe.png?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2016%2F04%2F19%2Foj-simpson-wants-to-date-kris-jenner%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2066453&comment_count=9", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kris-jenner-oj-simpson-dating-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kris-jenner-oj-simpson-dating-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Melas", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2016/04/19/oj-simpson-wants-to-date-kris-jenner/", "title": "O.J.
