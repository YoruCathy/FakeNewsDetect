Maybe you should've said no deal to that fugly hat, nahmean?\"\"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nAnyway, it all sounds very far-fetched, but this isn't the first report we've heard that Kate and Meg aren't exactly beasties:\n\n\"Kate feels like Meghan has barely made any effort with her and is more interested in impressing [Queen Elizabeth],\u201d a source recently told some tabloid called Closer Weekly.\n\n\"Kate feels left out. She spent years working on her image as 'the perfect royal,' and Meghan is stealing her thunder,\"\n\nYes, a real feud might be taking place among the duchesses.\n\nIf only we could convince them to star in a reality show about their classy beef.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--31Qp5QLn--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1519849741/markle-and-middleton.jpg"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--31Qp5QLn--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1519849741/markle-and-middleton.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/06/kate-middleton-trash-talks-meghan-markle-daily-report/", "title": "Kate Middleton Trash-Talks Meghan Markle Daily (Report)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/06/kate-middleton-trash-talks-meghan-markle-daily-report/", "title": "Kate Middleton Trash-Talks Meghan Markle Daily (Report)", "description": "Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton are reportedly not getting along.
