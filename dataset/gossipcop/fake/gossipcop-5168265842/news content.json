For her self-titled album, see Beyonc\u00e9 (album)\n\nAmerican singer, songwriter, producer, and actress\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter ( bee-YON-say; born September 4, 1981)[5] is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, dancer and actress. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyonc\u00e9 performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. She rose to fame in the late 1990s as the lead singer of Destiny's Child, one of the best-selling girl groups of all time.\n\nDuring Destiny's Child's hiatus, Beyonc\u00e9 made her theatrical film debut with a role in the US box-office number-one Austin Powers in Goldmember (2002) and recorded her first solo album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. It also featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\". Following the disbandment of Destiny's Child in 2006, she released her second solo album, B'Day, which contained the US number-one single \"Irreplaceable\", as well as the UK number-one singles \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" and \"Beautiful Liar\". Beyonc\u00e9 continued her acting career with starring roles in The Pink Panther (2006), Dreamgirls (2006), and Obsessed (2009). Her marriage to rapper Jay-Z and her portrayal of Etta James in Cadillac Records (2008) influenced her third album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008), which earned a record-setting six Grammy Awards in 2010. It spawned the UK number-one single \"If I Were a Boy\" and the US number-one single \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\".\n\nAfter splitting from her manager and father Mathew Knowles in 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 released 4 (2011), which was influenced by 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul. Beyonc\u00e9 received widespread critical acclaim for her albums, Beyonc\u00e9 (2013) and Lemonade (2016); the latter became the world's best-selling album of 2016. She became the first and only music act in Billboard 200 chart history to debut at number one with their first six solo studio albums.[6] In 2018, she released Everything Is Love, a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z, as the Carters.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide.[7] Her success during the 2000s was recognized with the Recording Industry Association of America's Top Certified Artist of the Decade, as well as Billboard magazine's Top Radio Songs Artist and the Top Female Artist of the Decade.[8][9] Beyonc\u00e9 is the most nominated woman in the Grammy Award's history, with a total of 24 wins.[10] She is also the most awarded artist at the MTV Video Music Awards, with 24 wins, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.[11][12] In 2014, she became the highest-paid black musician in history and was listed among Time's 100 most influential people in the world for a second year in a row.[13] Forbes ranked her as the most powerful female in entertainment on their 2015 and 2017 lists. She occupied the sixth place for Time's Person of the Year in 2016,[14] and in 2020, was named one of the 100 women who defined the last century by the same publication.[15] Beyonc\u00e9 was also included on Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's 100 Women list in 2019, for her contributions to the entertainment industry's history.[16]\n\nLife and career\n\n1981\u20131996: Early life\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles was born in Houston, Texas, to Celestine \"Tina\" Knowles (n\u00e9e Beyinc\u00e9), a hairdresser and salon owner, and Mathew Knowles, a Xerox sales manager.[17] Beyonc\u00e9's name is a tribute to her mother's maiden name.[18] Beyonc\u00e9's younger sister Solange is also a singer and a former backup dancer for Destiny's Child. Solange and Beyonc\u00e9 are the first sisters to have both had No. 1 albums.[19] Mathew is African American, and Tina is of Louisiana Creole descent (African, Native American, and French).[18][20][21] Through her mother, Beyonc\u00e9 is a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard.[20] Beyonc\u00e9 attended St. Mary's Montessori School in Houston, where she enrolled in dance classes. Her singing talent was discovered when dance instructor Darlette Johnson began humming a song and she finished it, able to hit the high-pitched notes.[22] Beyonc\u00e9's interest in music and performing continued after winning a school talent show at age seven, singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" to beat 15/16-year-olds.[23][24] In fall of 1990, Beyonc\u00e9 enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she would perform with the school's choir. She also attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts[26] and later Alief Elsik High School.[18][27] Beyonc\u00e9 was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church as a soloist for two years.[28]\n\nWhen Beyonc\u00e9 was eight, she and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while at an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[29] They were placed into a group called Girl's Tyme with three other girls, and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston.[30] After seeing the group, R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search, the largest talent show on national TV at the time. Girl's Tyme failed to win, and Beyonc\u00e9 later said the song they performed was not good.[31][32] In 1995 Beyonc\u00e9's father resigned from his job to manage the group.[33] The move reduced Beyonc\u00e9's family's income by half, and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments.[18] Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups.[29] The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records, moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording, only to be cut by the company.[18] This put further strain on the family, and Beyonc\u00e9's parents separated. On October 5, 1995, Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group. In 1996, the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music, the Knowles family reunited, and shortly after, the group got a contract with Columbia Records.[23]\n\n1997\u20132002: Destiny's Child\n\nThe group changed their name to Destiny's Child in 1996, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[34] In 1997, Destiny's Child released their major label debut song \"Killing Time\" on the soundtrack to the 1997 film, Men in Black.[32] The following year, the group released their self-titled debut album,[31] scoring their first major hit \"No, No, No\". The album established the group as a viable act in the music industry, with moderate sales and winning the group three Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards for Best R&B/Soul Album of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap New Artist, and Best R&B/Soul Single for \"No, No, No\". The group released their Multi-Platinum second album The Writing's on the Wall in 1999. The record features some of the group's most widely known songs such as \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", the group's first number-one single, \"Jumpin' Jumpin'\" and \"Say My Name\", which became their most successful song at the time, and would remain one of their signature songs. \"Say My Name\" won the Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and the Best R&B Song at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards.[29] The Writing's on the Wall sold more than eight million copies worldwide.[31] During this time, Beyonc\u00e9 recorded a duet with Marc Nelson, an original member of Boyz II Men, on the song \"After All Is Said and Done\" for the soundtrack to the 1999 film, The Best Man.[35]\n\nLeToya Luckett and Roberson became unhappy with Mathew's managing of the band and eventually were replaced by Farrah Franklin and Michelle Williams.[29] Beyonc\u00e9 experienced depression following the split with Luckett and Roberson after being publicly blamed by the media, critics, and blogs for its cause.[36] Her long-standing boyfriend left her at this time.[37] The depression was so severe it lasted for a couple of years, during which she occasionally kept herself in her bedroom for days and refused to eat anything.[38] Beyonc\u00e9 stated that she struggled to speak about her depression because Destiny's Child had just won their first Grammy Award, and she feared no one would take her seriously.[39] Beyonc\u00e9 would later speak of her mother as the person who helped her fight it.[38] Franklin was then dismissed, leaving just Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Williams.\n\nThe remaining band members recorded \"Independent Women Part I\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 2000 film Charlie's Angels. It became their best-charting single, topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks.[29] In early 2001, while Destiny's Child was completing their third album, Beyonc\u00e9 landed a major role in the MTV made-for-television film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring alongside American actor Mekhi Phifer. Set in Philadelphia, the film is a modern interpretation of the 19th-century opera Carmen by French composer Georges Bizet.[41] When the third album Survivor was released in May 2001, Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit claiming that the songs were aimed at them.[29] The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 663,000 copies sold.[42] The album spawned other number-one hits, \"Bootylicious\" and the title track, \"Survivor\", the latter of which earned the group a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.[43] After releasing their holiday album 8 Days of Christmas in October 2001, the group announced a hiatus to further pursue solo careers.[29]\n\nIn July 2002, Beyonc\u00e9 made her theatrical film debut, playing Foxxy Cleopatra alongside Mike Myers in the comedy film Austin Powers in Goldmember,[44] which spent its first weekend atop the US box office and grossed $73 million.[45] Beyonc\u00e9 released \"Work It Out\" as the lead single from its soundtrack album which entered the top ten in the UK, Norway, and Belgium.[46] In 2003, Beyonc\u00e9 starred opposite Cuba Gooding, Jr., in the musical comedy The Fighting Temptations as Lilly, a single mother with whom Gooding's character falls in love.[47] The film received mixed reviews from critics but grossed $30 million in the U.S.[48][49] Beyonc\u00e9 released \"Fighting Temptation\" as the lead single from the film's soundtrack album, with Missy Elliott, MC Lyte, and Free which was also used to promote the film.[50] Another of Beyonc\u00e9's contributions to the soundtrack, \"Summertime\", fared better on the US charts.[51]\n\n2003\u20132005: Dangerously in Love and Destiny Fulfilled\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's first solo recording was a feature on Jay-Z's \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" that was released in October 2002, peaking at number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart.[53] Her first solo album Dangerously in Love was released on June 24, 2003, after Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland had released their solo efforts.[54] The album sold 317,000 copies in its first week, debuted atop the Billboard 200,[55] and has since sold 11 million copies worldwide.[56] The album's lead single, \"Crazy in Love\", featuring Jay-Z, became Beyonc\u00e9's first number-one single as a solo artist in the US.[57] The single \"Baby Boy\" also reached number one,[52] and singles, \"Me, Myself and I\" and \"Naughty Girl\", both reached the top-five.[58] The album earned Beyonc\u00e9 a then record-tying five awards at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards; Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for \"Dangerously in Love 2\", Best R&B Song and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Crazy in Love\", and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for \"The Closer I Get to You\" with Luther Vandross.

However, this was put on hold so she could concentrate on recording Destiny Fulfilled, the final studio album by Destiny's Child.[62] Released on November 15, 2004, in the US[63] and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200,[64][65] Destiny Fulfilled included the singles \"Lose My Breath\" and \"Soldier\", which reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[66] Destiny's Child embarked on a worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin' It sponsored by McDonald's Corporation,[67] and performed hits such as \"No, No, No\", \"Survivor\", \"Say My Name\", \"Independent Women\" and \"Lose My Breath\".

It turned out to be a one-hour film which aired on HBO exactly a week later; a corresponding album with the same title was released on the same day exclusively on Tidal.[176] Lemonade debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Beyonc\u00e9 the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013.[177] With all 12 tracks of Lemonade debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Beyonc\u00e9 also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time.[178] Additionally, Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history.[179] It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the US with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country[180] as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.[181] In June 2019, Lemonade was certified 3\u00d7 Platinum, having sold up to 3 million album-equivalent units in the United States alone.[182]\n\nLemonade became her most critically acclaimed work to date, receiving universal acclaim according to Metacritic, a website collecting reviews from professional music critics.[183] Several music publications included the album among the best of 2016, including Rolling Stone, which listed Lemonade at number one.[184] The album's visuals were nominated in 11 categories at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards, the most ever received by Beyonc\u00e9 in a single year, and went on to win 8 awards, including Video of the Year for \"Formation\".[185][186] The eight wins made Beyonc\u00e9 the most awarded artist in the history of the VMAs (24), surpassing Madonna (20).[187] Beyonc\u00e9 occupied the sixth place for Time magazine's 2016 Person of the Year.[188]\n\nIn January 2017, it was announced that Beyonc\u00e9 would headline the Coachella Music and Arts Festival. This would make Beyonc\u00e9 only the second female headliner of the festival since it was founded in 1999.[189] It was later announced on February 23, 2017 that Beyonc\u00e9 would no longer be able to perform at the festival due to doctor's concerns regarding her pregnancy. The festival owners announced that she will instead headline the 2018 festival.[190] Upon the announcement of Beyonc\u00e9's departure from the festival lineup, ticket prices dropped by 12%.[191]\n\nAt the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017, Lemonade led the nominations with nine, including Album, Record, and Song of the Year for Lemonade and \"Formation\" respectively.[192] and ultimately won two, Best Urban Contemporary Album for Lemonade and Best Music Video for \"Formation\".[193] Adele, upon winning her Grammy for Album of the Year, stated Lemonade was monumental and more deserving.[194]\n\nOn June 13, 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 gave birth to twins Rumi and Sir Carter at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.[195] In September 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 collaborated with J Balvin and Willy William, to release a remix of the song \"Mi Gente\".

The couple announced the joint tour officially as On the Run II Tour on March 12[202] and simultaneously released a trailer for the tour on YouTube.[203] On March 20, 2018, the couple traveled to Jamaica to film a music video directed by Melina Matsoukas.[204]\n\nOn April 14, 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 played the first of two weekends as the headlining act of the Coachella Music Festival. Her performance of April 14, attended by 125,000 festival-goers, was immediately praised, with multiple media outlets describing it as historic. The performance became the most-tweeted about performance of weekend one, as well as the most-watched live Coachella performance and the most-watched live performance on YouTube of all time. The show paid tribute to black culture, specifically historically black colleges and universities and featured a live band with over 100 dancers. Destiny's Child also reunited during the show.[205][206]\n\nOn June 6, 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 and husband Jay-Z kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters, and initially available exclusively on Tidal. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyonc\u00e9's official YouTube channel.[207][208] Everything Is Love received generally positive reviews,[209] and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with 123,000 album-equivalent units, of which 70,000 were pure album sales.[210]\n\nOn December 2, 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 alongside Jay-Z headlined the Global Citizen Festival: Mandela 100 which was held at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa.[211] Their 2-hour performance had concepts similar to the On the Run II Tour and Beyonc\u00e9 was praised for her outfits, which paid tribute to Africa's diversity.[212]\n\nOn April 17, 2019, Beyonc\u00e9 alongside media-service provider Netflix, premiered the 137-minute documentary and concert film Homecoming, mainly regarding Beyonc\u00e9's historic 2018 Coachella performances.[213][214] The film was accompanied by the live album Homecoming: The Live Album.[215] It was later reported that Beyonc\u00e9 and Netflix had signed a $60 million deal to produce three different projects, one of which is Homecoming.[216] Homecoming received six nominations at the 71st Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.[217]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 starred in the voice over role of Nala in the remake The Lion King, which was released on July 19, 2019.[218] In March 2017, director Jon Favreau stated that Beyonc\u00e9 was his top choice for the role, and that the studio and himself would be willing to do whatever it took to accommodate her busy schedule.[219] On November 1, 2017, her role was confirmed in an official announcement.[220][221] Beyonc\u00e9 is featured on the film's soundtrack, released on July 11, 2019, with a remake of the song \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" alongside Donald Glover, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, which was originally composed by Elton John.[222] Additionally, an original song from the film by Beyonc\u00e9, \"Spirit\", was released as the lead single from both the soundtrack and The Lion King: The Gift \u2013 an album released alongside the film, produced and curated by Beyonc\u00e9.[223][224] Beyonc\u00e9 called The Lion King: The Gift a \"sonic cinema.\" She also stated that the album is influenced by everything from R&B, pop, hip hop and Afro Beat.[223] The songs were additionally produced by African producers, which Beyonc\u00e9 said was because \"authenticity and heart were important to [her],\" since the film is set in Africa.[223]\n\nDuring an interview for the Wall Street Journal, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, Tina Knowles, revealed that the singer had borrowed some of her art pieces for a new project already in development.[225]\n\nArtistry\n\nVoice and songwriting\n\nSaturday Night Live, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the With \"Single Ladies\", clearly I'd just gotten married, and people want to get married every day\u2014then there was the whole Justin Timberlake thing [recreating the video] on, and it was also the year YouTube blew up. With \"Irreplaceable\", the aggressive lyrics, the acoustic guitar, and the 808 drum machine \u2014those things don't typically go together, and it sounded fresh. \"Crazy in Love\" was another one of those classic moments in pop culture that none of us expected. I asked Jay to get on the song the night before I had to turn my album in \u2013 thank God he did. It still never gets old, no matter how many times I sing it. \u2014Beyonc\u00e9[226]\n\nJody Rosen highlights her tone and timbre as particularly distinctive, describing her voice as \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[227] Her vocal abilities mean she is identified as the centerpiece of Destiny's Child.[228] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that her voice is \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\".[229] Rosen notes that the hip hop era highly influenced Beyonc\u00e9's unique rhythmic vocal style, but also finds her quite traditionalist in her use of balladry, gospel and falsetto.[227] Other critics praise her range and power, with Chris Richards of The Washington Post saying she was \"capable of punctuating any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars.\"[230]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's music is generally R&B,[231][232] pop[231][233] and hip hop[234] but she also incorporates soul and funk into her songs. 4 demonstrated Beyonc\u00e9's exploration of 1990s-style R&B, as well as further use of soul and hip hop than compared to previous releases.[226] While she almost exclusively releases English songs, Beyonc\u00e9 recorded several Spanish songs for Irreemplazable (re-recordings of songs from B'Day for a Spanish-language audience), and the re-release of B'Day. To record these, Beyonc\u00e9 was coached phonetically by American record producer Rudy Perez.[235]\n\nShe has received co-writing credits for most of the songs recorded with Destiny's Child and her solo efforts.[29] Her early songs were personally driven and female-empowerment themed compositions like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\", but after the start of her relationship with Jay-Z, she transitioned to more man-tending anthems such as \"Cater 2 U\".[236] Beyonc\u00e9 has also received co-producing credits for most of the records in which she has been involved, especially during her solo efforts. However, she does not formulate beats herself, but typically comes up with melodies and ideas during production, sharing them with producers.[237]\n\nIn 2001, she became the first black woman and second female lyricist to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards.[18][238] Beyonc\u00e9 was the third woman to have writing credits on three number-one songs (\"Irreplaceable\", \"Grillz\" and \"Check on It\") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American lyricist Diane Warren at third with nine song-writing credits on number-one singles.[239] (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song \"I Was Here\" for 4.[240]) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyonc\u00e9 at number 17 on their list of the Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters, for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list, along with Alicia Keys and Taylor Swift.[241]\n\nInfluences\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 names Michael Jackson as her major musical influence.[242] Aged five, Beyonc\u00e9 attended her first ever concert where Jackson performed and she claims to have realized her purpose.[243] When she presented him with a tribute award at the World Music Awards in 2006, Beyonc\u00e9 said, \"if it wasn't for Michael Jackson, I would never ever have performed.\"[244] She admires Diana Ross as an \"all-around entertainer\".[245] Beyonc\u00e9 was heavily influenced by Tina Turner, who she said \"Tina Turner is someone that I admire, because she made her strength feminine and sexy\".[246] and Whitney Houston, who she said \"inspired me to get up there and do what she did.\"[247] She credits Mariah Carey's singing and her song \"Vision of Love\" as influencing her to begin practicing vocal runs as a child.[248][249] Her other musical influences include Prince,[250] Lauryn Hill,[245] Sade Adu,[251] Donna Summer,[252] Mary J. Blige,[253] Anita Baker and Rachelle Ferrell.[245]\n\nThe feminism and female empowerment themes on Beyonc\u00e9's second solo album B'Day were inspired by her role in Dreamgirls[254] and by singer Josephine Baker.[255] Beyonc\u00e9 paid homage to Baker by performing \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\" at the 2006 Fashion Rocks concert wearing Baker's trademark mini-hula skirt embellished with fake bananas.[256] Beyonc\u00e9's third solo album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, was inspired by Jay-Z and especially by Etta James, whose \"boldness\" inspired Beyonc\u00e9 to explore other musical genres and styles.[257] Her fourth solo album, 4, was inspired by Fela Kuti, 1990s R&B, Earth, Wind & Fire, DeBarge, Lionel Richie, Teena Marie, The Jackson 5, New Edition, Adele, Florence and the Machine, and Prince.[226]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has stated that she is personally inspired by Michelle Obama (the 44th First Lady of the United States), saying \"she proves you can do it all,\"[258] and has described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman.\"[245] She has also discussed how Jay-Z is a continuing inspiration to her, both with what she describes as his lyrical genius and in the obstacles he has overcome in his life.[259] Beyonc\u00e9 has expressed admiration for the artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, posting in a letter \"what I find in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, I search for in every day in music ... he is lyrical and raw\".[260][261] In February 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 said that Madonna inspired her to take control of her own career. She commented, \"I think about Madonna and how she took all of the great things she achieved and started the label and developed other artists. But there are not enough of those women.\"[262]\n\nMusic videos and stage\n\nIn 2006, Beyonc\u00e9 introduced her all-female tour band Suga Mama (also the name of a song on B'Day) which includes bassists, drummers, guitarists, horn players, keyboardists and percussionists.[263] Her background singers, The Mamas, consist of Montina Cooper-Donnell, Crystal Collins and Tiffany Moniqu\u00e9 Riddick. They made their debut appearance at the 2006 BET Awards and re-appeared in the music videos for \"Irreplaceable\" and \"Green Light\".[235] The band have supported Beyonc\u00e9 in most subsequent live performances, including her 2007 concert tour The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience, I Am... World Tour (2009\u20132010), The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour (2013\u20132014) and The Formation World Tour (2016).\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has received praise for her stage presence and voice during live performances. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post placed her at number one on her list of the Five Best Singer/Dancers.[264] According to Barbara Ellen of The Guardian Beyonc\u00e9 is the most in-charge female artist she's seen onstage,[265] while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good.\"[266] The ex-President of Def Jam L.A. Reid has described Beyonc\u00e9 as the greatest entertainer alive.[267] Jim Farber of the Daily News and Stephanie Classen of The StarPhoenix both praised her strong voice and her stage presence.[268][269] Beyonc\u00e9's stage outfits have been met with criticism from many countries, such as Malaysia, where she has postponed or cancelled performances due to the country's strict laws banning revealing costumes.[270]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has worked with numerous directors for her music videos throughout her career, including Melina Matsoukas, Jonas \u00c5kerlund, and Jake Nava. Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the Lemonade visuals in particular served as inspiration for his film, commenting, \"You look at Beyonc\u00e9's brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre is taking on so many different forms ... I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want.\"[271]\n\nAlter ego\n\nDescribed as being \"sexy, seductive and provocative\" when performing on stage, Beyonc\u00e9 has said that she originally created the alter ego \"Sasha Fierce\" to keep that stage persona separate from who she really is. She described Sasha as being \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", stating, \"I'm not like her in real life at all.\"[38] Sasha was conceived during the making of \"Crazy in Love\", and Beyonc\u00e9 introduced her with the release of her 2008 album, I Am... Sasha Fierce. In February 2010, she announced in an interview with Allure magazine that she was comfortable enough with herself to no longer need Sasha Fierce.[272] However, Beyonc\u00e9 announced in May 2012 that she would bring her back for her Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live shows later that month.[273]\n\nPublic image\n\nDreamgirls Beyonc\u00e9 at the premiere for her 2006 film,\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has been described as having a wide-ranging sex appeal, with music journalist Tour\u00e9 writing that since the release of Dangerously in Love, she has \"become a crossover sex symbol\".[274] Offstage Beyonc\u00e9 says that while she likes to dress sexily, her onstage dress \"is absolutely for the stage.\"[275] Due to her curves and the term's catchiness, in the 2000s (decade), the media often used the term \"Bootylicious\" (a portmanteau of the words booty and delicious) to describe Beyonc\u00e9,[276][277] the term popularized by Destiny's Child's single of the same name. In 2006, it was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.[278]\n\nExternal image Knowles's Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue cover from February 15, 2007\n\nIn September 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 made her runway modelling debut at Tom Ford's Spring/Summer 2011 fashion show.[279] She was named \"World's Most Beautiful Woman\" by People[280] and the \"Hottest Female Singer of All Time\" by Complex in 2012.[281] In January 2013, GQ placed her on its cover, featuring her atop its \"100 Sexiest Women of the 21st Century\" list.[282][283] VH1 listed her at number 1 on its 100 Sexiest Artists list.[284] Several wax figures of Beyonc\u00e9 are found at Madame Tussauds Wax Museums in major cities around the world, including New York,[285] Washington, D.C.,[286] Amsterdam,[287] Bangkok,[288] Hollywood[289] and Sydney.[290]\n\nAccording to Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli, Beyonc\u00e9 uses different fashion styles to work with her music while performing.[291] Her mother co-wrote a book, published in 2002, titled Destiny's Style[292] an account of how fashion affected the trio's success.[293] The B'Day Anthology Video Album showed many instances of fashion-oriented footage, depicting classic to contemporary wardrobe styles.[294] In 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 was featured on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, becoming the second African American woman after Tyra Banks,[295] and People magazine recognized Beyonc\u00e9 as the best-dressed celebrity.[296]\n\nThe Beyhive is the name given to Beyonc\u00e9's fan base. Fans were previously titled \"The Beyontourage\", (a portmanteau of Beyonc\u00e9 and entourage). The name Bey Hive derives from the word beehive, purposely misspelled to resemble her first name, and was penned by fans after petitions on the online social networking service Twitter and online news reports during competitions.[297]\n\nIn 2006, the animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), criticized Beyonc\u00e9 for wearing and using fur in her clothing line House of Der\u00e9on.[298] In 2011, she appeared on the cover of French fashion magazine L'Officiel, in blackface and tribal makeup that drew criticism from the media. A statement released from a spokesperson for the magazine said that Beyonc\u00e9's look was \"far from the glamorous Sasha Fierce\" and that it was \"a return to her African roots\".[299]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's lighter skin color and costuming has drawn criticism from some in the African-American community.[300] Emmett Price, a professor of music at Northeastern University, wrote in 2007 that he thinks race plays a role in many of these criticisms, saying white celebrities who dress similarly do not attract as many comments.[300] In 2008, L'Or\u00e9al was accused of whitening her skin in their Feria hair color advertisements, responding that \"it is categorically untrue\",[301][302] and in 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 herself criticized H&M for their proposed \"retouching\" of promotional images of her, and according to Vogue requested that only \"natural pictures be used\".[303]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has been very vocal for the Black Lives Matter movement. Her song \"Formation\", which she sang at the 2016 Super Bowl halftime show, gained criticism from some politicians and police. Some police tried to get The Formation World Tour boycotted by other members.[304] Beyonc\u00e9 has said that she is against police brutality but is not anti-police.[305]\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarriage and children\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 started a relationship with Jay-Z after their collaboration on \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\",[306] which appeared on his seventh album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002).[307] Beyonc\u00e9 appeared as Jay-Z's girlfriend in the music video for the song, fuelling speculation about their relationship.[308] On April 4, 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z married without publicity.[92] As of April 2014 , the couple had sold a combined 300 million records together.[160] They are known for their private relationship, although they have appeared to become more relaxed in recent years.[309] Both have acknowledged difficulty that arose in their marriage after Jay-Z had an affair.[310][311]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 suffered a miscarriage around 2010 or 2011, describing it as \"the saddest thing\" she had ever endured.[312] She returned to the studio and wrote music to cope with the loss. In April 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z traveled to Paris to shoot the album cover for 4, and she unexpectedly became pregnant in Paris.[313] In August, the couple attended the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, at which Beyonc\u00e9 performed \"Love on Top\" and ended the performance by revealing she was pregnant.[314] Her appearance helped that year's MTV Video Music Awards become the most-watched broadcast in MTV history, pulling in 12.4 million viewers;[315] the announcement was listed in Guinness World Records for \"most tweets per second recorded for a single event\" on Twitter,[316] receiving 8,868 tweets per second[317] and \"Beyonce pregnant\" was the most Googled phrase the week of August 29, 2011.[318] On January 7, 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.[319]\n\nFollowing the release of Lemonade, which included the single \"Sorry\", in 2016, speculations arose about Jay-Z's alleged infidelity with a mistress referred to as \"Becky.\" Jon Pareles in The New York Times pointed out that many of the accusations were \"aimed specifically and recognizably\" at him.[320] Similarly, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone magazine noted the lines \"Suck on my balls, I've had enough\" were an \"unmistakable hint\" that the lyrics revolve around Jay-Z.\"[321]\n\nOn February 1, 2017, she revealed on her Instagram account that she was expecting twins. Her announcement gained over 6.3 million \"likes\" within eight hours, breaking the world record for the most liked image on the website at the time.[322] On July 13, 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 uploaded the first image of herself and the twins onto her Instagram account, confirming their birth date as a month prior, on June 13, 2017 and the names Rumi and Sir Carter,[323] with the post becoming the second most liked on Instagram, behind her own pregnancy announcement.[324] The twins were born at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in California. She wrote of her pregnancy and its aftermath in the September 2018 issue of Vogue, in which she had full control of the cover, shot at Hammerwood Park by photographer Tyler Mitchell.[325][326]\n\nActivism\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 performed \"America the Beautiful\" at the 2009 presidential inauguration, as well as \"At Last\" during the first inaugural dance at the Neighborhood Ball two days later.[327] They held a fundraiser at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan for Obama's 2012 presidential campaign[328] which raised $4 million.[329] In the 2012 presidential election, Beyonc\u00e9 voted for Obama.[330] She performed the American national anthem at his second inauguration in January 2013.[142] The Washington Post reported in May 2015, that Beyonc\u00e9 attended a major celebrity fundraiser for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.[331] She also headlined for Hillary Clinton in a 2016 concert held the weekend before Election Day. In this performance, Beyonc\u00e9 and her entourage of backup dancers wore pantsuits; a clear allusion to Clinton's frequent dress-of-choice. The backup dancers also wore \"I'm with her\" tee shirts, the campaign slogan for Clinton. In a brief speech at this performance Beyonc\u00e9 said, \"I want my daughter to grow up seeing a woman lead our country and knowing that her possibilities are limitless.\"[332]\n\nIn 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 stated in an interview with Vogue that she considered herself to be \"a modern-day feminist\".[333] She would later align herself more publicly with the movement, sampling \"We should all be feminists\", a speech delivered by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a TEDx talk in April 2013, in her song \"Flawless\", released later that year.[334]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has conducted several fundraising and donation campaigns during her tours.\n\nIn 2014 she performed live at the MTV Video Awards in front a giant backdrop reading \"FEMINIST.\"[335] Her self-identification as a feminist in response incited a circulation of opinions and debate about whether her feminism is aligned with older, more established feminist ideals. Annie Lennox, celebrated artist and feminist advocate, referred to Beyonc\u00e9's use of her word feminist as 'feminist lite'. [336] Dr. bell hooks critiqued Beyonc\u00e9 as referring to her as a \"terrorist\" towards feminism, harmfully impacting her audience of young girls.[337] Adichie responded towards Beyonc\u00e9's feminism with \"\u2026her type of feminism is not mine, as it is the kind that, at the same time, gives quite a lot of space to the necessity of men.[338] Adichie expands upon what 'feminist lite' means to her, referring that \"more troubling is the idea, in Feminism Lite, that men are naturally superior but should be expected to \"treat women well\"\" and \"we judge powerful women more harshly than we judge powerful men. And Feminism Lite enables this.\"[339] Beyonc\u00e9 responded with her intent by utilizing the definition of feminist with her prestigious platform was to \"give clarity to the true meaning\" behind it.[340] Beyonc\u00e9 says to understand what being a feminist is, \"\u2026it's very simple. It's someone who believes in equal rights for men and women.\"[340] She advocated to provide equal opportunities for young boys and girls, men and women must begin to understand the double standards that remain persistent in our society and the issue must be illuminated in effort to start making changes.[340]\n\nShe has also contributed to the Ban Bossy campaign, which uses television and social media to encourage leadership in girls.[341] Following Beyonc\u00e9's public identification as a feminist, the sexualized nature of her performances and the fact that she championed her marriage was questioned.[342]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 publicly endorsed same-sex marriage on March 26, 2013, after the Supreme Court debate on California's Proposition 8.[343] Beyonc\u00e9 spoke against North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a bill passed (and later repealed) that discriminated against the LGBT community in public places in a statement during her concert in Raleigh as part of the Formation World Tour in 2016.[344] She has also condemned police brutality against black Americans. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z attended a rally in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the shooting of Trayvon Martin.[345] The film for her sixth album Lemonade included the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, holding pictures of their sons in the video for \"Freedom\".[346] In a 2016 interview with Elle, Beyonc\u00e9 responded to the controversy surrounding her song \"Formation\" which was perceived to be critical of the police. She clarified, \"I am against police brutality and injustice. Those are two separate things. If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me\".[347]\n\nIn February 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke out against the withdrawal of protections for transgender students in public schools by Donald Trump's presidential administration. Posting a link to the 100 Days of Kindness campaign on her Facebook page, Beyonc\u00e9 voiced her support for transgender youth and joined a roster of celebrities who spoke out against Trump's decision.[348]\n\nIn November 2017, Beyonc\u00e9 presented Colin Kaepernick with the 2017 Sports Illustrated Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, stating, \"Thank you for your selfless heart and your conviction, thank you for your personal sacrifice,\" and that \"Colin took action with no fear of consequence ... To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color. We're still waiting for the world to catch up.\" Muhammad Ali was heavily penalized in his career for protesting the status quo of US civil rights through opposition to the Vietnam War, by refusing to serve in the military. 40 years later, Kaepernick had already lost one professional year due to taking a much quieter and legal stand \"for people that are oppressed.\"[349]\n\nWealth\n\nForbes magazine began reporting on Beyonc\u00e9's earnings in 2008, calculating that the $80 million earned between June 2007 to June 2008, for her music, tour, films and clothing line made her the world's best-paid music personality at the time, above Madonna and Celine Dion.[350][351] They placed her fourth on the Celebrity 100 list in 2009[352] and ninth on the \"Most Powerful Women in the World\" list in 2010.[353] The following year, Forbes placed her eighth on the \"Best-Paid Celebrities Under 30\" list, having earned $35 million in the past year for her clothing line and endorsement deals. In 2012, Forbes placed Beyonc\u00e9 at number 16 on the Celebrity 100 list, twelve places lower than three years ago yet still having earned $40 million in the past year for her album 4, clothing line and endorsement deals.[354][355] In the same year, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z placed at number one on the \"World's Highest-Paid Celebrity Couples\", for collectively earning $78 million.[356] The couple made it into the previous year's Guinness World Records as the \"highest-earning power couple\" for collectively earning $122 million in 2009.[357] For the years 2009 to 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 earned an average of $70 million per year, and earned $40 million in 2012.[358] In 2013, Beyonc\u00e9's endorsements of Pepsi and H&M made her and Jay-Z the world's first billion dollar couple in the music industry.[359] That year, Beyonc\u00e9 was published as the fourth most-powerful celebrity in the Forbes rankings.[360]\n\nMTV estimated that by the end of 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 would become the highest-paid black musician in history;[361] this became the case in April 2014.[362] In June 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 ranked at number one on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list, earning an estimated $115 million throughout June 2013 \u2013 June 2014. This in turn was the first time she had topped the Celebrity 100 list as well as being her highest yearly earnings to date.[363] In 2016, Beyonc\u00e9 ranked at number 34 on the Celebrity 100 list with earnings of $54 million. Herself and Jay-Z also topped the highest paid celebrity couple list, with combined earnings of $107.5 million.[364] As of 2018 , Forbes calculated her net worth to be $355 million, and in June of the same year, ranked her as the 35th highest earning celebrity with annual earnings of $60 million. This tied Beyonc\u00e9 with Madonna as the only two female artists to earn more than $100 million within a single year twice.[365][366] As a couple with Jay-Z, they have a combined net worth of $1.16 billion.[367] In July 2017, Billboard announced that Beyonc\u00e9 was the highest paid musician of 2016, with an estimated total of $62.1 million.[368]\n\nLegacy\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 performing during her I Am... World Tour in 2009\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s success has led to her becoming a cultural icon and earning her the nickname \u201cQueen Bey\u201d.[369] In The New Yorker, music critic Jody Rosen described Beyonc\u00e9 as \"the most important and compelling popular musician of the twenty-first century ... the result, the logical end point, of a century-plus of pop.\"[370] When The Observer named her Artist of the Decade in 2009, Llewyn-Smith wrote:\n\nWhy Beyonc\u00e9? ... Because she made not one but two of the decade's greatest singles, with 'Crazy in Love' and 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)', not to mention her hits with Destiny's Child; and this was the decade when singles \u2013 particularly R&B singles \u2013 regained their status as pop's favourite medium. ... [She] and not any superannuated rock star was arguably the greatest live performer of the past 10 years.[371]\n\nWriting for Entertainment Weekly, Alex Suskind noticed how Beyonc\u00e9 was the decade\u2019s (2010s) defining pop star, stating that \"no one dominated music in the 2010s like Queen Bey\", explaining that her \"songs, album rollouts, stage presence, social justice initiatives, and disruptive public relations strategy have influenced the way we\u2019ve viewed music since 2010.\"[372] British publication NME also shared similar thoughts on her impact in the 2010s, including Beyonc\u00e9 on their list of the \"10 Artists Who Defined The Decade\", explaning: \"So much more than a popstar, Beyonce has become an outspoken advocate for civil rights, feminism and self-expression, proving that it\u2019s possible to be politically engaged and still hold down an extremely successful career in mainstream entertainment.\"[373]\n\nIn 2013, Beyonc\u00e9 made the Time 100 list, with Baz Luhrmann writing:\n\nNo one has that voice, no one moves the way she moves, no one can hold an audience the way she does ... When Beyonc\u00e9 does an album, when Beyonc\u00e9 sings a song, when Beyonc\u00e9 does anything, it's an event, and it's broadly influential. Right now, she is the heir-apparent diva of the USA \u2013 the reigning national voice.[374]\n\nIn 2014, Beyonc\u00e9 was listed again on the Time 100 and also featured on the cover of the issue.[375] In 2018, Rolling Stone included her on its Millennial 100 list and Brittany Spanos wrote: \"For 20 years, she\u2019s been a stately pop and R&B presence: Destiny\u2019s Child countered the glaringly white bubblegum of the time with unmatchable vocals and choreography, and their success made her solo career fail-proof. It\u2019s one reason Beyonc\u00e9 may be the most universally beloved artist of the Gen Y. A figure of talent, beauty and grace, Queen Bey has developed into the most exciting artist of the millennium as well as a political figure, setting the tone for how other major stars speak about feminism and the Black Lives Matter movement with the release of her landmark Lemonade album in 2016.\"[376]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's work has influenced numerous artists including Adele,[377] Alexis Jordan,[378] Ariana Grande,[379][380] Azealia Banks.[381] Paul McCartney,[382] Bebe Rexha,[383] Bridgit Mendler,[384] Camila Cabello,[385] Lizzo,[386] Britney Spears,[387] Cheryl,[388] Demi Lovato,[389] Ellie Goulding,[390] Ed Sheeran,[391] Fifth Harmony,[392] Florence Welch,[393] Grimes,[394][395] Hwasa,[396] Iggy Azalea,[397] Jessica Sanchez,[398] Jessie J,[399] JoJo,[400] Kelly Rowland,[401][402] Kendrick Lamar,[403] Lady Gaga,[404] Little Mix,[405] Meghan Trainor,[406] Nicole Scherzinger,[407] Millie Bobby Brown,[408] Rihanna,[409] Rita Ora,[410] Ryan Destiny[411] SZA,[412] Sam Smith,[413] Tinashe,[414] and Zendaya.[415]\n\nAmerican indie rock band White Rabbits also cited her an inspiration for their third album Milk Famous (2012),[416] and Irish singer Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor cited her as the inspiration for the title of her tenth album I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss.[417] Friend Gwyneth Paltrow[418] studied Beyonc\u00e9 at her live concerts while learning to become a musical performer for the 2010 film Country Strong.[419]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is known for coining popular phrases such as 'put a ring on it,' a euphemism for marriage proposal, 'I woke up like this, which started a trend of posting morning selfies with the hashtag #iwokeuplikethis, and 'boy, bye,' which was used as part of the Democratic National Committee's campaign for the 2020 election.[420][421] Similarly, she also came up with the phrase \"visual album\" following the release of her fifth studio album, which had a video for every song. This has been recreated by many other artists since, such as Frank Ocean and Melanie Martinez.[422] The album also popularized surprise releases, with many artists releasing songs, videos or albums with no prior announcement, such as Nicki Minaj, Eminem, Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Drake.[423]\n\nShe is often credited for the cultural shift towards female pop singers rapping and for creating the staccato style of 'rap-singing' she used in songs like \"Bug a Boo\" and \"Say My Name\".[424] Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork noticed her contribution in changing the sound of pop music radio with her hip-hop assisted style, writing:\n\nHer hip-hop fluency gave her an advantage in the pop-star arms race, helping her to become the presiding voice in an increasingly rap-dominated musical landscape. Her evolution, from rap-adjacent R&B star (appearing as early as 1998 in a Geto Boys video) to reluctant hip-hop shareholder to full-blown rapper, played a role in slowly shifting the sound of pop radio.[425]\n\nHer debut single, \"Crazy in Love\" was named VH1's \"Greatest Song of the 2000s\",[426] NME's \"Best Track of the 00s\"[427] and \"Pop Song of the Century\",[428] considered by Rolling Stone to be one of the 500 greatest songs of all time, earned two Grammy Awards and is one of the best-selling singles of all time at around 8 million copies. The music video for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", which achieved fame for its intricate choreography[429] and its deployment of jazz hands,[430] was credited by the Toronto Star as having started the \"first major dance craze of both the new millennium and the Internet\",[102] triggering a number of parodies of the dance choreography[431][432] and a legion of amateur imitators on YouTube.[429][431] In 2013, Drake released a single titled \"Girls Love Beyonc\u00e9\", which featured an interpolation from Destiny Child's \"Say My Name\" and discussed his relationship with women.[433] In January 2012, research scientist Bryan Lessard named Scaptia beyonceae, a species of horse fly found in Northern Queensland, Australia after Beyonc\u00e9 due to the fly's unique golden hairs on its abdomen.[434] In July 2014, a Beyonc\u00e9 exhibit was introduced into the \"Legends of Rock\" section of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The black leotard from the \"Single Ladies\" video and her outfit from the Super Bowl half time performance are among several pieces housed at the museum.[435] Architects credit Beyonc\u00e9's look in her \"Ghost\" music video as the inspiration of the design of the Premier Tower under construction in Australia.[436]\n\nThe City of Minneapolis, Minnesota declared May 23 Beyonc\u00e9 Day in the city in 2016.[437] In 2018, the City of Columbia, South Carolina declared August 21 Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter Day in the city after presenting her with the keys to Columbia.[438]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 inspired the character of Catherine of Aragon in the British musical Six, a modern retelling of the lives of the six wives of Henry VIII presented as a pop concert, with the character's outfit bearing resemblance to Beyonc\u00e9's from her performance at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards.[439] Additionally, Beyonc\u00e9 is featured alongside other R&B and pop divas as a primary character on the popular web parody Got 2B Real.[440]\n\nFor their first match of March 2019, the players of the United States women's national soccer team each wore a jersey with the name of a woman they were honoring on the back; Mallory Pugh chose the name of Beyonc\u00e9.[441]\n\nAchievements\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has received numerous awards. As a solo artist she has sold over 17 million albums in the US, and over 75 million worldwide (as of February 2013).[442] Having sold over 100 million records worldwide (a further 60 million additionally with Destiny's Child), Beyonc\u00e9 is one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[443][444][445][446][447][448] The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) listed Beyonc\u00e9 as the top certified artist of the 2000s decade, with a total of 64 certifications.[449][450] Her songs \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", \"Halo\", and \"Irreplaceable\" are some of the best-selling singles of all time worldwide.

Beyonc\u00e9 has also signed other artists to Parkwood such as Chloe x Halle, who performed at Super Bowl LIII in February 2019.\n\nEndorsements\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has worked with Pepsi since 2002,[470] and in 2004 appeared in a Gladiator-themed commercial with Britney Spears, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[471] In 2012, Beyonc\u00e9 signed a $50 million deal to endorse Pepsi.[472] The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPINET) wrote Beyonc\u00e9 an open letter asking her to reconsider the deal because of the unhealthiness of the product and to donate the proceeds to a medical organisation.[473] Nevertheless, NetBase found that Beyonc\u00e9's campaign was the most talked about endorsement in April 2013, with a 70 percent positive audience response to the commercial and print ads.[474]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has worked with Tommy Hilfiger for the fragrances True Star (singing a cover version of \"Wishing on a Star\")[475] and True Star Gold;[476] she also promoted Emporio Armani's Diamonds fragrance in 2007.[477] Beyonc\u00e9 launched her first official fragrance, Heat, in 2010.[478] The commercial, which featured the 1956 song \"Fever\", was shown after the water shed in the United Kingdom as it begins with an image of Beyonc\u00e9 appearing to lie naked in a room.[479] In February 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 launched her second fragrance, Heat Rush.[480] Beyonc\u00e9's third fragrance, Pulse, was launched in September 2011.[481] In 2013, The Mrs. Carter Show Limited Edition version of Heat was released.[482] The six editions of Heat are the world's best-selling celebrity fragrance line,[482] with sales of over $400 million.[483]\n\nThe release of a video-game Starpower: Beyonc\u00e9 was cancelled after Beyonc\u00e9 pulled out of a $100 million with GateFive who alleged the cancellation meant the sacking of 70 staff and millions of pounds lost in development.[484] It was settled out of court by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers.[485] Beyonc\u00e9 also has had deals with American Express,[351] Nintendo DS[486] and L'Or\u00e9al since the age of 18.[487]\n\nIn March 2015, Beyonc\u00e9 became a co-owner, with other artists, of the music streaming service Tidal. The service specializes in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Beyonc\u00e9's husband Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[488] Including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Kanye West, Rihanna, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake.[489] The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry.[490]\n\nFashion lines\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and her mother introduced House of Der\u00e9on, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.[491] The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyonc\u00e9's grandmother, Agn\u00e8z Der\u00e9on, a respected seamstress.[492][493] According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyonc\u00e9's taste and style. Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Der\u00e9on, and its junior collection, Der\u00e9on.[491] House of Der\u00e9on pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era.[494][495] The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and footwear, and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada.[491]\n\nIn 2005, Beyonc\u00e9 teamed up with House of Brands, a shoe company, to produce a range of footwear for House of Der\u00e9on.[496] In January 2008, Starwave Mobile launched Beyonc\u00e9 Fashion Diva, a \"high-style\" mobile game with a social networking component, featuring the House of Der\u00e9on collection.[491] In July 2009, Beyonc\u00e9 and her mother launched a new junior apparel label, Sasha Fierce for Der\u00e9on, for back-to-school selling.
