After his big night at the AFI Life Achievement Gala, we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY heard George\u2019s friends want him to make a run for the White House!\n\nIs the world ready for President George Clooney? After Donald Trump, anything seems possible (or a massive upgrade, TBH.) The politically-minded George, 57, and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, 40, were definitely looking like the First Couple of Hollywood during the AFI Life Achievement Gala. Some would love to see these two move into 1700 Pennsylvania Avenue, as a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that \u201cHollywood friends the likes of Julia Roberts and many more were not only interested in honoring their friend [at the AFI event] but they also wanted to grab his ear to try to convince him to run for President.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think he would be amazing\u201d as president, the source tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cWith Amal, as the first lady, by his side and whomever he would choose as a Vice President, it would be one of the most amazing things they could see him do.\u201d The source says that if there were any possibility to convince George to run, it would have been at the AFI event, as it was \u201cthe night where everyone who respects him was honoring him for his work in the entertainment world.\u201d The insider added that Candidate Clooney would have been \u201ca very big topic of conversation all night that George would not be able to get away from.\u201d\n\nDid someone get in George\u2019s ear during the gala and convince him to throw his hat in the ring when the 2020 election rolls around? Only time will tell. Granted, Amal \u2013 who Tina Fey famously described at the 2015 Golden Globes as \u201ca human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case; was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria; and was selected for a three-person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip\u201d \u2013 would be more qualified for the role of President of the United States of America. However, she was born in Lebanon, and is not eligible to run for the role. So, if people want Amal in the White House, they\u2019d better hope George announces his candidacy sometime between now and November 3, 2020.\n\nGeorge and Amal already won the election to be president \u2013 of our hearts! Before George accepted the 46th AFI Lifetime Achievement Award, Amal addressed the love of her life. \u201cI met George when I was 35 and starting to become quite resigned to the idea that I was going to be a spinster. Then we met and started hiding out in my London flat and very soon it felt like, no matter what happened, I would never want to be with anyone else,\u201d she said. Oh, just a FYI \u2013 during the AFI event, former president Barack Obama, 55, sent in a pre-taped statement. So, it\u2019s possible he may have already scored Barry\u2019s endorsement, and that would be huge!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/george-clooneys-friends-want-him-to-run-for-prez-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F08%2Fgeorge-clooney-running-president-amal-first-lady%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3175673", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/george-clooneys-friends-want-him-to-run-for-prez-ftr.jpg?w=620", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/george-clooneys-friends-want-him-to-run-for-prez-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/08/george-clooney-running-president-amal-first-lady/", "title": "George Clooney\u2019s Friends Want Him To Run For President: He Would Be \u2018Amazing\u2019 With Amal As First Lady", "meta_data": {"description": "After his big night at the AFI Life Achievement Gala, George Clooney's friends want him to run for president!", "news_keywords": "Amal Clooney, George Clooney", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "George Clooney\u2019s Friends Want Him To Run For President: He Would Be \u2018Amazing\u2019 With Amal As First Lady", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/08/george-clooney-running-president-amal-first-lady/", "description": "Introducing the next President of the United States\u2026George Clooney?
