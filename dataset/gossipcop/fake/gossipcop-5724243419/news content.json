Two decades. That\u2019s the length of some actors\u2019 entire careers, yet the public was none the wiser. The two actresses deserve some kind of award just for outwardly keeping the peace.\n\nPinkett Smith revealed the news to Extra while promoting her upcoming Facebook Watch talk show, which Union will eventually appear on. \u201cI have a really touching episode with Gabrielle Union,\u201d she told Extra. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really been on the best of terms for 17 years, and we have a reconciliation. They were like, \u2018We wanna do a girlfriends show,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Well . . . .\u2019 Her name just kept coming up. It just couldn\u2019t be anything else. So we brought it to the table.\u201d\n\n17 is a very specific number, not rounded up or down. It\u2019s a number a person can rattle off because they\u2019ve kept the books up to date, and because something happened. That would mean that whatever went down did so in those halcyon days of 2001. This was post-Bring It On Gabrielle Union, and pre-The Matrix Reloaded Jada Pinkett Smith\u2014around the time of Two Can Play That Game and Ali, respectively. What could have possibly happened?\n\nThey were never on a set together as far as IMDb is concerned, though Union starred alongside Pinkett Smith\u2019s husband, Will Smith, in Bad Boys II, in 2003. The only picture that exists on the newswires where the actresses appear in the same frame is from February 2016, at the 47th NAACP Image Awards, and they have three women\u2014Taraji P. Henson, Loretta Devine, and Tika Sumpter\u2014between them. Was it a skirmish over the alarmingly few roles for black women in Hollywood? Or something more personal than professional? Pinkett Smith says neither of them can remember why it started. (Vanity Fair has reached out to Union for comment.)\n\nThe show airs Monday, May 7, and co-stars Pinkett Smith\u2019s mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris and her daughter Willow Smith. I suppose we\u2019ll all just have to watch for more clues.\n\nUpdate (Monday, May 7 at 10:50 a.m.): Union stopped by the Today show on Monday and told host Hoda Kotb that indeed the \u201cfeud\u201d is over.\n\n\u201cJada nor I ever used the word feud, so it just became more of a media creation,\u201d she said. \u201cKind of like back in the day, neither one of us actually knows what originally took place back then. But the people we had around us were like \u2018well you know how she feels about you\u2019 and they were like, \u2018well you know how she feels about you.\u2019 And then it was like \u2018girl bye\u2019 for 17 years. Even though we\u2019re both very outspoken women, both activists, our husbands are friends, I worked with her husband, we both had too much pride and too much insecurities to just say, \u2018Hey, did that ever actually happen or was that just a creation of someone who didn\u2019t want to see two women rise together?\u2019\u201d", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a05cb15e8216d6da983dc2d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/HWD_WEEKLY_REBECCA%402x%2525202.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb7ea6c756b97862722205/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/dear-white-people.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aecb029c3caac4f50cdac76/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Betsy-DeVos-theranos-loser-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kenzie Bryant", "Kenzie Bryan", "Maya Kosof", "Rebecca Keega", "Laura Bradle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/jada-pinkett-smith-gabrielle-union-feud-reconciliation", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabrielle Union\u2019s Secret Feud Is No Longer a Secret", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kenzie Bryant", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "For nearly two decades, the two actresses kept their estrangement under wraps, and now they\u2019ve made amends.", "id": "5aec6201b729797c29525e95", "keywords": "celebrity,gabrielle union,loretta devine,willow smith,vanities,jada pinkett smith", "news_keywords": "celebrity,gabrielle union,loretta devine,willow smith,vanities,jada pinkett smith", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5aec6201b729797c29525e95", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"For nearly two decades, the two actresses kept their estrangement under wraps, and now they\u2019ve made amends.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "For nearly two decades, the two actresses kept their estrangement under wraps, and now they\u2019ve made amends.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabrielle Union\u2019s Secret Feud Is No Longer a Secret", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/jada-pinkett-smith-gabrielle-union-feud-reconciliation"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "For nearly two decades, the two actresses kept their estrangement under wraps, and now they\u2019ve made amends.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aec8b262630df71e06232cc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jada-Gabrielle-Feud-Over.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith and Gabrielle Union\u2019s Secret Feud Is No Longer a Secret"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
