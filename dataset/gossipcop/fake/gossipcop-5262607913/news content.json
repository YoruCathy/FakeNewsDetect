So with their second baby\u2014a boy\u2014born, let\u2019s take a look back at some of the most memorable moments of these lovebirds\u2019 11-year relationship.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about their famous romance.\n\nThe Music Video Meeting\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend first met on the set of Legend\u2019s 2007 music video for \u201cStereo.\u201d Teigen starred as Legend\u2019s love interest in the video and later revealed that when the shoot was over, they went back to Legend\u2019s hotel room, ate In-N-Out burgers and hooked up.\n\n\u201cWe did the music video, we were together for like 12 hours,\u201d she told Wendy Williams in 2014. \u201cWe spent the entire day together, me in my underwear and him in a full suit, and I went to go say goodbye to him, to his hotel and we didn\u2019t ever say goodbye that night.\u201d\n\nHowever, the pair didn\u2019t officially get together until some months later, with Legend heading out on tour shortly after their first encounter.\n\n\u201cI let him be himself for a while,\u201d Teigen told Cosmopolitan in 2014. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is try to lock someone like that down early on, then have them think, \u2018There\u2019s so much more out there.\u2019 I played it cool for a long time. Never once did I ask, \u2018What are we?\u2019 Marriage was never my goal, because I\u2019ve never been very traditional. I was just happy to be with him.\u201d\n\nThe Mini Break-Up\n\nAfter spending some time texting and talking on the phone, Teigen joined Legend on tour early in their relationship.\n\n\u201cI fell in love with her over the phone because she is good with those 140 characters,\u201d Legend joked to ET in 2016. \u201c[At the beginning of our relationship] we were texting a lot, and I started to see her sense of humor. We would talk on the phone, and I started to fall in love with how engaging and witty and funny she is.\u201d\n\nHowever, Legend apparently had a brief lapse of judgement and tried to break up with Teigen at some point in this time period.\n\n\u201cI was on tour with him and he\u2019d gotten sick,\u201d Teigen later revealed to Cosmo. \u201cHe was feeling really bummed and stressed out. He was like, \u2018I can\u2019t be in a relationship right now.\u2019 That lasted for one day. Literally, a day. I knew it came from a place other than us not working. It was the stress of him having to maybe cancel a show, and he had never been in a real relationship\u2014or so he says now. I always joke, \u2018Remember when you tried to break up with me?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Yes, sorry. Big mistake.'\u201d\n\nThe First Lake Como Trip\n\nThe couple took their first trip to Lake Como, Italy\u2014the future site of their wedding and filming location for the \u201cAll of Me\u201d music video\u2014in 2007, according to Teigen. And it was during that getaway that she knew she wanted to spend the rest of her life with Legend.\n\n\u201cBack to where it all began \u2013 Lake Como, Italy \u2013 first came here in 2007,\u201d she captioned a July 2016 Instagram post. \u201cA boat tour guide took us to a little spot on the lake and told us to make a wish. I asked for this to be the man I marry and have children with. I think John asked for the most perfect bite of cacio e pepe. Both came true, and here we are.\u201d\n\nThe Proposal\n\nAfter around four years of dating, Legend proposed to Teigen during a Maldives vacation in December 2011. But things didn\u2019t exactly go as planned.\n\nNot only did they get in a fight on the way to the airport, but TSA almost ruined the surprise before they could even get on their flight.\n\n\u201cI remember we got into a very big fight in the car on the way to the airport because we had opened our presents beforehand, and he had only gotten me a cookbook and a Crock-Pot,\u201d Teigen explained on an episode of FABLife that aired on the couple\u2019s second wedding anniversary.\n\n\u201c[The ring] was in my carry-on bag going through airport security, and security wanted to look through my bag and they wanted to look in that particular box,\u201d Legend added during a 2013 appearance on Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter. \u201cAnd Chrissy was standing right next to me and I was, like, \u2018Oh, my God. I\u2019ve hid it so well this whole time. Now as we\u2019re just about to get to the Maldives she\u2019s going to find out I have a ring in this box and it\u2019s going to ruin the surprise and I\u2019ll have to get on my knees in the airport.'\u201d\n\nLuckily, everything turned out just fine in the end.\n\n\u201cWe get to the Maldives and he had planned this beautiful Christmas. He knows how much I love Christmas\u2026And this waiter comes out with a silver dome for dessert\u2026So he opens up the dome and a ton of arugula falls out and then I kind of fish in it\u2026And I see the little box and then you know, your heart stops and you get so excited,\u201d Teigen said. \u201cThere was no big grand speech or anything. I think it was just very lovely and sweet.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of Me\u201d\n\nLegend debuted \u201cAll of Me\u201d\u2014a new song dedicated to his then-fianc\u00e9e \u2014during a June 2013 performance on Oprah\u2019s Next Chapter. But that wasn\u2019t Teigen\u2019s first time hearing the emotional love ballad. In an interview with the Huffington Post a month earlier, she revealed that the song had brought her to tears when Legend originally played it for her.\n\n\u201cI did cry when I heard it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m emotional, but like I don\u2019t really don\u2019t cry at things like that so yeah, it was beautiful. And live it\u2019s pretty unreal.\u201d\n\nTeigen also starred alongside Legend in the music video for the song, which was shot in Lake Como leading up to their wedding and ends with actual footage from the romantic day.\n\nThe Wedding\n\nChrissy and John\u2019s wedding took place on September 14, 2013 in Lake Como. But they legally tied the knot at an NYC courthouse a day before traveling to Italy.\n\n\u201cWe actually got married after going to a couple Fashion Week shows at Vera Wang, ironically who actually did my dress, but we got married at the courthouse right after,\u201d Teigen told E! News. \u201cWe are dumb and didn\u2019t realize that our Italian wedding would not be recognized unless we had a real ceremony in New York City. So Irina Shayk was our witness\u2014the most beautiful woman on earth!\u201d\n\nLuna Simone Stephens\n\nAfter opening up about their struggles with fertility during an episode of FABLife, Chrissy announced that she and John were expecting their first child on Oct. 12, 2015.\n\n\u201cJohn and I are so happy to announce that we are pregnant :),\u201d she captioned a post on Instagram. \u201cAs many of you know, we\u2019ve been trying to have a baby for a while now. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but we kept trying because we can\u2019t wait to bring our first child into the world and grow our family. We\u2019re so excited that it\u2019s finally happening. Thank you for all your love and well wishes. I look forward to all the belly touching!\u201d\n\nTeigen gave birth to their daughter, Luna Simone Stephens, on April 14, 2016. \u201cTo everyone asking, john is healing perfectly,\u201d she joked on Twitter.\n\nThe couple both shared the first official photos of baby Luna on Instagram a few days later.\n\nLuna\u2019s First Lake Como Trip\n\nIn July 2016, Chrissy and John took the then 3-month-old Luna to Italy for her first Lake Como trip.\n\n\u201cWent back to the \u2018all of me\u2019 house with Luna,\u201d Teigen captured an Instagram video of she and Legend recreating the scene from the music video when they stare at each other through the estate\u2019s floor-length windows. \u201cLol 3 years later.\u201d\n\nTeigen also shared an adorable shot of Luna living her best vacation life while hanging out in an armchair.\n\nBaby No. 2\n\nTeigen revealed she was pregnant with she and Legend\u2019s second child in an adorable Instagram video that featured Luna telling the world there was a baby in her mom\u2019s stomach.\n\nTeigen later revealed that they were expecting a boy, as the only embryo left from their IVF treatment was male.\n\nOn May 16, Teigen announced that baby No. 2 had arrived. However, as of Teigen\u2019s February appearance on Ellen, the couple had yet to come up with a name.\n\n\u201cBoy names are really tough and I don\u2019t think he will even have a middle name because we can\u2019t even come up with a first name,\u201d she told DeGeneres.\n\nGet The Brief.
