According to Hollywood Life, the \u201cStarboy\u201d singer, 27, is hoping to welcome a baby girl with Selena, 25. (And now all we can think about is how freaking cute their child would be.)\n\n\u201cHe has thought about starting a family with Selena at some point down the line, maybe in a few years and he has told her that he would want to have a girl because nothing would be better for him then to have a cute little Selena look-alike bouncing around,\u201d a source told the website. \u201cHe\u2019s mentioned to her many times that two of her would always be better than one.\u201d\n\nMORE: Selena Gomez Opens up About Her Relationship With The Weeknd, Says She \u201cLoves Tremendously Big\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nIt makes sense that The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) would be thinking about babies before marriage. During a February 2017 cover story interview with GQ, the Grammy winner \u2014 who began dating Selena in January \u2014 told the magazine that becoming a dad is more important to him than tying the knot.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the kind of guy that would have kids before getting married,\u201d the musician \u2014 who split from model Bella Hadid last November after two years of dating \u2014 explained. \u201cThe first thing would be kids. Marriage is scary to me, man.\u201d\n\nMORE: Selena Gomez\u2019s Mom Has a Change of Heart \u2014 Gives The Weeknd Two Thumbs Up!\n\nAs we eagerly wait to see what a mini Selena might look like, the pop princess and her beau are just enjoying being young and in love. Earlier this summer, Sel told SiriusXM\u2019s Nicole Ryan that she can\u2019t get enough of their relationship.\n\n\u201cI love being supportive,\u201d the Disney Channel alum \u2014 who famously dated Justin Bieber on and off for years \u2014 said of her romance with The Weeknd. \u201cI love just being there and having someone\u2019s back. It feels good. I haven\u2019t had that feeling in awhile.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/selena-gomez-the-weeknd.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/True-Thompson-Dream-Kardashian-Cute-Photos-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C125px%2C1080px%2C613px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Singer-JoJo-Vow-of-Celibacy-Exclusive-Feature.jpg?crop=625px%2C0px%2C4272px%2C2422px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Selfie.jpg?crop=199px%2C0px%2C810px%2C810px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/selena-gomez-rehab.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katy-Perrys-Dad-Gushes-Over-Her-Fiance-Orlando-Bloom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Admits-She-Will-\u2018Never-Come-in-Between\u2019-Tristan-and-Daughter-True-After-Scandal-pp.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Khloe-Kardashians-Daughter-True-Thompson-Really-Lights-Up-When-Aunt-Kylie-Jenner-Comes-Over.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Skincare-Routine-Should-You-Try-It-Out-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/embed-kim-zolciak.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10491194ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C179px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/the-weeknd-selena-gomez.jpg?w=1180&h=925&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-08-at-12-03-19-pm.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/botched-dr-dubrow-dr-nassif-plastic-surgery-filter.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C2013px%2C1139px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-08-at-12-03-19-pm.png?resize=1164%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-fat-jewish-emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-marriage-exclusive-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-08-at-12-03-19-pm.png?resize=1164%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/the-weeknd-babies-selena-gomez-138802/", "title": "The Weeknd Wants Babies With Selena Gomez (REPORT)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "He\u2019s got baby fever!
