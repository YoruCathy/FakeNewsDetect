What is perhaps equally unusual is that this is Depp\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nIn a role much more commonly assumed by defendants, the plaintiff actor was trying to delay the suit that he instigated. It was a pose that Depp repeatedly also tried with the deposition he finally gave to lawyers at Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP in late May.\n\nHaving flown in from Washington D.C., Depp\u2019s primary lawyer Benjamin Chew sought to have the August 15 jury proceedings shoved another 60 days \u2014 which would be in mid-October. If the ex parte application had been successful, it could have had the unanticipated consequence of throwing rotten egg on the now AT&T-owned WB, the studio of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald which is set for a November release.\n\nAlready forced to weather more than a little controversy over Depp\u2019s participation in the JK Rowling\u2019s franchise and now under new bosses, the last thing WB would have wanted was the possible waft of Depp\u2019s dirty laundry \u2014 financial and otherwise \u2014 to come out during their peak press period for the tentpole pic.\n\nFortunately for the studio, who had nothing to do with today\u2019s actions, the Honorable Teresa Beaudet wanted to stick to the schedule and get things dealt with sooner rather than later. \u201cThe ex parte application is denied at this time,\u201d the LASC Judge wrote in longhand on the proposed order Friday.\n\nShe added, \u201cThe parties are to work with the discovery referee to create a schedule to complete the discovery prior to the FSC (final status conference).\u201d\n\n\u201cThe parties have agreed to and scheduled a mediation on July 14, 2018 before the Honorable Peter Lichtman (Ret.) of JAMS,\u201d noted Chew in the unsuccessful application with the court today. Chew is now with DC\u2019s Brown Rudick. Prior to that, he was with repping Depp at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP.\n\n\u201cThat date was the first available date that the parties and Judge Lichtman could conduct a mediation,\u201d Chew added. \u201cIn light of the close proximity of that mediation date to the August 15th trial date and the related pre-trial filing dates which back up from the August 3, 2018 Final Status Conference, without a trial continuance the parties will effectively had been required to complete virtually all of their discovery and trial preparation prior to attending the mediation. A brief trial continuance would enable the parties to some extent to conserve the resources which would otherwise be devoted to completing discovery and trial preparation to be used for settlement purposes at the mediation.\u201d\n\nNot so much, retorted the other side.\n\n\u201cAlthough the parties have scheduled a private mediation for July 14, 2018\u2014the first available date because of Depp\u2019s current rock n\u2019 roll tour\u2014continuing the trial date prior to the mediation would be counter-productive,\u201d said Team TMG.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to assume that the action will settle at the mediation, and continuing the trial date will only decrease the odds of settlement,\u201d the defense lawyers declared. \u201cThe discovery grounds upon which the Depp Parties seek a trial continuance are the result of their own gamesmanship, delay and lack of diligence.\u201d\n\nNow battling ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorney, Depp first sued The Management Group back in January 2017.\n\nAt the time and since, the actor alleged that, despite making hundreds of millions of dollars, he was feeling the financial pinch because of having been swindled in the Hollywood accounting shell game by those he trusted and the much-respected TMG.\n\nThe Management Group swung back with a countersuit of their own in early 2017 over unpaid commissions and tales of excess and irresponsibility \u2014 to put it very mildly. The suit proclaimed that the actor, who banks upt $20 million a picture plus a share of profits, had spending habits that were the real cause of his emptying bank accounts. Among the various residences, dozens of vehicles, tens of thousands a month on wine, guitar collection, artwork, hangers-on, sibling provisions, security, acting assistants and other indulgences, TMG\u2019s reaction revealed that the Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas star paid out $3 million to have Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s ashes shoot out of a cannon in 2005 and forks out more $2-million in monthly expenses.\n\nDoing himself a few favors as custodian of his own funds, Depp bragged to Rolling Stone that the cost for the tribute to Thompson was actually closer to $5 million and that he blew a lot more than $30,000 a month on wine.\n\nLate last year, before Depp started shedding lawyers faster than Jack Sparrow does goodwill, TMG add another lawsuit to the pyre. \u201cDepp listened to no one, including TMG and his other advisors, and he demanded they fund a lifestyle that was extravagant and extreme,\u201d the business managers stated in foreclosure filings against the actor for a $5 million loan TMG said they made to him to bail him out a few years back.\n\nAs the summer trial seems certain to occur, Depp himself was not in court today.
