I read the song and I go, \u2018Babe, it sounds like they\u2019re talking about us.\u2019 And she goes, \u2018Yeah. They made it for me.\u2019 I heard it for the first time and I knew it was going to be a smash the first time I heard it.\u201d\n\nLopez, 48, previously said \u201cEl Anillo\u201d is about women ready for the rock.\n\n\u201cThe song is definitely about that, it is, but I felt like it was kind of something that all women get to a point where they say, \u2018OK, what\u2019s up?'\u201d the thrice-married star explained. \u201cLike we\u2019re good, everything\u2019s great, what\u2019s going on? Am I staying or am I [going]?\u201d\n\nLopez and Rodriguez appear to be going full-speed ahead, ending their New York tour with a pit stop in the Bronx for Thursday night\u2019s Yankees game.\n\nThe Bombers fell to the Boston Red Sox 5-4, ending their eight-game hot streak.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/05/11/alex-rodriguez-responds-to-jennifer-lopezs-proposal-hints/", "title": "Alex Rodriguez responds to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s proposal hints", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
