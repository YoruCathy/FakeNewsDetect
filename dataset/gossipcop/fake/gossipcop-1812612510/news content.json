The two, who are set to be sisters-in-law when Markle marries Prince Harry in May, are certainly amicable. But there\u2019s a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.\n\n\u201cI think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other. You know they\u2019re neighbors in Kensington Palace and I know that Meghan enjoys going over to see Kate and the children, and she does enjoy that. I\u2019m told there\u2019s always an open invitation for her to be with Kate ever when she wants,\u201d royal expert and author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love told InStyle. \u201cI think that any animosity is probably a fabrication in the press. I\u2019ve never heard to suggest that they don\u2019t get along.\u201d\n\nImage zoom CHRIS JACKSON/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYou\u2019re right if you could hear the \u201cbut\u201d coming, though.\n\n\u201cI do hear plenty to suggest that they\u2019re quite different people and that have quite different interests and that Meghan is quite independent and very confident and very keen to I think establish her own network of friends over here in London,\u201d Nicholl added.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s certainly not to say she\u2019s snubbed Kate in any way. I think they do spend time together. But I think Meghan\u2019s keen not to rely too much on Kate and to have her own friends as well.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Markle certainly already has a group of good friends in London, as they were quick to throw her a lavish spa-themed bridal shower earlier in March. Middleton wasn\u2019t present at the three-day event, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything in terms of their relationship.\n\nImage zoom Chris Jackson/Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nWhen the two stepped out for Markle\u2019s first official event with Queen Elizabeth on March 12, the two exchanged very authentic-looking smiles outside of Westminster Abbey and even seemingly color-coordinated their looks.\n\nImage zoom PAUL GROVER/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWe have no doubt that they will continue to get closer over time\u2014especially if Meghan and Harry start a family of their own. The prince said in a November interview with the BBC that they hope to start one \"in the near future.\"", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F031218-meghan-kate-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DK6Moecu9", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F031218-meghan-kate-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DYnLrljZA", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2F1520878763%2F031218-meghan-kate-embed.jpg%3Fitok%3DVVt9cszO", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2F1520878763%2F031218-meghan-kate-harry-embed.jpg%3Fitok%3DBNj9c5SY"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F031218-meghan-kate-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DYnLrljZA", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Bahou"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-relationship", "title": "Why Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton Are Friendly, but Not BFFs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celebrity,The Royals,News,latest,Meghan Markle,Kate Middleton", "news_keywords": "Celebrity,The Royals,News,latest,Meghan Markle,Kate Middleton", "description": "This is what future sister-in-laws Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's relationship is really like.", "og": {"title": "Why Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton Are Friendly, but Not BFFs", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-relationship", "description": "There\u2019s a good reason why these two aren\u2019t attached at the hip.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F031218-meghan-kate-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DYnLrljZA"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-relationship", "description": "This is what future sister-in-laws Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's relationship is really like.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F031218-meghan-kate-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DYnLrljZA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-relationship", "title": "Why Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton Are Friendly, but Not BFFs", "description": "There\u2019s a good reason why these two aren\u2019t attached at the hip.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F03%2F031218-meghan-kate-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DYnLrljZA"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
