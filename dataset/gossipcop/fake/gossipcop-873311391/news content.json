But look a bit closer and there\u2019s something different about this particular town. A stone\u2019s throw from the Tesla and McLaren car dealerships of Palo Alto, Los Altos has an inordinate, almost absurd number of services that cater to children. A toy store is stuffed with puffy glitter stickers and neon science projects for kid geniuses. A farm-to-fork restaurant includes a nanny-staffed room for children so you can enjoy your meal in peace, and a 5,000-square-foot kids\u2019 science center with an electromagnetic ring toss and an exhibition about the way the wind moves on the ocean opened its doors in December.\n\nThis childhood fantasia didn\u2019t happen by accident: some of it is the result of urban-design investments made by Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google, and his wife, Anne Wojcicki (pronounced Wo-jit-skee), the most important couple in town\u2014and perhaps the most prominent young couple in Silicon Valley. With more than $30 billion in wealth\u2014much of it in special B-class stock that allows Brin to retain a good share of his voting power in Google\u2014they were ranked ninth among U.S. families in charitable giving last year, on their way to becoming Generation X\u2019s answer to Bill and Melinda Gates.\n\n\u201cSergey is a beloved oddball of a guy, and unlike [Google\u2019s current and former C.E.O.\u2019s] Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, he\u2019s the one who gets to do the cool stuff at Google,\u201d says an industry observer. \u201cHe said, \u2018Larry, you do the hard, prestigious work, and at the end of your life you\u2019ll do the fun stuff, like Bill Gates. But I\u2019m cutting out the bullshit and Davos and doing the fun stuff right now.\u2019 \u201d Wojcicki, in her professional life as well as her personal one, is a powerful woman with ambitions that are enormous, which she funnels into her genetic-testing company, 23andMe. Last fall, Fast Company put her on the cover as \u201cThe Most Daring CEO in America.\u201d\n\nWith two kids under six years old (hence the strong commitment to child-oriented activities in their town, even if the enterprise seems a bit Truman Show-like), the couple were widely seen as perfect for each other. Some people even called them \u201ctwins\u201d: they\u2019re the same age (40), went to elite universities, and are fanatical about the outdoors, yoga, and athletics. Brin likes springboard diving; Wojcicki rides an elliptical bike to work. Among the foremost examples of Silicon Valley\u2019s data-driven pragmatism and optimism, they fervently believe the world can be a better place and have devoted themselves to making it so through their many interlocking ventures and family foundation, to which they contributed $187 million last year.\n\nBut romantic scandals can happen even to those for whom \u201cgood fortune arrives in fairytale-like flurries,\u201d as The New York Times once wrote. The pair separated about 10 months ago. Last year Brin, a handsome, compact man with a toned physique, an enviable head of hair, and sparkling brown eyes, left the family\u2019s spread on a $7 million Los Altos lot while dating a Google employee in her mid-20s, Amanda Rosenberg\u2014who, in turn, ditched her boyfriend, then a prized executive at Google\u2019s Android arm, for Brin. Gossip about the situation ricocheted quickly among the upper echelons of the wealthy fortysomethings leading Silicon Valley. Making things even more complicated, Wojcicki, says a friend of the couple\u2019s, considered Rosenberg \u201ca friend.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008b624d691057695ee/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008b8f23e3a03159023/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac00851062027081ff7a4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vanessa Grigoriadis", "Vanessa Grigoriadi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair", "title": "Sergey Brin and Amanda Rosenberg: Inside the Google Co-Founder\u2019s Romance with the Google Glass Marketing Manager", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Vanessa Grigoriadis", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.", "id": "54cb02145106202708207238", "keywords": "society,google,technology,magazine,april 2014 issue", "news_keywords": "society,google,technology,magazine,april 2014 issue", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "54cb02145106202708207238", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/image.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/image.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Sergey Brin and Amanda Rosenberg:\u00a0Inside the Google Co-Founder\u2019s Romance with the Google Glass Marketing Manager", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Sergey Brin and Amanda Rosenberg:\u00a0Inside the Google Co-Founder\u2019s Romance with the Google Glass Marketing Manager"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
