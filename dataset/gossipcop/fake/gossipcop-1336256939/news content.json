That was the scariest moment of my life,\u201d Kanye told iHeartRadio in May. \u201cI thought I was going to get killed. My wife wasn\u2019t in town, so I told [my friends], \u2018Don\u2019t leave my side until my wife gets here.\u2019 And they have this moment where they\u2019re forced to leave your side, and that has to change \u2026 I can\u2019t express to you how traumatizing that moment is, and then you wake up drugged the f\u2014k out.\u201d\n\nWhen Kim Kardashian did return, she called in some help. She had motivational speaker Tony Robbins on speed dial and asked him to please come try to talk to her husband.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, which posted a lengthy interview with the rapper on Sunday, after his breakdown, Kanye had walked into the living room of his California home and found Tony Robbins \u201cwaiting for him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had been just a few months since the rapper, producer, fashion designer and cultural fire starter had gone through one of the most taxing periods of his public life: His wife was robbed at gunpoint, and a series of erratic concert appearances followed, culminating in a nine-day stint in the U.C.L.A. Medical Center. He was in a state of shambles, and it showed,\u201d they write. \u201cHe could look at me and you know, I don\u2019t know why he mentioned suicide, but he could tell that I was very low\u2026Really medicated, shoulders slumped down, and my confidence was gone, which is a lot of the root of my superpower, because if you truly have self-confidence, no one can say anything to you.\u201d\n\nRobbins \u201chad been summoned\" by Kanye\u2019s wife to stage something \"like an intervention.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is pretty insane to imagine. Robbins looked Kanye in the eyes and \u201cstarted issuing instructions\u201d to help him get his head right.\n\n\u201cMade him stand up, get into a warrior pose and scream\u2026\u2019I was so self-conscious about the nanny and the housekeeper that I didn\u2019t want them to hear me screaming in the living room,\u2019 Kanye said. I think that that\u2019s such a metaphor of something for the existence of so-called well-off people that they\u2019re not really well-off \u2014 they won\u2019t even scream in their own house,\u201d says the report.\n\n\u201cHe was reluctant. But he screamed.\u201d\n\nThe NYT goes on to say that Kanye's healing wasn\u2019t instantaneous, but it was a start.\n\nThe piece then shifts to Wyoming, visiting Kanye on a ranch there, which he\u2019d been visiting regularly since early 2017, a couple of months after his hospital stay.\n\n\u201cWe came here just for healing,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting my brain together and [expletive].\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was medicated then \u2014 he\u2019d recently received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder \u2014 but over time, he began \u2018learning how to not be on meds,\u2019 adding proudly, \u2018I took one pill in the last seven days.\u2019\u201d\n\nKanye opens up about thoughts of suicide, and fears his wife has wanted to leave him. He describes himself now like this, \u201cMy existence is salvage denim at this point, it\u2019s a vintage Herm\u00e8s bag. All the stains just make it better.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-kim-kardashian-kanye-tony-robbins.jpg?itok=yyu9bWws&timestamp=1530541903", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/all/modules/custom/common_site/images/transp-bg-60-black.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/scale--1800/public/2017/01/refresh_personalspace_3000x800.png?itok=p_hT2JOp&timestamp=1485473711", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/11/look-book-north-west.jpg?itok=wV4oGj-e&timestamp=1510755632", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/microsite-logo--mobile-1_5x/public/2018/06/personalspace-padding2x.png?itok=seQHTkDs&timestamp=1529946723", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-kim-kardashian-kanye-tony-robbins.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/embedded-related-post__1_5x/public/field_blog_image/2017/03/dish-030317-kim-bethenny.jpg?itok=ExkfZCtG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2016/01/dish-012716-kanye.jpg?itok=r_BYKf5I&timestamp=1453927921"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-kim-kardashian-kanye-tony-robbins.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marianne Garvey"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153/http://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/kim-kardashian-called-in-a-major-celebrity-to-intervene", "title": "Kim Kardashian Called in *This* Celebrity to Intervene When Kanye West Was at His Lowest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "vertical_name": "Personal Space", "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Called in *This* Celebrity to Intervene When Kanye West Was at His Lowest", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153/http://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/kim-kardashian-called-in-a-major-celebrity-to-intervene", "description": "Earlier this year Kanye West revealed a little bit about the breakdown that left him hospitalized in November 2016, saying he thought, at the time, that he was going to die.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-kim-kardashian-kanye-tony-robbins.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/kim-kardashian-called-in-a-major-celebrity-to-intervene", "title": "Kim Kardashian Called in *This* Celebrity to Intervene When Kanye West Was at His Lowest", "description": "Earlier this year Kanye West revealed a little bit about the breakdown that left him hospitalized in November 2016, saying he thought, at the time, that he was going to die.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180704231153im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/personal-space-kim-kardashian-kanye-tony-robbins.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-02T10:46:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-02T11:25:51-04:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530542760.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
