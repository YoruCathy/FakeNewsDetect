I\u2019ve never in my life said I didn\u2019t want to have children. I did and I do and I will!\u201d Well, here we are over a decade later, and Jen is ready to make that happen\u2026 with Brad Pitt!\n\n\u201cThe two have grown closer over the last couple of years,\u201d a friend told In Touch exclusively. \u201cHis marriage [to Angelina Jolie] fell apart, then her marriage to Justin [Theroux] ended. During that difficult time, Brad and Jen reconnected. It\u2019s like destiny brought them together, and I can definitely see them having a child together.\u201d\n\nOf course, Brad is already a father of six, and admitted that \u201cBeing a father has changed me on so many levels and made me more generous and alive.\u201d Jen is 49 and has never had children, so Brad could surely help her through it. \u201cHe and Jen have talked about moving in together and giving this another try,\u201d said the insider. \u201cThis could all lead to her finally having his baby.\u201d Brad \u201chas babies on the brain. He loves being a dad. It\u2019s a huge part of who he is.\u201d\n\nBecause of Jen\u2019s age, the chances of conceiving naturally are extremely slim, \u201cBut they would try,\u201d said her pal. If that doesn\u2019t work, they would move on to IVF. \u201cEven if it meant months of trying IVF. When Jen sets her mind to something, she doesn\u2019t stop until she succeeds.\u201d After their long and heartbreaking journey away from and now back to each other, \u201cIt\u2019s the blockbuster news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for.\u201d\n\nOf course, the idea infuriates Angie. \u201cIt\u2019s the ultimate slap in the face,\u201d said an insider. But they won\u2019t let Angelina stop them, \u201cI think the more they talk about starting a family, the more it makes sense.\u201d (A rep for Jen denied the story, while a rep for Brad had no comment.) \u201cThey both have changed over the years and, after much heartache, are at a great place in their lives,\u201d said the friend. \u201cBrad loves the idea of how they\u2019d both come full circle and found each other again. Having a child together seems like the perfect next step.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re different people now, and could give them the chance to right some wrongs. \u201cOne of Jen\u2019s greatest regrets is that they never had a baby together when they were married,\u201d said the friend. \u201cJen and Brad tried midway through their marriage, but she lost the baby and they were heartbroken. She\u2019s been wanting a baby ever since, but it just hasn\u2019t come together for her.\u201d\n\nJen has decided to sell her $25 million Bel Air mansion (which recently was featured on the cover of Architectural Digest) and plans to move into Brad\u2019s Pacific Palisades home so they can be under one roof. \u201cJen and Brad are seizing the now-or-never moment. They\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nRead more about Jen and Brad\u2019s baby plans in this week\u2019s issue of In Touch Weekly, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/it-1821-may-9.jpg?w=1180&h=1000&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jen-aniston-brad-pitt.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jennifer-aniston-blonde.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jen-aniston-brad-pitt.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jennifer-justin-awkward-run-in.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jen-aniston-brad-pitt.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-baby-159670/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt's Baby Plans: They're Ready", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\"I want to have it all,\u201d Jennifer Aniston declared in 2006 about juggling a career and a family. \u201cThe women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children;
