Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk the supposed drama. We\u2019re told it\u2019s entirely fabricated. According to OK!, Affleck\u2019s girlfriend is becoming increasingly frustrated by the actor\u2019s friendship with his estranged wife, so much so that she\u2019s given him an ultimatum. \u201cEvery time things seem to be going well, something happens to remind her that Jen and the kids come first,\u201d a so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine. Late last month, Shookus visited Affleck in Hawaii, where he\u2019s shooting the upcoming Netflix movie Triple Frontier. Meanwhile, Garner traveled to the tropical island with her and the actor\u2019s three kids over Easter weekend. Using this as a jumping off point, the publication claims drama erupted when the two women supposedly crossed paths. The alleged insider contends, \u201cJen and the kids stayed in a hotel, but when she showed up to Ben\u2019s rental, Lindsay was furious.\u201d This narrative is completely inaccurate. In reality, Shookus left Hawaii before Garner and her children arrived on the island. Still, the outlet\u2019s unreliable tipster says the tall, blonde \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer \u201cultimately blew up at Ben, telling him she\u2019s confused about his intentions and yelling, \u2018It\u2019s either her or me!'\u201d However, Shookus was last spotted in Hawaii on Tuesday, March 27, while Garner was first photographed on the island on Saturday, March 31. It\u2019s evident the two women never overlapped, further proving the magazine\u2019s storyline is bogus. Regardless of the tabloid\u2019s cover story being based on a false premise, Gossip Cop still checked in with multiple sources close to the situation, who exclusively assures us on background that there\u2019s absolutely no \u201clove triangle\u201d between the actor, his girlfriend and his estranged wife. On the condition of anonymity, one insider tells us that Shookus is completely understanding of Affleck and Garner\u2019s friendly dynamic, as well as his devotion to his kids. Our impeccable sources notes the TV producer shares a young daughter with her estranged husband, so she clearly understands the importance of co-parenting. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time OK! has attempted to create a nonexistent love triangle between the estranged spouses and a third party. Gossip Cop recently busted the magazine for falsely claiming that Affleck and Josh Duhamel were fighting over Garner. Only, Affleck isn\u2019t trying to reconcile with his estranged wife, and Duhamel, by his own admission, never ever pursued the actress in the first place. This latest narrative is more fiction from the repeatedly discredited outlet.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam Neeson is not \u201ctaken\u201d with Jennifer Garner, despite a new claim. Gossip Cop can bust a story falsely alleging the pair are on the verge of dating. A rep for Neeson confirms to us that the tale is untrue. But according to RadarOnline, Garner is Neeson\u2019s \u201cultimate dream woman\u201d and he \u201chas it bad\u201d for her. It\u2019s alleged \u201cJen caught Liam\u2019s eye\u201d as she filmed the upcoming movie Peppermint, which is helmed by Neeson\u2019s Taken director, Pierre Morel. \u201cNow Liam\u2019s hoping to be set up with her,\u201d a so-called \u201cinsider\u201d alleges to the site. And the ball is supposedly already rolling. The blog claims Garner was \u201cconsulting\u201d with Neeson for her role in the action-driven Peppermint and even studied his Taken franchise. Apparently the website is unaware that Garner spent years starring on the action-filled TV series \u201cAlias\u201d before Taken even came out. She would not need guidance from Neeson for such a part. Still, the outlet maintains he and Garner are now \u201ctalking more and more frequently.\u201d Asserts the specious source, \u201cThe fascination is mutual\u2026 They are flirting with the idea of going on an actual date, and Liam\u2019s leaning on his friend Pierre to help make it happen.\u201d But if Neeson and Garner are already bonding on their own, why would he need Morel to play matchmaker? With these red flags in mind, Gossip Cop checked in with Neeson\u2019s rep, who tells us the whole report is made-up \u201cB.S.\u201d Neeson is not pursuing Garner, nor is she looking to date him. There is no \u201clove connection\u201d in the offing, contrary to the online publication\u2019s contentions. There\u2019s also a blatant factual error, with the site claiming \u201cGarner\u2019s divorce from her husband, Ben Affleck, was finalized last year.\u201d It was recently the one-year anniversary of Garner and Affleck filing for divorce, but it has not been finalized yet. They are still legally married and, as People reported just days ago, are in private mediation as they work on an official settlement. It\u2019s also worth noting RadarOnline has spent much of the past year peddling wrong information about Garner, including a December article that bogusly claimed Ben Affleck dumped Lindsay Shookus to get back together with her. Meanwhile, the blog\u2019s sister outlet, the National Enquirer, falsely linked Neeson to Naomi Watts just over a year ago. In both cases, time has proven Gossip Cop\u2019s debunkings were correct. Affleck never dumped Shookus for Garner and Neeson never dated Watts. When he and Garner never actually strike up a relationship of their own, it\u2019ll be clear we\u2019re right here, too.

Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this nonsense. Not only is the actress not pregnant, but she hasn\u2019t been on the dating scene since her 2015 split. \u201cJen\u2019s Pregnancy Shocker\u201d reads a headline in the latest issue of OK! The accompanying article quotes an alleged \u201csource\u201d as saying, \u201cThere\u2019s talk in Jen\u2019s circle that she could be expecting. The rumor is that she\u2019s in the early stages and still deciding how to handle the situation.\u201d The outlet\u2019s questionable insider goes on to say that a pregnancy \u201cwould definitely come as a shock to Jen, as well as everyone around her.\u201d The first red flag is that the outlet uses terms such as \u201cthere\u2019s talk\u201d and \u201crumor is,\u201d which means the magazine isn\u2019t particularly confident in its own story. Still, the seemingly phony tipster further contends that Garner \u201cloves being single and playing the field,\u201d suggesting there are various men who could be the father of her unborn child. The so-called \u201cinsider\u201d first speculates Affleck is the dad because he spends so much time with his estranged wife. The next option is Duhamel, the actress\u2019s Love, Simon co-star. And finally, the tabloid floats that the baby could belong to a \u201chandsome mystery man\u201d who was spotted with the actress in Los Angeles earlier this year. This ridiculous article is wrong on so many different levels. For starters, \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d reported just last week that Garner \u201chas little interest in dating\u201d and is entirely focused on her kids and her career. The trusted entertainment news outlet further noted the actress plans to be \u201cvery careful and very selective\u201d when she does eventually start dating again. Considering that Garner hasn\u2019t been on a date since her 2015 separation, the tabloid\u2019s story clearly isn\u2019t true, but Gossip Cop will also address the magazine\u2019s rundown of supposed \u201cbaby daddies.\u201d E! News reported earlier this month that Garner and Affleck \u201care not getting back together at all,\u201d but continue to cordially co-parent their three kids. The actress\u2019s estranged husband, who\u2019s been in a relationship for more than a year with \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer Lindsay Shookus, didn\u2019t get Garrner pregnant. Meanwhile, Garner and Duhamel laughed off the rumors they were dating while promoting Love, Simon last month, so he\u2019s out of the running as well. As for the \u201cmystery man,\u201d the actress\u2019s rep assured Gossip Cop last month that she\u2019s single and not romantically involved with anyone, which backs up what Garner herself has been saying for quite some time. There\u2019s no \u201cpregnancy shocker.\u201d What\u2019s shocking is how off-base the tabloid\u2019s story is. Share The Facts OK!

Gossip Cop is taking a look back at this bust to see how our debunking has held up over time. 12 months have gone by, and it\u2019s apparent there was no romance blossoming between the Love, Simon co-stars, just as we rightly said. But on April 20, 2017, we called out the National Enquirer for claiming Garner was going out of her way to flirt with Duhamel as they filmed Love, Simon, which at the time was known as Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda. The shoot was taking place in the wake of Garner and Affleck filing for divorce, leading the tabloid to quote a so-called \u201cpal\u201d of the actress as saying, \u201cJosh is exactly what Jen needs right now.\u201d The gossip magazine\u2019s supposed source went on to vaguely assert Duhamel was \u201cmaking her see things in a whole new light.\u201d Meanwhile, Affleck was described as \u201cinsanely jealous,\u201d in part because \u201cJosh is even better looking than he is.\u201d The alleged tipster maintained to the outlet that Garner was set on \u201cramping up her flirting with Josh\u201d and was getting a \u201cthrill out of making Ben jealous.\u201d But contrary to the publication\u2019s contentions, nothing was going on between the co-stars. A trustworthy source close to Garner assured Gossip Cop on the condition of anonymity that there was \u201cno truth\u201d to claims she was not flirting with Duhamel to make Affleck jealous. As we noted back then, Duhamel was still married during the production. Duhamel and wife Fergie didn\u2019t announce their split until September, roughly five months later, and their breakup had nothing to do with a nonexistent flirtation with Garner. In fact, last fall Garner confessed that she was not even \u201cinterested\u201d in dating. Even earlier this month, \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d reported that while Garner wants the next person she dates to be \u201cin it for the long run,\u201d she\u2019s still in \u201cno rush to return to the dating scene.\u201d And while the tabloids again tried to link Garner to Duhamel this year, the actor himself actually shot down such claims on multiple occasions. Last month for example, Duhamel acknowledged Garner is an \u201cincredible woman,\u201d but complained about the false narrative being spread about them. He told E! Online, \u201cIt does truly amaze me what some of the things that are printed. It\u2019s like, how is that even legal?\u201d The actor also noted that they only filmed together for \u201ca week and a half, two weeks.\u201d Surely if Garner was actually trying to make Affleck \u201cjealous,\u201d she and Duhamel wouldn\u2019t have shut down the romance rumors. And she would\u2019ve made a point to be seen with him apart from shooting and promoting their film. But Garner and Duhamel have never once been seen together in a non-work capacity. Nor she has been seen moving on with any other guy, even though Affleck is in a relationship with Lindsay Shookus. Clearly, the National Enquirer story was entirely wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\nJennifer Garner is not heartbroken over Josh Duhamel supposedly getting cozy with Megan Fox, despite a tabloid report that\u2019s wrong on every level. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. The entire narrative is based on lies. According to OK!, Garner is suffering another \u201cromantic letdown\u201d after sparking a relationship with Love, Simon co-star Duhamel, who\u2019s now allegedly pursuing Fox on the set of their upcoming movie, Think Like a Dog. \u201cJosh has had a crush on Megan since the beginning,\u201d a so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine. \u201cThey starred in two Transformers movies together, and he goes gaga when he gets to do a scene with her.\u201d The outlet\u2019s questionable insider goes on to say that Garner wasn\u2019t exactly blindsided by the situation, despite being upset. \u201cAfter everything Jen\u2019s been through, she isn\u2019t naive. She wasn\u2019t throwing her eggs all in one basket,\u201d adds the seemingly phony tipster. \u201cShe likes Josh and thinks he\u2019s handsome and very sexy, but she\u2019s telling friends that maybe this is a sign she should step back.\u201d There\u2019s nothing remotely true about any of this. For starters, Garner and Duhamel laughed off dating rumors while promoting their movie in March. Their denial came on the heels of Gossip Cop debunking countless stories about the two being a couple. The Love, Simon co-stars have never been romantically involved, so this latest article is provably untrue from the start. The second aspect of the tabloid\u2019s story is no more accurate. Gossip Cop called out NW earlier this week for falsely claiming that Duhamel wanted to start dating Fox, who happens to be married with three children. The actor\u2019s own rep assured us the two have a friendly and professional relationship. Meanwhile, \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d recently reported that Duhamel is currently dating actress Eiza Gonzalez. There\u2019s no love triangle between Garner and Fox. Additionally, OK! seems to come up with random storylines on a whim. Last month, Gossip Cop busted the publication for falsely claiming that Garner was pregnant and the baby might belong to either Duhamel, Ben Affleck or a \u201cmystery man.\u201d Tellingly, this latest report makes no mention of any pregnancy. The pattern here is becoming fairly obvious. As soon as Duhamel starts working with an attractive female co-star, the tabloids throw him into a nonexistent romance with her. Now that it\u2019s become abundantly clear the actor isn\u2019t dating Garner, the magazine is trying to save face by claiming he dumped her for Fox. The untrustworthy outlet is just bombarding its readers with lies.\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\nJennifer Garner remains one of Hollywood\u2019s most likeable stars. She sells movies and magazine covers, something that is not lost on the tabloids. As a result, the gossip media tends to use the actress for a lot of made-up stories. Gossip Cop is taking a look at five recent rumors about Garner below. In mid-April, RadarOnline announced Liam Neeson was \u201ctaken\u201d with Garner, who was deemed his \u201cultimate dream woman.\u201d The website quoted a so-called \u201cinsider,\u201d who maintained the \u201cfascination\u201d was \u201cmutual.\u201d Claimed this supposed source, \u201cThey are flirting with the idea of going on an actual date.\u201d Of course, the stars have yet to be seen together, and fans shouldn\u2019t be hoping they\u2019ll step out on a red carpet any time soon. A rep for Neeson exclusively told Gossip Cop that the romance report was complete \u201cB.S.\u201d Just days later, the site\u2019s sister publication, OK!, published a crazy story claiming Garner was pregnant, and the father might be estranged husband Ben Affleck, Love, Simon co-star Josh Duhamel or a \u201cmystery man.\u201d In highly suspicious language, an alleged \u201csource\u201d maintained, \u201cThere\u2019s talk in Jen\u2019s circle that she could be expecting. The rumor is that she\u2019s in the early stages and still deciding how to handle the situation.\u201d This \u201ctalk,\u201d however, was all wrong. A rep for Garner had already confirmed to Gossip Cop that she wasn\u2019t involved with anyone, and that was backed up by \u201cEntertainment Tonight,\u201d which reported Garner has \u201clittle interest\u201d in dating. There was no secret relationship and no pregnancy. Meanwhile, NW wanted readers to believe Garner and Affleck were giving their marriage \u201canother shot.\u201d A purported \u201csource\u201d claimed the actor was \u201changing onto the hope that they\u2019ll get back together,\u201d while she\u2019d \u201clove for them to be a family again.\u201d The outlet even went as far as claiming they had decided to \u201crevive their marriage.\u201d But this wasn\u2019t the least bit factual. Though People reported that the dynamic between Affleck and Garner was \u201cpretty good\u201d one year after their divorce filing, they had no intention of reconciling romantically. On the contrary, their friendly relationship is to benefit their kids, and Affleck remains committed to girlfriend Lindsay Shookus. The National Enquirer recently opted to go in a somewhat different direction, alleging Garner was spending time with Affleck to get him \u201cback into shape.\u201d But the publication insisted she had ulterior motive, contending she was \u201cgetting a kick out of controlling his workouts and diet\u201d after he \u201cwrecked their marriage with his boozing, gambling and cheating.\u201d While boasting that she was \u201cenjoying watching him suffer,\u201d the tabloid\u2019s \u201cinsider\u201d also claimed Garner was doing Affleck a \u201cfavor,\u201d since he needed to slim down to play Batman again. As Gossip Cop pointed out, however, Affleck isn\u2019t even sure if he\u2019ll be suiting up as Batman again, and while he\u2019s been seen working out with Shookus, he and Garner are more likely to be spotted with their kids at church. Most recently, OK! abandoned its pregnancy narrative last week for a piece claiming Garner was heartbroken over Duhamel getting supposedly cozy with Megan Fox. Here, the magazine maintained the \u201cAlias\u201d star was dealing with another \u201cromantic letdown\u201d because the actor was more interested in Fox than her. But Gossip Cop had already debunked untrue claims of a blossoming relationship between both pairs, and Garner and Duhamel themselves even laughed off rumors about them dating. The outlet was now trying to make a love triangle, even though Duhamel wasn\u2019t involved with her or with the married Fox. This angle was just as fictitious as Garner\u2019s nonexistent pregnancy. Though Garner is happily single as she raises three children and continues her successful career, the gossip media still prefers to focus on her love life. That apparently means putting her into phony relationships, love triangles, pregnancies and reunions. These scenarios rarely resemble reality, and, as explained above, there\u2019s usually plenty of readily available evidence to disprove them. Fans should keep that in mind the next time these tabloids are on display.\n\n\n\nBen Affleck and Jennifer Garner are not \u201ctogether again\u201d in the gym, despite a new report claiming the actress is helping her estranged husband get \u201cinto shape.\u201d Not only is this untrue tale reminiscent of a previously debunked story, but there is zero proof to support it. In fact, Gossip Cop can point out evidence that disproves it. This inaccurate article comes from RadarOnline, which begins by declaring, \u201cBen Affleck is back with Jennifer Garner\u2026 in the gym at least.\u201d The site, in cruel terms, claims \u201cthe bloated Batman star has enlisted his estranged wife to whip him back into fighting shape.\u201d A so-called \u201cinsider\u201d contends that Affleck \u201calways leaned on Jen to help him focus on a regime as well as prepare his gym routine and meal plans\u201d during their marriage. Now that he\u2019s seemingly put on weight and is in \u201cterrible shape,\u201d the blog\u2019s supposed source alleges Garner \u201cagreed to help him\u201d slim down. On top of overseeing his fitness routine, the actress is \u201calso taking charge of his diet, putting him on a detox plan,\u201d maintains the outlet. Adds the purported tipster, \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge getting Ben back on track but she\u2019s into it. The kids see him so out of shape, so that\u2019s a motivation too.\u201d But the website notably has no photos of the exes at the gym together. It illustrates its story with individual, undated paparazzi shots of Affleck and Garner following separate sessions. And the last time they were pictured together, just a few days ago, Garner and Affleck were at their son\u2019s baseball game, not working out. In contrast, it was with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus that Affleck was seen kayaking back in March. Of course, the actor doesn\u2019t need a wife or a girlfriend to oversee his health regimen. Through his movie career, Affleck has access to top trainers, nutritionists and more. It is those experts who guide his fitness and diet plans. In fact, in 2016, Affleck and his longtime trainer spoke with Men\u2019s Journal about transforming his body for Batman V Superman. So, to recap, the Oscar winner is on record about relying on a professional trainer for his health needs, there is no evidence of him currently working out with Garner, and there are recent photos of him exercising with Shookus. But that\u2019s not all. More than a month ago, the National Enquirer claimed, and RadarOnline regurgitated online, that Garner was getting Affleck into shape. The two sister outlets had nothing to substantiate its contentions then, and the site still doesn\u2019t now.\n\n\n\nBen Affleck is selling his Savannah-area home, but it\u2019s not because he needs the cash to pay off Jennifer Garner in their divorce. One actually has nothing to do with the other. Gossip Cop can separate fact from fiction. In late May, it was revealed Affleck had listed his Georgia compound, which is located on Hampton Island Preserve, more than thirty miles outside of Savannah. He purchased the property in 2003, but hasn\u2019t spent much time there in the last two years. Now RadarOnline is trying to connect his decision to sell the estate to his ongoing divorce from Garner. It\u2019s specifically alleged a \u201ccash-starved\u201d Affleck is \u201cselling assets to pay her off.\u201d A so-called \u201csource\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cBen is selling because of the divorce. He needs the cash, which will go to Jen as part of the settlement.\u201d Yet while multiple outlets weeks ago covered the news of Affleck putting the residence up for sale, no reputable publications connected the decision to his split from Garner. Similarly, none have reported anything about him being in financial trouble. In fact, in evidence that\u2019s he not, Affleck purchased a $19 million home in Pacific Palisades in April. If he was in such dire straights financially and needed to conserve money for his divorce, he needn\u2019t have purchased such a pricey abode. In comparison, the Georgia compound is on the market for only for $8.7 million. It\u2019s apparent then that Affleck is not \u201ccash-starved.\u201d It seems the real reason he\u2019s decided to ditch the Southern estate is because he just doesn\u2019t need it. Affleck hasn\u2019t been spotted there since filming Live By Night on the property in the fall of 2015, at which time he also lived there for the production. If it was a vacation home that he used regularly, it might seem odd that he was suddenly parting ways with the compound. But it appears roughly two and a half years have passed since he\u2019s stayed there, so it\u2019s not exactly eyebrow raising that he\u2019s decided to unload it. An Affleck confidante, who declined to speak on the record, tells Gossip Cop it\u2019s \u201cnot true\u201d he\u2019s selling the residence to pay for his divorce from Garner. It should also be noted that RadarOnline has little credibility when it comes to reporting on the estrange couple. Last December, we busted the website for falsely claiming Affleck dumped Lindsay Shookus to win back Garner. And while the National Enquirer is running a virtually identical story about the property sale in its print edition this week, the site\u2019s sister tabloid lied about Shookus being pregnant with Affleck\u2019s baby last fall. Neither outlet can be trusted.\n\n\n\nBen Affleck never asked Jennifer Garner to get back together a year ago, despite a poorly-timed report. Exactly 12 months ago, Gossip Cop explained how and why the story was wrong. Now time has made its inaccuracy even clearer. On July 7, 2017, we rightly busted Life & Style for claiming Affleck was \u201cpushing for an official reconciliation\u201d after he and Garner took a family vacation to the Bahamas, despite their marital estrangement. Since the trip went well and they were supposedly \u201cso happy back together,\u201d it was alleged Affleck wanted to formally reunite. \u201cBen asked Jen to call off the divorce,\u201d a so-called \u201cinsider\u201d was quoted as saying. The tabloid\u2019s alleged tipster went on to contend the actor was hoping \u201cJen will realize what a great time they had on vacation and want to move forward together.\u201d And with their divorce not yet settled, \u201cBen isn\u2019t going down without a fight,\u201d maintained this questionable source. But as Gossip Cop pointed out then, the \u201cinsider\u201d couldn\u2019t have really been in-the-know because its purported inside information on the former couple was all wrong. As opposed to working on winning Garner back, Affleck had actually moved on. The very same week the magazine peddled this narrative, it was revealed Affleck was dating Lindsay Shookus. At the time, it was reported by E! Online that while the relationship was in the \u201cearly stages,\u201d it was also \u201cmore than a summer fling.\u201d The passage of time has shown just how right that was, and how wrong the tabloid was about a reunion with Garner. 365 days have gone by, and Affleck and the \u201cSNL\u201d producer are still together, while his divorce from Garner is still proceeding. In fact, People reported just a few days ago that Affleck and Shookus will be spending the summer together in Los Angeles while \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d is on hiatus. \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d also recently did a story exploring how Affleck and Shookus may not be at the marriage stage yet, but their relationship is \u201cstill going strong.\u201d Meanwhile, Life & Style has continued to spread misinformation. Last November, the magazine pretended it never peddled a tale about Affleck wanting to reunite with Garner and offered a new article alleging he and Shookus were \u201csecretly engaged.\u201d Gossip Cop corrected that at the time, and in the aforementioned \u201cET\u201d story from two weeks ago, it was specifically stressed, \u201cBen isn\u2019t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon.\u201d So, this much is apparent: Life & Style was wrong last year claiming Affleck was asking Garner to get back together when he was actually moving on with Shookus. And the outlet was also wrong last fall when it alleged he and Shookus were \u201csecretly engaged.\u201d Gossip Cop will continue to hold the publication accountable when it comes to reporting on Affleck and all stars.\n\n\n\nJennifer Garner did not \u201cblock\u201d Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus\u2019 wedding, despite reports. Gossip Cop can debunk untrue these stories. As we\u2019ve already reported, the actor is not ready to marry his girlfriend, regardless of the status of his separation from Garner. Sister outlets the National Enquirer and RadarOnline published identical articles on Wednesday contending Garner \u201crefuses to sign her divorce papers,\u201d thereby preventing Affleck from tying the knot with Shookus, \u201cwho\u2019s rumored to be pregnant.\u201d The publications accuse Garner of \u201cstonewalling Affleck\u2019s demand to finally put an end to their two-year divorce battle \u2014 because she doesn\u2019t want her ex to marry\u201d the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d producer, \u201ceven if she\u2019s expecting.\u201d The same so-called \u201cinsider\u201d is quoted in both stories as saying, \u201cBen is trying to speed things along in their divorce but Jen is stalling.\u201d Without offering any specifics, this supposed source alleges, \u201cEvery attempt he\u2019s made is met with resistance.\u201d Affleck is described as \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201cangry,\u201d with the purported snitch also claiming, \u201cLindsay is living in L.A. with him and she intends to stay.\u201d It\u2019s a huge red flag, though, that this questionable \u201cinsider\u201d makes all these assertions, yet doesn\u2019t seem to know for sure whether Shookus is pregnant. There\u2019s further reason to be skeptical of this specious snitch when it\u2019s claimed \u201cfriends are saying\u201d Garner is allegedly delaying the divorce\u201d because \u201cLindsay\u2019s encroaching upon her territory to become Mrs. Affleck.\u201d The phrase \u201cfriends are saying\u201d indicates that this purported \u201cinsider\u201d doesn\u2019t have any firsthand knowledge of what is or isn\u2019t going on, nor do the tabloid and the website. There\u2019s more suspicious phrasing when it\u2019s asserted, \u201cNow she\u2019s hearing what people are saying \u2014 that Lindsay\u2019s pregnant \u2014 and she\u2019s terrified she\u2019ll lose Ben and that he\u2019ll marry Lindsay.\u201d Garner needn\u2019t fixate on what \u201cpeople are saying\u201d when she could simply ask Affleck herself, making this contention particularly illogical. There\u2019s also a factual error in the line about a \u201ctwo-year divorce battle.\u201d Not only has there not been a \u201cbattle,\u201d but two years haven\u2019t passed since the estranged spouses filed their legal papers. Garner and Affleck filed for divorce in 2017, with the one-year anniversary just coming a few months ago in April. The claim that Shookus \u201cintends to stay\u201d in L.A. is also wrong. People has already reported that while she and Affleck are spending the summer together in Los Angeles, \u201cShe maintains a residence in New York City and will have to be on the East Coast more once the new season of \u2018SNL\u2019 begins filming in the fall.\u201d As for a marriage between Affleck and Shookus, \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d recently reported that he \u201cin no rush to get married again,\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t ready to propose.\u201d And Garner is not the reason why. Rather, the outlet explained Affleck \u201cwants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He\u2019s actually been told to take it slow and he\u2019s heeding that advice.\u201d In fact, Gossip Cop already busted RadarOnline earlier this week for falsely claiming Affleck and Shookus want to have a \u201cshotgun wedding\u201d in Hawaii. It was also alleged in that piece that the Emmy winner is \u201cexpecting.\u201d But in addition to having no sign of a baby bump, E! Online recently reported that Shookus was drinking wine on a double date with Affleck and her parents late last month. Conclusion: There are a number of provable errors throughout these articles from Radar and its sister tabloid, the Enquirer. They both wrongly claim it\u2019s been \u201ctwo years\u201d since Affleck and Garner filed for divorce, and untruthfully maintain Shookus is planning to \u201cstay\u201d on the West Coast permanently. And while the publications contend she and Affleck are ready to wed and may have a baby on the way, there\u2019s substantial evidence and reliable reporting from others in the media that show none of that is accurate. Meanwhile, no proof is offered to back up any of the allegations, including the claim that Garner is \u201cblocking\u201d a (nonexistent) wedding from happening by holding up a divorce. On top of all this, Affleck\u2019s rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that there is \u201cno truth\u201d to this narrative.\n\n\n\nLoading...\n\nIs Jennifer Garner \u201cbegging\u201d Ben Affleck to a \u201csecond chance\u201d? That\u2019s what one of the tabloids wants readers to believe. But Gossip Cop can bust the bogus story. According to the Globe, Garner is still \u201cdesperately in love\u201d with her estranged husband, and is \u201cbegging the boozing bad boy to dump his live-in lover and return to her arms.\u201d A so-called \u201cfriend\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cShe\u2019s told Ben point-blank she wants him back. He was stunned. But she\u2019s begging him to consider it. He said he would.\u201d Though Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus have supposedly moved in together, Garner \u201cjust can\u2019t see life without him,\u201d asserts the purported pal, claiming, \u201cBen was \u2014 and is \u2014 the love of her life and she can\u2019t give him up.\u201d The outlet even alleges the actress has \u201cturned down dates in hopes he\u2019ll return to her and their kids.\u201d Maintains the purported tipster, \u201cShe regrets giving up on Ben and wants to try again.\u201d The publication further contends Garner \u201ctried to move in on Ben\u201d during their time in Hawaii a few months ago. Though the trip was so their children could spend their Easter break with the actor as he filmed in the Aloha State, the article suggests Garner had an ulterior motive and \u201creally enjoyed\u201d the time she spent with Affleck. Actually, E! Online reported back in April that Garner was giving Affleck \u201calone time with the kids,\u201d and she was seen exploring Honolulu without him. Shortly after, in a piece about how fans won\u2019t give up on Garner and Affleck as a couple, the outlet stressed, \u201cThey are not getting back together at all. They are both moving on.\u201d Nothing has changed, despite what the tabloid is claiming. In fact, this story contains a few falsehoods. While Affleck and Shookus are spending the summer together in Los Angeles, she is not living with him full-time. She has her own place in L.A., People has reported, and she\u2019ll be back in New York when production for \u201cSNL\u201d starts up again this fall. And while the magazine takes a cheap shot at the actor by calling him a \u201cboozing bad boy,\u201d Entertainment Tonight recently did a story on Affleck and Shookus in which it was specifically stressed how he\u2019s focusing on his sobriety. In that piece, it was also noted that Garner \u201cwants to keep encouraging him and knows the importance of her children having both parents in their lives.\u201d Nothing was said about her wanting to reconcile romantically. That Garner hasn\u2019t started dating since their breakup shouldn\u2019t be misconstrued as a sign she\u2019s still holding a torch for Affleck. What it really shows is that her focus remains on her children and her career. Lastly, Gossip Cop already busted the tabloid\u2019s sister publications, RadarOnline and the National Enquirer, this week for falsely claiming Garner is \u201cblocking\u201d Affleck from marrying Shookus by refusing to finalize their divorce. Even Affleck\u2019s own rep confirmed that isn\u2019t true.\n\n\n\nIs Ben Affleck begging Jennifer Garner to finalize their divorce so he can quickly marry Lindsay Shookus? That\u2019s the premise behind a new tabloid story. Gossip Cop, however, looked into the claim and it\u2019s not true. According to Life & Style, Affleck is tired of waiting for Garner to legally end their marriage because he wants to wed Shookus and is even exploring legal remedies. An unnamed \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine, \u201cHe has made it clear to Jen that unless the divorce is finalized by September, he\u2019d have no choice but to arrange a court date.\u201d Affleck has already bought a ring and wants to \u201cmarry Lindsay as soon as he can,\u201d contends the outlet, which adds, \u201cBen\u2019s getting awfully tired of waiting\u201d for Garner to sign off on the divorce and wants to \u201cmake things permanent with Lindsay.\u201d The alleged insider maintains, \u201cJen isn\u2019t as ready to move on\u201d and is dragging her feet when it comes to finalizing the divorce papers. \u201cShe never expected him to want to remarry again so soon,\u201d offers the so-called \u201csource.\u201d However, asserts the unidentifiable tipster, Garner \u201cknows that unless she stops stalling the process, things could take a bitter turn.\u201d The reality, however, is that their separation is far from acrimonious. Recently, Affleck and Garner were spotted together laughing in a Los Angeles park. Also, Garner posted as loving tribute on Instagram to Affleck on Father\u2019s Day. And just a few days ago, Garner and Affleck took their kids to \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d on Broadway, and it was noted how they\u2019re in a \u201cgood place.\u201d It\u2019s true a little more than a year has gone by since Garner filed for divorce, but the actress is not \u201cstalling the process.\u201d A number of variables go into a split, including working out a division of assets, custody arrangements and child support, to name a few. Additionally, Affleck\u2019s sobriety is part of both his divorce from Garner and possibly getting more serious with Shookus, with whom he currently has no plans to wed. As previously reported, Garner needs to make sure Affleck remains sober, as part of their custody agreement. Similarly, although their relationship is progressing nicely, Affleck is not marrying Shookus in the near future because he\u2019s been told to slow down and focus on his sobriety. \u201cBen isn\u2019t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon,\u201d further notes \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201d And People also reports Affleck and Shookus are \u201cnot rushing anything.\u201d Even with all the overwhelming proof to debunk the tabloid\u2019s article, Gossip Cop reached out to the two stars\u2019 reps. While a spokesperson for Garner didn\u2019t comment, a source close to the actress tells us the magazine\u2019s premise is \u201cnot true.\u201d And a rep for Affleck also assures Gossip Cop the narrative about Affleck begging his estranged wife for a divorce so he can marry his girlfriend is \u201cuntrue.\u201d It\u2019s interesting that Life & Style claims the actor now has a ring and wants to get married because it previously alleged Affleck and Shookus got secretly engaged nine months ago. It\u2019s also the same outlet Gossip Cop busted when it falsely reported Affleck asked Garner to get back together. The magazine\u2019s untraceable (and possibly nonexistent) sources have been wrong before and are once again with this latest article about how Affleck is begging Garner to finalize their divorce so he can marry Shookus, who is still legally wed to her estranged husband.\n\n\n\nJennifer Garner and Lindsay Shookus are not \u201cboth pregnant\u201d with Ben Affleck\u2019s babies, contrary to a new tabloid cover story. Garner and Affleck also have not \u201ccalled off\u201d their divorce. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust these untruths. The latest cover of Star features photos of Garner and Shookus that were taken from side angles, giving the false illusion of protruding stomachs. These misleading pictures are being used to sell an entirely fabricated narrative about Affleck impregnating both women. It\u2019s evident right in the sub-headline inside the issue that this is all bogus, with the magazine writing, \u201cSources Say Ben Affleck May Be Gearing Up For New Babies \u2014 With Both His Girlfriend And His Ex-Wife!\u201d Garner is not Affleck\u2019s \u201cex-wife,\u201d as they are still legally married, and the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d indicates the outlet doesn\u2019t have any legitimate confirmation to back up its claims. In fact, the publication goes on to contend Affleck \u201ccould be expecting a child not only with Lindsay \u2014 but also with Jen.\u201d Notably, neither \u201cmay\u201d nor \u201ccould\u201d appear on the cover, where it\u2019s declared Shookus and Garner are \u201cboth pregnant.\u201d The tabloid lures readers in with what appears to be an announcement, but then changes course in the actual story, which is apparently about the possibility that they\u2019re both carrying the actor\u2019s babies. Following this bait-and-switch, a so-called \u201csource\u201d calls the situation a \u201cmess,\u201d but asserts \u201cthe initial shock is wearing off,\u201d and Affleck is \u201cactually feeling good about it.\u201d But how is it not known for sure then whether or not Garner and Shookus are expecting? The logic is faulty throughout the piece. It\u2019s alleged that Affleck possibly impregnated Garner when he supposedly spent the night at her home back on March 7. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret Ben was trying to woo Jen back, even while seeing Lindsay,\u201d claims the tabloid\u2019s untraceable \u201cinsider,\u201d while the unnamed \u201csource\u201d theorizes Affleck and Garner \u201cmay have had a brief magic moment\u201d during the unverified \u201csleepover.\u201d Meanwhile, another anonymous \u201cinsider\u201d contends that unidentifiable \u201cpeople\u201d are now \u201cbuzzing she\u2019s pregnant, and that the timing lines perfectly up with the night Ben slept at her place.\u201d As for Shookus, the magazine asserts she\u2019s \u201crumored to be pregnant, too,\u201d with another purported \u201csource\u201d alleging there\u2019s \u201ctalk of a baby on the way.\u201d She and Affleck are said to be \u201cboth very happy, in spite of the unusual circumstances,\u201d which is a clear contradiction from the cover line that maintains Shookus\u2019 \u201cbaby joy\u201d has been \u201cshattered.\u201d In another red flag, there\u2019s nothing said in the article about Affleck and Garner calling off their divorce, despite that also being touted on the front of the issue. Gossip Cop also already busted this same outlet a few weeks ago for falsely claiming Shookus is pregnant. As we pointed out then, just days before that tale was published Shookus and Affleck went on a double date with her parents, where she was seen drinking wine. That same weekend, Shookus and Affleck were photographed on a hike with her family, and it was clear from her pictured bared midriff that she does not have any kind of a baby bump. That was on June 24, a week after the misleading June 16 photo of Shookus that Star uses on its cover. Basically, she didn\u2019t have a baby bump and then eight days later it disappeared. In regards to the actor reconciling with his estranged wife, People examined the state of Affleck and Garner\u2019s relationship on the one-year anniversary of the divorce filing, and reported that while they co-parent and support one another, he is in a \u201cvery committed relationship\u201d with Shookus. That means no dalliances with Garner. Furthermore, Garner just did a YouTube live stream with Martha Stewart this week, and it\u2019s apparent from the video that she, too, doesn\u2019t have a baby bump. The photo of Garner on the cover was taken on July 4, a full 12 days before her later flat-stomach appearance with Stewart. Conclusion: More recent photos of Garner and Shookus than the ones used by the tabloid show that neither of them has a baby bump. There is also independent reporting about Shookus drinking wine after the cover picture was taken, and another reputable outlet has reported that Garner and Affleck aren\u2019t involved romantically any more. That rules out pregnancies for both women. In addition to all this transparent evidence, Garner\u2019s spokesperson, who is authorized to speak on her behalf, confirms to Gossip Cop that she is neither pregnant nor having a rendezvous with Affleck. For his part, Affleck\u2019s rep tells us on the record that the double pregnancy cover story is \u201cso crazy\u201d and untrue that it\u2019s \u201camusing almost.\u201d And a Shookus confidante, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, calls the claims both \u201chilarious\u201d and \u201cnot true.\u201d Share The Facts Star Magazine\n\nBen Affleck\u2019s estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, and current girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus, are both pregnant with his babies. \u30b7\u30a7\u30a2\u3059\u308b\n\n\u7d9a\u304d\u3092\u8aad\u3080 \u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9 \u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3078\u306e\u57cb\u3081\u8fbc\u307f\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u60c5\u5831 oEmbed\u306e\u30ea\u30f3\u30af https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5802f9b6-4f0c-41a6-8504-1726e4aeb58e\n\n\n\nDid Jennifer Garner really say she\u2019s \u201cnot ready to divorce\u201d Ben Affleck? That\u2019s the untruthful claim coming from one of this week\u2019s tabloids. Gossip Cop can debunk the allegation with video proof. The new cover of OK! Australia features the teaser, \u201cJen\u2019s Heartbreaking Interview: \u2018I\u2019m Not Ready To Divorce Ben.'\u201d Inside the issue, the same alleged quote appears in the headline, with the magazine claiming Garner \u201creveal[ed] why she hasn\u2019t finalized their split.\u201d The outlet is referring to Garner\u2019s recent interview with the CBS show \u201cSunday Morning,\u201d which broadcast a nine-minute profile of the actress this past Sunday. During the segment, she spoke candidly about the difficulty of living under tabloid scrutiny during her relationship with Affleck, and in the wake of their 2015 breakup. \u201cThere was a solid decade where there was five or six cars minimum, and easily up to 15 or 20 on the weekends, outside of my house at all times. And looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I could cry talking about it,\u201d Garner said. She went on, \u201cWhat I think I learned is that scrutiny on your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married because you think that will end the, \u2018Are they engaged or are they not?\u2019 And that\u2019s true in the reverse as well. If there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloid decides there\u2019s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny \u2014 everyone says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had to go through this in public.\u2019 The public isn\u2019t what\u2019s hard. What\u2019s hard is going through it.\u201d The outlet features some of these quotes in its article, but adds in the line, \u201cI\u2019m not ready to divorce Ben.\u201d As the full CBS video of Garner\u2019s interview shows, she never uttered such a quote, nor did she ever say anything remotely similar. This is an indisputable fabrication. The publication also claims that, though the actress and Affleck split three years ago, she \u201cadmits that even now, it\u2019s hard to let go.\u201d Again, the footage shows Garner said nothing like that. The \u201cstress\u201d to which she referred was entirely about the paparazzi staking out her home throughout the marriage, and \u201clooking back on that,\u201d as she said, can make her emotional. The tabloid maintains Garner \u201copened up about struggling to cope with the breakdown\u201d of the relationship when that\u2019s clearly not the case. She also never \u201crevealed\u201d why they haven\u2019t finalized the divorce. On top of those blatant falsehoods, the magazine also quotes an \u201cinside source,\u201d who accuses Garner of \u201cstalling\u201d the divorce, and claims she\u2019s \u201cterrified\u201d of losing Affleck to his girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus, amid \u201crumors\u201d that the \u201cSNL\u201d producer \u201ccould be pregnant.\u201d These \u201csource\u201d quotes, however, are plagiarized from the National Enquirer and RadarOnline, which Gossip Cop busted more than a week ago for wrongly contending Garner was \u201cblocking\u201d Affleck and Shookus from having a wedding. Even though those outlets were inaccurate in their allegations, OK! doesn\u2019t bother to provide attribution and instead passes off the quotes as their own. Similarly, the article ends this way: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Ben will be a tough act to follow. \u2018He\u2019s the love of my life,\u2019 she sadly admits. \u2018What am I going to do about that?'\u201d Again the tabloid doesn\u2019t credit the original publication, likely because these quotes are two years old and from Garner\u2019s first post-split interview with Vanity Fair in 2016. But they\u2019re presented here as current statements, as if they may be from Garner\u2019s CBS profile, when they are unequivocally not. Conclusion: The cover of OK! and the headline of its article feature the quote, \u201cI\u2019m Not Ready To Divorce Ben.\u201d But the full video of Garner\u2019s interview with CBS News, which is what the story is about, shows she never said that. The tabloid also doesn\u2019t provide any context for additional quotes from Garner, presenting them as recent comments when they\u2019re actually from an interview that was conducted a few years ago with a separate publication. In addition, the magazine plagiarizes from two fellow gossip outlets. This transparent fact-check makes it evident that the story is full of lies and misinformation.\n\n\n\nJennifer Garner and Ben Affleck broke up in 2015, and last year, he went public with a new relationship with Lindsay Shookus. Though he has very clearly moved on, Garner hasn\u2019t opted for a new romance just yet. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the tabloids from making up fictional ones. Below, check out five wrong dating rumors about the actress below. Just over a year ago, OK! announced Garner was in a \u201crevenge romance\u201d with Chris Pine. \u201cChris and Jen have been seeing each other on the down-low for a little while now,\u201d a so-called \u201cinsider\u201d was quoted as saying. At the same time, though, it was claimed they were stepping out at the Sunset Tower and going on afternoon hikes. Yet the stars, who are routinely photographed by paparazzi, were never seen together. That\u2019s because they weren\u2019t dating, and this cover story was fabricated out of thin air, as Gossip Cop said 12 months ago. Time has since proven our reporting was correct. Earlier this year, Pine started dating Annabelle Wallis. In March, the National Enquirer wanted readers to believe Garner had a \u201cnew guy,\u201d an unnamed lawyer whom she already introduced to her family over a New Year\u2019s vacation. As the story went, Garner and her kids initially spent Christmas in Montana with Affleck, but once he left, the purported beau and her family arrived to continue the holiday celebration. Tellingly, it was not said how Garner and the unidentifiable attorney met, or even why the magazine was running this narrative months after the alleged rendezvous. The outlet also failed to acknowledge that a mere month before the holidays, Garner admitted she\u2019s not interested in dating. And, as Gossip Cop noted, her spokesperson further confirmed she was still single. The following month, in April, the publication\u2019s sister site, RadarOnline, peddled a bogus romance narrative about Garner and Liam Neeson. The actor was said to be \u201ctaken\u201d with the mom of three, and \u201choping to be set up with her.\u201d An untraceable \u201cinsider\u201d claimed the pair bonded through her upcoming action film Peppermint, and maintained, \u201cThe fascination is mutual\u2026 They are flirting with the idea of going on an actual date.\u201d When Gossip Cop investigated, however, a rep for Neeson told us the tale was \u201cB.S.\u201d There was also a clear factual error, with the blog wrongly contending Garner had \u201cfinalized\u201d her divorce from Affleck \u201clast year.\u201d In actuality, the legal proceedings are ongoing, and it was the one-year anniversary of Garner filing for divorce just days before this misinformation was peddled. Throughout the first half of 2018, OK! ran a number of phony articles about Garner being in a relationship with Josh Duhamel. This culminated in May, when the tabloid alleged she was suffering another \u201cromantic letdown\u201d because he was supposedly now getting close with Megan Fox. A so-called \u201csource\u201d asserted, \u201cShe likes Josh and thinks he\u2019s handsome and very sexy, but she\u2019s telling friends that maybe this is a sign she should step back.\u201d The problems here were two-fold: As Gossip Cop had already reported, and as the Love, Simon co-stars themselves had confirmed, Duhamel and Garner were not dating. But he wasn\u2019t pursuing a romance with the married Fox, either. In fact, the actor is currently dating Eiza Gonzalez. Just last week, Star offered what is perhaps the most outrageous rumor of the bunch with a cover story claiming Garner and Shookus are \u201cboth pregnant\u201d Affleck\u2019s babies. It was alleged he possibly impregnated his estranged wife during a \u201csleepover\u201d at her home on March 7. An anonymous insider insisted, \u201cPeople are buzzing she\u2019s pregnant, and that the timing lines perfectly up with the night Ben slept at her place.\u201d Suspiciously, the cover of the issue said Garner was calling off their divorce, but nothing was mentioned about that in the actual article. Regardless, all of the contentions were untrue, both their spokespeople assured Gossip Cop on the record. We also uncovered a YouTube video from two days before this report that showed Garner has no baby bump whatsoever. Garner has also been falsely linked to neighbors, various \u201cmystery\u201d men, and even Patrick Dempsey. There\u2019s no reason to believe the star won\u2019t re-enter the dating world eventually. But all of these reports have been wildly premature and inaccurate.
