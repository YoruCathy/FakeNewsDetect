Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she\u2019s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.\n\n\u2018Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they\u2019re just friends and that he\u2019s committed but Jen just isn\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s very wary of him \u2013 after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.\n\n\u2018While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she\u2019s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that\u2019s how everything worked out,\u2019 reveals the insider.\n\nAfter her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.\n\n\u2018She had been sad it never happened,\u2019 a source told the magazine. \u2018But it never consumed her.\u2019\n\nBut since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.\n\n\u2018This could be a dream come true for her, and she\u2019s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that\u2019s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.\u2019\n\nOver the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.\n\nIn the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: \u2018This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don\u2019t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,\u2019 she told Allure.\n\nDenying that was the case, she said: \u2018No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.\u2019\n\nFor the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/26858/jennifer-aniston-pre.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/26858/jennifer-aniston-pre.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
