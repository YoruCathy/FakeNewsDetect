A source close to Gwen told HL EXCLUSIVELY the reason why they call each other \u2018husband & wife\u2019!\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton had fans thinking they might have gotten married after Gwen posed for a picture with her brother Todd\u2019s wife Jen on Jul. 29 during the couple\u2019s Florida vacation. However, fans mistook Jen for Blake\u2019s sister Endy, and since Gwen called Jen her \u201csister-in-law\u201d in the caption, some people (believing Jen to Endy) wrongly believed that this was a cryptic clue that maybe, just maybe Gwen and Blake got married. On top of that, a source close to Gwen confirmed to us EXCLUSIVELY that the two have not gotten hitched. \u201cGwen and Blake haven\u2019t gotten secretly married, but they\u2019re always joking around and calling each other husband and wife,\u201d our source said. \u201cGwen and Blake have spoken about getting married, and it\u2019s something that they definitely do want to do one day, but they\u2019re really happy with the way things are right now, and they\u2019ve both been married before so they don\u2019t see the point of rushing things.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes down to it, Gwen and Blake have a great thing going on \u2014 the two were photographed on July 1 in a LA convenience store looking like a perfect modern family along with Gwen\u2019s kids \u2014 so why would they mess with that? \u201cNeither Gwen or Blake want to jinx what they have,\u201d our source added. \u201cIt\u2019s so perfect as it is, and they\u2019re aware that sometimes getting married can add an extra pressure to a relationship, and they don\u2019t want to risk that right now. Plus, their schedules are so busy, that logistically it would be kind of a headache trying to arrange a wedding, so they\u2019d rather wait till Gwen\u2019s residency is over and take their time so they can do it properly and plan something really beautiful and special, when the time is right.\u201d\n\nAnd beyond that, they don\u2019t want to rush into marriage. If anything, they want to make sure everything goes perfectly with their wedding when the time comes. \u201cThey want to take their time and do things properly,\u201d our source continued. \u201cThey want to make sure their love lasts forever.\u201d", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/blake-gwen-married-ftrl.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/blake-gwen-married-ftrl.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F29%2Fare-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-secretly-married-husband-wife-names%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3256800", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tim_mcgovern.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/blake-gwen-married-ftrl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Mcgovern", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/29/are-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-secretly-married-husband-wife-names/", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Secretly Married?
