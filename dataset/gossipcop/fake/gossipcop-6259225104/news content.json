But we\u2019ve never actually seen the daughter and son of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. On a recent podcast, Kutcher explained why.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have chosen a career where we\u2019re in the public light, but my kids have not,\u201d Ashton told Arianna Huffington on The Thrive Global Podcast. \u201cI think they should have the right to choose that and I actually don\u2019t think that they should have images of them as children that are out there, that somebody could potentially blackmail them with. It\u2019s their private life; it\u2019s not mine to give away.\u201d\n\nHe did almost give it away at the beginning. Shortly after Wyatt\u2019s birth in 2014, he shared several photos of different babies, refusing to identify which one was his daughter.\n\n\u201cMila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cCan you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute.\u201d\n\nKutcher and Kunis aren\u2019t alone in their decision to shield their children from the public eye. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell are also known for keeping their kids off social media. And outside of the celebrity circuit, plenty of parents choose to keep their Facebook feeds child-free. And like Kutcher, they explain it\u2019s more about their child\u2019s autonomy than safety concerns.", "images": ["https://static.thebump.com/v2/shared/share-icons/share_facebook_filled.svg", "https://media.front.xoedge.com/images/b0c3e021-ca3c-41f6-b800-b984ef5c38bd~rs_1080.h", "https://media.front.xoedge.com/images/b0c3e021-ca3c-41f6-b800-b984ef5c38bd"], "top_img": "https://media.front.xoedge.com/images/b0c3e021-ca3c-41f6-b800-b984ef5c38bd", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thebump.com/news/ashton-kutcher-no-kids-photos-online", "title": "Why Ashton Kutcher Doesn't Post Photos Of His Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height", "robots": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow", "description": "See why Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis don&#39;t post any photos of their children on social media.", "keywords": "TheBump.com - Pregnancy, Parenting and Baby Information, Baby Names, Pregnancy Information, Parenting Tips, Parenting Forums, Baby Names, Pregnancy Information, Parenting Tips, Parenting Advice, Baby Advice", "fb": {"app_id": 44019285167}, "og": {"url": "https://www.thebump.com/news/ashton-kutcher-no-kids-photos-online", "type": "article", "title": "Why Ashton Kutcher Doesn't Post Photos Of His Kids", "description": "See why Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis don&#39;t post any photos of their children on social media.", "image": "https://media.front.xoedge.com/images/b0c3e021-ca3c-41f6-b800-b984ef5c38bd"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "gogGyhKqEkZ_R1Gfjc1awdDQwz0C_S-li99X36mxeMV", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "next-head-count": 24}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.thebump.com", "summary": ""}
