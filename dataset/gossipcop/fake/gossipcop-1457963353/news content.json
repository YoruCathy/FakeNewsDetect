She\u2019s a singer, an actress appearing in \u201cThe Saints and Sinners\u201d and Tyler Perry\u2019s \u201cMeet the Paynes.\u201d She also had a stint in reality TV on \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta.\u201d Her latest role takes place in a world we have never seen, set in an alternate, present-day America.\n\n\u201cMotherland: Fort Salem\u201d takes place in an America, where witches ended their persecution 300 years ago by cutting a deal with the U.S. government to fight for their country. The series follows three young women from basic training in combat magic into terrifying and thrilling early deployment. In this world, the traditional roles of gender and power are flipped with women on the front lines, the fight looming and terrorist threats that are strikingly familiar to our world, but with supernatural tactics and weapons\n\nMcKinney plays Anacostia, a tough but wryly humorous drill sergeant whose chief concern is keeping the young recruits alive through basic training. McKinney spoke with EURweb\u2019s Jill Munroe about preparing for the new role, why reality TV isn\u2019t for her, and how she\u2019s been surviving quarantine.\n\nJill: You\u2019re in Atlanta, how are you handling sheltering in place?\n\nDemetria: We\u2019re making the best of it. We are glad that we have separate corners of the house to go to when we need to. It\u2019s literally just me and my son here. And we have three dogs. So he\u2019s got his space. He\u2019s got his quarters or whatnot, and I\u2019ve got my own space and we\u2019ve got different places to go if we need a change of venue. So we\u2019ve been just really cognizant of making sure that we don\u2019t step on each other too much.\n\nJill: And how have you been kind of keeping your spirits up through this?\n\nDemetria: Well, that first week, chile, it was a trial. But then I got into the mode of introspection, a lot of meditation, just really kind of looking into where I\u2019ve come from, where I am, where I want to be and how I get there. The last couple of years have been a whirlwind of work, which has been great, but I missed a lot of time with my son. And so just reconnecting with him, binge-watching shows, getting in the kitchen together, we\u2019ve been doing some gardening together. He\u2019s working on music, so just giving him some tips and tools to use with that.\n\nThat\u2019s been kind of the focus for me. As well as planning for other projects to come, looking into the future, things of entertainment that I\u2019d like to be a part of and figuring out how to make that thing happen.\n\nMORE NEWS: DJ Jazzy Jeff Opens Up to Will Smith About His Battle with Suspected Coronavirus [VIDEO]\n\nJill: So speaking of entertainment and you kind of touched on it, you have over the past few years, been across pretty much every aspect of entertainment. You\u2019re acting, you\u2019re singing, you touched reality TV for a minute. What are the differences for you as far as moving through those different places in entertainment and your approach?\n\nDemetria: Oh, that\u2019s a loaded question. As far as the reality space, I realized, one that it\u2019s just not for me. I think that, you know, everybody loves entertainment and everything has its space, but, the opportunity to tear somebody down for a rating is not something that I necessarily want to be a part of.\n\nAs far as like, getting into music, that\u2019s the reality I want to be in. If I\u2019m going to be showing myself, I want to show myself by my own terms, in my own words and really, expressively and artistically, where somebody can relate to it and pick themselves up or relate to it and say, you know what, I\u2019m about to pack every bag I got that. I want to be the real reality for myself with my music and thankfully, people understand that and were rocking with it.\n\nAs far as the other shows that I\u2019ve done, the art of being able to tell somebody else\u2019s story with truth, with dignity, with honesty, regardless of what the circumstance is, is something that I really, really grown to love and learn from. I remember those days when you know, back in the beginning days of The Cosby Show, when you sat and you watched and you actually got a chance to discuss the things that were happening in the show and you sparked conversation with your kids, and you really got a chance to kind of delve into each other\u2019s worlds and understandings. And that\u2019s what I feel like I\u2019ve gotten a chance to do with House of Payne, or even A House Divided, Saints and Sinners. And now, going into Motherland, this fantasy space \u2014 that\u2019s a whole best of both worlds. Like, I get to be real, I get to be mystical. I get to be magical. I get to be strong. I get to reclaim woman power, like it\u2019s just amazing. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything.\n\nJill: Okay, so let\u2019s talk about Motherland. One of the things that\u2019s really amazing about this show is the fact that the alternate universe is the female lead. So before we get into the specifics of your character and everything that she\u2019s kind of going through, do you think that the world would be much different if women were in power? Because I think power corrupts, and I think that there are certain things that no matter what, people in power kind of end up succumbing to, not all, but some. So I feel some of the battles would be the same. But what about you?\n\nDemetria: I feel that power is fluid. I think that certain powers that are naturally given to all of us as humans are from time to time tested and given to a specific sect of people. Whether we\u2019re talking about women\u2019s rights, whether we delve into slavery, whether we look into the Holocaust, there\u2019s always been a struggle for power. How it would change if a woman was involved, I think that Motherland paints a nice picture of what the possibilities are, but I think power shifts and moves according to the intention of the personalities behind it.\n\nLook at the legislation, the difference between Obama and Trump \u2014 vastly different, both male, one\u2019s different than the other. So what I love about this realm with Motherland and the women being in power is that one thing we don\u2019t do is diminish the power of other. You have an African American female president. You have a woman who\u2019s been alive for over 300 years, who was a witch who was leading the Army. You have the recruits being all female and understanding that their vulnerabilities are their strengths, you know, I think that\u2019s the biggest difference. As women, we understand the nurturing, we understand the vulnerability of it all. And we don\u2019t necessarily run from that. And that may cause a little bit more empathy while still keeping the powerful strength that we possess intact.\n\nSo I hope it would be a little better, but I like the fact that we get to explore that option in Motherland.\n\nJill: Okay, So, getting into that in your character, I read that your mother was in the military. What did you take from her and her experience and apply to your role?\n\nDemetria: Oh, my gosh, I took many things from my mother to play Anacostia. I took her strength and her silence. You know that Mama look when you\u2019re doing something you ain\u2019t got no business doing, you don\u2019t have to say anything, everybody straightens up. I definitely took that from her and applied it. I think that her sternness was the biggest strength that I was able to add to Anacostia. The layers that start to reveal themselves later actually come from my single motherhood. I raised one kid, hallelujah, God knew not to do that again. But, understanding that there has to be a level of compassion, understanding that there has to be understanding within that. Understanding that you\u2019re not always right, even as a parent, as an adult, whatever, what you\u2019ve been through, you don\u2019t know every and all.\n\nSo I wanted to make sure that she definitely let them know at the end of the day, they could trust her. At the end of the day, they knew that she loved them, it was just a different way and that balance was something that was really important to me.\n\nMotherland: Fort Salem airs TONIGHT, Wednesday
