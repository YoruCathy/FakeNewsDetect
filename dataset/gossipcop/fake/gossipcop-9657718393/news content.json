Malibu singer has a hilarious response to the baby bump rumours\n\nShe wrote: \"RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a s\u2014 ton of tufurkey.\"\n\nEven after that, Hollywood Life reported that the Wrecking Ball singer wanted to get 'pregnant ASAP' with fiance Liam Hemsworth.\n\nAn insider reportedly told the website, \"Miley's totally ready to start a family with Liam.\"\n\nAlthough she did not appreciate the speculations that she was pregnant \"because it is something she has thought about for a while that hasn't happened yet.\"\n\nRUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a shit ton of tufurkey pic.twitter.com/rjNjquxvLb \u2014 Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 23, 2017\n\nThe source reiterated: \"She wants to be married, she wants to start a family but Liam isn't 100% ready for all of that just yet. She can only hint about it so much.\"\n\nHence those kinds of baby bump rumours have driven her crazy \"because she would want nothing more than for those rumours to be true.\"\n\n\"Miley is just waiting for Liam to be just as ready as she has become. She knows that it is all in time but if it was up to her, she would love to speed up the process,\" the source also told Hollywood LIfe.\n\nBut as usual, Gossip Cop exposed the truth behind all these speculations and claimed that the insider's statement is entirely fabricated.\n\nGiven that, the Hollywood Life's report looks contrary to its own insider's statements. While Miley herself rubbished all the pregnancy rumours on Twitter during Thanksgiving, how is it possible that she told the insider about her willingness to get pregnant?\n\nBesides this, the songstress clarified in a radio interview a few months back that she is in no rush to have kids. Talking to 104.3 Myfm, Cyrus said, \"No, I love pigs more than kids, to be honest.\"\n\nThus it is quite clear that the story about Cyrus wanting to \"get pregnant ASAP\" and \"have babies with Hemsworth\" is entirely made up.", "images": ["https://graphic1.ibtimes.co.in/www/img/logo-stack.png", "https://graphic1.ibtimes.co.in/www/responsive/latest/home.png", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/664638/miley.jpg"], "top_img": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/664638/miley.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Asmita Kundu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/miley-cyrus-pregnancy-singer-wants-have-baby-liam-hemsworth-750840", "title": "Miley Cyrus Pregnancy: The singer wants to have baby with Liam Hemsworth?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "english", "author": "Asmita Kundu", "copyright": "2020 IBTimes", "subject": "Miley Cyrus Pregnancy: The singer wants to have baby with Liam Hemsworth?", "description": "The songstress recently denied all the pregnancy-related rumours in a tweet during Thanksgiving.", "keywords": "Miley Cyrus,Miley Cyrus Pregnant,Miley Cyrus pregnancy rumours,Miley Cyrus pregnancy,Miley Cyrus wants to be pregnant,Miley Cyrus Liam Hemsworth,Miley cyrus baby bump,Miley Cyrus babu bump rumour,Liam Hemsworth", "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-26T12:52:45+05:30", "modified_time": "2017-11-26T12:52:45+05:30", "section": "Gossip", "tag": "Liam Hemsworth", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ibtimes.india"}, "og": {"title": "Miley Cyrus Pregnancy: The singer wants to have baby with Liam Hemsworth?", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/miley-cyrus-pregnancy-singer-wants-have-baby-liam-hemsworth-750840", "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/664638/miley.jpg", "description": "The songstress recently denied all the pregnancy-related rumours in a tweet during Thanksgiving.", "type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times, India Edition"}, "DC.title": "Miley Cyrus Pregnancy: The singer wants to have baby with Liam Hemsworth?", "DC.description": "The songstress recently denied all the pregnancy-related rumours in a tweet during Thanksgiving.", "DC.subject": "Miley Cyrus,Miley Cyrus Pregnant,Miley Cyrus pregnancy rumours,Miley Cyrus pregnancy,Miley Cyrus wants to be pregnant,Miley Cyrus Liam Hemsworth,Miley cyrus baby bump,Miley Cyrus babu bump rumour,Liam Hemsworth", "news_keywords": "Gossip,Miley Cyrus,Miley Cyrus Pregnant,Miley Cyrus pregnancy rumours,Miley Cyrus pregnancy,Miley Cyrus wants to be pregnant,Miley Cyrus Liam Hemsworth,Miley cyrus baby bump,Miley Cyrus babu bump rumour,Liam Hemsworth", "syndication-source": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/miley-cyrus-pregnancy-singer-wants-have-baby-liam-hemsworth-750840", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"title": "Miley Cyrus Pregnancy: The singer wants to have baby with Liam Hemsworth?", "description": "The songstress recently denied all the pregnancy-related rumours in a tweet during Thanksgiving.", "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/664638/miley.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ibtimes_india", "domain": "www.ibtimes.co.in", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/miley-cyrus-pregnancy-singer-wants-have-baby-liam-hemsworth-750840"}, "fb": {"pages": 134755750024728, "app_id": 1386147698272496}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511680965.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in", "summary": ""}
