The former Laguna Beach star may have gotten his start on reality TV, but would the single star ever return to his roots to find love?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a single man. Yes, so The Bachelor season 47,\u201d Colletti, 32, said to Us during our \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d podcast.\n\nHowever, after a little more thought it appears that Colletti will not be going on any group dates anytime soon. The Everyone is Doing Great star told Us, \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t [go on The Bachelor.] I think we\u2019ve handled enough realty TV on this end.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he wouldn\u2019t consider making an appearance on the hit ABC show, but his former One Tree Hill costar James Lafferty would have to tag along.\n\n\u201cWe hand out the roses,\u201d Colletti told Us. \u201cJust the rose holder. You [Lafferty] come in not saying anything. That looks like Nathan Scott, James Lafferty. He\u2019s on The Bachelor?! \u201c\n\nAll kidding aside Lafferty, 33 reveals he is \u201crespectfully spoken for\u201d in the dating department, while Colletti, who once dated Kristin Cavallari, is still looking.\n\n\u201cThere is not a type of girl I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Colletti told Us. I\u2019m open. Open for applications.\u201d\n\nBut for right now Colletti and Lafferty are focusing on getting their pilot Everyone is Doing Great to air. They recently enlisted the help of their former One Tree Hill costars Sophia Bush and Antwon Tanner, once again sparking rumors of a reunion.\n\n\u201cWe do get this question a lot,\u201d Lafferty told Us. \u201cAnd it\u2019s super flattering because there\u2019s nothing more validating than people saying they want to see more of something that you made, which is great. But first of all, not that much time has passed since the show ended. You kind of feel like a little bit more time should pass before a reunion happens. It\u2019s like in high school, you don\u2019t really have a reunion until 10 years out. Right?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut aside from that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anyone on the cast that would say no to it.\u201d\n\nFans can donate to Lafferty and Colletti\u2019s Everyone Is Doing Great Indiegogo campaign here.\n\nSubscribe and listen to the \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d podcast!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colletti-and-James-Lafferty.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colletti-and-James-Lafferty.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1023px%2C537px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colletti-and-James-Lafferty.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1023px%2C537px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Garibaldi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/is-stephen-colletti-headed-to-the-bachelor/", "title": "Is Stephen Colletti Headed to 'The Bachelor'?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Stephen Colette and James Lafferty sat down with Us Weekly to talk dating, \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 and a possible \u2018One Tree Hill\u2019 reunion \u2014 listen!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Get Your Roses Ready: Is Stephen Colletti Headed to 'The Bachelor'?!", "description": "Stephen Colette and James Lafferty sat down with Us Weekly to talk dating, \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 and a possible \u2018One Tree Hill\u2019 reunion \u2014 listen!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/is-stephen-colletti-headed-to-the-bachelor/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-08-02T19:26:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colletti-and-James-Lafferty.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1023px%2C537px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colletti-and-James-Lafferty.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1023px%2C537px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "podcast", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-08-02T19:12:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-02T19:26:31+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Stephen Colette and James Lafferty sat down with Us Weekly to talk dating, \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 and a possible \u2018One Tree Hill\u2019 reunion \u2014 listen!", "title": "Get Your Roses Ready: Is Stephen Colletti Headed to 'The Bachelor'?!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Stephen-Colletti-and-James-Lafferty.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1023px%2C537px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533237165.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
