The former NBA star spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about his tell-all book and reveled what inspired him to finally share his story.\n\n\u201cI\u201dm very excited to work with BenBella Books, Inc. to release my very first book! My fans have always been the best and I really wanted to release this book to give you all a chance to get to know Lamar Odom and my real story, directly from me,\u201d the 38-year-old athlete told Us on Tuesday, June 26. \u201cI hope to [be] an inspiration to many that you can overcome adversity and challenge no matter where you fall from.\u201d\n\nUs broke the news in February that Odom\u2019s \u201cjuicy\u201d page-turner will cover his battle with drug use, his career in the NBA and marriage to Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. An insider now tells Us that the basketball star will reflect on his tumultuous relationship with the Good American founder, 33, and discuss \u201cwhat led to the end\u201d of the marriage.\n\nThe former Lakers star made headlines in October 2015 when he was hospitalized for a near-fatal drug overdose at a Nevada brothel. The Kardashian clan rushed to his side and helped aide him back to health. \u201cHe will also talk about \u2026 what really went on in those hospital doors and what the world didn\u2019t get to see as well as rehab,\u201d the source adds. \u201cWe get to read about a side of Lamar Odom we never got to see on Keeping Up With the Kardashians or Khloe & Lamar nor on the basketball court.\u201d\n\nOdom opened up about his sobriety during a March 2017 interview with Us and revealed that the Revenge Body host helped him stay clean. \u201cHell, yeah [I was surprised she was at my side]. She played a major role in me getting my memory back,\u201d he admitted. \u201cShe would bring pictures of my mother and grandmother.\u201d\n\nOdom\u2019s tell-all will hit shelves in February 2019.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=115px%2C0px%2C1652px%2C867px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1888px%2C1066px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=115px%2C0px%2C1652px%2C867px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lamar-odoms-book-will-reveal-why-his-marriage-to-khloe-kardashian-ended/", "title": "Lamar Odom\u2019s Book Will Reveal Why His Marriage to Khloe Kardashian Ended", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Lamar Odom is opening up about his split from Khloe Kardashian, battle with drug use and career in the NBA in his upcoming tell-all book \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lamar Odom\u2019s Book Will Reveal Why His Marriage to Khloe Kardashian Ended", "description": "Lamar Odom is opening up about his split from Khloe Kardashian, battle with drug use and career in the NBA in his upcoming tell-all book \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lamar-odoms-book-will-reveal-why-his-marriage-to-khloe-kardashian-ended/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=115px%2C0px%2C1652px%2C867px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=115px%2C0px%2C1652px%2C867px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Kardashians", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-26T22:40:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lamar Odom is opening up about his split from Khloe Kardashian, battle with drug use and career in the NBA in his upcoming tell-all book \u2014 get the details", "title": "Lamar Odom\u2019s Book Will Reveal Why His Marriage to Khloe Kardashian Ended", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lamar-odom-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=115px%2C0px%2C1652px%2C867px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530052832.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
