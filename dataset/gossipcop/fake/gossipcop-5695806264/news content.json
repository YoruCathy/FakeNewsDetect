As if six children wasn\u2019t enough of a handful, Angelina Jolie is excited to expand her family once the Brad Pitt divorce is behind her. The actress wants to adopt more kids from all around the world, and we\u2019ve got the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\nAngelina Jolie, 41, has a heart of gold! Smack in the middle of a messy Brad Pitt, 53, divorce, the humanitarian is still thinking of sweet ways she can make the world a better place \u2014 specifically for a few lucky children! \u201cAngelina is going to continue to adopt kids in the future,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe feels that it certainly makes a difference. With her current children getting older and the resources she has to accommodate that, it will only be a matter of time before she expands her brood.\u201d Where will she go next?\n\nThe First They Killed My Father director has adopted children all over the world, including Cambodia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam. While pregnant with daughter Shiloh, Angie and Brad actually traveled to Namibia to avoid the photographers and Hollywood hype. As for twins Vivienne and Knox, the actress spent two weeks inside a hospital in Nice, France before their arrival. It\u2019s likely that Angie will voyage to another third-world country for her future adoptions. This time, however, the Fight Club hunk won\u2019t be invited.\n\n\u201cShe would like to clear up everything with Brad before going through with it,\u201d the source continues, \u201cbut if the divorce process takes longer to complete, she\u2019s OK with moving forward with adopting. Whenever it feel right, really.\u201d With Angie\u2019s kids growing up so fast, it makes sense that she doesn\u2019t want empty nest syndrome. Her teenagers will be off to college in the blink of an eye, and the feeling of having toddlers around is too great to pass up. We can\u2019t wait for Angie\u2019s next chapter to begin!\n\nHollywoodLifers, how many children do you think Angie will adopt and from which countries?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-ready-to-adopt-more-kids-once-divorce-from-brad-pitt-is-behind-her-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-ready-to-adopt-more-kids-once-divorce-from-brad-pitt-is-behind-her-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F03%2F09%2Fangelina-jolie-adopting-more-kids-brad-pitt-divorce%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2500269&comment_count=25", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/140c0e0fd0ad702646ff54aed53914eb?s=64&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-ready-to-adopt-more-kids-once-divorce-from-brad-pitt-is-behind-her-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Radvan", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/03/09/angelina-jolie-adopting-more-kids-brad-pitt-divorce/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Ready To Adopt More Kids Once Divorce From Brad Pitt Is Behind Her", "meta_data": {"description": "The more the merrier!
