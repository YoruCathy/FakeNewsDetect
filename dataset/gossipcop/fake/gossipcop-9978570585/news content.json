Tricky!\n\nIt was thought that the Kylie had gone into labour on Saturday 13 January, sending fans wild over the idea that baby Jenner was about to enter the world.\n\nThe rumour was hinged on a screenshot of text messages from somebody claiming their \u2018friend\u2019s friend\u2019s sister\u2019 (another reliable source) was working at Cedar-Sinai Hospital \u2013 the hospital all the Kardashian sisters have given birth in \u2013 and saw Kylie being checked into the labour ward.\n\nYeah right, \u2013 as if Kylie wouldn\u2019t book an entire floor to herself.\n\nKylie and Travis are on the countdown to the arrival of their alleged baby (Picture: Getty)\n\nThen, a Snapchat from Travis Scott on a private jet with the caption \u2018Make it home to ya one way or another\u2019 had everyone believing the rapper was racing to the hospital to witness the birth of his child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, calm down, folks \u2013 that Snapchat was actually sent in December, and Kylie isn\u2019t in labour.\n\nAnyway, TMZ reported that the lip kit mogul isn\u2019t even due this month, so the rumours that she\u2019s pushing out the heiress to her cosmetics fortune are false.\n\nKylie\u2019s sister Khloe, 33, is six months pregnant with her first child, having confirmed the happy news last month.\n\nAnd Kim\u2019s surrogate is set to give birth any day now \u2013 this will be Kim and Kanye\u2019s third child, after North, 4, and Saint, 2.\n\nMetro.co.uk have contacted reps for Kylie and Travis for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
