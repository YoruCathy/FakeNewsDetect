Angelina + Jenny Shimizu 1996 pic.twitter.com/KuDB7LwmzA \u2014 Andrea Ant (@_Andrea_Ant) September 20, 2016\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s third marriage, to actor Brad Pitt, now appears to be over \u2014 but there was an earlier relationship in her life that the superstar said could have led to yet another marriage, this one to a woman. For several years in the 1990s and early 2000s, Jolie was heavily involved in a lesbian romance with model and actress Jenny Shimizu. Shimizu is an out lesbian and Jolie has acknowledged her own bisexuality.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about the 49-year-old San Jose, California, native Shimizu, Jolie\u2019s former girlfriend.\n\n1. The Couple Met On The Set of the 1996 Teen Drama \u201cFoxfire\u201d\n\nEven though Jolie would be married in March of 1996 to her first husband, British actor Jonny Lee Miller, she described meeting Shimizu during the casting process of Foxfire \u2014 a melodrama about five teen girls who take revenge on their sexual abuser \u2014 as such a powerful experience that she was certain the Japanese-American actress had stolen her lead role as \u201cLegs Sadovsky.\u201d\n\nThe young Jolie said it was love at first sight with Shimizu.\n\nangelina jolie and jenny shimizu appreciation post pic.twitter.com/ALmJzZlbrp \u2014 sporty spice (@themermaidwitch) September 20, 2016\n\n\u201cI fell in love with her the first second I saw her,\u201d Jolie said in a 1997 interview with Girlfriends magazine. \u201cActually, I saw when she was being cast in Foxfire, and I thought she had just read for my part. I thought I was going to lose the job. I said to myself, \u2018Oh, my God, that\u2019s Legs.\u2019 She\u2019s great. We had a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nIn fact, she told Girlfriends, \u201cI probably would have married Jenny Shimizu if I hadn\u2019t married my [first] husband.\u201d\n\nMany years later, Jolie told TV interviewer Barbara Walters that her sexual feelings for Shimizu surprised even herself.\n\n\u201c[I was] surprised when I suddenly found myself having these feelings I always had for men, but for a woman,\u201d the superstar told Walters. \u201cAnd wanting to kiss her and wanting to touch her.\u201d\n\nShimizu, for her part, has touted her own ability to \u201ctake care of [Angelina\u2019s] sexual needs.\u201d\n\nTheir lesbian relationship continued throughout Jolie\u2019s three-year marriage to Miller, possibly contributing to their 1999 divorce, as well as afterward even as Jolie became involved with other men, according to The New York Daily News. Jolie was married to actor Billy Bob Thornton in 2000, after just two months of dating.\n\n2. Shimizu Was Reportedly Arrested For An Incident With A Previous Girlfriend\n\nPersonajes del Cine Venezolano: MACU (Mar\u00eda Luisa Mosquera) de \"Macu, la mujer del polic\u00eda\" (1987) de @solveighoo pic.twitter.com/Db1EpuQKrI \u2014 Elba Poleo (@Sabitariana) May 5, 2016\n\nIn February of 2016, the celebrity gossip site Radar Online reported that it had uncovered court documents from a 1996 incident in which Shimizu was charged with assaulting actress Mar\u00eda Luisa Mosquera, who was Shimizu\u2019s live-in girlfriend at the time she met Jolie.\n\nAccording to the Radar report, Shimizu was initially charged in November of 1996 with assault with a deadly weapon, stemming from an alleged incident between her and Mosquera, who starred in the 1987 Venezuelan thriller, Macu, The Policeman\u2019s Woman.\n\nShimizu was required to post $20,000 bail and then another $80,000 bail after a December complaint against her, alleging that she made criminal threats against Mosquera and and assaulting her with a firearm, Radar cited the documents as saying. Early in 1997, she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of \u201cpossession of a weapon with intent to assault and felony inflicting visible injury on a cohabitant or spouse.\u201d\n\nShimizu was ordered to undergo a year of domestic violence counseling and pay a $200 fine, according to the Radar report. She spent a day in jail as well, the report said.\n\n3. Shimizu Has a Reported Net Worth of $2 Million\n\nA successful model in her own right, Shimizu\u2019s picture has been snapped by such top fashion photographers as Bruce Weber, Richard Avedon, and Michel Comte and she has appeared in advertisements for high-end fashion designer labels, including Donna Karan, Jean Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mueller and the fragrance CK One. She also appeared as a judge on the Bravo network reality fashion competition show, Make Me a Supermodel.\n\nAccording to the site Celebrity Net Worth, all of this work for Shimizu has resulted in considerable financial success and an asset sheet totaling an estimated $2 million. Of course, that is literally 1/100th of the $200 million that her former girlfriend Jolie is reportedly worth.\n\nOther models apart of the heroin chic and \"dirty realism\" 90s movement of Calvin Klein include Jenny Shimizu pic.twitter.com/d382WKQuY4 \u2014 bald headed (@femmeminem) June 23, 2016\n\nAll of her modeling success has come despite the fact that Shimizu, who grew up mainly in Santa Maria, California, stands just five feet, seven inches tall. That\u2019s a full inch shorter than the minimum height required by many major modeling agencies, which demand models between five-foot-eight and five-foot-11 inches tall.\n\n4. Shimizu Claims That She Was Once Madonna\u2019s \u201cSecret Booty Call\u201d\n\nFBP: When Madonna dated Jenny Shimizu \u2013 the reason why Angelina Jolie hated Madonna. pic.twitter.com/KELdL36Ujv \u2014 The Queen (@Amen_Madonna) February 16, 2014\n\nAccording to an article by the LGBT site Pink News, Shimizu was planning a \u201ckiss and tell\u201d autobiography \u2014 which apparently was never completed, or at least never published \u2014 in which she would dish dirt on some of her lesbian relationships with famous celebrities. And while Jolie has spoken openly of her affair with Shimizu, another of the model\u2019s lovers, the iconic pop star Madonna, has not.\n\nNonetheless, Shimizu claims that she happily served as Madonna\u2019s \u201csex slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was her secret \u2018booty call\u2019 available any time of the day or night for secret sex sessions,\u201d Shimizu has claimed in an interview, adding that Madonna would, she said, pay for her to fly to any part of the world that Madonna happened to be, in order to engage in steamy sexual encounters.\n\njenny shimizu hanging out wi madonna #bimbowatch pic.twitter.com/DxJZrMmZ7x \u2014 Bimbo Movie Bash (@BimboMovieBash) August 30, 2016\n\nIn a more public relationship with an actress, Shimizu also dated Ione Skye, best known as John Cusack\u2019s co-star in the 1989 teen-flick classic, Say Anything. According to the Pink News report, Skye ditched her then-husband, Beastie Boys rapper Adam \u201cAd Rock\u201d Horowitz, to take up with Shimizu.\n\n5. Shimizu Married Michelle Harper in 2014, But Jolie Didn\u2019t Make the Wedding\n\nIn September of 2014, just a couple of weeks after Jolie married Pitt, Shimizu also got married \u2014 to fashion guru and \u201cbrand consultant\u201d Michelle Harper.\n\nBut though Shimizu invited her famous ex-girlfriend to the private ceremony, Jolie took a pass on showing up.\n\n\u201cAngie and I have so much history. And now that she and Brad are married, I figured it couldn\u2019t hurt to invite her even though I knew she was probably too busy with her own life to come,\u201d Shimizu reportedly said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted her to walk me down the aisle or anything, but it would have been a really cool thing if she\u2019d come.\u201d\n\nUnlike many of Shimizu\u2019s previous lovers and girlfriends, the now-38-year-old Harper was not world-famous. The New York Times described her as a \u201cwoman of mystery.\u201d But Harper, who was once a fixture on the New York club scene using the nickname \u201cCutie Pie,\u201d told the Times that she is simply a businesswoman.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 thing I get labeled quite often is socialite,\u201d Harper told the paper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a hard-working girl who may be dressed and out a lot and outspoken, but I\u2019m not in some bubble. There\u2019s no money tree shaking down on me.\u201d\n\nBut Shimizu\u2019s marriage did not stop Twitter speculation that she and Jolie would get back together, now that Jolie is divorcing Pitt.", "images": ["https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/pjimage-1-e1474386381542.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20567959cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-bisexual-divorce-jonny-lee-miller-brad-pitt-jenny-shimizu-wife.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=778", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/gettyimages-496019968-e1474383001798.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-bisexual-divorce-jonny-lee-miller-brad-pitt-jenny-shimizu-wife-ione-skye.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780&h=550", "https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/22c96b1e2152b58518db441b85b53fa3?s=71&d=https%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D71&r=PG", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=lfktn1QolK10vg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/angelina-jolie-marriages-jonny-lee-miller-first-husband-past-how-many-times-married-divorce-jonny-lee-miller-wife1.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=150&h=100&crop=1", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-bisexual-divorce-jonny-lee-miller-brad-pitt-jenny-shimizu-wife-michelle-harper.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780&h=452"], "top_img": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-bisexual-divorce-jonny-lee-miller-brad-pitt-jenny-shimizu-wife.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=778", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Vankin"], "canonical_link": "https://heavy.com/news/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-girlfriend-jenny-shimizu-divorce-brad-pitt/", "title": "Jenny Shimizu, Angelina Jolie\u2019s Ex-Girlfriend: 5 Facts", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "nfPVut3DNEWv3BaV0stQ8yOV3TeBg_TWFdQzQYaG8Qs", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 360, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "msapplication-TileColor": "#121212", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Angelina Jolie took a lesbian lover in the 1990s, actress and model Jenny Shimizu, after Jolie was divorced from Jonny Lee Miller.", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie lesbian lover, Angelina Jolie bisexual, Angelina Jolie divorce, Jonny Lee Miller, Brad Pitt, Jenny Shimizu, Jenny Shimizu wife", "keywords": "angelina jolie lesbian lover, angelina jolie bisexual, angelina jolie divorce, jonny lee miller, brad pitt, jenny shimizu, jenny shimizu wife", "msvalidate.01": "D36F6DC077CF4906C4E074037A94917B", "generator": "WordPress.com", "author": "Jonathan Vankin", "twitter": {"url": "https://heavy.com/news/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-girlfriend-jenny-shimizu-divorce-brad-pitt", "card": "summary", "site": "@heavysan", "creator": "@heavysan"}, "fb": {"admins": 1041016861, "app_id": 1103740676351644}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heavycom", "published_time": "2016-09-20T21:56:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-09-20T22:59:43+00:00", "author": "https://heavy.com/author/jonvankin/", "section": "News", "tag": "Jonny Lee Miller"}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-bisexual-divorce-jonny-lee-miller-brad-pitt-jenny-shimizu-wife.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "width": 778, "height": 440}, "site_name": "Heavy.com", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://heavy.com/news/2016/09/angelina-jolie-lesbian-lover-girlfriend-jenny-shimizu-divorce-brad-pitt/", "title": "Jenny Shimizu, Angelina Jolie\u2019s Ex-Girlfriend : 5 Fast Facts You Need To\u00a0Know", "description": "Angelina Jolie, who is bisexual, dated actress-model Jenny Shimizu in the 1990s.
