More than 99 percent of American women reportedly remove their body hair, spending tens of thousands of dollars over the course of their lifetimes to wax, pluck, shave, epilate, thread, or laser unwanted fuzz off their bodies. Below, 25 women \u2014 from Victoria\u2019s Secret models to body-hair activists \u2014 get real about their own body hair (from eyebrows to pubes to leg hair), whether they choose to laser everything off, or let it grow out as nature intended.\n\nKim Kardashian\n\n\u201cI have the hairiest forehead you could ever imagine, and I would always break out and get all cracky on my forehead just from all the hair that I had. So in high school, I would wax it off because there was just so much hair, and then I would laser it off a little bit. If you Google 2008 or 2007, I had the craziest, hairiest hairline, so I did laser it. Everyone would just Photoshop it every time I did a photo shoot [anyway]. I didn\u2019t really change the shape, I just got rid of all the baby hairs.\u201d \u2013 People, March 2015\n\nRihanna\n\n\u201cWell, I went to this wax salon, and she recognized me before I took my clothes off \u2026 And then, you know, obviously, I\u2019m laying there in pain, and she just decides to bust out \u2014 and you know what, every time I get a wax, I always specify that the lady is old and speaks Russian or no English \u2014 and she was [a] 25-year-old American. And she was basically like, \u2018I know who you are. [Imitates wax-tearing noise.] You\u2019re Rihanna, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 I was just like \u2026 awkward. It was really awkward. It was probably one of the most awkward moments of my entire life. I just got up and I just got out of there.\u201d \u2013 The Graham Norton Show, November 2010\n\nAdele\n\nOn whether her husband minds her unshaven legs: \u201cHe has no choice. I\u2019ll have no man telling me to shave my fuckin\u2019 legs. Shave yours.\u201d \u2013 Vanity Fair, October 2016\n\nLeandra Medine\n\n\u201cMy relationship with shaving and waxing is very strange. The reason I don\u2019t do anything to my arms is because I really don\u2019t mind the hair on them. Sometimes my husband asks me to shave it or to wax it and that really bothers me. I\u2019m not asking him to, like, wax his balls. So why should he tell me what to wax or what to shave? Right? \u2026 Still, I think that my problem with bikini waxing in particular is that I am uncomfortable with having hair there, and I\u2019m uncomfortable about being uncomfortable. I almost want to remove my hair to take back being a woman, and have that be my feminist statement \u2026 I don\u2019t mind how [my arm hair] looks, though, so I\u2019m not changing it. However, I do laser my mustache.\u201d \u2013 Man Repeller, July 2015\n\nCarrie Brownstein\n\n\u201cI will say, as a woman, when you put a mustache on, you find out a lot of things about yourself \u2026 There\u2019s just a certain swagger. Now I know why men, you know, grow out the facial hair. Like there is just a certain level of confidence but also just a certain level of sleaziness.\u201d \u2013 Wait Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell Me!, March 2012\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\n\u201cBrows need to be on point, and I prefer threading to waxing. Because your skin is so sensitive around your eye, waxing can create wrinkles. It\u2019s also really important for your eyebrows to be extremely well filled-in. If you have great eyebrows and a good lip, then you don\u2019t need anything else on your face. My mom used to do her own eyebrows when she was in school, so I\u2019ve known how to do [it] for years. If you have sensitive skin then it is kind of tricky \u2014 you have to find the right technician to do it. And when you find her, keep her! My hairstylist does it for me. Her name is Priyanka, actually \u2014 same as mine.\u201d \u2013 Into the Gloss, May 2015\n\nHarnaam Kaur\n\n\u201cI was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries from a really young age, around the time I hit puberty. PCOS is a condition in which there is an imbalance in hormones within the female body, this has led me to have more male hormones than female ones, and it is also the reason to why I have a beard. I used to have my face waxed two to three times a week, and on the days I couldn\u2019t bear the pain I would simply shave \u2026 I decided to keep my beard and step forward against society\u2019s expectations of what a woman should look like \u2026 Today I am happy living as a young, beautiful, bearded woman. I have realized that this body is mine, I own it, I do not have any other body to live in, so I may as well love it unconditionally.\u201d \u2013 Rock N Roll Bride, June 2015\n\nPetra Collins\n\nOn shaving her pubic area: \u201cI never really did. I guess I would like trim. And it was always something that I\u2019d be like, I\u2019m going to the beach, I\u2019m so embarrassed. Like, because I never really liked to shave. So I just didn\u2019t know what to wear because it was embarrassing \u2026 Now, I just don\u2019t care \u2026 [Women\u2019s body hair]\u2019s just something that is so not talked about that it\u2019s insane. Like, all shaving ads would not \u2014 there\u2019s no hair in the ads. It doesn\u2019t even start with hair. They\u2019re shaving nothing. And I guess it\u2019s kind of the same thing with like menstrual blood \u2026 I was finally like, wait, why do I do this every day and why do I buy things every day to get rid of something that my body\u2019s just trying to grow?\u201d \u2013 StyleLikeU, June 2015\n\nGaby Hoffmann\n\n\u201cWhen people want me to talk about whether I think the bush is back, and if that\u2019s great for feminism, I\u2019m like, \u2018You know what\u2019s great for feminism? Respecting everybody\u2019s own choice.\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t give a shit if people want to wax everything off. If it makes you feel comfortable, by all means, do that. This is how I feel comfortable.\u201d \u2013 The Telegraph, May 2016\n\nEva Longoria\n\n\u201cGet a Brazilian wax. It makes sex better, orgasm-wise. It\u2019s like the difference between this [she pats her arm lightly] and this [rubs her arm] \u2026 Believe me, the first time I did it, the technician did half, and I was like \u2018Stop!\u2019 She said, \u2018Sit down, I have to finish.\u2019 But then it gets easier. The more you do it, the less hair grows back. But yeah, I love it. I swear by it. Every woman should try a Brazilian wax once. And then the sex they have afterward will make them keep coming back!\u201d \u2013 Cosmopolitan, October 2005\n\nTina Fey\n\n\u201cRemove your body hair only when necessary. Body hair is a constant annoyance. Mostly I just let it be. Until I have to go into a professional situation, and then I have to shave from head to toe.\u201d \u2013 The Edit, December 2015\n\nKate Winslet\n\nOn her role in The Reader: \u201cI had to grow the hair down there. But because of years of waxing, as all of us girls know, it doesn\u2019t come back quite the way it used to. They even made me a merkin \u2014 a wig \u2014 because they were so concerned that I might not be able to grow enough.\u201d \u2013 Allure, June 2009\n\nChrissy Teigen\n\n\u201cWaxing for a shoot? Are you kidding? I shave my whole body every day. It\u2019s exhausting. Trust me. It\u2019s gotten to the point where it takes up more of my life than anything else.\u201d \u2013 Allure, April 2015\n\nCameron Diaz\n\n\u201cI figure there\u2019s a purpose for that hair. No matter how you enjoy grooming it throughout your life, whether it\u2019s like shave it all off, wax it all off, put a bull\u2019s-eye, birthday cake, I don\u2019t care. Just girls, think about not taking it all off forever. Permanency forever, ever, means forever. It doesn\u2019t come back.\u201d \u2013 Chelsea Lately, March 2014\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t love waxing. I just don\u2019t like everybody \u2026 up in the business, you know what I mean? I shave everywhere; the only thing I wax is my eyebrows. It\u2019s torture plucking the hairs out one by one \u2026 I\u2019m not really a hairy person. I shave every few days; once the stubble comes in, I take it off right away. Today I\u2019ve changed my outfit six times for shoots, and there\u2019s a lot of going from pants to a short skirt, so I keep a razor in my travel kit. In a pinch, I\u2019ve grabbed a water spray bottle from the hairdresser, mixed it with some lotion, and shaved my legs in under a minute.\u201d \u2013 Allure, February 2011\n\nKate Somerville\n\n\u201cI hate to say this, but personally I get hairs above my upper lip, and have forever. Initially I [shaved] it because of the hair, but then I noticed that it was a great exfoliant and that my makeup went on a lot better.\u201d \u2013 The New York Times, June 2015\n\nEmma Watson\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2014 I was just talking to my friend before this about how in the Instagram era it\u2019s so easy to edit your life so that it looks perfect. But I bleach my top lip and tweeze my eyebrows and you\u2019d never get to see that, even though it\u2019s a part of my routine. There\u2019s still so much shame around the things you do to get ready while you\u2019ve got a towel wrapped around your head. It\u2019s important to me not to edit that out. I\u2019ve been bleaching my top lip since I was nine. I don\u2019t do it very often, but I do it! There\u2019s that, and I use Fur Oil. I\u2019ll use that anywhere from the ends of my hair to my eyebrows to my pubic hair. It\u2019s an amazing all-purpose product.\u201d \u2013 Into The Gloss, March 2017\n\nRita Ora\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not working and getting my makeup done, that\u2019s my chance to do a hair mask and a face mask and my plucking and waxing and all of that \u2026Eyebrows are really important because they structure the face. In school it was funny because I was always the one walking around with tweezers plucking my girlfriends\u2019 eyebrows. I was really good; eyebrow tweezing runs in my family \u2014 my mother used to do mine, and I picked it up. Then I started plucking my friends\u2019 brows when I would see them at school. Suddenly there ended up being a line at lunchtime of people who wanted to get their eyebrows tweezed.\u201d \u2013 Into The Gloss, August 2014\n\nMadonna\n\n\u201c[G]oing to high school, I saw how popular girls had to behave to get the boys. I knew I couldn\u2019t fit into that. So I decided to do the opposite. I refused to wear makeup, to have a hairstyle. I refused to shave. I had hairy armpits \u2026 The boys in my school would make fun of me. \u2018Hairy monster.\u2019 You know, things like that.\u201d \u2013 Harper\u2019s Bazaar, November 2011\n\nMo\u2019Nique\n\nOn her shaven legs: \u201cOkay, let me tell you something \u2026 I didn\u2019t [care about my leg hair]. And I still don\u2019t. But what happened was, as I got older, the hair began to fall out in different places. So one night, Sid [her husband] and I were in the closet, and he said \u2018Mama, you\u2019re starting to have spots on your legs. It look like you got the mangy. So you got to do something about that.\u2019 So I shaved them that night and I\u2019ve been shaving them ever since \u2026 If I still had it I would still wear it well.\u201d \u2013 The Wendy Williams Show, April 2015\n\nBusy Philipps\n\nOn whether she waxes or shaves: \u201cOh! I love this question. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about this, it\u2019s so weird. So I do get waxed, but after I had my daughter I had this real epiphany. I felt like it would be really fucking weird if I had no hair on my vagina, because I have a little girl and I want her to look at me and think that grown women have hair on their vaginas!\u201d \u2013 The Conversation with Amanda de Cadenet, May 2013\n\nGrimes\n\n\u201cI just started shaving for the first time this year. I am rebelling against my previous body hair, because now people get mad when I shave my legs. So I\u2019m like, \u2018I have the right to shave my legs.\u2019 I think people policing my body either way is bizarre \u2026 There is still an intense vibe in society about body hair. No one I\u2019ve ever dated has mentioned it. I didn\u2019t even think it was weird until I started doing fashion and people would be putting concealer over my legs.\u201d \u2013 Teen Vogue, April 2016\n\nCharlotte Free\n\nOn her unshaven armpits: \u201cIt\u2019s an equal-rights thing. It\u2019s ridiculous that women have to shave their armpits and legs every day. I don\u2019t have time. I think it\u2019s asinine that men have this standard that women should be perfectly shaven \u2026 I only shave them once in a blue moon for a really big job. I like to keep my body hair. It\u2019s a symbol of how I\u2019m not going to conform to something that\u2019s so ridiculous.\u201d \u2013 The Guardian, March 2012\n\nMayim Bialik\n\n\u201cI wonder if I had a girl if she would find me odd and embarrassing, or if whatever we present to our children about us, whether they be girls or boys, is simply what we teach them we are. Meaning, if we never told girls to shave, would they? If we modeled a cultural acceptance of our body hair, would they spontaneously feel the need to remove it weekly, monthly, or daily? If we all wore bathing suits that covered our natural forms instead of the form that only hairless young girls who have not birthed babies can wear, would our girls and boys have a more or less realistic notion of what the human body \u2018should\u2019 look like?\u201d \u2013 Kveller, July 2012\n\nMolly Soda\n\n\u201cChoosing to shave doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re insecure. The strongest statement you can make is to take control of your body and present yourself in whatever way that makes you feel comfortable. Shave one leg and don\u2019t shave the other, shave sometimes, never shave \u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters is that you feel good about you. That\u2019s the boldest and bravest thing you can do.\u201d \u2013 Nylon, April 2016", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/03/30/30-famous-women-waxing-shaving.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/03/30/30-famous-women-waxing-shaving.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/03/30/30-famous-women-waxing-shaving.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Ma"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/25-famous-women-on-waxing-and-shaving.html", "title": "25 Famous Women on Waxing and Shaving", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "25 Famous Women on Waxing and Shaving", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/03/25-famous-women-on-waxing-and-shaving.html", "description": "How Rihanna, Emma Watson, Eva Longoria, and more deal with body hair.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/03/30/30-famous-women-waxing-shaving.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "25 Famous Women on Waxing and Shaving", "description": "How Rihanna, Emma Watson, Eva Longoria, and more deal with body hair.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2017/03/30/30-famous-women-waxing-shaving.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "description": "How Rihanna, Emma Watson, Eva Longoria, and more deal with body hair.", "article": {"tag": "body hair, 25 famous women on, fame, beauty, kim kardashian, rihanna, adele, leandra medine, carrie brownstein, priyanka chopra, harnaam kaur, petra collins, gaby hoffmann, eva longoria, tina fey, kate winslet, chrissy teigen, cameron diaz, jennifer lopez, kate somerville, emma watson, rita ora, madonna, monique, busy philipps, grimes, charlotte free, mayim bialik, molly soda, hairy situations, cut homepage lede, top story", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "sailthru.tags": "body hair, 25 famous women on, fame, beauty, kim kardashian, rihanna, adele, leandra medine, carrie brownstein, priyanka chopra, harnaam kaur, petra collins, gaby hoffmann, eva longoria, tina fey, kate winslet, chrissy teigen, cameron diaz, jennifer lopez, kate somerville, emma watson, rita ora, madonna, monique, busy philipps, grimes, charlotte free, mayim bialik, molly soda, hairy situations, cut homepage lede, top story", "author": "Julie Ma", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1490371200.0, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
