Here, take a look at the papers in which she shockingly asks for no spousal or child support.\n\nJust hours after it was revealed that Angelina, 41, filed for divorce from Brad, 52, on Sept. 20, HollywoodLife.com obtained the divorce papers that laid out exactly what Angie is asking for as she\u2019s ending her marriage of just over two years.\n\nAngelina cites \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d in the 11-page divorce papers. But, she makes no demands for child support for their six children, nor any support for herself. She is, however, asking for full physical custody of the couple\u2019s children, Shiloh, Knox, Vivienne, Zahara, Maddox, and Pax, and joint legal custody.\n\nShe\u2019s also released a statement through her lawyer giving her reason for ending the marriage. \u201cAngelina has filed for dissolution of the marriage,\u201d Robert Offer, Angelina\u2019s entertainment attorney, said in a statement on Sept. 20, per Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cThis decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time.\u201d\n\nAlthough \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d is the reason cited in the papers, sources also said that Brad has a weed addiction as well as a possible alcohol issues. On top of that, he has an \u201canger problem\u201d \u2014 all of which serve as a major threat to their young children. It was also reported that Angelina was frustrated with Brad\u2019s \u201cmethods\u201d of parenting.\n\nBrad and Angelina have been together since 2004 and married since 2014, so there\u2019s certainly a lot that will need to be worked out in their split. Whether Angelina will be granted everything she is requesting is yet to be determined, but we\u2019ll surely be keeping tabs on this shocking breakup!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about Brangelina\u2019s reasons for divorcing? Do you find it shocking that she doesn\u2019t want any spousal or child support?
