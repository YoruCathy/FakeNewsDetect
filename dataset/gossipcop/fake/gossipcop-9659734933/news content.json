Tabloids knew nothing the couple didn\u2019t want known. Their image as the chic-est, jet-setting-est, most racially harmonious family on Earth was impenetrable.\n\nUntil Tuesday, when Jolie\u2019s filing demanding sole physical custody sent the media into overdrive: What had Pitt, heretofore known as a devoted father, possibly done?\n\nIncredibly, almost on the hour, the story kept advancing: TMZ reported that Jolie had concerns \u201cwith the way Brad was parenting\u201d and that she was \u201cfed up\u201d with his heavy use of weed and alcohol. He had an \u201canger problem.\u201d\n\nNext came accusations of Pitt cheating \u2014 with a co-star and with Russian hookers, their nationality an odd detail \u2014 of using hard drugs, and of verbally and physically attacking one of their children on a private plane.\n\nWithin 72 hours, the world knew more about Brangelina than in the 12 years they had been together. It was sordid and dirty, the photo negative of the perfect \u00adimage they had so smugly, aggressively promoted.\n\nThe likeliest source of that narrative flip? Angelina Jolie, who at 41 has masterfully manipulated the media for over two decades.\n\nStrategically, Jolie seems miles ahead of Pitt, but she may lose the long game. Video reportedly exists of the plane incident, and no physical altercation is said to have occurred. People have come to \u00adadmire her, but they love him.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing seems very impetuous,\u201d says Jolie\u2019s biographer, Andrew Morton. \u201cHer mother would freeze out people for whatever reason, and now Angie has frozen out Brad \u2014 who was far more dignified and just issued a quiet statement.\u201d\n\nBy so publicly disparaging the father of her children \u2014 some old enough to read what\u2019s being said online \u2014 Jolie is endangering her own self-created myth, that of \u00addepraved Hollywood hellion-turned-St. Angelina, humanitarian nonpareil.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bad Dad vs. St. Ange,\u201d Morton says. \u201cThe ultimate losers are the children.\u201d\n\nAnd Jolie\u2019s halo, which may be revoked.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget how deeply weird Angelina Jolie was when she came on the scene in the mid-\u201990s. There\u2019s an entire generation that knows her as an actress, yes, but more so as the selfless philanthropist, the devoted mother of six, one-half of the most glamorous couple in Hollywood.\n\nJolie has never used a publicist, and this has only added to the sense \u2014 true or not \u2014 that she\u2019s authentic. But she is, at heart, an actress. Jolie and her estranged father, actor Jon Voight, share one key trait: Both, she\u2019s said, are \u201cdrama queens.\u201d\n\nAs a premillennial starlet, Jolie was unlike any of her peers. She was in stark opposition to the arch, cosmopolitan WASP-iness of Gwyneth Paltrow, who was then engaged to Pitt. She made Winona Ryder\u2019s eccentric darkness seem purely adolescent. Drew Barrymore, with her trauma, her drug use and mid-20s marriage spree, could not compare.\n\nJolie carved her own niche, controlled her own narrative, and it was impossible to look away. She was the wildest of the wild. She divulged thoughts and experiences so outlandish, you had to wonder how much was true.\n\nShe spoke of self-harm, rampant drug use \u2014 heroin, she said, her favourite \u2014 her bisexuality, how much she loved knife-play and S&M, her history of insomnia and eating disorders, of committing herself to the psych ward at UCLA for 72 hours, of suicidal ideations and of once hiring a hit man to kill her before changing her mind. All this by age 22.\n\nIn 1996, she married British actor Jonny Lee Miller. She said she wed in a white shirt with Miller\u2019s name scrawled in blood on the back.\n\nThey divorced in 2000, the same year Jolie began cavorting with her brother, James Haven, on red carpets, making out in front of photographers. When she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar that year for Girl, Interrupted, she gushed over him in her acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in love with my brother right now,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was too weird, even by Hollywood standards. Haven quickly receded from Jolie\u2019s public life, and within weeks, she wed her Pushing Tin co-star Billy Bob Thornton, who was then engaged to actress Laura Dern.\n\n\u201cI left our home to work on a movie,\u201d Dern told Talk magazine in 2000, \u201cand while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I\u2019ve never heard from him again.\u201d\n\nJolie and Thornton \u2014 then 24 and 44, respectively \u2014 embraced their role as Hollywood\u2019s premier freak-show couple. They wore \u00advials of each other\u2019s blood around their necks and boasted of wild sex on fur-lined harnesses.\n\nThe marriage lasted four years, until the moment Jolie said was life-changing: Her decision, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in Cambodia, to adopt a child.\n\n\u201cI knew once I committed to Maddox,\u201d she said, \u201cI would never be self-destructive again.\u201d\n\nJolie divorced Thornton. \u201cShe used the same M.O. as with Brad \u2014 accused him of having affairs and being drunk,\u201d says Morton, her biographer. \u201cAs soon as Maddox came along, Billy Bob had served his purpose.\u201d\n\nThus Jolie began her pivot from savage, man-stealing sex bomb to valiant single mom of an indigent child. She began working with the United Nations as a goodwill ambassador. Her time in Cambodia, she said, \u201cmade me suddenly realise certain things about the world and how much I had to learn.\u201d\n\nShe was a spoiled Hollywood brat who orchestrated her public awakening to the less fortunate and duly expressed shame. As an actress, things were less exciting. She trudged along in a series of unremarkable movies: Original Sin, Life or Something Like It, Beyond Borders, Alexander.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 2004, when she replaced Nicole Kidman in a film called Mr. & Mrs. Smith, that Angelina Jolie\u2019s star power \u00adbecame stratospheric.\n\nThis, of course, was the movie where Pitt and Jolie met and fell in love. At the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston, and they were considered Hollywood\u2019s golden couple: he the wholesome, Midwestern matinee idol, content with a bong and a beer, she the A-list star of Friends, the breezy, sort-of-plain popular girl who had landed the high-school quarterback.\n\nJolie, with or without Pitt\u2019s knowledge, helped extricate him from that marriage expertly. In April 2005, amid rumours of their affair, Pitt flew to visit Jolie and her toddler son in Kenya. Paparazzi somehow knew to be there, and a now-iconic image of Jolie, Pitt and Maddox made the cover of US Weekly.\n\nAniston had said goodbye to Pitt hours earlier, with no knowledge of his plans. \u201cThe world was shocked, and I was shocked,\u201d Aniston told Vanity Fair that year.\n\nRumours were rampant that Jolie was pregnant with Pitt\u2019s baby \u2014 compounding the tabloid narrative that Pitt badly wanted to be a dad but, denied by his career-obsessed wife, had no choice but to leave.\n\n\u201cMy worst fear,\u201d Aniston\u2019s friend Kristin Hahn told Vanity Fair, \u201cis that Jen will have to face them having a baby together soon, because that would be beyond painful.\u201d\n\nIn July of that year, Jolie adopted a baby girl from Ethiopia, an event she announced in People magazine. She began heavily publicising her work as a UN ambassador. To paraphrase the old saying about Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire: Jolie gave Pitt gravitas, and Pitt gave her respectability.\n\nIn May 2007, the couple relocated to Namibia, where a heavily pregnant Jolie was again shot by paparazzi, with Pitt and her two children, on otherwise empty sand dunes \u2014 this, even though the couple had gotten the Namibian government to ban all journalists from entry so she could give birth there.\n\nAfter their daughter Shiloh was born, Pitt and Jolie gave a press conference only to Namibian reporters. They sat on a dais with Namibia\u2019s president, Sam Nujoma, formerly the country\u2019s dictator, and began their spin off planet Earth.\n\nIn 2007, Jolie began forcing celebrity journalists to sign contracts before interviewing her. These forbade \u201cany questions regarding her personal relationships,\u201d even though her personal relationships were exactly what she was selling. In April of that year, People glowingly reported Jolie\u2019s adoption of a 3-year-old boy from Vietnam.\n\nHis mother was still living, and Jolie changed his name from Pham Quang Sang to Pax. He spoke no English, but no matter \u2014 the magazine deified Jolie, shooting her in profile, holding her new toddler as they gazed off at the horizon. In less than two years, Jolie and Pitt had a family of four.\n\n\u201cI know we seem crazy, just bringing them in one after the other,\u201d Jolie told The New York Times in 2008, the year she gave birth to twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\n\u201cBut we do plan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make sure one is absorbed completely into the family before we add \u00adanother.\u201d\n\nSanding down their scandalous origin story further, Jolie founded the Maddox Jolie Pitt Foundation in 2006. Though the couple have always said they donate all the money they make from selling family photos to magazines, tax filings raise questions.\n\nIn 2008, the year they sold pictures of the twins to People for $US14 million, the foundation gave away a little over $6 million. The UN High Commission on Refugees got $US100,000; the Council on Foreign Relations \u2014 which extended membership to Jolie the year before \u2014 got $110,000, and Pitt\u2019s own non-profit, Make It Right, got $1 million.\n\nThe year before, the MJP Foundation listed itself as a \u201cconsultant\u201d to Make It Right, earning $US204,867 in fees. It also listed nearly $4 million in assets invested, with, among others, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. They donated just $1.4 million, with $333,000 going to the UNHCR, which finally, after nearly $1 million in total donations from MJP, named Jolie a special envoy in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, People paid $US2 million for the Jolie-Pitt wedding photos. But the magazine doesn\u2019t appear on MJP Foundation filings. However, Asprey, the jewellery company that has commissioned designs from the couple, does.\n\nReps for Pitt and \u00adJolie did not return requests for comment.\n\nAs adroit as she has been, Jolie has seemed to lose touch with how she\u2019s actually perceived. Her pretension has become boundless: bragging to a UK radio program that her six kids speak seven languages, including sign language.\n\n\u201cVivienne really wanted to learn Arabic,\u201d she said.\n\nVivienne is 8.\n\nJolie has been publicly on the verge of quitting acting since 2005, ready to sacrifice movie stardom for her kids \u2014 never a mention of the nannies \u2014 her charities, the world. In November, she begins a visiting professorship at the London School of Economics. She is reportedly seeking to move to England permanently to join the House of Lords, which requires UK citizenship, and remake herself yet again, this time as a politician.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never loved being in front of the camera,\u201d she said in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s a transition sparked, most likely, by her failed attempts to become a serious writer-director. Each successive film \u2014 2011\u2019s In the Land of Blood and Honey, 2014\u2019s Unbroken and last year\u2019s disasterpiece, By the Sea, in which she and Pitt played a couple on the verge of divorce \u2014 has bombed exponentially.\n\nThe Sony hack revealed true \u00adindustry opinion of Jolie. \u201cMinimally talented spoiled brat,\u201d wrote super-producer Scott Rudin to then-Sony chief Amy Pascal. \u201cShe\u2019s a camp event and a celebrity and that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nBy seeking to elevate herself by denigrating Pitt, Jolie\u2019s hypocrisy has begun to show. Whatever went down on that plane, it most likely can\u2019t be worse than having her children witness their father\u2019s public humiliation at their mother\u2019s hands \u2014 the ultimate irony for a woman who prides herself on motherhood above all.\n\nAs she told The New York Times in 2008, she was already worried about what her children might read about their lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we\u2019re going to have to explain to them,\u201d she said, \u201cabout how public their family is.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Isabel Vincent.\n\nThis story originally appeared in the NY Post
