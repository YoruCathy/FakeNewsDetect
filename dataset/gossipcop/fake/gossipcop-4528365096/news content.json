Brad Pitt\u2019s new girlfriend, Neri Oxman, was spotted out and about on Wednesday, April 18, heading to teach a class at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe MIT professor, 42, was walking through the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, dressed in a black turtleneck, trench coat and matching pants. The award-winning architectural designer wore her hair up in a loose bun with dark sunglasses and carried a copy of The Voyager Golden Record.\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Oxman has been quietly seeing the War Machine actor, 54, for six months. An insider close to the actor told Us that Pitt has been \u201cglowing around her.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor first reached out to her after he saw a line of her 3-D printed chaise lounges, and headed to meet with her at MIT, where she teaches media arts and sciences at the Massachusetts school\u2019s Media Lab. \u201cBrad\u2019s absolutely smitten by her,\u201d the source revealed exclusively to Us. \u201cTheir chemistry is off the charts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey got romantically involved almost right away,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cHe\u2019s been going to great lengths to make sure he\u2019s not spotted by prying eyes.\u201d The pair have also traveled together internationally on several occasions since they started dating.\n\nThe Inglorious Bastards actor\u2019s pal told Us that Pitt fell for Oxman\u2019s intelligence and her charm, and not just her appearance. \u201cNeri is a very passionate, extremely smart and talented woman. She is very extroverted, outgoing, vivacious and loving,\u201d the insider told Us. \u201cMen and women love Neri. She has a way of making you feel as if you\u2019re the only person in a crowded room,\u201d the pal added. \u201cBeing around Neri is intoxicating as if you\u2019re flying high above the mountains.\u201d\n\nOxman is the first woman Pitt has been linked with since his split from Angelina Jolie in September 2016. The Mr. & Mrs. Smith actors \u2014 who are the parents of Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 \u2014 are currently working on finalizing their divorce.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neri-oxman1.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neri-oxman1.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neri-oxman1.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/neri-oxman-steps-out-amid-news-of-brad-pitt-romance/", "title": "Neri Oxman Steps Out Amid News of Brad Pitt Romance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Neri Oxman was spotted at the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, amid news that she is dating actor Brad Pitt \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Neri Oxman Steps Out Amid News of Brad Pitt Romance", "description": "Neri Oxman was spotted at the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, amid news that she is dating actor Brad Pitt \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/neri-oxman-steps-out-amid-news-of-brad-pitt-romance/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neri-oxman1.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neri-oxman1.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-18T20:33:41+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Neri Oxman was spotted at the MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts, amid news that she is dating actor Brad Pitt \u2014 details", "title": "Neri Oxman Steps Out Amid News of Brad Pitt Romance", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/neri-oxman1.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524083621.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
