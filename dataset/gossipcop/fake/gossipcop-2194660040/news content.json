They have educated her about Ronald Regan\u2019s poisoning by the Deep State after his assassination attempt in 1981. They have also warned her that George W. Bush was reduced to a \u201cbrain damaged\u201d state after years of steady poisoning.\n\nBut the advantage Trump may hold over his GOP predecessors in the Oval Office is that he has a wife who is wise to the ruse and is insisting he watch his food and drink intake closely for signs of adulteration.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s food choices say a lot about the man. The president\u2019s Howard Hughes-level pickiness when it comes to food is partly motivated by a desire to avoid being poisoned, according to Melania. He doesn\u2019t trust those around him \u2013 and rightfully so.\n\nAs President Trump knows all too well, there are enemies of the state dug in deep at the White House.\n\nReporters from TIME recently got a glimpse behind-the-scenes at the White House, where they reported on what goes down at the president\u2019s dinner table. Of particular interest was a meal enjoyed by the reporters, Trump, and Vice President Pence.\n\nPence\u2019s meal was not unusual\u2014he ate what everyone else did. But the POTUS received a meal fully customized to his own preferences, and closely observed by Melania who insisted on watching the chef prepare the meal with ingredients she provided herself.",
