The purpose, it seemed, was to announce his new pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, one day after Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for the position.\n\nBut after a minute or so of talking about Acosta, Trump launched into a nearly hour-and-a-half long rant in which he harshly criticized at the media, told a series of blatantly incorrect \"facts\" about how popular he was, and went off on Hillary Clinton.\n\nCelebrities had a lot of feelings about this one:\n\nKendrick Sampson\n\nThe press conferences keep getting more bizarre. I honestly wonder if this man is mentally stable. And he's still going on about Hillary! pic.twitter.com/1c4CvnBnW3 \u2014 Kendrick Sampson (@kendrick38) February 16, 2017\n\nTrump just shut down a Jewish man asking abt the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. saying \"I am the least racist/anti-Semitic person\" \u2014 Kendrick Sampson (@kendrick38) February 16, 2017\n\nYvette Nicole Brown\n\nDid he just ask #AprilRyan if the Congressional Black Caucus are friends of hers?\n\n\n\nBecause we ALL know each other (& look alike) amirite? \u2014 yvette nicole brown (@YNB) February 16, 2017\n\nAva DuVernay\n\nHe reeks of ignorance.
