The thrice-married beauty explained how the message is about women who are ready for the rock.\n\n\u201cThe song is definitely about that, it is but I felt like it was kind of something that all women get to a point where they say, \u2018OK, what\u2019s up?'\u201d said Lopez, 48. \u201cLike we\u2019re good, everything\u2019s great, what\u2019s going on? Am I staying or am I [going]?\u201d\n\nBefore Lopez explained the tune, host Jimmy Fallon held up a photo of the couple from Monday\u2019s Met Gala, with a special message for Rodriguez, 42.\n\n\u201cAlex, are you watching? Hello,\u201d Fallon joked, to which Lopez replied, \u201cNo pressure.\u201d\n\nTogether since last spring, Lopez hasn\u2019t ruled out a fourth trip down the aisle, despite failed marriages to Ojani Noa, Cris Judd and Marc Anthony.\n\n\u201cI would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m not forcing anything right now,\u201d the mother of two revealed in the April 2018 issue of Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other\u2019s lives in a way that most other people couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLopez also revealed Rodriguez, the face of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Baseball,\u201d regularly sprinkles America\u2019s pastime into their daily exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt is baseball day and night, night and day,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Baby, what time you think you\u2019re going to be home?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Well, right now I\u2019m kind of in the seventh inning of the meeting.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Keep your head in the game!'\u201d", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-index.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-index.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/05/10/jennifer-lopez-jokes-theres-no-pressure-for-alex-rodriguez-to-propose/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez jokes there\u2019s \u2018no pressure\u2019 for Alex Rodriguez to propose", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
