Their relationship didn\u2019t last, and Seyfried is now happily married to Tom Sadoski - with whom she has a child. She admitted in a new interview that Sadoski was \u201cjealous\u201d of her on-screen relationship with Cooper, but it\u2019s nothing to worry about. \u201cI think he has the same kind of issues that I would have if we were hanging out with his ex-girlfriend from long ago,\u201d she told The Mirror.\n\nAmanda Seyfried reunites with Dominic Cooper in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again\n\nSeyfried is now married to Tom Sadoski\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always like, \u2018I\u2019m so in love with this person, so that person must be so in love with her too\u2019. \u201cI assume everyone\u2019s in love with Tommy because I\u2019m in love with him. I assume that everybody sees him the way I do.\u201d She added: \u201cI\u2019d guess he assumed Dominic is in love with me the way he\u2019s in love with me. And it\u2019s just not the case. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet. I\u2019d rather he be jealous than completely fine with it.
