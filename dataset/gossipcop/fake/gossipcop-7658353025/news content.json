It\u2019s the fourth remake of a story that dates back to 1932, but this one has a look and vibe all its own \u2014 rapturous and swooning, but also delicate and intimate and luminous. It\u2019s set in the present day, but in spirit it\u2019s a sophisticated retro \u201970s drama built around the uncanny flow of feeling that develops between the movie\u2019s two stars: Bradley Cooper, who plays Jackson Maine, a hard-drinking, bad-ol\u2019-boy redneck rock \u2018n\u2019 roller who is still hanging on as a popular attraction but has lost the lust for what he\u2019s doing, and Lady Gaga, in her fetching and accomplished movie-star debut, as Ally, an ingenuous, fresh-faced singer-songwriter who becomes his lover and stage partner before rocketing on her own into the new pop stratosphere.\n\nShe takes off as he slowly crashes \u2014 that\u2019s the soapy tragic \u201cStar Is Born\u201d concept. But what the movie does is to take this fabled melodramatic romantic seesaw and turn it into something indelibly heartfelt and revealing. Cooper directed the movie himself, working from a script he co-wrote with Eric Roth and Will Fetters, and to say that he does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment. As a filmmaker, Bradley Cooper gets right onto the high wire, staging scenes that take their time and play out with a shaggy intimacy that\u2019s shorn of the usual \u201cbeats.\u201d The new \u201cStar Is Born\u201d is a total emotional knockout, but it\u2019s also a movie that gets you to believe, at every step, in the complicated rapture of the story it\u2019s telling.\n\nThe 1976 version, starring Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, had some terrific cornball love songs, but they didn\u2019t belong anywhere near the stadium-rock stage, and neither did Streisand, which is part of why the movie came off as borderline ludicrous. It seemed stranded, with a kind of campy sincere ineptitude, between three worlds: Old Hollywood, New Hollywood, and Barbra Streisand rock-princess fantasy.\n\nBut from the electrifying opening moments of the new version, in which Jackson, boozy and raw, with his sunburned squint and hard-bitten shit-kicker sexiness, takes the stage of a gigantic stadium and launches into a grinding slow rocker that sounds like \u201cVictim of Love\u201d-era Eagles as done by the Allman Brothers, the movie is thrillingly authentic. That\u2019s no minor accomplishment. Hollywood almost never succeeds in nailing the rock world, but \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d though a love story through and through, is the most lived-in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll movie since \u201cAlmost Famous.\u201d And that absolute looks right, sounds right, feels right verisimilitude sets the stage for everything that follows.\n\nJackson, who looks to be in his mid-40s, has been around long enough that he now occupies a grey zone between legend and nostalgia. He can still fill an arena full of screaming fans, and his old hits have become classic-rock chestnuts, but his sound and persona have long slipped out of the zeitgeist. His whole outlaw look \u2014 the beard and rancher\u2019s hat, the Kristofferson-meets-Skynyrd soused macho twinkle \u2014 mark him as a charismatic relic, and the grand irony is this: What that look, and sound, are all about is an era when rock \u2018n\u2019 roll strutted its \u201cauthenticity,\u201d but now that he\u2019s out of date, Jackson\u2019s authenticity looks more than ever like a showbiz conceit, frozen in amber. It\u2019s a part he\u2019s playing, an image he\u2019s working \u2014 and secretly struggling \u2014 to keep alive. He\u2019s got a signature ballad that goes \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to let the old ways die,\u201d and when he wrote it (long ago), he probably didn\u2019t know that he was talking about himself.\n\nIn the first of many telling jump cuts, the film leaps from his on-stage glory to Jackson slinking into the back of his car, weary and alone, grabbing the bottle of gin he\u2019s got stashed there. He takes a guzzle, and Cooper, acting with his body, lets you feel just how much Jackson (between sickly coughs) needs the lifeblood of that drink. It\u2019s what he believes in more than the show he\u2019s just finished.\n\nHow do you play a drunk? We know, of course, that the answer is not to \u201cplay drunk,\u201d but Cooper doesn\u2019t just avoid the usual slurry shambling (though at key moments he does a little of that too, and it\u2019s powerful). He brings off something I\u2019ve rarely seen done this exquisitely: He plays blitzed, very functional and in his element, his smile and reflexes greased by the liquor. Jackson speaks in a deep, low, deliberate Southern-stud growl \u2014 a voice with real music in it, though one that lets you taste all the booze it\u2019s marinated in.\n\nNeeding another drink, he has his driver drop him off at the first available bar, which turns out to be a roadside dive on drag-queen karaoke night. It\u2019s not his scene, but he doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s the same celebrity everywhere he goes, so he\u2019s in the perfect mood of lit-up contentment when she walks on stage.\n\nShe is Ally, the one non-drag performer of the night (she\u2019s friends with all the queens there, so they let her sing for real). When she enters the room, the movie pulls off a neat trick. We\u2019ve already seen Ally break up with her boyfriend over the phone, letting out a banshee wail in the process, and when she appears in heavy white-make up and pasted on half-circle eyebrows, her hair teased into a punked-out French pastry, then does a strutting-down-the-bar version of \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d that she milks for every flourish of theatrical kitsch she can, we think, \u201cOf course! How Gaga-netic!\u201d Backstage after the show, Jackson gently pulls off one of Ally\u2019s eyebrows and asks her out for a drink.\n\nBut when she emerges from the dressing room minus all the Gaga trappings, we\u2019re shocked to see a young woman with softly falling straight brown hair and the sweetest of chiclet-tooth grins, and this is the movie\u2019s way of saying: Ladies and gentlemen, meet Lady Gaga, actress. A character we haven\u2019t seen before.\n\nAlly, make no mistake, has sass to spare (later that evening, when Jackson is confronted by a troublemaker at his favorite cop bar, she gives him a punch), but Gaga, in an ebullient and winningly direct performance, never lets her own star quality get in the way of the character. Or, rather, she lets us see that star quality is something that lives inside Ally but is still waiting to come out (the way it was in the young Streisand of \u201cFunny Girl\u201d). Ally works as a waitress and lives with her dad, the Sinatra-fixated passive-aggressive Teddy bear Lorenzo (Andrew Dice Clay) in a modest suburban neighborhood, and she and Jackson strike an unforced connection. He can let down his guard around her, and his wistful melancholy starts to seep out.\n\nCooper has made a jaggedly tender love story that is never over-the-top, an operatic movie that dares to be quiet. Ally has something that Jackson recognizes because he used to have it too: the songwriter\u2019s passion, the drive to take your own story and turn it into a jukebox poem. They have a great conversation about her Roman nose \u2014 which plays, knowingly, off the prejudices of the music industry that Gaga confronted on her way up. Ally thinks her nose is too big (or so she\u2019s been told), but Jackson thinks it\u2019s beautiful \u2014 and, of course, he\u2019s right.\n\nHe listens to a song she wrote, and can tell that she\u2019s got the gift, so after wooing her to one of his concerts, he suddenly brings her onstage to sing that song with him. It\u2019s called \u201cShallow,\u201d and when their voices melt together on the line \u201cWe\u2019re far from the shallow now,\u201d we melt along with them, and when Ally suddenly sends the song into a higher register, you will feel tingles rippling through your body. It\u2019s an absolutely ecstatic moment, because it\u2019s about the fusion of these two voices and souls, about Jackson coming back to life, about Ally realizing her destiny, and about the audience\u2019s rediscovery of what romance in a movie can still be: a volt to the heart.\n\nDoes Jackson want Ally to become a star? Sort of. He\u2019s the one who makes it possible, but after a video of their live duet goes viral, she\u2019s approached after a show by a rock manager, Dez (Rafi Gavron), who gives her the I-can-make-you-a-star rap. Immediately, we know where this is going: to a place Jackson is not going to like. The manager represents the dissolution of Jackson\u2019s sway over Ally, something the movie views in contemporary feminist terms. In his dissolute-rocker way, Jackson is grounded in the old male establishment, a place where Ally can be a \u201cgirl singer.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t realize is that she\u2019s going to embrace stardom on her own terms, and they aren\u2019t his.\n\nRafi Gavron\u2019s terrific performance as Rez, the tough-love manager, is a great example of what\u2019s so compelling about the new \u201cStar Is Born.\u201d We\u2019ve seen this character \u2014 slick, British, corporate \u2014 before, and he\u2019s always played as an insidious pest who symbolizes the big sellout. But that\u2019s not the way Gavron plays him. He makes Rez a smart and compelling straight shooter, and the movie never caricatures him as a sleaze.\n\nInstead, it flips our expectations. Ally gets plugged into the 21st-century pop machine \u2014 high-dazzle robotic choreography, a new glam look with flaming red hair, the whole media swirl, complete with meticulously timed rollout performance on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 and we realize that the film is playing off Lady Gaga\u2019s own rise. The fascination of this is that instead of satirizing Ally\u2019s journey as some sort of plunge into synthetic marketing decadence, the movie says, in essence: This is the new landscape, same as the old landscape. Next to Jackson\u2019s world, it looks \u201cinauthentic\u201d (and viewers of a certain age may automatically view it that way), but Jackson\u2019s world probably looked inauthentic to the generation before it. The movie says that in pop (as in life), it\u2019s always time for the old ways to die, and for the new ways to be born.\n\nThat\u2019s what Jackson can\u2019t handle, and it\u2019s why he drinks. Cooper has a couple of scenes in which Jackson gets sloppy and nasty: he \u201caffectionately\u201d smears Ally\u2019s face with cake, and when she\u2019s taking a bath, and he\u2019s really sozzled, he starts to rag on her and even drops the U-word (\u201cugly\u201d), which shocks us. But it\u2019s part of the power of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d that their relationship is never one-note; it\u2019s tender, sexy, angry, jealous, and sad, all at the same time. It\u2019s a real love, and could have stayed that way except that Jackson is too broken. The movie lets us touch his damage, body and soul: the hearing loss accompanied by tinnitus (which we hear on the soundtrack), the sense that going through the motions of stardom for too long has ground him to a weary nub. Sam Elliott, with white hair, his mopey bluntness sharper than ever, plays Jackson\u2019s older brother, Bobby, who has been his road manager for years (but has had it with cleaning up after Jackson\u2019s messes), and the two actors give their fights, and embraces, a deeply rooted sense of the past. They got a raw deal growing up with a drunken father, and they\u2019re still playing it out.\n\nThe best version of \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d has always been the 1954 George Cukor version: moody, purplish, extravagant, driven by Judy Garland\u2019s self-dramatizing fever. The scene you remember best from it, apart from Garland singing \u201cThe Man That Got Away,\u201d is James Mason\u2019s demented drunken slap of Garland during the Academy Awards \u2014 one of the most outrageous moments in movie history. In the new \u201cStar Is Born,\u201d Bradley Cooper pays homage to that moment, in a scene set at the Grammys, and actually tops it in outrageousness, in sick-joke masochistic power. And he does it convincingly. That\u2019s part of the magnetic pull of this version \u2014 it, too, is a romance heightened by the cruel mirror of showbiz. Yet it has a naked humanity that leaves you wowed. These two people, the rising star and the fading star, are locked in a love as true as it is torn, and by the end of the movie they\u2019ve both become us. \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is a reminder of the scrappy grand passion that movies are all about.\n\nRELATED VIDEO:", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/asib-06030r221-e1536072536291.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/asib-06030r221-e1536072536291.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C998px%2C562px&resize=681%2C383", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Freviews%2Fa-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-1202922858%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202922858&comment_count=87", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/asib-06030r221-e1536072536291.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Owen Gleiberman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-1202922858/", "title": "Film Review: \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga are stunning together in Cooper's rapturous rock 'n' roll remake of a romantic saga that never gets old.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202922858, "author": "Owen Gleiberman", "pmc-category": "Reviews", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-08-31T10:15:18"}, "pmc-tag": "A Star Is Born,Bradley Cooper,Lady Gaga,Venice Film Festival", "title": "Film Review: \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film,music", "pmc-primary-category": "Reviews", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Film Review: \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/a-star-is-born-review-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-1202922858/", "description": "\u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie.

But that\u2019s not the way Gavron plays him. He makes Rez a smart and compelling straight shooter, and the movie never caricatures him as a sleaze.\r\n\r\nInstead, it flips our expectations. Ally gets plugged into the 21st-century pop machine \u2014 high-dazzle robotic choreography, a new glam look with flaming red hair, the whole media swirl, complete with meticulously timed rollout performance on \"Saturday Night Live\" \u2014 and we realize that the film is playing off Lady Gaga\u2019s own rise. The fascination of this is that instead of satirizing Ally\u2019s journey as some sort of plunge into synthetic marketing decadence, the movie says, in essence: This is the new landscape, same as the old landscape. Next to Jackson\u2019s world, it looks \"inauthentic\" (and viewers of a certain age may automatically view it that way), but Jackson\u2019s world probably looked inauthentic to the generation before it. The movie says that in pop (as in life), it\u2019s always time for the old ways to die, and for the new ways to be born.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what Jackson can\u2019t handle, and it\u2019s why he drinks. Cooper has a couple of scenes in which Jackson gets sloppy and nasty: he \"affectionately\" smears Ally\u2019s face with cake, and when she\u2019s taking a bath, and he\u2019s really sozzled, he starts to rag on her and even drops the U-word (\"ugly\"), which shocks us. But it\u2019s part of the power of \"A Star Is Born\" that their relationship is never one-note; it\u2019s tender, sexy, angry, jealous, and sad, all at the same time. It\u2019s a real love, and could have stayed that way except that Jackson is too broken. The movie lets us touch his damage, body and soul: the hearing loss accompanied by tinnitus (which we hear on the soundtrack), the sense that going through the motions of stardom for too long has ground him to a weary nub. Sam Elliott, with white hair, his mopey bluntness sharper than ever, plays Jackson\u2019s older brother, Bobby, who has been his road manager for years (but has had it with cleaning up after Jackson\u2019s messes), and the two actors give their fights, and embraces, a deeply rooted sense of the past. They got a raw deal growing up with a drunken father, and they\u2019re still playing it out.\r\n\r\nThe best version of \"A Star Is Born\" has always been the 1954 George Cukor version: moody, purplish, extravagant, driven by Judy Garland\u2019s self-dramatizing fever. The scene you remember best from it, apart from Garland singing \"The Man That Got Away,\" is James Mason\u2019s demented drunken slap of Garland during the Academy Awards \u2014 one of the most outrageous moments in movie history. In the new \"Star Is Born,\" Bradley Cooper pays homage to that moment, in a scene set at the Grammys, and actually tops it in outrageousness, in sick-joke masochistic power. And he does it convincingly. That\u2019s part of the magnetic pull of this version \u2014 it, too, is a romance heightened by the cruel mirror of showbiz. Yet it has a naked humanity that leaves you wowed. These two people, the rising star and the fading star, are locked in a love as true as it is torn, and by the end of the movie they've both become us. \"A Star Is Born\" is a reminder of the scrappy grand passion that movies are all about.\r\n\r\nRELATED VIDEO:", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535735718.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
