But, as far as the public knows, the newborn still doesn\u2019t have a name! HollywoodLife.com learned EXCLUSIVELY that\u2019s actually for a very good reason though. Find out what all the secrecy is about here!\n\nNow that Liam Payne\u2018s, 23, a father, he knows exactly what it\u2019s like to want to protect your child at all costs. And that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing! Everything changed for the One Directioner when his girlfriend Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, 33, gave birth to their first child, a baby boy, on Mar. 22. And while we have seen a pic of Liam holding the tiny bundle of joy, that will most likely be the only photo we see of the infant for quite a while.\n\n\u201cLiam is being careful to protect his new family and has no plans to take his baby out into the world anytime soon,\u201d an insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe and Cheryl are getting help from close family and will not be releasing the name or pictures of their baby anytime soon.\u201d So while apparently the baby boy HAS been given a name, fans won\u2019t get any the details until Liam and Cheryl feel the time is right. Is anyone else super anxious to find out more about the little one?\n\n\u201cThey are savoring every moment of privacy and soaking up all the love for themselves,\u201d our source added.\u201d It will be a while before they are ready to let the world in on their private bundle of joy.\u201d Aw! We can\u2019t say we disagree. So far though, what Liam has shared has been both adorable and comical. Days after he and Cheryl posted the pic of the singer holding his son, Liam took to Twitter to express that he\u2019s ALREADY struggling with diaper duty.\n\n\u201cWhen the fourth nappy happens in 5 minutes,\u201d he wrote on Mar. 27, along with a gif of David Schwimmer\u2018s, 50, Ross Geller from Friends yelling: \u201cNo!, No, no!\u201d At least he can laugh about it, right?\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think it\u2019s a smart idea to keep the baby\u2019s name under wraps for now? When do you think Liam and Cheryl will announce it?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F03%2F30%2Fliam-payne-why-baby-name-secret-cheryl-son-privacy%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2527181", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/liam-payne-cheryl-spl-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/liam-payne-cheryl-spl-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/liam-payne-cheryl-spl-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/03/30/liam-payne-why-baby-name-secret-cheryl-son-privacy/", "title": "Liam Payne & Cheryl \u2018Relishing\u2019 Every Private Minute With Son: Why They\u2019re Keeping Name Secret", "meta_data": {"description": "Liam Payne &amp; Cheryl welcomed their precious baby boy over one week ago.
