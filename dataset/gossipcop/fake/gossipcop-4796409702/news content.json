Rodriguez/Getty Images]\n\nRadar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner\u2019s \u201cmoney making machine\u201d after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she\u2019s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her \u201cmomager,\u201d had been controlling her life and career.\n\n\u201cKim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,\u201d an insider told the site of Kardashian\u2019s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to \u201cphase out\u201d Kris from her career.\n\n\u201cKim is just starting to think that maybe Kris\u2019s intentions were not pure all along,\u201d continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris\u2019s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.\n\n[Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]\n\n\u201c[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris\u2019s help,\u201d a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.\n\nWhat do you think of reports claiming Kim Kardashian and mom Kris Jenner could be caught in a feud amid claims Kim is attempting to \u201cphase out\u201d her mother\u2019s management?\n\n[Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-460347614.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04740ca59ff3a7ed6178872d42206b16?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-459809326.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GettyImages-485155908.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kim-Kardashian-Kris-Jenner-Feud.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Hutchinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3859542/kim-kardashian-kris-jenner-feuding-feud-kim-phasing-out-used-her/", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kris Jenner Feud?
