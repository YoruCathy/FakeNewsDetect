A new report claims they found love with each other after their divorces with Ben Affleck and Fergie.\n\nJennifer Garner, 45, and Josh Duhamel, 45, may have found love again \u2014 with each other! A new report claims the Love, Simon co-stars have apparently been in a secret relationship \u201cfor months\u201d and built their rumored romance during breaks from filming, a source told OK! \u201cThat\u2019s the best time for those intimate conversations, the ones you have at the beginning of a relationship to happen,\u201d the insider said. \u201cAway from home and looking for companionship, it\u2019s easy to see what happened.\u201d\n\nIf these two are together, it\u2019d be pretty interesting timing considering their divorces from Ben Affleck, 45, and Fergie, 42. Jen and Ben announced they were separating in 2015, after a decade of marriage. They officially filed for divorce in April 2017. \u201cAnyone in Jen\u2019s shoes, after all she went through with Ben, would doubt whether they could ever trust a man again,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut Josh is truly a good guy, and spending time with him opened her up emotionally. She\u2019s still playing her cards close to the vest, but she\u2019s excited about where this could go.\u201d\n\nJosh and Fergie were married for eight years before announcing in Sept. 2017 that they had separated earlier in the year. \u201cTo be honest, hardly anyone close to him thought Josh and Fergie made a good couple. She was too wild for him. Josh is a homebody and craves the simple life. With Jen, he\u2019d get that in spades. She\u2019s very sweet and family-oriented,\u201d the source added.\n\nWhile Jen and Josh would certainly make a cute couple, we aren\u2019t completely convinced that they\u2019re together because not only have they never spoken publicly about their rumored romance, but Jen has actually said she isn\u2019t too interested in something serious right now. \u201c\u201cI haven\u2019t been on a date and I am not interested in dating,\u201d she told news.com.au in a Nov. 2017 interview. \u201cPeople want to set me up and I am just like, \u2018No thank you!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut if you\u2019ve decided that you totally ship this speculative couple, at least you have their new movie to look forward to in which they star as a couple and the parents to Simon, played by Jurassic World\u2018s Nick Robinson, 22. Love, Simon, a comedy-drama based on the novel Simon Vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda is set for a March, 16, 2018 release. It also stars 13 Reasons Why\u2018s Katherine Langford, 21. Even if Jen and Josh aren\u2019t a couple IRL, we\u2019re sure they\u2019ll be great together in their upcoming movie!\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Jen and Josh\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of the report that Josh and Jen are dating?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jennifer_josh-ftr.jpg?w=620", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F10%2Fjennifer-garner-josh-duhamel-dating-divorce-ben-affleck-fergie%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2941798&comment_count=2", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jennifer_josh-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/jennifer_josh-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/10/jennifer-garner-josh-duhamel-dating-divorce-ben-affleck-fergie/", "title": "Are Jennifer Garner & Josh Duhamel Dating After Devastating Divorces From Ben Affleck & Fergie?", "meta_data": {"description": "Are Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel dating after their divorces from Ben Affleck and Fergie?
