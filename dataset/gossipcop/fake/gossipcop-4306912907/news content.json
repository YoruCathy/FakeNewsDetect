With almost 10 years of Web site experience under her belt (and decades more as a Hollywood actress), Paltrow typically seems unbothered by her opponents, who have lambasted her for everything from publishing outrageous gift guides to using pseudo-science to promote products. That is until ob-gyn Jen Gunter, a longtime critic of the lifestyle Web site, published a blog post in January about Goop selling its much-discussed $66 vaginal jade eggs, writing, \u201cThe only thing your post got right is to check with your doctor before using one. So let me give you some free advice, don\u2019t use vaginal jade eggs.\u201d In a rare move, Goop responded, on Thursday, with Paltrow tweeting out a link to the statement, along with Michelle Obama\u2019s famed Democratic convention quote, \u201cWhen they go low, we go high,\u201d which, it should be noted, was not in reference to vaginas.\n\n\u201cAs goop has grown, so has the attention we receive. We consistently find ourselves to be of interest to many\u2014and for that, we are grateful\u2014but we also find that there are third parties who critique goop to leverage that interest and bring attention to themselves,\u201d the post began before turning its focus to Gunter, who was referred to as a \u201cSan Francisco-based ob-gyn/blogger,\u201d who, Goop claimed, \u201chas been taking advantage of the attention and issuing attacks to build her personal platform\u2014ridiculing the women who might read our site in the process.\u201d\n\nGoop\u2019s blog ended with letters from two doctors, Steven Gundry and Aviva Romm. Gundry opened his letter criticizing Gunter\u2019s language (\u201cI have never seen a medical discussion start or end with the \u2018F-bomb,\u2019 yet yours did\u201d) before proceeding to list off his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, making sure to add that he has never \u201cdropped\u201d an \u201cF-bomb\u201d while speaking with a \u201cdiscussant.\u201d\n\nGunter spoke to Buzzfeed about Goop\u2019s statement while on vacation in England, telling the outlet she \u201cwas shocked to see Gundry mansplaining science to me. I have four board certifications. I was a doctor when I was 23.\u201d She also questioned why she was the one to be singled out by Goop and Paltrow, as there are many Goop-critics to choose from, including Stephen Colbert and Timothy Caulfield, who wrote an article for Salon in 2015 called \u201cGwyneth Paltrow Is Wrong About Everything\u201d and recently published a book with a slightly less-declarative title, \u201cIs Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?: When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash.\u201d Caulfield also spoke to Buzzfeed about Gunter\u2019s work, saying, \u201cWe need more and more voices like Jen to combat the noise on pop culture around health, which is often dominated by science-free celebrities.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint exactly why Jen Gunter was the one to face the unusual ire of Goop and the Goop-adjacent. It could be because, unlike Colbert or even Caulfield, Gunter, as an unknown target, was easier to lash out at. Or maybe she was Goop's most-prolific critic who finally managed to push one button too many. Or Goop was just really tired of all those F-bombs. Whatever the reason and regardless of scientific facts, history has taught us that the world of Goop will keep on spinning.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f8c2f3d30c374e9109f683/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Goop-Summit.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58d594990920c94abb961a0e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/celebrity-godparents-children-ss01-a.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936cd1929fc2c6405bcc5fe/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/gywneth-paltrow-doesnt-know.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58d594990920c94abb961a0d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/celebrity-godparents-children-ss03.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58d594990920c94abb961a0c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/celebrity-godparents-children-ss02.png", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594c185f68eab65bcd735af6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/nasa-vs-goop.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood", "Erika Harwoo", "Lauren Le Vin", "Kenzie Bryan", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-jade-egg-statement", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop Issues a Rare Response to a Critic", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "You can mess with Gwyn, but you can\u2019t mess with her jade egg.", "id": "5968d69296475a07efe9944d", "keywords": "celebrity,vanities,gwyneth paltrow,goop,jade egg", "news_keywords": "celebrity,vanities,gwyneth paltrow,goop,jade egg", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5968d69296475a07efe9944d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"You can mess with Gwyn, but you can\u2019t mess with her jade egg.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png\"}", "og": {"description": "You can mess with Gwyn, but you can\u2019t mess with her jade egg.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop Issues a Rare Response to a Critic", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-jade-egg-statement"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "You can mess with Gwyn, but you can\u2019t mess with her jade egg.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5968d922bbf8842bfabbf773/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gwyneth-paltrow-responds-to-critic.png?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop Issues a Rare Response to a Critic"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
