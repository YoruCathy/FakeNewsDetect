Now, her incredible chemistry with Strahan\u2019s replacement, Ryan Seacrest, is undeniable, but in the midst of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Ripa is feeling betrayed and torn about standing beside him. Could these skeletons in Seacrest\u2019s closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?\n\nAccording to Life & Style, in the era of the #MeToo and #Time\u2019sUp movements every business is playing it safe, and that means things could change at Live, especially if ratings start to drop and big names start to avoid the show.\n\n\u201c[Kelly\u2019s] waiting to see what happens with Ryan. But [either way] this is a dark period for her,\u201d reveals an insider. \u201cShe\u2019s pissed\u2026Kelly feels blindsided. The last thing she needs is celebrities boycotting. Everyone is on pins and needles.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasn\u2019t the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.\n\nThis resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.\n\nRipa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn\u2019t mean she still isn\u2019t conflicted about the allegations.\n\nShe does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.\n\nRipa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser\u2019s head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.\n\nBut, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.\n\nOscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLive with Kelly and Ryan, starring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, airs weekday mornings in syndication around the country.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kelly-Ripa-Leaving-Live-She-Feels-Betrayed-By-Ryan-Seacrest-Amid-Sexual-Harassment-Claims.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c4eb22e316d2891e343d51dc44ce7c9c?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/35e51f42f2bcdafa0de5278d6bf01eaf?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1e996d3c406abbc0fe6803091dea9855?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/421821f61548302b23145895cff92b4d?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/38946b81e91b7c32bc118c87f78156c5?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kelly-Ripa-Heartbroken-For-Eva-LaRue-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/American-Idol-Producers-Are-Trying-To-Figure-Out-How-To-Finish-Out-The-Season-Amid-Coronavirus-Pandemic-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/472ea9a891a638f77be362cdae507f2d?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e3dbbcc4b2b9d3f00d75fc36ddb8e15?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c3fe954802745172afc65ef70d900339?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Stan-Lee-PageSix.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c0ea7b8416e5970a0dd7b3e3f9efbad?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e95a17aa6620c3abd6be9187ba1805c7?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c185e3c03ada0a4e5490eb57811f895c?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kelly-Ripa-RedBookMag.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d466e659c1c2fa2b9c8f309c6ad1a0df?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kelly-Ripa-Leaving-Live-She-Feels-Betrayed-By-Ryan-Seacrest-Amid-Sexual-Harassment-Claims.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kelly-ripa-leaving-live-she-feels-betrayed-by-ryan-seacrest-amid-sexual-harassment-claims-126041/", "title": "Kelly Ripa Leaving \u2018Live\u2019?
