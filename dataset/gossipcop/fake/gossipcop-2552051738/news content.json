Incommunicado. No visitors. No internet. No phone calls. No access to outside world. This is torture -- a slow, painful death [at] the hands of the US [and] UK. I feel for Ecuador.

We are all Julian Assange.\"\n\nWith her visits to Assange suddenly halted, Anderson is once again drumming up speculation around the nature of her relationship with the controversial figure. Though the actress has been dating 32-year-old soccer star Adil Rami since 2017, it's unclear whether or not that romance is exclusive.\n\n\"I don't want to say anything about whether there's a romance,\" Anderson once told Grazia of her relationship with Assange. \"So, let's say we're just 'good friends.'\"\n\nSources close to the WikiLeaks founder say that he has a \"deep crush\" on the actress because \"she's just out of reach.\"\n\n\"Julian has a thing for blondes and he's always been quite the womanizer,\" a source told Page Six. \"But Pam's much more intelligent than most women with that kind of look -- she's no bimbo.\"\n\nAssange has reportedly \"had a lot of so-called 'girlfriends' visit him there before Pam,\" but \"they were the kind of groupies who fall for men in prison.\"\n\nThough neither has done much to quell rumors of a romance between them, sources familiar with the \"Baywatch\" actress question her motives in getting involved with Assange and her highly-photographed visits to see him.\n\n\"Pam thrives on attention from famous men, and she thrives on press,\" one source said. \"It's no accident she shows up to the embassy in those sexy outfits. They are all very contrived.\"\n\nIndeed, the outfits that Anderson has worn to visit Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy are always glamorous, often skin-baring and definitely thought-out. The paparazzi are frequently already there catching her enter and exit the property, often carrying bags full of food.\n\nSee photos of Julian Assange:\n\n\n\n14 PHOTOS Julian Assange See Gallery Julian Assange WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a speech from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy, in central London, Britain February 5, 2016.

The founder of a website which published tens of thousands of leaked military files about the war in Afghanistan said Monday they showed that the 'course of the war needs to change'. In all, some 92,000 documents dating back to 2004 were released by the whistleblowers' website Wikileaks to the New York Times, Britain's Guardian newspaper, and Germany's Der Spiegel news weekly. Assange also used a press conference in London to dismiss the White House's furious reaction to the disclosures.
