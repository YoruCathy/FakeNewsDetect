She credits Joe for that and realizes how much better off she is.\u201d\n\nSwift, for one of the first times in the public eye, has not talked about Alwyn in any interviews. She has barely been photographed out with him, though this week they were shot holding hands in Turks and Caicos. \u201cThey seemed genuinely happy,\u201d a witness there told Us of their interactions out and about there. \u201cThey were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.\u201d\n\nSwift isn't about to say anything about Alwyn though, another source cautioned the outlet.
