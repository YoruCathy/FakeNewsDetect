It would mark his return to the stage after the infamous \"Nipplegate\" incident in in 2004, when he performed with Janet Jackson for his song \"Rock Your Body\" and accidentally tore part of her costume off and exposed her nipple to viewers watching all over the country.\n\nAccording to the report, if Timberlake signs the deal, he is said to be performing solo, and won't be bringing any of his former collaborators in as surprise guests.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nOf course, Timberlake isn't the only performer whose name has been dropped as a performer for the 2018 show. Here are five other artists who have been reportedly tapped to headline the event:\n\nJay-Z\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThere were numerous reports that a Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake co-performance was being sought out for the show, with a chance that they would be collaborating together being \"very high,\" according to BET. It's unclear if Jay-Z was also being considered as a solo act, but he was recently reported to have turned down the gig.\n\nBritney Spears\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nTimberlake's long-time ex was also previously rumored as a consideration for the show earlier this year, marking a potential return after her last performance in 2001. However, a Pepsi executive who would help determine the performer shot down the rumor in July.\n\n\"I can tell you it's not Britney,\" Justin Toman said. \"We'll reveal in due time.\"\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThe \"Look What You Made Me Do\" singer has been a favorite to headline the big game's halftime show for years, and doing so in 2018, fresh off the release of her highly-anticipated \"Redemption\" album, would make the game a great stage for her. However, she has reportedly already booked a different huge event in terms of halftime shows, so it seems more likely that she wouldn't be taking the Super Bowl gig this time around.\n\nAdam Lambert and Queen\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nWhile not officially rumored to be contenders, the \"American Idol\" winner and the classic rock band, who are currently touring together, did win a Pop Crush fan poll when it came to who should perform at the NFL event. Compared to other performers on the poll, which included Christina Aguilera and Kylie Minogue, they handily won out with 38 percent of the votes.\n\nBTS\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nThe Korean pop band also hasn't been officially reported to be tapped for the big show, but a Billboard poll had them winning out with a considerably large percentage over several other contenders who were more mainstream. In that poll, 58 percent of fans wanted the group to perform at the show. The next closest contenders were Justin Bieber with 13 percent of the votes, Twenty One Pilots with nine percent, and Rihanna with four percent. The other contenders included Swift, Maroon 5, Kanye West, Miley Cyrus, The Weeknd, Carrie Underwood and Spears.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/small-business-administration-chief-jovita-carranza-has-overseen.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/09/27/jay-z.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/the-group-tours-istanbul-neighbourhoods-densely-populated-by.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2014/01/21/target-logo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/09/27/adam-lambert-queen.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/09/27/justin-timberlake.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/09/27/bts.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/03/19/spacex-dragon-has-made-several-resupply-trips-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/president-donald-trump-flanked-by-vice-president-mike.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/wuhan-is-slowly-reopening-after-a-lockdown-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/09/27/justin-timberlake.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/09/27/britney-spears.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/arinew10.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/09/27/taylor-swift.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/02/06/airasias-top-executives-have-stepped-aside-during-an.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/09/27/justin-timberlake.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/justin-timberlake-5-other-stars-rumored-perform-super-bowl-2018-2594783", "title": "Justin Timberlake, 5 Other Stars Rumored To Perform At Super Bowl 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "super bowl 2018 halftime show, justin timberlake super bowl 2018, jay-z super bowl 2018, britney spears super bowl 2018, taylor swift super bowl 2018, adam lambert and queen super bowl 2018, bts super bowl 2018", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/justin-timberlake-5-other-stars-rumored-perform-super-bowl-2018-2594783", "title": "Justin Timberlake, 5 Other Stars Rumored To Perform At Super Bowl 2018", "description": "Justin Timberlake isn't the only artist whose name has been tossed around in connection with the Super Bowl 2018 halftime show.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/09/27/justin-timberlake.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/09/27/justin-timberlake.jpg", "height": 3509, "width": 5264, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Lauren Dubois", "modified_time": "2017-10-23T14:48:37-04:00", "published_time": "2017-09-27T15:27:10-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Timberlake, 5 Other Stars Rumored To Perform At Super Bowl 2018", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/justin-timberlake-5-other-stars-rumored-perform-super-bowl-2018-2594783", "description": "Justin Timberlake isn't the only artist whose name has been tossed around in connection with the Super Bowl 2018 halftime show.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/09/27/justin-timberlake.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "super bowl 2018 halftime show, justin timberlake super bowl 2018, jay-z super bowl 2018, britney spears super bowl 2018, taylor swift super bowl 2018, adam lambert and queen super bowl 2018, bts super bowl 2018", "author": "Lauren Dubois", "description": "Justin Timberlake isn't the only artist whose name has been tossed around in connection with the Super Bowl 2018 halftime show."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506540430.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
