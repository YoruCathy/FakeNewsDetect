{"url": "www.teenvogue.com/gallery/kendall-jenner-best-kuwtk-quotes", "text": "Kendall Jenner has spent nearly half of her life on camera. She was just 11 when her family\u2019s TV show hit the airwaves in 2007, which means that almost every awkward moment of her life is also featured in an episode on E! We\u2019ve watched her blossom from a little kid whose main function was to serve as comedic relief for sister\u2019s onscreen exploits to the graceful, calm, and collected supermodel she is today.\n\nWhile the Kardashian sisters are zany, outspoken, and uber-glam, Kendall\u2019s always been a bit more grounded in real life. When she speaks, she\u2019s to the point \u2014 dare we say she\u2019s wise beyond her years? Kendall has a knack for hitting the nail on head when it comes to being real. What would the show be without her confessional reality checks and one-liners?\n\nIn that spirit, we rounded up some of Kendall\u2019s wisest, most matter-of-fact moments. Feel free to use them when you need to channel your inner smart-ass supermodel.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819df11c1cacbb91ceb1676/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/GettyImages-618502178%20Cropped.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193866c1cacbb91ceb1656/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/09.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193862421843cf657bf47f/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/07.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386bc1cacbb91ceb1658/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/14.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819385cc1cacbb91ceb1652/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/02.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386d421843cf657bf483/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/16.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193868421843cf657bf481/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/12.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193865421843cf657bf480/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/10.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386dc1cacbb91ceb1659/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/15.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819385f421843cf657bf47d/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/04.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193870421843cf657bf485/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/19.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193860c1cacbb91ceb1654/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/06.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193864c1cacbb91ceb1655/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/08.gif", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819395f421843cf657bf487/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/20.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386e421843cf657bf484/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/18.gif", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193860421843cf657bf47e/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/05.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58193868c1cacbb91ceb1657/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/11.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386ec1cacbb91ceb165a/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/17.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386b421843cf657bf482/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/13.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819385c421843cf657bf47c/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/01.gif", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819385fc1cacbb91ceb1653/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/03.gif"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819df11c1cacbb91ceb1676/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/GettyImages-618502178%20Cropped.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kara Nesvig", "Kara Nesvi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/kendall-jenner-best-kuwtk-quotes", "title": "Kendall Jenner's 20 Best 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' Moments", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kara Nesvig", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Kendall Jenner may be a supermodel, but she's also super relatable \u2014 see her wisest quotes and moments here.", "id": "5819384ec1cacbb91ceb1651", "keywords": "tv,kendall jenner", "news_keywords": "tv,kendall jenner", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "gallery", "parsely-post-id": "5819384ec1cacbb91ceb1651", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kendall Jenner may be a supermodel, but she's also super relatable \u2014 see her wisest quotes and moments here.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386dc1cacbb91ceb1659/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/15.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819386dc1cacbb91ceb1659/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/15.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "Kenny knows best.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819df11c1cacbb91ceb1676/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/GettyImages-618502178%20Cropped.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "20 Times Kendall Jenner Was Secretly the Smartest Person on 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/kendall-jenner-best-kuwtk-quotes"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Kenny knows best.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5819df11c1cacbb91ceb1676/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/GettyImages-618502178%20Cropped.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "20 Times Kendall Jenner Was Secretly the Smartest Person on 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
