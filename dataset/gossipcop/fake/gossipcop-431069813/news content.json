The record will notably feature a collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Future titled, \u201cEnd Game.\u201d The album will also include previously released songs, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d \u201cGorgeous,\u201d \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d and \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d Swift served as executive producer on Reputation, while Jack Antonoff, Max Martin and Shellback also contributed production.\n\n***\n\nTaylor Swift\u2018s new album Reputation will not be available on streaming services upon its release November 10th, Bloomberg reports.\n\nThe record is expected to be withheld through its first week of sales, though Swift is reportedly still negotiating the specifics with various platforms. Despite its absence from streaming services, Reputation will still be available via digital retailers like iTunes.\n\nA representative for Swift did not immediately return Rolling Stone\u2018s request for comment.\n\nSwift has been one of the most vocal critics of streaming services, even temporarily pulling her music from all of them in 2014. Around the same time, Swift called streaming \u201ca grand experiment\u201d and said she was apprehensive about how fairly it compensated artists, producers and songwriters. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Swift wrote, \u201cMusic is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Swift began to soften her stance, first making 1989 available on Apple Music after Apple changed its policies on paying artists and musician\u2019s royalties. However, it was only this past June that Swift re-released her entire back catalog on all streaming services, including Spotify.\n\nWhile streaming continues to grow as the dominate form of music consumption, some high-profile artists have continued to shun the platforms \u2013 at least temporarily \u2013 to chase physical and digital sales. Most notably, Adele\u2019s 2015 album 25 was unavailable on streaming platforms for months, yet still sold a record-breaking 3.38 million copies in its first week. Swift\u2019s decision to withhold 1989 from streaming services didn\u2019t hurt its sales either, as it finished in the top three in global sales for 2014 and 2015.\n\nReputation Track List\n\n1. \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d\n\n2. \u201cEnd Game\u201d (ft.
