[He\u2019s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he\u2019s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own \u2013 starting his own church \u2013 we\u2019re not quite sure, but that\u2019s the word from an inside source.\u201d\n\nApologising to his fans via TMZ for cancelling his upcoming shows, Bieber said: \u201cI love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed, it\u2019s not in my heart [or] anything, and have a blessed day.\u201d\n\nThe cancellation was announced via a statement on his website, which reads: \u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. He is grateful and honoured to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across 6 continents during this run.\u201d Advertisement Meanwhile, Bieber has also reportedly been banned from China \u2013 while \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 star Sophie Turner has tipped him to be the next music cameo in the show following on from Ed Sheeran. \u201cThat was fun because Maisie loves Ed Sheeran and [creators] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] had it as, like, a surprise for her,\u201d said Turner at Comic-Con. \u201cSo they just, they didn\u2019t tell her. I told her by accident! I was like, \u2018Oh, when\u2019s Ed Sheeran coming on the show?\u2019 But yeah, they kind of did it as a surprise.\u201d She continued: \u201cI was kind of mad because I\u2019ve been talking about [Justin] Bieber coming on the show for a while now. But it\u2019s fine, I\u2019m over it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015JustinBieber_2_DC_131115.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Trendell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-bieber-starting-church-2116040", "title": "Is Justin Bieber starting up his own church?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Is Justin Bieber starting up his own church? | NME", "description": "Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-bieber-starting-church-2116040", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2017-07-25T08:02:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Following the cancellation of his tour, rumour has now spread that Justin Bieber may be planning to start up his own church", "title": "Is Justin Bieber starting up his own church? | NME", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500969775.0, "source": "http://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
