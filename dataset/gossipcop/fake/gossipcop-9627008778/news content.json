The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.\u201d\n\nDuring the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. \u201cJen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn\u2019t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,\u201d added the source.\n\n\u201cThe kids love when they all spend time together,\u201d said a second source.\n\nWhen filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. \u201cHe\u2019s found a really good routine,\u201d an insider said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gal/BACKGRID\n\nDays before Garner and the children arrived in Hawaii, Affleck\u2019s girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, also visited him.\n\nSources have said the two are in a committed relationship but taking it slow.\n\n\u201cBen is in a very committed relationship with Lindsey Shook us and they too work hard to balance time between work, friends and their families,\u201d says the source close to Affleck.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Garner was spotted out in N.Y.C. looking relaxed and happy. The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladur\u00e9e.\n\nGarner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who\u2019s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. \u201cAs long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,\u201d another insider said. \u201cShe will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Jennifer Garner and Kids Visit Ben Affleck in Hawaii for Easter Weekend\n\nThe actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles.
