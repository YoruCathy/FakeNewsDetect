Simpson is her biological father. It was alleged that Kris Jenner carried on a secret affair with the former pro-football player during her marriage to Simpson\u2019s lawyer, Robert Kardashian.\n\nJenner admitted in her book, Kris Jenner and All Things Kardashian, to an affair around the time Kardashian was conceived.\n\nSources tell Radar Online that Simpson is demanding to see his new \u201cgranddaughter.\u201d This allegation has not been confirmed by either the Kardashian clan or Simpson himself.\n\nDuring a 2012 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kris asked if her daughter would take a DNA test regarding her true paternity; Kardashian refused.\n\n\u201cSeriously, my dad is Robert Kardashian. My other dad is Bruce Jenner,\u201d Khloe reeled, continuing to her mother, \u201cIf you f***ed other people during the same time and you do not know, go on Maury!\u201d Kim Kardashian later approached her sister and told her that their mother was upset by her reluctance to take the test.\n\nKhloe Kardashian then penned a letter to her mother which was read on the E! series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need someone to tell me who my family is. I have had the blessing of having two phenomenal fathers. I don\u2019t need a DNA test to prove who my father is.\u201d\n\nRadar reported that a source at the Nevada prison where Simpson was incarcerated claims that Jenner called Simpson \u201cat least once a week\u201d and begged him to take a DNA test to put to rest rumors of her daughter\u2019s paternity.\n\nFeatured image credit: Jason Bean-Pool Getty Images\n\nThe source allegedly stated, \u201cO.J. believes now more than ever that Khloe is his daughter because True looks so much like his son Justin did when he was a baby.\u201d\n\nOJ Simpson is a father to four children; Arnelle, 49, and Jason, 48, from his first marriage to Marguerite Whitley; and Sydney, 32, and Justin, 30, from his marriage to Nicole Brown.\n\n\u201cNow that he\u2019s out of prison, he wants his family around, but he really doesn\u2019t have much family left,\u201d the insider allegedly stated to Radar. \u201cIf True is his grandchild, then he absolutely wants to be a part of her life.\u201d\n\nOJ Simpson was accused of murdering his wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. Simpson was acquitted of both murders.\n\nSimpson was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with the felonies of armed robbery and kidnapping. In 2008, he was convicted and sentenced to 33 years imprisonment, with a minimum of nine years without parole. He served his sentence at the Lovelock Correctional Center near Lovelock, Nevada.\n\nSimpson was paroled from jail in October 2017.", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OJ-Simpson-1.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-And-Tristan-Thompson-Barely-Speaking-.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/758eb8ec6d9a8c04d1d92a307699ac47?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucille Barilla"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5002947/oj-simpson-demanding-meet-khloe-kardashians-baby-true/", "title": "OJ Simpson \u2018Demanding\u2019 To Meet Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Baby, Per \u2018Radar Online\u2019", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/K_7XJlyNRx8?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
