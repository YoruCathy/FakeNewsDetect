Would she call the divorce off, too? We\u2019ve learned EXCLUSIVELY that there\u2019s one reason that Angelina would welcome Brad back with open arms.\n\nHope may not be lost after all for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt\u2018s marriage. While they are firmly split and on their way to an official divorce, a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that Angelina changing her mind could still be a possibility! She and Brad, and their family, have been through so much after breaking up nearly one year ago. But there\u2019s still love there, and it\u2019s up to Brad to make her feel it again!\n\n\u201cAngelina definitely has regrets about splitting from Brad and about the end of their marriage. At the time of the breakup things were really bad between them \u2014 they had been fighting a lot \u2014 and she felt that Brad had checked out of their relationship,\u201d a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cObviously, there was a lot of drama surrounding the split, and bad feelings on both sides. Angelina misses Brad a lot more than she ever thought she would. She feels really lonely without him. Brad was Angelina\u2019s best friend, as well as her husband. They talked about everything and totally had each other\u2019s back. Angelina is a really stubborn person, and there\u2019s no way she would admit to having made a mistake, but if Brad came crawling back to her and begged for another chance, she would willingly drop the divorce.\u201d\n\nCould it happen? Could we really see the rise and fall, and rise of Brangelina again in our lifetime? Angelina\u2019s already made it clear that she\u2019s pleased with the progress Brad\u2019s made in his sobriety. But Brad allegedly isn\u2019t too thrilled with the prospect of making up, according to a report from Life & Style. And on their wedding anniversary, August 23, they gave each other the silent treatment, we learned EXCLUSIVELY. They didn\u2019t want to ruminate on the sad day.\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina\u2019s rep for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina and Brad could make it work?
