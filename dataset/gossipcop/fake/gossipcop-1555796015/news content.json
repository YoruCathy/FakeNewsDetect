In Joe Alwyn\u2018s case, the 26-year-old is giving the gift of love and romance to girlfriend Taylor Swift as she turns 28 on Dec. 13. \u201cJoe is planning a surprise romantic dinner and an intimate night alone with Taylor at a luxury hotel suite to help celebrate her birthday. Their romance has been amazing lately and Joe can\u2019t wait to surprise Taylor with a passionate evening with just the two of them. Taylor and Joe are really falling in love with each other and things have never been better,\u201d a source close to the British actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cJoe has ordered dozens of red roses for their suite, several bottles of champagne and he is having a private chef who will cook them dinner and recreate one of her favorite dishes as part of their meal, sweet potato pancakes normally found at her favorite restaurant in Nashville. After a year of dating on the down-low, Taylor has slowly been allowing herself to be seen out in public with Joe. The \u201cReady For It\u201d singer allowed herself to be photographed holding hands with Joe as they headed into her NYC pad\u2019s front entrance on Dec. 9. She has a more private way to come and go from the place so it was a BIG DEAL that she finally was photographed showing PDA with him. See pics of Taylor\u2019s epic 2017, here.\n\nThe next night she performed at London\u2019s Jingle Ball and Tay was spotted out in the audience with Joe during pal Ed Sheeran\u2018s set. She had her arm around him while singing along to Ed\u2019s smash \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d and was spotted hugging her boyfriend during other songs in the set. Fans freaked and posted the videos to Twitter and it was clear she is a-okay with the world knowing she\u2019s with Joe.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what\u2019s the best birthday present you\u2019ve ever received?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/joe-alwyn-plans-epic-night-for-taylor-ftr.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/joe-alwyn-plans-epic-night-for-taylor-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2F12%2Ftaylor-swift-joe-alwyn-birthday-surprise-dinner-hotel-celebration%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2909519&comment_count=2"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/joe-alwyn-plans-epic-night-for-taylor-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/12/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-birthday-surprise-dinner-hotel-celebration/", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Planning Epic Surprise Romantic Dinner & Intimate Night In Hotel", "meta_data": {"description": "Joe Alwyn has a romantic 28th birthday surprise for GF Taylor Swift, including a private dinner and night in a hotel suite.", "news_keywords": "Joe Alwyn, Taylor Swift", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Planning Epic Surprise Romantic Dinner & Intimate Night In Hotel", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/12/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-birthday-surprise-dinner-hotel-celebration/", "description": "Taylor Swift is turning 28 on Dec. 13 and we\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how BF Joe Alwyn has a romantic night in store to celebrate with his superstar sweetie.", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/joe-alwyn-plans-epic-night-for-taylor-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-13T04:16:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-13T14:16:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Planning Epic Surprise Romantic Dinner & Intimate Night In Hotel"}, "image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/joe-alwyn-plans-epic-night-for-taylor-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Planning Epic Surprise Romantic Dinner & Intimate Night In Hotel", "description": "Joe Alwyn has a romantic 28th birthday surprise for GF Taylor Swift, including a private dinner and night in a hotel suite."}, "author": "Beth Shilliday", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513008000.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
