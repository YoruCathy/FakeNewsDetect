Preparations are afoot to announce their rise to the throne by the end of December. The Queen wants to star 2018 in a positive way so they can turn the opinion polls around,' a top palace source reveals.\n\n'The recent opinion polls are a disaster for the monarchy, there are no two ways about it,' says the palace courtier.

The Queen has always been nervous of handing the reins to Charles and Camilla - her preferences has always been to make William and Kate the next king and queen, as she really feels they're the future of the monarchy.'\n\nThese latest opinion polls reveal that over the past two years support for the monarchy is the lowest it's ever been, and experts claim the lack of support for Charles is a major problem of the Queen.\n\n'The proportion of people who advocate for William to be crowns as the next monarch has reached its highest point since our monarchy tracker began,' James Endersby, managing director of Opinium Research, told The Express.\n\nNow the Queen is 'talking to her advisers on the legalities of moving Prince William to be next in line. It's what she has always wanted to do and now she just needs to make it happen.'\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BaWMQgFAL00/media/?size=l"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/will-and-kate-christmas-coronation", "title": "Queen retires: Wills and Kate\u2019s Christmas coronation!", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "It was meant to be Prince Charles' first major step towards taking over the royal throne - the historic moment he took the place of the Queen to lay a wreath during London's Remembrance Day service.", "news_keywords": "The Queen, Prince William, kate middleton, the royals, royal news, royal family news, the royal family, latest royal news, royal gossip, Duchess of Cambridge, Duke of Edinburgh, prince charles", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/will-and-kate-christmas-coronation", "title": "Queen retires: Wills and Kate\u2019s Christmas coronation!", "description": "It was meant to be Prince Charles' first major step towards taking over the royal throne - the historic moment he took the place of the Queen to lay a wreath during London's Remembrance Day service.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 800}}, "twitter": {"title": "Queen retires: Wills and Kate\u2019s Christmas coronation", "description": "It was meant to be Prince Charles' first major step towards taking over the royal throne - the historic moment he took the place of the Queen to lay a wreath during London's Remembrance Day service.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/will-and-kate-christmas-coronation"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511123254.747, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
