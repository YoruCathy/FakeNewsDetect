Gomez, she said, told her over FaceTime she was a match.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Yay... what? How do you know this?\u2019\u201d the \u201cGrown-ish\u201d actress said. \u201cI had a way that I wanted to tell her when I made the decision. I knew it was gonna happen, I just needed that time, like it\u2019s a big thing.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cSo I hang up, and I call my social worker, and I\u2019m angry. And she told me, \u2018It\u2019s gonna be hard: the recipient is gonna glow, and she\u2019s gonna recover a lot faster than the donor is \u2018cause she\u2019s receiving something she needs. You\u2019re losing something you don\u2019t need to lose. It\u2019s gonna be hard.\u2019 And it was very hard. Selena and I both went through a depression.\u201d\n\nSELENA GOMEZ IS TAKING A BREAK FROM FAME AFTER JUSTIN BIEBER BREAKUP, REPORT SAYS\n\nGomez, according to Raisa, \u201chad some complications with hers, and she\u2019s bigger scars, than you know, I do.\u201d\n\nRaisa said that Gomez texted her, \u201cI\u2019m so scared I might die.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, 'What?' And I - I was calling someone and that\u2019s when when she got the complication where the kidney turned and broke an artery,\u201d Raisa revealed. \u201cAnd she had to go back in and they actually had to take a vein out of her leg, so she has a scar right here, and um, build a wall around her artery.\u201d\n\nGomez also opened up about her battle with depression in an interview with Harper's Bazaar in early February.\n\n\"[Depression is] not something I feel I\u2019ll ever overcome,\" Gomez told the magazine. \"There won\u2019t be a day when I\u2019m like, 'Here I am in a pretty dress\u2014 I won!' I think it\u2019s a battle I\u2019m gonna have to face for the rest of my life, and I\u2019m okay with that because I know that I\u2019m choosing myself over anything else.\"\n\nThe singer has been very open about her life-saving transplant.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I got the kidney transplant, my arthritis went away,\u201d the singer told TODAY in October. \u201cMy lupus -- there\u2019s about a 3-5 percent chance it'll ever come back. My blood pressure is better. My energy, my life has been better.\u201d\n\nGomez praised Raisa during an acceptance speech for the Billboard Woman of the Year Award in November 2017.\n\n\"I think Francia should be getting this award. She saved my life \u2026 I feel incredibly lucky,\u201d she said at the time.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/jim-edmonds-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/02/270/152/Carey-Harwick.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/gomez-raisa.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Crenshaw-Maher-FOX-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gomez-raisa.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/270/152/bill-maher-HBO.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gomez-raisa.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Szathmary"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-kidney-donor-francia-raisa-reveals-she-went-through-a-depression-after-transplant", "title": "Selena Gomez kidney donor Francia Raisa reveals she 'went through a depression' after transplant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Francia Raisa made the remarks to Self in a video clip that was published on Wednesday.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Zoe Szathmary", "dc.title": "Selena Gomez kidney donor Francia Raisa reveals she 'went through a depression' after transplant", "dcterms.abstract": "Francia Raisa made the remarks to Self in a video clip that was published on Wednesday.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Francia Raisa made the remarks to Self in a video clip that was published on Wednesday.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:12660485-ae4b-5997-b49e-bf40bb7c8875", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-03-15", "dcterms.created": "2018-03-15T13:01:32-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-03-15T18:18:31-04:00", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez kidney donor Francia Raisa reveals she 'went through a depression' after transplant", "description": "Francia Raisa made the remarks to Self in a video clip that was published on Wednesday.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/gomez-raisa.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-kidney-donor-francia-raisa-reveals-she-went-through-a-depression-after-transplant", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Selena Gomez kidney donor Francia Raisa reveals she 'went through a depression' after transplant", "description": "Francia Raisa made the remarks to Self in a video clip that was published on Wednesday.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/gomez-raisa.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/selena-gomez-kidney-donor-francia-raisa-reveals-she-went-through-a-depression-after-transplant"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/soBb4X5Hb6k"], "publish_date": 1521043200.0, "source": "http://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
