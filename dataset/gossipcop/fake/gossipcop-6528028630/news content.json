Nina and Orlando have been romantically linked multiple times in the past \u2014 and according to sources, they\u2019re \u201chaving fun together.\u201d\n\nMORE: Kylie Jenner Seemingly Confirms Tyga Breakup, Shows up Alone at Coachella 2017\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a while,\u201d a source told People magazine. \u201cRecently they\u2019ve been hanging out as more than friends. It\u2019s super casual.\u201d\n\nBut Nina\u2019s rep denies that there\u2019s anything romantic going on between the two actors. \u201cNina and Orlando are just friends. They have the same representation and friends in common, and often end up in the same social group. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Nina and Orlando sparked dating rumors. In 2014, the two were spotted making out and dancing at a Comic-Con party. After the event, a source close to Nina explained that their connection wasn\u2019t new and that she had an interest in the Pirates of the Caribbean star.\n\nMORE: Robin Thicke\u2019s Girlfriend April Love Geary Flaunts Her \u201cBuns\u201d on Instagram!\n\n\u201cNina has known Orlando for a few years now,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cShe\u2019s been out with him in social settings with mutual friends. She\u2019s always thought he was an attractive man.\u201d\n\nLooks like their friendship might turn into something more! Last month, Orlando split from Katy Perry after 14 months of dating. Nina dated her Vampire Diaries co-star Ian Somerhalder for three years before calling it quits in 2013.\n\nWill this be the moment they take their relationship to the next level, or will they fizzle out? We\u2019ll have to wait and see, but we do know they\u2019d make an adorable couple!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/paris-hilton-coachella.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nina-dobrev-orlando-bloom.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/True-Thompson-Dream-Kardashian-Cute-Photos-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C125px%2C1080px%2C613px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Selfie.jpg?crop=199px%2C0px%2C810px%2C810px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nina-dobrev-orlando-bloom.png?resize=704%2C439", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Thompson-Already-Loves-Picking-Out-Her-Own-Clothes.jpg?crop=71px%2C393px%2C939px%2C531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/paul-wesley-phoebe-tonkin.jpg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nina-dobrev-orlando-bloom.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Admits-She-Will-\u2018Never-Come-in-Between\u2019-Tristan-and-Daughter-True-After-Scandal-pp.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Khloe-Kardashians-Daughter-True-Thompson-Really-Lights-Up-When-Aunt-Kylie-Jenner-Comes-Over.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Skincare-Routine-Should-You-Try-It-Out-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10491194ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C179px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scott-Kourtney-Coparents.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scott-Disick-and-Sofia-Richie.jpg?crop=0px%2C62px%2C2280px%2C1294px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/john-mayer-jennifer-love-hewitt.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-fat-jewish-emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-marriage-exclusive-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nina-dobrev-orlando-bloom.png?resize=704%2C439", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paulina Jayne Isaac"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/nina-dobrev-orlando-bloom-130265/", "title": "Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom Are \"Casually Dating\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "It looks like Nina Dobrev's relationship status might change again!
