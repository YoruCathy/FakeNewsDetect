Is she advanced for her age?-Know the truths here! Share this\n\nPrincess Charlotte\u2019s recital?\n\nNational Enquirer this week reported that 2-year-old Princess Charlotte, the youngest and only daughter of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton had randomly recited her grand ancestor, Queen Victoria\u2019s quote. Queen Victoria had served as the Queen of England from 1837 to her death in 1901. The tabloid wrote that the little royal kid had shocked the palace staff members when she said what Queen Victoria used to say. Princess Charlotte was playing with a group of toddlers. After she finished playing, it seems that she looked at the royal helpers and said:\n\n\u201cThe important thing is not what they think of me, but what I think of them.\u201d\n\nThis quote was used by Queen Victoria in the 19th century.\n\nGossip Cop has spoken to a royal insider who laughed off at National Enquirer\u2019s story. The insider also denied any such incident in the palace. The source revealed that the story of the tabloid was completely untrue. It is quite unlikely that a kid as small as Princess Charlotte could put together the words to make such a complete and articulate sentence. And then to repeat what was said almost a century ago is very far-fetched.\n\nIs Princess Charlotte advanced for her age?\n\nLast September, Princess Charlotte had accompanied her parents and brother to Canada. At a royal garden party, Princess Charlotte had mingled with other children and toddlers. Princess Charlotte moved around confidently round the garden lawn and engaged herself with the surroundings. She was just 16 years old when she went to Canada for this tour. But it was clearly seen that instead of the wobbly walk of any her age child, Princess Charlotte was walking quite sturdily and also was seen running at one point in time. She preferred balloons over bubbles. At her age, children usually can only mimic simple tasks. But Princess Charlotte was spotted trying to fold her cardigan which is quite a complex task for such a small child.\n\nShe seemed to have a good vocabulary at that age. Princess Charlotte was heard saying: dada, flower, and pop (for the balloons). Paul Kilshaw, 53, the children\u2019s entertainer said:\n\n\u201cCharlotte asked for a flower, I think she said \u2018flower\u2019 because the other little girls were asking for flowers.\u201d\n\nShe was not copying others like the other children of her age would but was inventing her own plays. She went and sat on the dog Moose. She also ran towards the balloons and started a game of her own of repeatedly hitting at them.\n\nShe also hugged the black and white rabbit around; which reveals her emotional development of passing on love to an animal. A spokesperson for the Royal family said:\n\n\u201cThe Duke and Duchess are really pleased to have this opportunity to introduce their children to Canada and it\u2019s great that they have the chance to play with other children while they are here.\u201d\n\nThe show-stealer\n\nPrincess Charlotte is the show-stealer at most of the occasions. She seems to have inherited the dark Middleton eyes and her mother\u2019s darker hairs. But she is gradually acquiring the royal genes. Her face now resembles that of her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II when she was small.\n\nPrince William dots on his little one and calls her \u2018the joy from the Heaven\u2019. Friends say that the little Princess has a bubbly and confident character, but talking about her daughter, Princess Kate had said:\n\n\u201cShe is very cute but she has got quite a feisty side. George has turned out to be a really lovely little boy. I hope George will keep Charlotte in order!\u201d\n\nPrincess Charlotte was the bridesmaid for her maternal aunt, Pippa Middleton at the latter\u2019s wedding on 20th May 2017 to financier James Matthews. Princess Charlotte looked cute in her tan-and-white dress by Pepa and Co. and had worn a floral headpiece. She was also holding a tiny basket and seemed quite fond of it. The mother-daughter duo made an amazing and beautiful pair!\n\nThe little Princess had also stolen the show at the Trooping the Colour Ceremony in June 2017 at the Royal Palace. She was in a pretty baby pink dress and stood on the balcony of the Buckingham Palace along with the other royal family members, enjoying the military specter.\n\nThe Princess\u2019 life at Anmer Hall\n\nFor the last two years, Princess Charlotte had stayed with her parents and brother at Anmer Hall, her parents\u2019 10-bedroom mansion at Norfolk, England. It was a simple life there with Kate managing the whole show alone. She had her royal servants and her children\u2019s nanny. An insider told People:\n\n\u201cThere was no formality at all. It really was like any other family sitting down to lunch, with George and Charlotte eating their homemade food in their high chairs and toddling around with their toys.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that Kate and William would have an army of staff to help them out, but it really was just them and the children,\u201d\n\nAnother family friend said:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20554'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Karen-Allen-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/share_new.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20900'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/princess-charlotte-birthday-royal-family-ftr.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/popsugar.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Michael-1-232x290.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2060%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20423'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danny-Brown-Feature-Img-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3similar-z-hello-mag.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Lynne-Curtin-60x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Joshua-Waring-232x290.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20444'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pc-dm1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20232%20290'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pc-etonline.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tom4-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Josh-Waring-60x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/plugins/married-biography//public/images/ajax-loader.gif", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Marquise-Jackson-75x75.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20422'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jordan-Ozuna-232x290.jpeg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tarvaris-Jackson-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kate1-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Lesley-Ann-Warren-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pc-dm.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/pc-mirror.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Karl4-232x290.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RZA-75x75.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Princess-Charlotte-Queen-Victoria-Quote-gc.jpg", "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alex-Morgan-60x75.jpg"], "top_img": "https://marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/princess-charlotte-birthday-royal-family-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://marriedbiography.com/princess-charlotte-recite-great-ancestors-quote-unknowingly-advanced-age-know-truths/", "title": "Did Princess Charlotte recite her great ancestor\u2019s quote unknowingly?
