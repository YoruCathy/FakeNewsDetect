Trump even referenced them Monday night during a rally in South Carolina.\n\nBut despite Trump's claim that Lynch, \"a Hollywood guy,\" had endorsed his performance as president, Lynch had actually been trying to point out how Trump's election and administration had put a spotlight on the inefficiency of government. (\u201cOur so-called leaders can\u2019t take the country forward, can\u2019t get anything done. Like children, they are. Trump has shown all this,\u201d Lynch told The Guardian.)\n\nIn a Facebook post published Tuesday, the \"Twin Peaks creator addressed Trump directly, saying he wished they \"could sit down and have a talk.\"\n\nHe warned the president, \"If you continue as you have been, you will not have a chance to go down in history as a great president. This would be very sad it seems for you \u2013 and for the country. You are causing suffering and division.\"\n\nLynch continued, \"It\u2019s not too late to turn the ship around. Point our ship toward a bright future for all. You can unite the country. Your soul will sing. Under great loving leadership, no one loses \u2013 everybody wins. It\u2019s something I hope you think about and take to heart. All you need to do is treat all the people as you would like to be treated.\"\n\nMore:David Lynch goes home again to 'Twin Peaks'", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14d38e3329c6f1f889b4c48cfb975ddc97bd20bb/c=0-0-3495-1975/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654425448153202-XXX-IMG-AP-2017-WINTER-TCA-S-3-1-G8IDI6G2.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14d38e3329c6f1f889b4c48cfb975ddc97bd20bb/c=0-0-3495-1975/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654425448153202-XXX-IMG-AP-2017-WINTER-TCA-S-3-1-G8IDI6G2.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14d38e3329c6f1f889b4c48cfb975ddc97bd20bb/c=0-0-3495-1975/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654425448153202-XXX-IMG-AP-2017-WINTER-TCA-S-3-1-G8IDI6G2.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/06/24/david-lynch-trump-guardian-greatest-history/729089002/", "title": "David Lynch says Trump won't be a great president if he continues down current path", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "David Lynch says Trump won't be a great president if he continues down current path", "description": "\"Twin Peaks\" director David Lynch warned President Trump that he was \"causing suffering and division.\" He also issued a warning: \"If you continue as you have been, you will not have a chance to go down in history as a great president.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/06/24/david-lynch-trump-guardian-greatest-history/729089002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14d38e3329c6f1f889b4c48cfb975ddc97bd20bb/c=0-0-3495-1975/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654425448153202-XXX-IMG-AP-2017-WINTER-TCA-S-3-1-G8IDI6G2.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Carly Mallenbaum", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "\"Twin Peaks\" director David Lynch warned President Trump that he was \"causing suffering and division.\" He also issued a warning: \"If you continue as you have been, you will not have a chance to go down in history as a great president.\"", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/14d38e3329c6f1f889b4c48cfb975ddc97bd20bb/c=0-0-3495-1975/local/-/media/2018/06/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636654425448153202-XXX-IMG-AP-2017-WINTER-TCA-S-3-1-G8IDI6G2.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "David Lynch says Trump won't be a great president if he continues down current path", "description": "\"Twin Peaks\" director David Lynch warned President Trump that he was \"causing suffering and division.\" He also issued a warning: \"If you continue as you have been, you will not have a chance to go down in history as a great president.\""}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529769600.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
