doesn\u2019t involve Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan.\n\nAccording to new reports, when devoted Scientologist Jenna Elfman and Katie Holmes appeared on yesterday\u2019s broadcast, Elfman had Holmes tremble in fear behind the cameras.\n\n\u201cJenna was doing the show live to promote her new ABC show,\u201d one on-set source stated. \u201cShe was happy and charming and the audience loved her,\u201d the insider added.\n\nHowever, despite all of that, it turns out that the other scheduled guest was not too happy to see her.\n\n[media-credit name=\u201dSource: radar.com\u201d align=\u201daligncenter\u201d width=\u201d594\u2033] [/media-credit]\n\nIn fact, the source revealed that Katie, who was on the show to talk about her role as Jacqueline Kennedy was \u201cterrified\u201d backstage.\n\n\u201cShe was literally hiding from her and she seemed scared.\u201d\n\nNot to mention, the staff even had to change Katie\u2019s dressing room just because she wanted to be nowhere near the Scientologist.\n\nAs fans may already know, in the past, Elfman was known for attacking those who left the faith.\n\nOne former Scientologist revealed that the woman confronted her when she found out about the decision to leave Scientology and \u201cIt was one of the ugliest and nastiest things I\u2019ve ever seen a human being do and to this day I just can\u2019t stand her.\u201d\n\nBesides, Katie Holmes was considered to be a suppressive person and shunned by the Scientology community after her divorce from Tom Cruise \u2013 the \u201cmessiah\u201d of Scientology and the most iconic star involved with the cult.\n\n\u201cKatie got out of the religion and knows everything, and she wants nothing to do with Scientology,\u201d the insider explained about the awkward situation between the two guests on Good Morning America.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortunately, the producers and staff were able to \u201cchoreograph\u201d everything in such a way that both stars could feel comfortable on the morning show.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg",
