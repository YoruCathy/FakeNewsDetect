Following an eruption of violence in the college town where one person was killed and 19 people were injured after a car hit protesters leaving a rally.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, President Trump condemned the violence but blamed \u201cmany sides.\u201d\n\nThe White House issued a statement Sunday saying \"The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.\" But the president has not used those words himself.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats criticized the president for not being more forceful in calling out white nationalists groups.\n\nTrump \u201cmissed an opportunity to be very explicit here,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Fox News Sunday.\n\nThe white nationalists \u201cseem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House\u2026 I would urge the president to dissuade them of the [idea] that he is sympathetic to their cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more from our president on this issue \u2026 it\u2019s up to him to correct the record here,\" Graham said.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, was one of the first Republicans to say Trump needed to \"call evil by its name\" Saturday.\n\n\"This president has done an incredible job of naming terrorism around the globe as evil., radical Islamic terrorism ... he has said and called it out time and time again and this president needs to do exactly that today, call this white supremacy, white nationalism evil,\u201d Gardner said on CNN State of the Union Sunday. \"Let the country hear it and let the world hear it. It's something that needs to come from the Oval Office.\"\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have recommended that statement. I think he needed to be much harsher as it related to the white supremacists,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, Trump\u2019s former communications director, on ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cIt\u2019s actually terrorism, whether it\u2019s domestic or international terrorism with the moral authority of the presidency you have to call that stuff out.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged the president to say \"white supremacy is an affront to American values.\"\n\nAs of Sunday morning Trump had still not specifically condemned white nationalism.\n\n\"The president has been very clear, we cannot tolerate this kind of bigotry, this kind of hatred. And what he did is he called on all Americans to take a firm stance against it,\" said Trump National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. \"The president called out anyone who is responsible for fomenting this kind of bigotry, hatred, racism and violence. I think the president was very clear on that.\"\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews and observe the Sabbath, which begins Friday night at sundown and runs through Saturday at sundown. During that time they do not engage in social media.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1893984dda7012d6ecf90758428c1acee2860fc2/c=0-305-6000-3695/local/-/media/2017/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636382111538783905-EPA-EPASELECT-USA-IVANKA-MILITARY-SPOUSES-92789553.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff82b1af445c13c4978624a5ebd732f2640c009a/c=0-305-6000-3695&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2017/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636382111538783905-EPA-EPASELECT-USA-IVANKA-MILITARY-SPOUSES-92789553.JPG?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1893984dda7012d6ecf90758428c1acee2860fc2/c=0-305-6000-3695/local/-/media/2017/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636382111538783905-EPA-EPASELECT-USA-IVANKA-MILITARY-SPOUSES-92789553.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/08/13/charlottesville-ivanka-trump-condemns-white-supremacy/562903001/", "title": "Ivanka Trump issues direct condemnation of 'white supremacy and neo-nazis'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Ivanka Trump issues direct condemnation of 'white supremacy and neo-nazis'", "description": "On Saturday afternoon, President Trump condemned the\u00a0violence but blamed \u201cmany sides.\u201d", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/08/13/charlottesville-ivanka-trump-condemns-white-supremacy/562903001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1893984dda7012d6ecf90758428c1acee2860fc2/c=0-305-6000-3695/local/-/media/2017/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636382111538783905-EPA-EPASELECT-USA-IVANKA-MILITARY-SPOUSES-92789553.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Eliza Collins", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "On Saturday afternoon, President Trump condemned the\u00a0violence but blamed \u201cmany sides.\u201d", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1893984dda7012d6ecf90758428c1acee2860fc2/c=0-305-6000-3695/local/-/media/2017/08/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636382111538783905-EPA-EPASELECT-USA-IVANKA-MILITARY-SPOUSES-92789553.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Ivanka Trump issues direct condemnation of 'white supremacy and neo-nazis'", "description": "On Saturday afternoon, President Trump condemned the\u00a0violence but blamed \u201cmany sides.\u201d"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502553600.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
