And in celebration of their anniversary, DeGeneres, 59, shared a loving tribute to Instagram!\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201c@PortiadeRossi and I got married 9 years ago today,\u201d the Ellen DeGeneres Show host captioned a smiling, black-and-white photo of the pair on their wedding day. \u201cBeing her wife is the greatest thing I am.\u201d\n\nSinger Joshua Radin, who performed at the couple\u2019s wedding, also took to the photo and video-sharing app to celebrate their union.\n\n\u201cNine years ago today, these two incredible women got married and asked me to sing some of my songs to them while they were celebrating their most special day. It\u2019s still one of the most fun things I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Radin wrote. \u201cHappy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview with Oprah Winfrey, de Rossi recalled about falling for DeGeneres. \u201cWe actually met socially and I just felt that immediate draw,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did talk a little bit and then over those three years, we saw each other at parties or at various things, but the one time that was the most significant was during a photoshoot actually.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cI just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn\u2019t believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart. I felt weak at the knees and I was overwhelmed with how I felt, but then it took me about 10 months to get the courage up to actually do anything about it.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Jada Pinkett Smith Talks Celebrating 20 Years with Will Smith\n\nIn a 2008 episode of her talk show, DeGeneres announced her plans to wed de Rossi; the reveal followed the news that the California Supreme Court had struck down a law banning same-sex marriage. The happy couple later showed off their engagement bling on the Daytime Emmys red carpet that same year.\n\nThat August, the couple tied the knot with an intimate ceremony in their L.A. home. (To see more of their cute moments from throughout the years, click here).\n\n\u201cPortia and I constantly say to each other, \u2018We are so lucky.\u2019 Sometimes it\u2019s lying in bed at night before I go to sleep, and I just say thank you to whatever, whoever is out there,\u201d DeGeneres told PEOPLE in her 2016 cover story. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to a place where I really am just settled. Really. I know that I\u2019m not going anywhere. She\u2019s not going anywhere. I\u2019m not saying the relationship took a while; I\u2019m saying in my life, it took a while to find this.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-nine-year-wedding-anniversary-tribute/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Celebrates 9 Years of Marriage to Portia de Rossi with Tribute", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Anniversaries,Ellen DeGeneres,Marriage,News,Portia de Rossi,TV", "news_keywords": "Anniversaries,Ellen DeGeneres,Marriage,News,Portia de Rossi,TV", "description": "The couple tied the knot on Aug. 16, 2008, with an intimate ceremony in their L.A. home", "og": {"title": "Ellen DeGeneres Celebrates 9 Years of Marriage to Portia de Rossi with Tribute", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-nine-year-wedding-anniversary-tribute/", "description": "Happy anniversary Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi!
