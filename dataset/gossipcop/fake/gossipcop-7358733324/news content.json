The Coldplay frontman drove Johnson to a local coffee shop in Malibu but made her walk back after she picked up the drinks.\n\nJohnson brought along her dog for the outing, which is probably why Martin drove back home by himself. It looked like the Fifty Shades actress wanted to get a quick walk in for her pup after the coffee run.\n\nWhile things look pretty good between Martin and Johnson, not everyone in his circle is happy about their growing romance.\n\nInside sources claim that members of Martin\u2019s band do not like his new girlfriend. With Martin committing so much time to the relationship, the members of Coldplay are starting to find Johnson annoying.\n\nLoved-up couple Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin have been spotted \u2018holding hands and kissing\u2019 on a veggie brunch date. They looked \u2018very cute together\u2019 according to a fellow diner at Heirloom Restaurant in Vancouver. #DakotaJohnson ? #ChrisMartin ??? pic.twitter.com/ipcmEnv7NC \u2014 BookishBeth ?

Most of the members, however, are ready to get back in the saddle and start working on new music, but Martin is completely focused on his new romance and is spending every waking moment with Johnson. Some band members want Johnson to ease up a little, but she\u2019s not listening.\n\nOver the past few weeks, Johnson and Martin have become practically inseparable, and it doesn\u2019t\u2019 look like that\u2019s going to change soon.\n\nMartin\u2019s bandmates aren\u2019t the only ones unhappy with Johnson. The singer\u2019s former wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is reportedly jealous over his romance with the actress, especially the fact that she\u2019s a lot younger than him.\n\nSunday brunch #modernfamily A post shared by Gwyneth Paltrow (@gwynethpaltrow) on Nov 26, 2017 at 12:59pm PST\n\nThat said, Paltrow has already moved on with Brad Falchuk, whom Martin hasn\u2019t been the warmest toward in the past. In fact, Paltrow and Falchuk are set to get married this year after three years together.\n\nMartin was married to Paltrow for ten years before they announced their split in 2014. The pair share two children \u2014 Apple and Moses \u2014 and remained good friends after the breakup.\n\nWhile the rumors haven\u2019t been confirmed, it\u2019s clear that things are heating up between Martin and Johnson. Earlier last month, Martin brought Johnson to Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 birthday bash, an event that included two of Martin\u2019s exes: Paltrow and Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how everyone reacted inside the event, but Martin and Johnson were spotted holding hands as they arrived. The singer rocked a casual look with a grey sweater and matching beanie while Johnson wore a long white coat and heels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChris Martin has not commented on the rumors surrounding Coldplay and his romance with Dakota Johnson.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dakota-Johnson-And-Chris-Martin-Run-Errands-In-Malibu-After-Rumors-Surface-Coldplay-Are-Not-A-Fans-Of-The-Fifty-Shades-Star.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gwyneth-Paltrow-The-Goop-Lab-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Paltrow-Insider.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Jill-Duggar-Celebrates-Disgraced-Husband-Derick-Dillards-Birthday-By-Rebelling-Against-Her-Conservative-Counting-On-Family-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Gwyneth-Paltrow-Breast-Implants-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Dakota-Johnson-And-Chris-Martin-Run-Errands-In-Malibu-After-Rumors-Surface-Coldplay-Are-Not-A-Fans-Of-The-Fifty-Shades-Star.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/dakota-johnson-and-chris-martin-run-errands-in-malibu-after-rumors-surface-coldplay-are-not-a-fans-of-the-fifty-shades-star-124552/", "title": "Dakota Johnson And Chris Martin Run Errands In Malibu After Rumors Surface Coldplay Are Not A Fans Of The \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019 Star", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "chris martin, coldplay, dakota johnson, fifty shades of grey, gwyneth paltrow,", "keywords": "celebrity news, chris martin, coldplay, dakota johnson, fifty shades of grey, gwyneth paltrow,", "description": "Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin enjoyed an early morning coffee run this week, proving their romance is still going strong.
