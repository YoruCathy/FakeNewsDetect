Lee,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cSo this week, it is Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder, is it George Washington next week? And is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you really do have to ask yourself, where does it stop?\u201d\n\nIt was a remarkable rejection of the criticism he confronted after waiting two days before naming the right-wing groups in the bloodshed that ended with the death of a young woman after a car crashed into a crowd of protesters.\n\nMr. Trump accused people he called the alt-left of \u201cswinging clubs\u201d as they \u201ccame charging at, as you say, at the alt-right.\u201d He said some of the right-wing members of the crowd in the Virginia park were \u201cbad.\u201d But he added that the other side came \u201ccharging in without a permit and they were very, very violent.\u201d\n\nAides had urged him for days to take the high ground, persuading him on Monday to read a brief statement condemning the neo-Nazi groups from the Diplomatic Room in the White House. But over the past day, back in his private New York residence for the first time since becoming president, Mr. Trump was alone, without his wife and young son, and consuming hours of television, with many on cable news telling him he had not done enough.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-2/merlin-to-scoop-126035954-28496-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/us/16dc-trump-new/16dc-trump-new-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael D.
