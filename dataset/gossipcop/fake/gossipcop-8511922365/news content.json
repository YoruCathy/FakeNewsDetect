Angelina Jolie could be getting married again, according to a shocking new report! She has allegedly been dating a mystery man for months now, and hasn\u2019t told Brad a thing!\n\nShe\u2019s still technically married to Brad Pitt, 52, but Angelina Jolie, 41, allegedly has her heart set on a new marriage. Barely a year after filing for divorce from her husband, Angelina is reportedly planning her fourth wedding to a wealthy, 40-something businessman and philanthropist, according to InTouch Weekly! Angelina and her handsome British guy reportedly started dating in early 2017, and has been keeping the whole relationship \u201cvery hush-hush.\u201d That means that Brad has no idea she\u2019s dating, let alone engaged or getting married. Uh oh!\n\n\u201cAngelina could tell Brad what\u2019s going on but she\u2019s choosing not to,\u201d a source told InTouch. She reportedly hopes he \u201cwill be taken by complete surprise. If it makes Brad unhappy when he finds out, she\u2019s fine with that.\u201d She actually hasn\u2019t even told her six kids about the alleged wedding for fear that they\u2019ll spill the beans to their dad. Crafty!\n\nAs for the wedding itself, Angelina\u2019s reportedly taking her closest friends and family to Cambodia, \u201cher second home,\u201d for a traditional Buddhist ceremony, according to the source. The wedding will allegedly take place on a wildlife reserve, wear traditional Cambodian clothing, and serve local delicacies at the reception. \u201cAngie\u2019s thinking of having Shiloh, Zahara, and Vivienne as bridesmaids and Maddox as the groom\u2019s best man since Maddox sort of feels he\u2019s the man of the family now,\u201d the source said. Knox will allegedly be the ring bearer, and Pax will DJ and bake the cake for the reception (he did for his parents\u2019 wedding, too!) It all sounds lovely, but how will Brad react when he finds out?\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Angelina\u2019s rep for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina\u2019s really getting married for the fourth time?
