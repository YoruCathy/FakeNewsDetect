(Tibor Illyes/MTI via AP)\n\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis may be in the spotlight due to their acting careers. But as parents, they\u2019re about as private as you and me.\n\nWhile you\u2019re scrolling through your facebook feed, perhaps you\u2019ll happen across a few photos of a friend\u2019s toddler going poopie on the potty for the first time. Or, maybe there will be a video of your sister\u2019s kid taking it\u2019s first steps. A little further down and maybe there will be a photo of so and so\u2019s first day of school. All of these are things you will never see from Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.
