Find out why here!\n\nSince her lupus diagnosis and kidney transplant, Selena Gomez, 25, has changed her outlook on life. The \u201cWolves\u201d singer revealed on Good Morning America on June 29, that she doesn\u2019t even live in Los Angeles anymore and no longer worries about whether or not people like her. And while that came as quite a shock, not everything in Selena\u2019s life has changed. In fact, Selena can\u2019t seem to get her ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, 24, off her mind, especially while on the media tour for Hotel Transylvania 3. \u201cSelena might be staying away from LA and things that cause her stress, but it\u2019s impossible for her to not think about Justin during this time because in the past, she has brought Justin\u2019s siblings and Justin himself with her to the previous Hotel Transylvania premieres,\u201d a source close to Selena tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cShe has some fun and fond memories from it all, which then makes her think of the good old days. She won\u2019t easily admit it to everyone, but her friends and family still know that she still holds a candle for Justin and can see that times like this media tours gets to her emotionally and makes her think of the past,\u201d our insider continued. We can certainly understand Selena\u2019s emotions. After all, they\u2019ve known each other since 2001, and their breakup back in March was their fourth time getting back together.\n\n\u201cAll that her friends and family can do is help her ride it out because no one in her camp wants to see them together again,\u201d the source said. Plus, Justin Bieber is happily in a relationship with Hailey Baldwin, 21. Nevertheless, we wish Selena the best during this difficult time as moving on is not as easy as it seems.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ecfb7e275332c72a5d7c98a0963061b?s=64&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F29%2Fselena-gomez-thinking-about-justin-bieber-hotel-transylvania-3-media-tour%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3226823", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-why-shes-thinking-about-justin-bieber-during-her-hotel-transylvania-3-media-tour-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-why-shes-thinking-about-justin-bieber-during-her-hotel-transylvania-3-media-tour-ftr.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-why-shes-thinking-about-justin-bieber-during-her-hotel-transylvania-3-media-tour-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/29/selena-gomez-thinking-about-justin-bieber-hotel-transylvania-3-media-tour/", "title": "Selena Gomez: Why She\u2019s Thinking About Justin Bieber During Her \u2018Hotel Transylvania 3\u2019 Media Tour", "meta_data": {"description": "Find out why Selena Gomez is still thinking about Justin Bieber!", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez: Why She\u2019s Thinking About Justin Bieber During Her \u2018Hotel Transylvania 3\u2019 Media Tour", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/29/selena-gomez-thinking-about-justin-bieber-hotel-transylvania-3-media-tour/", "description": "Selena Gomez may have left LA to focus on herself and get away from distractions, but for some reason she can\u2019t stop thinking about Justin Bieber!
