This Baywatch (** out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Thursday night) has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they\u2019re beating a dead seahorse.\n\nThe comedy directed by Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) rests on the boulder shoulders of The Rock, who plays the old Hoff role of Baywatch honcho Mitch Buchannon. Instead of just giving out random suntan-lotion rubdowns and helping the occasional victim of a bad wave, these lifeguards are part-time superheroes who take on fiery boat accidents, jewelry-stealing grifters and rampant drug dealing along their beloved Emerald Bay. When a passerby asks Mitch if he\u2019s Batman, our hero responds, \u201cSure, pal. Just bigger. And browner.\u201d\n\nZac Efron talks 'Baywatch' wipe-out: 'I just totally tripped'\n\nHow did David Hasselhoff get his 'Baywatch' body? Workouts with The Rock.\n\nThe archetypal Baywatch crew \u2014 including second-in-command Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera), athletic Summer (Alexandra Daddario), good-hearted CJ (Kelly Rohrbach) and nerdy Ronnie (Jon Bass) \u2014 have a difficult time getting on the same page with the addition of new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a disgraced Olympic swimming champion hired to the team as a PR stunt. Mitch and Brody clash often, trash-talking each other endlessly and engaging in physical competitions (like hauling fridges), but have to put their macho egos in check to stop local businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) and the femme fatale\u2019s nefarious plans to take over the bay.\n\nBrandishing bods that\u2019ll make you question your own fitness decisions, Johnson and Efron are at least fun to watch \u2014 Mitch reads as a little too serious, though Brody makes up for it as an overly self-confident goof who spends much of the movie wondering why they just don\u2019t call the cops. Daddario adds a surprising deft comedic touch as well: A scene where Mitch, Brody and Summer investigate the morgue Scooby-Doo style is one of the few times when Baywatch really shines.\n\nEverything one would expect in a Baywatch movie \u2014 cleavage, bouncing body parts, constant flexing and the excessive use of slo-mo \u2014 is present. (Plus, a couple of the old TV cast members show up for cameos.) Yet the remake yearns to be both sendup farce and straight action film, tripping along the way and failing to grasp either. When the plastic aquarium version of the usually ultra-charismatic Johnson gets more laughs than the real deal, there\u2019s something seriously wrong.\n\nThe Rock meets 1-year-old 'heart warrior' while shooting 'Baywatch'\n\nBryan Cranston cried over his 'Baywatch' cameo at the SAG Awards\n\nA lot of the humor just doesn\u2019t connect and tries way too hard, from one dude getting his junk stuck in a beach chair to a running gag involving salad. Chopra, whose villainess seems bored by the whole situation, would rather be eviling it up in a James Bond movie, and the fireworks-laden climax is full of punch but leans predictable and lacks excitement.\n\nThis flick might be bigger than the original Baywatch \u2014 from the production budget to its stars' muscles \u2014 but lacks the cheesy fun.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/019f034fb763392ff269b07ea9152b9f90888d35/c=0-142-3995-2399/local/-/media/2017/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636310588265187705-bw-22957-36rc.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/019f034fb763392ff269b07ea9152b9f90888d35/c=0-142-3995-2399/local/-/media/2017/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636310588265187705-bw-22957-36rc.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/019f034fb763392ff269b07ea9152b9f90888d35/c=0-142-3995-2399/local/-/media/2017/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636310588265187705-bw-22957-36rc.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/23/review-baywatch-movie-dwayne-johnson-zac-efron/102011794/", "title": "Review: Dwayne Johnson's bland 'Baywatch' can't commit to the absurd", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Review: Dwayne Johnson's bland 'Baywatch' can't commit to the absurd", "description": "Comedy is only fitfully funny as a paean to its Z-grade TV source material.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/05/23/review-baywatch-movie-dwayne-johnson-zac-efron/102011794/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/019f034fb763392ff269b07ea9152b9f90888d35/c=0-142-3995-2399/local/-/media/2017/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636310588265187705-bw-22957-36rc.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Brian Truitt", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Comedy is only fitfully funny as a paean to its Z-grade TV source material.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/019f034fb763392ff269b07ea9152b9f90888d35/c=0-142-3995-2399/local/-/media/2017/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636310588265187705-bw-22957-36rc.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Review: Dwayne Johnson's bland 'Baywatch' can't commit to the absurd", "description": "Comedy is only fitfully funny as a paean to its Z-grade TV source material."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495468800.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
