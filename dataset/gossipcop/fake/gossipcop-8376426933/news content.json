Last week\u2019s Forbes cover was like a punch in the gut and now this GQ cover with Travis is only making missing Kylie worse and more painful.\n\nAccording to sources, the rapper couldn\u2019t even bring himself to open the pages of the publication.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t like seeing her with Travis\u2019s arms wrapped around her and he does not want to read the interview either.\n\nSorry to hear that, Tyga.\n\nSource: Ian West\n\nKaty Perry says she was heartbroken over public reaction to her last album\n\nIn a candid interview with Vogue Australia, Katy Perry revealed that she suffered bouts of situational depression due to public reaction to the release of her latest album, Witness.\n\nI have had bouts of situational depression and my heart was broken last year because, unknowingly, I put so much validity in the reaction of the public.\n\nAbout last night \u264f\ufe0f \ud83d\udc9c#americanidolfinale A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on May 22, 2018 at 1:22pm PDT\n\nThe 33-year-old admitted that she was left heartbroken by the response to the album, which saw the release of Chained to the Rhythm and Swish Swish.\n\nThe public didn\u2019t react in the way I had expected to \u2026 which broke my heart.\n\nThe singer reveals she sought help from the Hoffman Institute, a California-based personal growth retreat, after seeing how much her friends gained from time spent there.\n\nFor years, my friends would go and come back completely rejuvenated, and I wanted to go, too. I was ready to let go of anything that was holding me back from being my ultimate self. Fair play, Perry.\n\nSource: PA Archive/PA Images\n\nCalum Best had his say on online trolling while appearing on Lorraine\n\nCalum Best has urged members of the public to reconsider their attitude towards reality TV stars, given the level of trolling which takes place online during the broadcast of certain series.\n\nSource: Doug Peters/PA Images\n\nUsing Love Island as an example, Calum, who appeared on Lorraine today, began by saying he understands why the line is often blurred.\n\nI know it can be light hearted and fun because realistically Love Island is a fun show.\n\nCalum, who won Celebrity Love Island in 2006, spoke of his own experience, while acknowledging that not everyone is robust enough to cope with the court of public opinion in the aftermath.\n\nYou go out there and there\u2019re awkward love moments and it\u2019s all quite fun but you have to think about if people are getting trolled and nasty things are being said and they don\u2019t know how to cope with that, that can mess them up.\n\nSource: Hugh Macknight/PA Images\n\nReferring to the late Sophie Gradon, who appeared on Love Island in 2016, and died last month, Calum said:\n\nPoor Sophie, she was a friend of mine and to think she was struggling on the inside because of what people might have said or how she was being treated \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible thought and that can happen to anybody.\n\nThe 37-year-old acknowledges that trolling on social media is almost unavoidable, but is keen to raise awareness of the implications of certain online behaviour.\n\nI know there are memes out there and it can be quite funny and we all have a laugh, but can you imagine if somebody isn\u2019t confident or somebody lacks self belief and they start seeing all these horrible things written about them.\n\nDefinitely something to think about.\n\nAnd in the rest of the day\u2019s dirt\u2026\n\n\n\nLouis Tomlinson felt he had to assure fans that music was still his priority, despite signing up to this year\u2019s The X Factor.
