If rumors are to be believed, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is allegedly the new girl crush of The Black Eyed Peas vocalist, Fergie.\n\nIn an exclusive report by Radar Online, it has been alleged that the 42-year-old singer has her eyes set on the La Perla model. The webloid claimed that Fergie finds Kendall really attractive and is keen on getting close to her.\n\n\u201cFergie thinks Kendall\u2019s so hot and she wants to get close.\u201d\n\nApparently, Kendall and Fergie first met behind the scenes of a fashion show. The mother-of-one allegedly thinks that she had an instant connection with the Victoria\u2019s Secret model.\n\nThe gossip site also noted that the \u201cBig Girls Don\u2019t Cry\u201d singer has already worked with the supermodel. Just recently, Kendall appeared in Fergie\u2019s new music video for \u201cEnchant\u00e9 (Carine).\u201d\n\nAside from that, Fergie is reportedly close to Kendall\u2019s step-sister, Kim Kardashian West, who also starred in her \u201cMILF, Money\u201d music video in 2016.\n\nThe webloid added that the singer is looking forward to work with Kendall again, this time, as a model for her shoe designs.\n\nIt can be recalled that Fergie secretly split with Josh Duhamel after years of being together. And now that the singer is single, the gossip site alleged that she wants to \u201cexplore her fantasies.\u201d\n\n\u201cFergie\u2019s free to explore all of her fantasies and Kendall is at the top of her list.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BaaYE-4gyqj/?hl=en&taken-by=fergie\n\nDespite reports that Fergie is crushing hard on Kendall Jenner, Gossip Cop claimed that the rumors were not true. According to the debunking site, a source close to the singer confirmed that the rumor about her crushing on the supermodel is \u201c100 percent false.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYs9sgOD7Bd/?hl=en&taken-by=kendalljenner\n\nThis is not the first time that Fergie\u2019s sexuality has been the subject of controversy. In 2009, the \u201cFergalicious\u201d singer admitted in an interview that she is a bisexual, adding that she has always been honest about it with her husband.\n\n\u201cI think women are beautiful. I\u2019ve had a lot of fun with women, and I\u2019m not ashamed of it. The problem is that I also love a well-endowed man.\u201d\n\nHowever, she reiterated that she forbid herself to have affairs with women while in a relationship with her husband. Apparently, the singer has set a rule that \u201cit is still cheating even if it\u2019s with girls.\u201d\n\nIn September, Fergie and Josh Duhamel confirmed that they are separating after eight years of marriage. In an interview with The Wendy Willams Show, the singer emotionally admitted that she \u201cwanted to stay married forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Josh. He\u2019s the father of my child. We forever have that project together, and we\u2019re doing the best we can.\u201d\n\n[Featured Images by Frazer Harrison, Frederick M.
