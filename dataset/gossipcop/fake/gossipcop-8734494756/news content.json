For us, we\u2019re just enjoying this time.\u201d\n\nThe wildlife conservationist \u2014 who followed in the footsteps of her late father Steve Irwin \u2014 says that despite finding the \u201cone\u201d, she believes the couple should be focusing on enjoying their youth. \u201cAs young people, it\u2019s all about school and then college and then getting a house and getting married and that\u2019s fantastic, but sometimes we forget to live in the now,\u201d Bindi explained. \u201cSo for us, in our relationship, we\u2019re enjoying this moment and having so much fun traveling the world, working with animals, following our passion of conservation and just being together.\u201d\n\nBindi\u2019s mother, Terri Irwin, also told Us why the 21-year-old \u2014 who went out of his way to keep in touch with the Dancing With the Stars winner after meeting at her family\u2019s zoo \u2014 has her seal of approval: \u201cChandler had his brother contact the zoo to ask my permission if Chandler could stay in touch with Bindi. And I thought, who does that? So permission granted and it\u2019s been wonderful ever since.\u201d\n\nThe happy couple debuted their romance in September 2015 at a taping for season 21 of Dancing With the Stars. Bindi later told Entertainment Tonight she knew Powell was \u201cthe one\u201d after he put on a khaki Australia Zoo uniform, saying, \u201cIt was kind of one of those moments that was a real defining moment for me \u2026 only the people who are the closest to us that get their khakis.\u201d\n\nAs for the patriarch of the Irwin family, Steve \u2014 who died in September 2006 after being stung by a stingray while filming a documentary \u2014 was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, April 26.
