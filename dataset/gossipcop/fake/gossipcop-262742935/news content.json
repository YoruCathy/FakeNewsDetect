Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.\n\n\"It's sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,\" Jackman revealed. \"The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the 'shirt off' scenes to the very end.\"\n\n\"You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,\" Jackman said, explaining the process. \"You lose ten pounds of water weight.\"\n\nBut now that that's over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.\n\n\"Now I'm eating and loving it,\" Jackman told Colbert. \"Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.\"\n\n\"With it still in my lap,\" he added.\n\nOne of us! One of us! One of us!\n\nLogan is in theaters now.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/41d393a63bef3b38dcd919b830808fd3?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "https://mlpnk72yciwc.i.optimole.com/cqhiHLc-IL1Nn2d-/w:600/h:338/q:90/https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HughJackman.jpg", "https://mlpnk72yciwc.i.optimole.com/cqhiHLc-WIpllaB8/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/themes/bleeding-cool-theme/library/images/bleeding-cool-logo.png", "https://mlpnk72yciwc.i.optimole.com/cqhiHLc-_0_sOhij/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cgc-bc-sponsorship.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20600%20338%22%20width%3D%22600%22%20height%3D%22338%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HughJackman-600x338.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HughJackman-600x338.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://bleedingcool.com/movies/hugh-jackman-plans-get-fat-now-hes-done-playing-wolverine/", "title": "Hugh Jackman Plans To Get Fat Now That He's Done Playing Wolverine", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he's done", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hugh Jackman Plans To Get Fat Now That He's Done Playing Wolverine", "description": "Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he's done", "url": "https://bleedingcool.com/movies/hugh-jackman-plans-get-fat-now-hes-done-playing-wolverine/", "site_name": "Bleeding Cool News And Rumors", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HughJackman-600x338.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HughJackman-600x338.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bleedingcoolnews", "tag": "wolverine", "section": "Movies", "published_time": "2017-03-03T05:30:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1669179913139032}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hugh Jackman was a guest on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert tonight, and Colbert had an important question for the Logan actor: now that he's done", "title": "Hugh Jackman Plans To Get Fat Now That He's Done Playing Wolverine", "site": "@bleedingcool", "image": "https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/HughJackman-600x338-1.jpg", "creator": "@judeterror"}, "generator": "Optimole 2.3.0", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488384000.0, "source": "http://www.bleedingcool.com", "summary": ""}
