And so, after the 2016 election last November, the National Enquirer tried again, this time with a report announcing, \u201cObamas To Split After White House Exit!\u201d The gossip magazine actually maintained divorce lawyers were already \u201chammering out a deal so the presidential pair can end their 24-year union as soon as they leave the White House!\u201d At issue, claimed the tabloid, was \u201cchild support, custody, and their $25 million fortune,\u201d As Gossip Cop rightly said at the time, though, the allegations were total bullsplit.\n\nThe Obamas left office in January and immediately went on a joint vacation. In the time since, they\u2019ve made no move towards a divorce. Yet Radar Online decided to revive the split narrative this past July, suggesting there were \u201cmarriage problems\u201d because the former president was \u201cspotted smiling without his wedding band.\u201d It was sensationalized drivel that was spun simply because Barack posed for a photo in an airport. It was followed, however, by another story claiming Barack wanted to \u201ccut loose and party\u201d and had secret plans to \u201clive life as a bachelor without Michelle\u201d amid \u201cdivorce rumors.\u201d\n\nThose manufactured \u201cdivorce rumors,\u201d however, had no merit and only came from the webloid and its print counterpart. But according to this tale, the ex commander-in-chief had \u201ckicked wife Michelle to the curb\u201d and wanted to \u201cenjoy all the lovely young women\u201d around him. It was even alleged they \u201csecretly agreed to a $25 million divorce deal,\u201d and a purported \u201cinsider\u201d was quoted as saying, \u201cTheir marriage is through. The wedding band is gone \u2014 and Michelle will soon follow!\u201d So, what really followed those contentions?\n\nWell, the Obamas remained together, just as Gossip Cop said they would. And today, they mark a quarter of century united in marriage. Gossip Cop sincerely wishes the couple a rumor-free anniversary, and we\u2019ll be here to correct any continued misinformation as necessary.\n\nPhoto: Instagram/MichelleObama", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e6647903b24e994901bfc4c?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-10-04-obamas-celebrate-25th-anniversary-after-false-split-stories/", "title": "Obamas Celebrate 25th Anniversary After False Split Stories", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "To mark the milestone, Michelle shared a photo from their nuptials on social media.", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "discover new music, more music more variety, Uniquely Twin Cities, discover new music, more music more variety, Uniquely Twin Cities", "og": {"title": "Obamas Celebrate 25th Anniversary After False Split Stories | Cities 97.1", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://cities971.iheart.com/content/2017-10-04-obamas-celebrate-25th-anniversary-after-false-split-stories/", "description": "To mark the milestone, Michelle shared a photo from their nuptials on social media.", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "Cities 97.1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://cities971.iheart.com/content/2017-10-04-obamas-celebrate-25th-anniversary-after-false-split-stories/", "site": "@cities97radio", "creator": "@cities97radio", "title": "Obamas Celebrate 25th Anniversary After False Split Stories | Cities 97.1", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "To mark the milestone, Michelle shared a photo from their nuptials on social media.", "domain": "cities971.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Obamas Celebrate 25th Anniversary After False Split Stories | Cities 97.1", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-10-04-obamas-celebrate-25th-anniversary-after-false-split-stories/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "discover new music, more music more variety, Uniquely Twin Cities, discover new music, more music more variety, Uniquely Twin Cities", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59d4e9b73e36889a4817cd4f?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "Cities 97.1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "fb": {"pages": 128814659408, "app_id": 169806486402569}, "parsely-pub-date": "2017-10-04T14:04:00.000Z", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-section": "National - Trending (Urban Entertainment) (501920)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507046400.0, "source": "http://cities97.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
