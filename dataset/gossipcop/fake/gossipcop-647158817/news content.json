Some residents used their life savings, combined with federal relief funding, to buy the homes. But some found they couldn\u2019t keep up with the repairs and have abandoned them, the Daily Mail added.\n\nResident Constance Fowler told the Daily Mail that her next-door neighbors in a Make it Right home had to move out because the wife was getting sick from the mold. Make it Right promised to renovate the house, but workers found its roof was beyond repair, Fowler said. The house was left unoccupied and rotting away. Fowler told the Daily Mail she had to repeatedly petition Make it Right and the city to tear it down.\n\n\u201cMake It Right says this is the largest green community in the United States,\u201d Fowler said to the Daily Mail. \u201cLook how many are boarded up now or abandoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have problems with porches, roofs, walls falling apart,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s six out of seven homes right next to me that have had significant repairs.\u201d\n\nAnother resident, Doris Wyman, said she and her husband Henry are only able to stay in their Make it Right home because Henry is a skilled handyman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about neighbors\u2019 homes,\u201d she said. \u201cJust because mine is holding up, I know others are falling apart, their walls, roofs and porches.\u201d\n\nWyman said Make it Right may have brought people back to the Lower Ninth Ward, but ultimately failed in its mission if people can\u2019t stay in their homes. She acknowledged that the intention probably was \u201cbeautiful\u201d but asked, \u201cWhere did they go wrong?\u201d\n\nPitt used to be a regular presence in the neighborhood and at the Make it Right headquarters, the Daily Mail said. But residents told the Daily Mail they haven\u2019t seen him for a couple of years.\n\nThe New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in May 2015 that Pitt and Jolie, then Hollywood\u2019s premier globe-trotting super couple, were selling their New York Orleans mansion for $6.5 million.\n\nA representative for the couple insisted at the time that the sale didn\u2019t mean that the couple were wavering in their commitment to the Lower Ninth Ward.\n\n\u201cYes they are letting go of this property and will look for something more off the beaten path down the road,\u201d the rep said told the Times-Picayune. \u201cIn the meantime, they remain committed to, and infatuated as ever with the city of New Orleans, and will continue to focus on growth in the Lower Ninth through the Make It Right Foundation.\u201d\n\nJolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016, and the couple have since been locked in a bitter, high-profile battle over their divorce and custody of their six children, ages 10 to 16. Pitt also was initially hit with allegations that he was drinking too much and had become violent with their oldest son, Maddox, 16, during a flight from Europe in 2016.\n\nPitt, facing the biggest scandal of his three-decade career, \u201cturned inward,\u201d E! News recently reported. In a candid 2017 interview with GQ Style, Pitt used an architectural metaphor to describe his recovery from the breakup of his family, saying he relied on therapy, a newfound sobriety and plenty of solitude to strip down \u201cto the foundation and break out the mortar.\u201d\n\nWith regard to his focus on Make it Right, a source close to Pitt insisted to the Daily Mail that the actor has visited New Orleans several times over the past few years and continues to make the organization a priority.\n\n\u201cIn addition to personally being there, he continues to dedicate significant time and financial support to this project,\u201d the source said. \u201cThis is an ongoing project for both Make It Right and for Brad \u2014 who has personally donated his time and millions of his own dollars to ensure the community is revitalized and the project continues as scheduled.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview from Los Angeles with the New Orleans Times-Picayune in 2015 \u2014 the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina \u2014 Pitt said he had recently visited the Lower Ninth Ward. He delighted in how the neighborhood had become an \u201coasis of color and the solar panels.\u201d\n\nPitt told the Times-Picayune he also had talked to residents sitting on their front porch. He asked them how their new homes were working out.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said they told him. \u201cAnd I say what\u2019s your utility bill? And they\u2019ll throw something out like, \u201924 bucks\u2019 or something, and I feel fantastic.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Pitt admitted to the Times-Picayune that he and the organization had been \u201cincredibly naive\u201d in understanding what it really takes to rebuild a community.\n\n\u201cWe went into it incredibly naive,\u201d he told the newspaper, \u201cjust thinking we can build homes \u2014 how hard is that? \u2014 and not understanding forgivable loan structures and family financial counseling and getting the rights to lots and HUD grants and so on and so forth. So it\u2019s been a big learning curve.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PittNOLA2.jpg?w=1024&h=639", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PIttNOLA3.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PittNOLA1.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/PittNOLA2.jpg?w=1024&h=639", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
