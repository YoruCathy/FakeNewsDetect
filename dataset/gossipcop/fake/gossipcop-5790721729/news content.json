The publication reports that Stella has moved into Kristen\u2019s four-bedroom house in Los Angeles\u2019 Los Feliz neighborhood, while also keeping her apartment in New York.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both so busy with work but try to be together when they can,\u201d a source told Us Weekly.\n\nThe 27-year-old actress\u2019 romance comes after failed relationships with stars including Robert Pattinson and, since going public with her sexuality, musicians Stephanie Sokolinski and St. Vincent.\n\nThe bisexual actress tends to be guarded when it comes to her private life, but after publicly calling out President Donald Trump about nasty tweets he sent about her split from Pattinson in 2012, Kristen has been more open than ever about her sexual preferences.\n\nAt the New York screening of her movie Personal Shopper in March (17), Kristen was asked by The Associated Press how she felt about the widespread media coverage regarding her sexuality.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad that it\u2019s gotten attention, it matters, it\u2019s important,\u201d she said in a video interview with the news outlet before walking off somewhat stony-faced.\n\nIn a previous interview with The Guardian, Kristen added that her experience since coming out has been nothing but positive.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to talk about. I don\u2019t want to seem presumptuous, because everyone has their own experience,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to acknowledge that fluidity, that greyness, which has always existed. But maybe only now are we allowed to start talking about it.\u201d", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ef1y0A8erBLUc.gif", "https://www.media3.hw-static.com/media/2017/05/wenn_kristenstewart_stellamaxwell_050517_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3002265&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://www.media3.hw-static.com/media/2017/05/wenn_kristenstewart_stellamaxwell_050517_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.hollywood.com/general/kristen-stewart-and-girlfriend-stella-maxwell-move-in-together-report-60687368/", "title": "Kristen Stewart and Girlfriend Stella Maxwell Move in Together", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#df8424", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 ,maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "author": "WENN", "article": {"topic": "Celebrities", "type": "Article", "category": "Love Connection", "publisher": "http://facebook.com/hollywoodcom", "tag": "stella-maxwell", "section": "Celebrities", "published_time": "2017-05-05T06:35:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-05T10:44:03+00:00"}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kristen Stewart and Girlfriend Stella Maxwell Move in Together", "url": "http://www.hollywood.com/general/kristen-stewart-and-girlfriend-stella-maxwell-move-in-together-report-60687368/", "site_name": "Hollywood.com", "updated_time": "2017-05-05T10:44:03+00:00", "image": "https://www.media3.hw-static.com/media/2017/05/wenn_kristenstewart_stellamaxwell_050517_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 825400}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kristen Stewart and Girlfriend Stella Maxwell Move in Together", "site": "@hollywood_com", "domain": "Hollywood.com", "image": {"src": "https://www.media4.hw-static.com/media/2017/05/wenn_kristenstewart_stellamaxwell_050517_1800x1200-1800x1200.jpg"}, "creator": "@hollywood_com"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493966106.0, "source": "http://www.hollywood.com", "summary": ""}
