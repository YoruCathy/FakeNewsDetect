News. \u201cJack and Lena were growing apart and it just made sense for them to end their relationship where it was.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey added: \u201cThey want the best for each other no matter what. They are both moving on.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from the couple then confirmed that they were no longer together.\n\nBleachers, whose recent album \u2018Gone Now\u2018 was named as one of NME\u2019s best albums of 2017, last year had Dunham direct the video for \u2018Don\u2019t Take The Money\u2018.\n\nRecent years have seen Antonoff act as producer and co-writer with the likes of St Vincent, Lorde and Taylor Swift \u2013 the latter once said that his relationship with Dunham inspired the \u20181989\u2019 album track \u2018You Are In Love\u2018.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had that, so I wrote that song about things that Lena [Dunham] has told me about her and Jack [Antonoff],\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just basically stuff she\u2019s told me. And I think that that kind of relationship \u2014 God, it sounds like it would just be so beautiful \u2014 would also be hard. It would also be mundane at times.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-633605336_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_1000.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-633605336_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_1000-696x442.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-633605336_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Trendell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/lena-dunham-jack-antonoff-split-2216170", "title": "Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have split up", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have confirmed that they have split up after five years together", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have split up | NME", "description": "Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have confirmed that they have split up after five years together", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/lena-dunham-jack-antonoff-split-2216170", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-633605336_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_1000.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-633605336_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_1000.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2018-01-09T08:30:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have confirmed that they have split up after five years together", "title": "Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff have split up | NME", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-633605336_lena_dunham_jack_antonoff_1000.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515486659.0, "source": "http://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
