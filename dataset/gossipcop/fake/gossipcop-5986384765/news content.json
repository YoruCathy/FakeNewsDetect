It won't -- for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn't seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.\n\nThe much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall \u2014 and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means \u2014 and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months \u2014 that, ultimately, this isn't a legal fight, it's a public relations one.\n\nGiuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota. \"I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,\" Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.\n\n\"My version\" vs. \"their version.\" What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the \"versions\" will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other \"version\" will be Giuliani's cable TV appearances and President Trump's tweets.\n\nThat is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion -- particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump's side.", "images": ["http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180123174541-02-trump-mueller-split-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161209163408-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-super-tease.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170305101637-trump-putin-split-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180713124904-dana-bash-reax-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180717082752-02-donald-trump-0716-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170515131851-the-point-with-chris-cillizza-logo-large-169.png", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180730080926-rudy-giuliani-newday-1-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170423134003-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171030211613-conspiracy-collusion-explainer-orig-mg-00005015-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180713211809-chris-cuomo-roger-stone-07132018-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180916103441-kenneth-starr-september-16-2018-01-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171028084409-robert-mueller-0721-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180628175842-trey-gowdy-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180713121217-01-rosenstein-0713-screengrab-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180411072715-01-trump-putin-file-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180730080926-rudy-giuliani-newday-1-exlarge-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170308211706-trump-tower-sign-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180716184831-fox-news-putin-intv-large-169.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180917180812-donald-trump-declassify-documents-russia-perez-tsr-vpx-00001628-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180712205102-rep-david-cicilline-07-12-2018-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180812091946-rudy-giuliani-8-12-18-large-169.jpg", "http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180730085905-rudy-giuliani-alisyn-camerota-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161209163408-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Analysis Chris Cillizza", "Cnn Editor-At-Large"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/politics/donald-trump-rudy-giuliani/index.html", "title": "The secret Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani know about the Russia probe", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "politics", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2018-07-31T14:28:33Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/31/politics/donald-trump-rudy-giuliani/index.html", "title": "The secret Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani know about the Russia probe", "description": "The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161209163408-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2018-07-31T14:28:33Z", "lastmod": "2018-08-01T15:10:37Z", "author": "Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large", "twitter": {"title": "The secret Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani know about the Russia probe", "description": "The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161209163408-donald-trump-rudy-giuliani-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump.", "keywords": "politics, The Russia investigation secret Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani know -
