Does that mean he wants to get back together with her? Get the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\n\n\nPeople LOVE when couples rekindle their romances, but is a reunion in the cards for Kristen Stewart, 27, and Robert Pattinson, 31? The Twilight alums were spotted \u201changing out\u201d together on Feb. 11, and we\u2019re hearing that the former couple are on good terms now! \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to get there, but Rob and Kristen are finally friends again,\u201d a source close to Rob told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cTheir break-up was so painful for Rob, and he felt so angry and humiliated by Kristen cheating, that at one point he doubted he would ever be able to fully forgive her. But, time heals and Rob\u2019s now managed to put the past behind him and let bygones be bygones.\u201d\n\nBut even though the pair have a past with each other, don\u2019t expect them them to be getting together in the future. \u201cRob and Kristen have so much shared history, they were together during the craziest time in their lives, they pretty much grew up together during the whole Twilight madness, and they really understand each other better than anyone else could. Rob still has a lot of love and respect for Kristen, but it\u2019s evolved from romantic feelings into a deep friendship,\u201d the insider added.\n\nIf you\u2019re bummed that Bella and Edward won\u2019t be living the rest of eternity together IRL, listen, I get it. We all are gunning for our faves to rekindle their lost love. Personally, I\u2019m still not over the fact that Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron broke up! But, unfortunately, not every couple is Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. And also, Kristen herself has said in a monologue on Saturday Night Live that she is \u201clike so gay dude.\u201d She\u2019s currently dating Victoria\u2019s Secret model Stella Maxwell, 27. So yeah, Kristen and Robert aren\u2019t getting back together any time soon, and that\u2019s probably for the best. (And while we\u2019re at it, quit it with the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston shipping! They\u2019re not getting back together! Stop it!)\n\nHollywoodLifers, what were your thoughts on Kristen and Robert hanging out?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F02%2F17%2Frobert-pattinson-loves-kristen-stewart-reunion-rumors%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3001212&comment_count=7", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/robert-pattinson-still-loves-respects-kristen-stewart-amid-reunion-rumors-does-he-want-to-get-back-together-again-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/robert-pattinson-still-loves-respects-kristen-stewart-amid-reunion-rumors-does-he-want-to-get-back-together-again-ftr.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/robert-pattinson-still-loves-respects-kristen-stewart-amid-reunion-rumors-does-he-want-to-get-back-together-again-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/17/robert-pattinson-loves-kristen-stewart-reunion-rumors/", "title": "Rob Pattinson Still \u2018Loves\u2019 Kristen Stewart Amid Reunion Rumors: Does He Want To Date Her Again?", "meta_data": {"description": "Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have started hanging out again, and he apparently still 'loves' her.
