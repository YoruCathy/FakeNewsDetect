At the royal wedding of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Kate and William took special interest in each other, going so far as to lean over poor Camilla to converse:\n\n\n\nPrince William, Camila, and Kate Middleton in the pews of St George\u2019s Chapel at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s May 19, 2018 wedding. Getty Images\n\nAlthough body language typically reflects a couple's emotional connection, you can't fully interpret it without context \u2014 particularly when observing how a royal couple behaves in public, according to body language expert Blanca Cobb based in North Carolina. \"They may be more reserved [than other couples] in their public displays of affection, but that doesn\u2019t meant they love each other any less or aren\u2019t excited about each other,\" Cobb says.\n\nTo better understand what *really* goes on behind palace doors, Cobb analyzed a handful of the couple's closest public encounters:\n\n1. When Kate Leans Over Camilla\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn the midst of a royal wedding, there's no such thing as a private moment \u2014 but boy do William and Kate try! Above, they attempt to converse, leaning forward to make eye contact without overstepping into Camilla's personal space, Cobb observes. \"William and Kate prefer to be together and share moments privately,\" she says. So much for seating charts!\n\n2. When Kate Tapped William's Knee\n\nKate taps William\u2019s knee during a filmed interview. (December 2017)\n\nDespite the recent hoopla surrounding this exchange, it isn't *really* about affection or romance, according to Cobb, who sees tapping as a way to signal, \"Hey, we can both relate,\" in lighthearted situations. That said, touching doesn't necessarily happen between any two people: \"There's a level of familiarity, comfort, and likability in touch. Through touch you connect with your partner. You let them know that they\u2019re important to you,\" Cobb says. \"Gentle touches, playful moments, and sincere smiles show that they enjoy each other\u2019s company and have fun together.\"\n\n3. When They Walked Arm-in-Arm\n\nThe couple walks together after a rowing race in Germany. (July 2017) Samir Hussein/ Getty Images\n\nCobb says couples who synchronize their movements are emotionally in sync, and in the photo above, Kate and William both lead with their left legs. \"This shows they are in tune with each other,\" Cobb says. Because Kate walks slightly ahead of William in this photo, it's a sign that she may be a dominant force in their relationship, according to Cobb.\n\n4. When They Stood in the Stands\n\nThe couple holds horns while watching the London Marathon. (April 2017) Samir Hussein / Getty Images\n\n\"Body mirroring is another sign you\u2019re really digging your partner,\" Cobb says, pointing out the way Kate and William both lean toward their left, and they both rest their left forearms on the railing.\n\n5. When William Wrapped His Arms Around Kate\n\nWilliam embraces Kate during London 2012 Olympic Games.

Although this doesn't appear to be an intimate moment, since Kate and William aren't locking eyes, \"they\u2019re seizing the moment with physical closeness that brings them closer emotionally,\" Cobb says.\n\n6. When Kate Draped Her Arms Around William\n\nThe couple embraces during the London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images\n\nCobb isn't concerned that the couples' eyes don't meet during this embrace, since they're watching a sports game. \"Her hands are relaxed on his shoulders, they're standing body-to-body with no air between them, and while his hands fall away from her a little, his fingers look relaxed with no tightness,\" Cobb says. \"They are very relaxed and comfortable expressing themselves the best way they can, as royals.\"\n\nCobb thinks nothing of the way Kate is tilting her hips away from William in the photo above, in part because it's difficult to determine how much room Kate had to shift around in the stands. And because Kate and William tend to act demure around each other, facing each other, hip-to-hip, would seem out of character for them, anyway.\n\n7. When Kate Air Kisses William\n\nKate kisses William on both cheeks after his polo team wins a competition (July 2011). Samir Hussein / Getty Images\n\nKate and William rarely kiss in public, and this cheek kiss would be a rare exception \u2014 except that Kate doesn't actually touch her lips to William's face. \"You can't say she doesn't feel emotion for her husband,\" Cobb says. \"There's still no tension here. Kate is reaching out to him, has a relaxed bend in her arm, with her fingers relaxed on shoulder.\"\n\nWilliam, on the other hand, looks less comfortable receiving affection in this context. \"He's body blocking by holding the gift between them,\" Cobb says, although this doesn't mean these partners don't show fondness toward each other. \"It could be that this is the extent of affection they're willing to demonstrate in public.\"\n\n8. When They Were Young\n\nThe couple poses for photo on the day of their university graduation. (June 2005) Middleton Family/Clarence House via GettyImages\n\n\"Putting your hand on someone's stomach is more intimate than placing it on the shoulder or back,\" Cobb says. \"Although it's unclear whether William is trying to hold Kate's hand there or move it away, there's no curvature to his fingers, which means there no tension. He's most likely holding Kate's hand in place \u2014 a sign of mutual comfort.\"\n\n9. When Kate and William Lean In\n\nThe couple sits side by side during a graduation ceremony.

When William Touched Kate's Lower Back\n\nThe couple attends media event. (December 2017) Karwai Tang/ Getty Images\n\n\"Couples who love each other want to touch each other, since it can convey your love without you having to say a word,\" Cobb says of William placing his hand on Kate's lower back. \"The back placement is a nice, intimate compromise, since if he goes any lower, he goes near the tush, and the shoulder seems too formal.\"\n\n11. When The Newly Marrieds Kissed On The Buckingham Palace Balcony\n\nThe couple kisses on their wedding day. (April 2011)\n\nCobb says the couple's wedding kiss is the least intimate interaction of them all. \"It was their wedding day! They should have been touching and embracing heart-to-heart,\" she says. Instead, they stand apart, without even holding hands, and reach only their lips toward each other to meet.\n\nDuring the kiss, Kate and William open their eyes at different moments before Kate ultimately pulls away. \"It signals a disconnect, since people who are really into each other automatically close their eyes to feel the moment, the breath of the other person, and the sensation of lips touching,\" Cobb says. \"It looks like they're going through the motions. I also get the sense she\u2019s a little shy, embarrassed, or unsure, since she giggles right afterward, and raises her shoulders \u2014 it's a nervous moment for her.\" But hey, not everyone gets married in front of thousands of people!\n\nThe Bottom Line:\n\n\"This isn't a typical couple, they're people of royalty with rules to follow on public decorum,\" Cobb says. \"I think what happens behind closed doors can be very different from what you see in public.\"\n\nGet all the health and fitness news directly in your feed.
