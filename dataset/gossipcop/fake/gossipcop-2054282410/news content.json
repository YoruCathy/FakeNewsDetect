But on Tuesday\u2019s Stern Show, Rob came clean to Howard about getting expelled from classes after he was caught shoplifting dirty magazines in his youth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never actually said this before,\u201d Rob said with a laugh. \u201cI was, like, stealing porno magazines and selling them at school.\u201d\n\nThe X-rated mags fetched Rob a pretty penny, too. \u201cI would sell it for like 20 pounds \u2026 like 30 bucks,\u201d he told Howard.\n\nWhile he started out swiping just one or two magazines from the store at a time, Rob then tried to up his haul. \u201cI got so cocky that I would take the entire rack,\u201d he admitted. That\u2019s when he got noticed by a store employee who caught him with a backpack full of porn and gave Rob the option of having him call the cops or call his parents. Begrudgingly, Rob told him to call his parents. However, the store clerk also ratted Rob out to his school, hence why he was expelled.\n\nPrior to pilfering porno, Rob said he used to steal candy, especially wearable candy bracelets that he told Howard he used to be \u201cobsessed\u201d with.\n\n\u201cI liked stealing things a lot,\u201d Rob said. \u201cYou can definitely get high off it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGary, do me a favor \u2014 make sure nothing\u2019s missing from the green room,\u201d Howard joked.\n\nNow on the straight and narrow, the only thing Rob steals is audience\u2019s hearts. Pattinson became a household name after five turns as Edward Cullen in the \u201cTwilight\u201d films, but on Tuesday he told Howard how close he came to actually getting fired from the famous movie franchise. According to Rob, he wanted his young vampire character to be much more brooding than the film\u2019s producers who requested he lighten up a bit whenever cameras were rolling.\n\n\u201cI remember the producers giving me a copy of the book,\u201d Rob told Howard. \u201cEvery single instance where my character smiled and stuff, they\u2019d highlighted.\u201d\n\nRob said he then took his own highlighter to the book and underlined each and every time his character frowned or showed emotion. His agent was eventually flown in to have a frank conversation with Rob and explain if he didn\u2019t change his character\u2019s attitude, he might be out of a job. He told Howard he returned to set with a smile on his face.\n\n\u201cI was probably going a little bit too miserable so there was some kind of compromise made,\u201d Rob said.\n\nEven though he\u2019s been deemed the Sexiest Man Alive by multiple publications throughout the years, Rob told Howard he prefers to keep his shirt on, especially while on a movie set. He joked about \u201cTwilight\u201d director Catherine Hardwicke even telling him to cover up while shooting the first film.\n\n\u201cI took it off and she told me to put it back on again,\u201d Rob said.\n\nHe\u2019s also all but ruled out starring in a superhero franchise due to the dedication needed in the gym in order to achieve the ripped body expected of a caped crime fighter. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how people do it, at all,\u201d Rob said with a laugh of actors who work out nonstop.\n\nRob is playing just about the opposite of a superhero in his new movie \u201cGood Time\u201d which tells the story of a bank robbery gone wrong. The movie is set in New York and Howard was impressed in Pattinson's ability to shed his English accent for a thick Queens dialect.\n\n\u201cI was just hanging out in New York for ages,\u201d Rob explained to Howard. He even tried out his accent while in character at a Yonkers auto body shop, just to test its authenticity.\n\nAccents have never been an issue for Rob, who said he used to always walk into auditions speaking like an American rather than a Brit in an effort to convince casting directors he was right for a part. He would go so far as to lie and say he was from Denver before launching into an accent from another region in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that anyone could see me as [being in] was period dramas,\u201d Rob said of auditioning with his English accent intact. As an American, though, he was able to land many of the roles he wanted.\n\nHoward asked Rob about his current relationship with singer-songwriter FKA Twigs. The two have been together for nearly three years but Rob revealed many in \u201cTwilight\u201d nation have a problem with him dating her, some going so far as to make racist remarks online about her.\n\n\u201cThey get so addicted to kind of just wanting to cause hurt and pain on someone,\u201d Rob said of internet trolls. \u201cIt\u2019s a faceless enemy.\u201d\n\nMany a woman would consider falling in love with Rob a dream come true, but he made it clear there are plenty of disadvantages to dating him: crazed fans, limited privacy, and a hectic schedule.\n\n\u201cThey may think they want to have a relationship with you, but if they start having a relationship with you they actually realize, like, \u2018Oh, this is not what I want at all,\u2019\u201d Rob said. \u201cIt actually kind of narrows things down.\u201d\n\nSee Robert Pattinson in \u201cGood Time\u201d opening in New York and Los Angeles Aug. 11, in theaters everywhere Aug. 25.", "images": ["https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/static/site/img/logo.png", "https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/static/site/img/HS-Footer-Logos.png", "https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/static/site/img/logo.white.png", "https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/photos/2017/07/25/55-41582-rob-pattinson-studio-072517-promo-full-hss-1501006677.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/photos/2017/07/25/55-41582-rob-pattinson-studio-072517-promo-full-hss-1501006677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://www.howardstern.com/show/2017/7/25/robert-pattinson-nearly-being-fired-twilight-his-current-love-life-and-stealing-porn-kid/", "title": "Robert Pattinson on Nearly Being Fired From \u2018Twilight,\u2019 His Current Love Life, and Stealing as a Kid", "meta_data": {"title": "Robert Pattinson on Nearly Being Fired From \u2018Twilight,\u2019 His Current Love Life, and Stealing as a Kid", "description": "Hollywood actor comes clean to Howard about getting caught red-handed with dirty magazines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"title": "Robert Pattinson on Nearly Being Fired From \u2018Twilight,\u2019 His Current Love Life, and Stealing as a Kid", "description": "Hollywood actor comes clean to Howard about getting caught red-handed with dirty magazines", "type": "website", "image": "https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/photos/2017/07/25/55-41582-rob-pattinson-studio-072517-promo-full-hss-1501006677.jpg", "url": "https://www.howardstern.com/show/2017/7/25/robert-pattinson-nearly-being-fired-twilight-his-current-love-life-and-stealing-porn-kid/", "site_name": "Howard Stern"}, "fb": {"pages": 215428201914198}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@sternshow", "title": "Robert Pattinson on Nearly Being Fired From \u2018Twilight,\u2019 His Current Love Life, and Stealing as a Kid", "description": "Hollywood actor comes clean to Howard about getting caught red-handed with dirty magazines", "image": "https://d1o0agh0cxj49r.cloudfront.net/photos/2017/07/25/55-41582-rob-pattinson-studio-072517-promo-full-hss-1501006677.jpg"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Snk6mGGKH4M?rel=0&wmode=opaque", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/NrB28374Ggo?rel=0&wmode=opaque", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vct9CyAp4LE?rel=0&wmode=opaque"], "publish_date": 1500912000.0, "source": "http://www.howardstern.com", "summary": ""}
