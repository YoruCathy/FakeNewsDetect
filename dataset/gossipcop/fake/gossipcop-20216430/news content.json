According to the source, the pop superstar, 47, is getting cold feet. \"Jennifer keeps telling Alex that she's 'just not there yet,'\" says the insider.\n\nAccording to the report, Rodriguez has been pushing for a date.\n\n\"A-Rod has been begging J.Lo to set a wedding date. She loves him, but she's told him that until she says otherwise, the wedding is on hold.\"\n\nThe two celebrities have been talked about as one of the biggest power couples over the past year.\n\nMonths ago, a report suggested Lopez--not Rodriguez--wanted the marriage to happen by the end of 2017.\n\nAccording to a report from In Touch, Rodriguez and Lopez are discussing a prenuptial agreement in preparation for marriage.
