Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201ctotally false.\u201d\u201cBrad Pitt Skips 2017 Oscars After Angelina Jolie Divorce: Couldn\u2019t Bear To See Ex Jennifer Aniston Happy With Justin Theroux?\u201d blares a new Celeb Dirty Laundry headline. Pitt produced Best Picture winner Moonlight, but the site purports that he didn\u2019t attend the awards show because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t bear the spotlight,\u201d so he stayed home \u201cskulking.\u201dWithout a single source to back up its claim, the repeatedly discredited website adds, \u201cThere\u2019s also a high chance that he just wanted to avoid seeing Jennifer Aniston with her husband, Justin Theroux.\u201d The unreliable webloid further claims, \u201cObviously, had Brad gone to the Oscars, he would have felt some regret when he saw his ex-wife happily married to another man when he was single and depressed.\u201dDespite the outlet\u2019s report being entirely baseless, Gossip Cop still checked in with a rep for Pitt, who exclusively assures us the story is \u201ctotally false.\u201d The actor\u2019s reason for not attending the Academy Awards had absolutely nothing to do with Aniston or Theroux, and the claim otherwise is ridiculous.Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time Gossip Cop has had to call out CDL for concocting a nonexistent love triangle between the stars. We previously busted the webloid for falsely claiming Theroux warned Pitt to stay away from Aniston. Gossip Cop also debunked the site\u2019s tall tale about Aniston trying to make Theroux look like Pitt. This latest story is similarly bogus.", "images": ["http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/seagulls-32b6c85d8065e4adbb2d87a1bbb9e9a15dc0ab54.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/t/tiger-5117e3f2cb071e456e3d5fc7d5872570741e2150.jpg", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/roflmao.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/i/image001-7.jpg", "http://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Brad-Pitt-Oscars-Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-300x248.png", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/spam.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/m/manwiththexrayeyes3dbdpack.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/laughingup.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/t/thumbnailbabylonberlins3packshot2d.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/j/james-gandolfini-as-mafia-boss-tony-soprano-4448d33c9c8e614f.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/w/wheelie-bin-056c28d36c389ce83133d5c691afc6dcc66e7753.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/k/knife-322808f87044c4eed4d3f820b0d9d516785eb2db.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye7.gif", "http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article1729920.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Jennifer%20Aniston%20and%20Justin%20Theroux%20OSCARS%20.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/O9SU2Tw7qR7oDbQgvGDjng3XVvc/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/12/12/937/n/1922398/c8a754f5f5d7dc9b_main.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/bustingup.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/f/fighter-jet-081b86e576474c00b187601078a4027476a9c19c.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/z/zebra-6a816e66761bf274817e7d770bc3c715fc9e5cf3.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Brad-Pitt-Oscars-Jennifer-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-300x248.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=728879", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
