Producers Want Hollywood's Hottest To Play George Michael In Biopic Stars including Ryan Gosling, Mel Gibson and Michael Douglas in talks to join film.\n\nGeorge Michael died young \u2014 but Hollywood bosses want as many as seven megastars of various ages to play the pop icon for a blockbuster biopic!\n\nRadarOnline.com has learned Ryan Gosling, Oscar winners Mel Gibson, Michael Douglas and Benicio del Toro, along with British actors Tom Hiddleston, Tom Hardy and Michael Sheen are in the running to step into Michael\u2019s shoes.\n\nEddie Redmayne and Keanu Reeves are also being considered, sources said.\n\nThe \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d singer passed away at age 53 on Christmas Day 2016 under mysterious circumstances.\n\nFor his biopic, producers are said to be borrowing from 2007\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Not There\u201d about music legend Bob Dylan. In that film, multiple stars, including Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett, portrayed various aspects of Dylan\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cProducers are interested in doing the same with George Michael because he went through so much during his lifetime,\u201d dished a snitch.\n\nBut the stages of the former Wham! star\u2019s life are being referred to in \u201ccrude\u201d terms, the source said.\n\n\u201cThere have been talks that they need someone for the \u2018closet years\u2019 before George came out, the \u2018toilet sex years\u2019 when he was busted in a public restroom, the \u2018addiction years\u2019 and the \u2018fat years\u2019 when George was left bloated by his drinking, drug use and health problems,\u201d the insider revealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge ask of one actor to portray all that, so splitting the job between several actors not only makes production easier, it also increases the chance of more people paying to see the film.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
