But the source says West knows what he is doing and is just looking for a little loyalty from his life partner.\n\n\u201cIn his mind, they could be the most powerful couple and spread an important message together, but Kim\u2019s not interested in getting caught up in this,\u201d the source concluded. \u201cAt this point she\u2019ll do whatever she can to avoid drawing attention to Kanye\u2019s embarrassing rants.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
