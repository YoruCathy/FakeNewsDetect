Did President Donald Trump just fire \u2018Black History Month?\u2019 February has been the time when America celebrates the contributions made by its citizens of color, but after four decades of going by \u2018Black History Month,\u2019 Trump reportedly has given the name the boot!\n\nSay good-bye to \u201cBlack History Month\u201d and hello to \u201cNational African American History Month.\u201d Just like with many of his casinos and hotels, President Donald Trump, 70, has decided to take a pre-existing institution and slap his own branding on it, as TMZ reports Trump\u2019s changing the name of the month dedicated to celebrating America\u2019s finest citizens of color.\n\nAfter Trump met with African American leaders, a senior administration official tells TMZ, Donald was convinced that the term \u201cblack\u201d is outdated, and the more appropriate way to refer to the community is \u201cAfrican American.\u201d Hmmm, sounds like Donald\u2019s trying to be a little bit more politically correct!\n\nUpdate: Guess what! TMZ has updated their story to point out that yes, most modern presidents have referred to it as \u201cNational African American History Month\u201d and Donald did NOT change it.\n\nTrump also noticed how the newest addition to the Smithsonian museum was called the \u201cNational Museum of African American History and Culture,\u201d the official tells TMZ. So, Trump decided to change the month\u2019s name. Ever since 1976, every U.S. president has designated February as \u201cBlack History Month,\u201d but Donald has reportedly decided to do his own thing. HollywoodLife.com has reached out for a comment on this report.\n\nDonald\u2019s sudden interest in African American studies comes one day after his strange behavior regarding Frederick Douglass. The abolitionist, former slave and suffrage advocate was brought up by the ex-Celebrity Apprentice star during a Black History Event on Feb. 1, according to The Atlantic. While talking about Frederick during Black History Month isn\u2019t unusual, Donald\u2019s blathering seemed to indicate he thought Mr. Douglass was still alive.\n\n\u201cI am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things,\u201d Donald said. \u201cFrederick Douglass is an example of somebody who\u2019s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.\u201d Yeah, someone tell Donald that Frederick died on Feb. 20, 1895, nearly 122 years ago. He hasn\u2019t \u201cdone an amazing\u201d anything in more than a century.\n\nEven Trump\u2019s press secretary, Sean Spicer, 45, struggled to spin Donald\u2019s comments, trying to convince the world that Donald didn\u2019t think Mr. Douglass was somehow immortal. \u201cI think there\u2019s contributions \u2014 I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made,\u201d Sean said, per the Washington Post. \u201cAnd I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he\u2019s going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more.\u201d Huh? Say that again? And these are the gentlemen who are reportedly changing \u201cBlack History Month\u201d to \u201cNational African American History Month?\n\nWhat do you think about the supposed name change, HollywoodLifers?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F02%2F02%2Fdonald-trump-renaming-black-history-month-name%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2446280&comment_count=6", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/donald-trump-to-rename-e28098black-history-month_-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/donald-trump-to-rename-e28098black-history-month_-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/donald-trump-to-rename-e28098black-history-month_-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/02/02/donald-trump-renaming-black-history-month-name/", "title": "Trump Renaming \u2018Black History Month\u2019 After 41 Years Of Celebration \u2013 Report", "meta_data": {"description": "Uh, say what?
