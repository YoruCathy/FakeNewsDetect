A blog called Just News USA claimed that Queen Elizabeth \u201cdelivered a brutal beatdown\u201d to Michelle for trying to wormhole her way to being one of the exclusive guests at the royal wedding, which is to be held over Memorial Day weekend in 2018.\n\nThe website also alleged that Barack Obama \u201cpractically stalked\u201d Prince Harry on Twitter, sending a message of congratulations to him \u201cwithin seconds of the [engagement] news coming out,\u201d which \u201cperhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.\u201d It went on to claim that the former president posted a number of \u201cdesperate\u201d tweets to Prince Harry in an effort to score a place on the guest list. The article added that the queen \u201croyally snubbed\u201d Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s attempts to attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding.\n\nGossip Cop reports that the only shred of truth to the the website\u2019s story is that Barack\u2019s congratulatory message to Prince Harry was soon after the wedding announcement. He wished the prince and Meghan Markle \u201ca lifetime of joy and happiness\u201d on Twitter. The message was in no way a massive hint to the royals that he and Michelle were \u201cavailable\u201d to attend their wedding ceremony. Just that alone is false because Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding date hadn\u2019t yet been revealed until two days after their announcement.\n\nThe claims made by Just News USA that Michelle Obama tried to \u201csneak a spot\u201d on the wedding guest list is largely viewed as ludicrous, especially since no other details are offered regarding Queen Elizabeth\u2019s \u201cbeatdown\u201d of her.\n\nStory About Queen Elizabeth Giving Michelle Obama \u201cBeatdown\u201d Over Prince Harry Wedding Invite Is Made-Up https://t.co/X3FQsNnLc9 \u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) December 4, 2017\n\nAs Gossip Cop reports, if the Obamas get invited to the royal wedding, it\u2019ll be for other reasons \u2014 such as being good friends with Prince Harry. It won\u2019t come as a result of desperate pleas on social media. The article is characterized as \u201cfake news\u201d by the site that often debunks rumors and other made up stories about celebrities. The site will probably be correcting a number of inaccurate articles between now and when the royal wedding is held next year. All of the commotion about who\u2019s going to be included on the ultra exclusive guest list will be talked about for months to come.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown if Barack and Michelle Obama will attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding, but speculations suggest they\u2019ll most likely be on the guest list. It\u2019s currently being drafted, according to Gossip Cop.", "images": ["http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/be9e7ede81f5ed49321ffae1116e3851?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Michelle-Obama-Prince-Harry-Wedding.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Tooley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4661415/michelle-obama-didnt-try-to-sneak-a-spot-on-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-wedding-guest-list-debunked/", "title": "Michelle Obama Didn\u2019t Try To \u2018Sneak A Spot\u2019 On Prince Harry And Meghan Markle\u2019s Wedding Guest List [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
