But there were still plenty of lingering questions about the whole situation right after it occurred: How was she doing? Were her kids aware? And how did Kanye West deal with the aftermath?\n\nHere are the answers to many of the questions about the scary events that unfolded.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED, IN KIM\u2019S WORDS:\n\nKim\u2019s harrowing first-hand account of the crime was revealed in police reports she filed to French authorities around 4:30 a.m. on Oct. 3 \u2014 just hours after she escaped from her restraints and called for help.\n\nAccording to French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, she explained in the report that she returned to her hotel with her sister Kourtney Kardashian and stylist Simone Harouche. She told police that Kourtney and her assistant Stephanie Sheppard changed clothes as they prepared for a night out, but she wasn\u2019t joining them and went upstairs to work on her computer.\n\n\u201cI heard a noise at the door, like footsteps, and I shouted, asking, \u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 \u201d she said, according to the report. \u201cNo one answered. I called my bodyguard at 2:56 a.m. Through the door, I saw two people arrive, plus the night man who was tied up.\u201d\n\nThe two men apparently had police paraphernalia and one individual wore ski goggles. \u201cIt\u2019s the one with the ski goggles who stayed with me,\u201d she said, according to the report. \u201cHe demanded with a strong French accent, my ring. It was on the bedside table. It\u2019s worth $4 million. \u2026 I told him that I didn\u2019t know, he took out a gun and I showed him the ring.\u201d\n\nShe continued, according to the report: \u201cThey grabbed me and took me into the hallway. I was wearing a bathrobe, naked underneath. Then we went in the room again and they pushed me on the bed. And, it was this time, they tied me up with plastic cables and taped my hands, then they put tape over my mouth and my legs.\u201d\n\nKim also reportedly described in detail what had been taken from her room: two diamond Cartier bracelets, a gold and diamond Jacob necklace, Lorraine Schwartz diamond earrings, a gold Rolex and other items. \u201cI think they robbed me of 5 million dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they left on the run.\u201d\n\nThe new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians will also cover the incident, with the reality star publicly opening up about the ordeal for the first time.\n\nImage zoom Source: EOnline.com\n\n\u201cThey ask for money. I said I don\u2019t have any money,\u201d she tearfully tells her sisters in a clip from the second episode. \u201cThey dragged me out on to the hallway on top of the stairs. That\u2019s when I saw the gun clear, like clear as day. I was kind of looking at the gun, looking down back at the stairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like; \u2018I have a split second in my mind to make this quick decision,\u2019 \u201d she recalls. \u201cAm I going to run down the stairs and either be shot in the back? It makes me so upset to think about it. Either they\u2019re going to shoot me in the back, or if I make it and they don\u2019t, if the elevator does not open in time, or the stairs are locked, then like I\u2019m f\u2014ed. There\u2019s no way out.\u201d\n\nWHY WASN\u2019T HER BODYGUARD THERE?\n\nThe No. 1 question that seemed to be on everyone\u2019s mind after reports of the star\u2019s terrifying ordeal broke seemed to be: Where was her (seemingly omnipresent) bodyguard when it happened?\n\nIn the days leading up to the robbery, Pascal Duvier was right by Kim\u2019s side on the streets of Paris \u2014 she even joked about him \u201calways being in my shot\u201d on Instagram \u2014 and helped thwart prankster Vitalii Sediuk after he attempted to grab the reality star on the street. So why wasn\u2019t he in her room the night of the robbery?\n\nHe was looking after Kim\u2019s sisters, Kourtney and Kendall, as they hit the town in Paris: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be that strange for Pascal to be dispatched to be with Kourtney or the other family members once Kim was \u2018safely\u2019 in her residence,\u201d a source close to the family told PEOPLE. \u201cAnd he regularly provides security for the whole family \u2014 not just Kim.\u201d\n\nImage zoom AKM-GSI\n\nAnd though there isn\u2019t much security on site at the hotel \u2014 \u201cAs I recall, there\u2019s a receptionist downstairs who buzzes you through the door in the courtyard and a nightman,\u201d a former guest told PEOPLE \u2014 Kim felt safe at the No Address Hotel, especially since her husband had maintained a semi-permanent residence there since at least 2011.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO HER BODYGUARD?\n\nIn the days following the robbery, questions arose surrounding Kim\u2019s lack of security \u2026 and the fate of family bodyguard Duvier. While a source told PEOPLE the Spain-born German bodyguard continued to work for them, they added that Duvier \u201cisn\u2019t irreplaceable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe family really likes him, but he is not a family member,\u201d said the insider. \u201cKanye is evaluating his family\u2019s needs. He is ultimately the one who decides what happens with Pascal.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Mehdi Taamallah/NurPhoto/Getty\n\nDuvier remained employed by the family directly after the incident, until Kim and Kanye parted ways with him one month after the robbery.\n\n\u201cPascal no longer works for Kim and Kanye, but he wasn\u2019t fired,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cHe instead reassigned himself to another family for professional reasons. Pascal thought that he did let down Kim and didn\u2019t do his job properly in Paris. They all agreed that it was better for Kim and Kanye to hire a completely new security team.\u201d\n\nDID SHE BEEF UP HER SECURITY TEAM AFTER THE INCIDENT?\n\nDefinitely \u2014 Kim significantly upped her security detail and a source close to the family revealed that she now has a \u201cmuch heavier security team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere will be a focus on security personal who aren\u2019t in traditional clothing,\u201d an insider told PEOPLE. \u201cThere will be a lot more undercover security.\u201d\n\nThe entire Kardashian-Jenner family also cut down on public appearances for a short time after Kim\u2019s ordeal, as well as upped their own security.\n\n\u201cWhen something like this happens, everything changes,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cIt changes the whole family \u2014 how and where they travel.\u201d\n\nHOW DID THE ROBBERS GET IN?\n\nThe thieves\u2019 first point of entry came via the concierge at the No Address, whom she described to police as eerily calm, according to a PEOPLE source. According to the insider, Kim told police the nightman was handcuffed when he opened the door to her apartment, he was present for the entire incident and even engaged in a conversation with her.\n\nAccording to the source, Kim told police the robbers took the concierge with them when they left and deposited him in the lobby with his hands still cuffed.\n\nHOW DID SHE MANAGE TO ESCAPE?\n\n\u201cThey put plastic ties around her wrists, but she managed to squeeze her hands out of the wrist ties by wriggling her hands,\u201d a source close to Kim told PEOPLE. After escaping, a second source told PEOPLE that Kim \u201cscreamed from the balcony\u201d for help.\n\nWAS ANYONE ELSE IN THE HOTEL WITH HER?\n\nThough Kim was alone in her hotel room \u2014 which she revealed when she Snapchatted herself FaceTiming brother Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna ahead of their baby shower \u2014 her good friend Harouche was in a nearby room during the ordeal.\n\nImage zoom Source: Kim Kardashian/Snapchat\n\n\u201cBy the time [Kim] escaped, Simone had heard noises,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe was downstairs and called Pascal not knowing what was going on, asking if everything was okay.\u201d\n\nHOW DID THE ROBBERS KNOW WHERE SHE WAS?\n\nIt\u2019s likely that the robbers, who were dressed as police officers when they broke into her room, had been tailing Kim before the crime. Sources confirmed to PEOPLE that authorities believe that they may have posed as paparazzi in order to keep her under surveillance in the days leading up to the attack.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s surrounded by paparazzi, any of whom could have given this information to others for a fee,\u201d Christopher Hagon, a managing partner at Incident Management Group, a Florida-based international security consulting firm, told PEOPLE. \u201cIt\u2019s either an inside job, or she\u2019s been under surveillance. I think it\u2019s a blend of [both].\u201d\n\nKim herself has also said she believes the perpetrators tracked her via social media.\n\n\u201cThere was probably a group of guys that were following us the entire trip,\u201d she says in an episode of the current season of KUWTK.\n\n\u201cI was Snapchatting that I was home and that everyone was going out,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I think they knew Pascal was out with Kourtney and that I was there by myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had to have known we were leaving that day,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey had this window of opportunity and just went for it.\u201d\n\nWHERE WERE HER KIDS?\n\nThankfully, North, 3, and Saint, 14 months, were not involved in the terrifying incident. In fact, North was in New York, where she saw the Broadway musical Matilda hours before Kim was robbed.\n\n\u201cShe was there with two other children, a nanny and a security person,\u201d a rep for the Shubert Organization, which owns and operates Broadway theaters, told PEOPLE. \u201cAfter the performance, they went backstage and met the children\u2019s ensemble and [the actress who played] Matilda \u2026 The kids were excited to meet her.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE LATEST IN THE INVESTIGATION?\n\nFrench police initially arrested 17 suspects in connection with the robbery across France on Jan. 9. Of the 17 arrested, 10 have been indicted and are now facing criminal charges.\n\nThe first four men were indicted on Jan. 12. The first, a 64-year-old man identified by Le Parisien/AFP, was charged with conspiracy and helping arrange the resale of stolen jewelry. His lawyer has denied any involvement of his client in the case.\n\nTwo more suspects, age 63 and 44, were indicted for conspiracy, robbery, kidnapping and forceable confinement. The 63-year-old suspect has been identified Yunice A., and the 44-year-old as Florus H.\n\nA fourth suspect, Gary M., age 27, identified as the younger brother of Kim\u2019s Paris chauffeur, also appeared before a French judge and was charged with assisting an armed robbery and kidnapping.\n\nFrench authorities indicted an additional six suspects on Jan. 13. \u2014 five men and one women, who happen to be the more senior members of the suspects, ranging in age from 44 to 72.\n\nOne was a man identified as Omar A., dubbed \u201cOmar the Old,\u201d whom authorities presume was the \u201cmastermind\u201d behind the robbery. Investigators reportedly suspect it was his DNA that was found on the scene on adhesive tape and a plastic tie used to restrain the star.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West\u2019s Shocking Ocean\u2019s Eight Cameo \u2014 Yes, There\u2019s a Jewelry Heist\n\nThe first lead French police had was a suspicious black car that was seen in the early hours of Monday morning circling the No Address.\n\nThe vehicle was caught on surveillance video from the Carel shop, which is located directly across from the hotel. A spokesperson from the business confirmed to PEOPLE that they turned the CCTV footage over to authorities immediately.\n\n\u201cThe police were there at 10 a.m. Monday morning, waiting for the employees to come open the shop,\u201d the employee at the firm\u2019s headquarters said. \u201cThey were canvassing the street and went directly in a backroom and viewed the tapes. We gave them over.\u201d\n\nThe Carel staffer also confirmed to PEOPLE that images of the footage obtained by British tabloids are accurate. They show the vehicle driving slowly past the hotel at 2:34 a.m., 2:45 a.m. and again at 2:54 a.m. Kim reportedly made a distress call for help from the balcony of her hotel and on the phone to Duvier at 2:56 a.m.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED TO HER JEWELRY?\n\nAccording to an expert, it\u2019s \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Kim will see any of the millions worth of jewelry that were stolen (including that $4 million ring) ever again.\n\n\u201cWhat happens next is that these thieves will bring the diamonds and jewelry to somebody they already have lined up before they did this job \u2014 a fence,\u201d said jewelry theft expert and co-author of Flawless: Inside the Largest Diamond Heist in History, Scott Selby. \u201cWhat happens after that is the fence will take apart this jewelry, so that loses value \u2013 and now you have all these separate stones.\u201d\n\nSelby revealed that the jewels will most likely be taken apart, with the metals and medium and small stones being sold on the black market, where they\u2019ll likely end up in Antwerp, Belgium\u2019s diamond district, within weeks.\n\nImage zoom Instagram\n\n\u201cDiamonds like that change hands five times in two days in Antwerp\u2019s diamond district,\u201d Selby said. \u201cNobody will ever know \u2026 They will be on the fingers of Americans within six months to a year.\u201d\n\nAs for the larger stones? \u201cYou have three choices,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could either hold on to it, you can sell it to a buyer who is fine with it being stolen \u2013 which is very hard to find \u2013 or you can change the stones to make them unrecognizable. Anybody in the trade would be able to tell that these were Kim Kardashian\u2019s diamonds.\u201d\n\nHOW DID HER FAMILY REACT?\n\nKim reunited with her husband in New York City after leaving Paris just hours after the ordeal, and she was soon joined by mother Kris Jenner and her boyfriend Corey Gamble. Both couples were escorted by massive security details back to their Manhattan apartment. Sister Kourtney, meanwhile, arrived back home in L.A. a few days later, where she was flanked by two security guards as she made her way through Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nImage zoom Sharky/Polite Paparazzi/SPLASH\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s family feels terrible about what happened to her,\u201d a source told PEOPLE, adding that husband West, 39, \u201cwanted to get to her as soon as he could.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told her that he couldn\u2019t care less about the jewelry; he\u2019s just thankful that she\u2019s okay,\u201d said the insider.\n\nBrother Rob, meanwhile, had been celebrating his baby shower with Chyna in L.A. Despite speaking with Kim directly before the incident, \u201cNo one at the party knew of anything that happened to Kim because everyone\u2019s phones were taken,\u201d said the source. Rob found out about the robbery afterward, and was \u201cextremely worried\u201d about his sister.\n\nHOW DID KIM REACT?\n\n\u201cKim couldn\u2019t wait to leave Paris,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe gave a statement to the police and left right after. She got robbed of her jewelry, but doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s just happy to be alive.\u201d\n\nIn the days directly following the heist, the reality star spent \u201call her time with kids and Kanye\u201d and attempted to keep things \u201cas normal as possible,\u201d a source close to the family told PEOPLE.\n\nAnother source also said the star \u201cbarely slept.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe had no anxiety medication or alcoholic drinks, as she doesn\u2019t do any of that stuff,\u201d said the insider. \u201cShe\u2019s just got comfort from being around her kids and friends. Her best friends rushed to her side: Jonathan Cheban, Simon Huck and La La Anthony. They have been her rocks.\u201d\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Kim was deeply shaken after the traumatic incident, and she went on to take a three-month hiatus from the public eye and social media. She has since stepped back into the spotlight and returned to social media on Jan. 6. In the months since, she\u2019s gradually become more comfortable being photographed and attending events.\n\nImage zoom Rob Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock (\n\nOver Martin Luther King, Jr. weekend, Kim traveled to Dubai where she made her first official public appearance since the incident on Jan. 13, at her longtime makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic\u2018s Masterclass.\n\n\u201cKim is starting to act more relaxed about public outings,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cShe still uses a bodyguard every day, but isn\u2019t hiding. She lets herself be photographed. She seems more comfortable. She acted much more nervous right after the robbery.\u201d\n\nDID CUTTING BACK AFFECT HER INCOME?\n\nAfter the incident, Kim suspended all of her commitments indefinitely and a financial expert estimated that she would likely lose some substantial income \u2014 maybe more than \u201c$1 million a month\u201d in growth.\n\nCelebrity financial adviser Samuel Rad told PEOPLE that Kim\u2019s \u201coverall brand is generating at least $1 million a month through just general posts, not including anything that\u2019s specifically being contracted with companies,\u201d which is separate from special event appearances where he estimates she rakes in between $200,000 to $300,000.\n\nRad also estimated that her personal, non-ad-related posts \u201care worth at least $20,000 a piece to her overall brand.\u201d\n\nHe speculated, however, that \u201cif Kim positions herself correctly [on her return], she can have a real blockbuster media score.\u201d\n\nWHAT DID IT ALL MEAN FOR KUWTK?\n\nE! initially halted production on KUWTK in the wake of the incident. \u201cKim\u2019s well-being is our core focus right now,\u201da spokesperson from the network said in a statement to PEOPLE the week of the robbery. \u201cNo decision has been made as to when production will resume.\u201d\n\nWhile two sources told PEOPLE that filming continued with other family members, Kim didn\u2019t resume filming until three weeks after the incident. The incident will be heavily covered on the current season 13.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in February, Kim\u2019s mom Kris said returning to the show helped her daughter heal from the \u201cdevastating\u201d incident.\n\n\u201cWhen we started filming again and getting up and running, obviously Kim was around because we all practically live together on the same street,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started filming and what was coming out of that was very therapeutic for her, I think \u2014 to just explain to us and walk us through.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian also touched on the family\u2019s decision to include the incident on their reality show during an interview with PEOPLE Now in January.\n\n\u201cWell, we are damned if we do and damned if we don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are so vulnerable and [have opened] up our lives so much in the past that interestingly enough, if we don\u2019t show things fans get really angry \u2014 they feel as if that was taken away from them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I think for Kim, it was maybe therapeutic for her,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s also something that disgustingly happens to a lot of other people and we always come from a place of honesty.\u201d", "images":
