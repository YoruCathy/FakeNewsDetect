But the 20-year-old beauty mogul had the most to say about little Stormi. She told Kardashian all about what surprised her most about motherhood and even admitted that she likes changing her daughter\u2019s diapers.\n\n\u201cI think more about the future because of her. Every time I leave and I\u2019m stressed about leaving her, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m doing it for you,\u2019\u201d Jenner said. \u201cEveryone says you change completely when you become a mom, but I really feel the same, just better. So I don\u2019t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s only gotten better. You\u2019re less selfish \u2014 and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It\u2019s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don\u2019t know, the whole thing is really\u2026 it\u2019s like such an amazing experience.\u201d\n\nScott and Jenner, who are currently on vacation together, celebrated their daughter\u2019s three-month birthday on Tuesday, sharing an adorable photo on Instagram.\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 8:46pm PDT\n\nJenner noted in the interview that she and Travis were originally thinking of just going with the name \u201cStorm\u201d instead of \u201cStormi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know how we thought of Storm. Her dad insisted it was him, but I feel like it was me. And that kind of just stuck with us,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAnd then I didn\u2019t really like just Storm \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel like that was her name. So then it became Stormi,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cAnd it just stuck. I feel like there were a lot of other names that I might have even liked better, to be honest, but I feel like Stormi picked her own name, like it was just her name.\u201d\n\nJenner said that being a new mom has \u201cbeen so amazing\u201d and \u201cso much fun\u201d but she admitted things can sometimes be difficult.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m learning so much more about myself and life, and it\u2019s been such a great experience,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s hard times and stuff \u2026 even in the beginning, just not sleeping, the nights, like, baby blues \u2026 and all the ups and downs.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 11:12am PDT\n\nStormi Webster was born on Feb. 1, weighing 8 lbs., 9 oz. She is the first child for both Jenner and Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster.\n\n\u201cPregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life-changing experience I\u2019ve had in my entire life and I\u2019m actually going to miss it,\u201d Jenner said in an statement a few days after giving birth. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst!\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 12:30pm PDT", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9950b81e000008087ad4a7.png?cache=fzddhpeutn&ops=1778_1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae9d13d1a00002700cdd75d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5df70b30240000840a5a35d7.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9950b81e000008087ad4a7.png?cache=fzddhpeutn&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kylie-jenner-new-mom-changing-diapers_n_5ae9c564e4b06748dc8e6ed4", "title": "New Mom Kylie Jenner Explains Why She Loves Changing Diapers", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The 20-year-old also spoke about the \"baby blues\" and the \"ups and downs\" of parenting.", "keywords": "Celebrities,Parenting ,kim kardashian,Kylie Jenner, travis scott", "og": {"title": "New Mom Kylie Jenner Explains Why She Loves Changing Diapers", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9950b81e000008087ad4a7.png?cache=fzddhpeutn&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9950b81e000008087ad4a7.png?cache=fzddhpeutn&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kylie-jenner-new-mom-changing-diapers_n_5ae9c564e4b06748dc8e6ed4", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The 20-year-old also spoke about the \"baby blues\" and the \"ups and downs\" of parenting."}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,Parenting ,kim kardashian,Kylie Jenner, travis scott", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-05-02 13:05:16 -0400", "modified_time": "2018-05-02 13:05:16 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "New Mom Kylie Jenner Explains Why She Loves Changing Diapers", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9950b81e000008087ad4a7.png?cache=fzddhpeutn&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The 20-year-old also spoke about the \"baby blues\" and the \"ups and downs\" of parenting.", "creator": "ledbettercarly"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5ae9c564e4b06748dc8e6ed4", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525280716.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
