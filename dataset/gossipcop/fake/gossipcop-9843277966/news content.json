The same source also alleged that they are considering getting hitched in Paris, with her BFF Zac Posen designing her wedding dress and only 30 guests on the RSVP list.\n\nThere is one only one other major person involved in the potential wedding, and it just happens to be Katie\u2019s daughter Suri! \u201cSuri is Katie\u2019s top priority, and she wouldn\u2019t think about getting married unless she was sure it would last,\u201d the insider said. \u201cJamie has become really close to Suri over the past few years, and she truly sees him as a father figure, so thankfully she was over the moon when her mom told her.\u201d Suri\u2019s involvement is fairly massive, as she has not only signed off on \u201cthe cake, floral d\u00e9cor and the dress,\u201d according to the insider, but she\u2019s also serving as Katie\u2019s \u201cmaid of honor!\u201d\n\nA source has also revealed to OK! that her famous ex, Tom Cruise, has actually given the nuptials his seal of approval. \u201cIt\u2019s been nearly six years since their divorce and Tom has put hard feelings behind him,\u201d noted the insider. \u201cHe knows Jamie\u2019s a good guy and he\u2019s comfortable with him being around Suri.\u201d\n\nThough she wasn\u2019t waiting or expecting anything from her ex, the source adds that his blessing has given her the confidence she needs to move forward. \u201cShe feels she\u2019s finally where she\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d shared the source. \u201cKatie and Jamie have been through a lot. Now they\u2019re ready to spend their lives together.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above! Do you think Jamie and Katie will make it official by the end of the year?
