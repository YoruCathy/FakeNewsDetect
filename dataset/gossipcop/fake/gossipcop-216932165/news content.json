This is \u2014 according to New Idea\u2019s unnamed source \u2014 part of a larger \u201cbattle brewing between Angelina Jolie and Amal Clooney, with both stars desperate to befriend [Markle].\u201d Which is pretty awesome considering that less than two years ago, MM was about a thousand ranks below either woman on the celebrity power ladder (and they say the British class system doesn\u2019t allow for upward mobility). But is it true?\n\nThe smell test: Eau de stinky kippers wafts intensely around this story, which doesn\u2019t even bother to explain why Jolie might have hoped to score a wedding invite. (If she has ever met Meghan Markle before, the Internet doesn\u2019t know about it.) Is it plausible that Angelina is interested in meeting with the newly powerful Duchess of Sussex to discuss their shared passions for human rights and social justice? Well sure, but that\u2019s hardly evidence of a feud. As for the alleged friction between Angie and Amal, that (probably false) narrative has been around for a while now, stemming from the fact that Brad Pitt got George in the divorce.\n\nThe rumour: Protestors will greet the Queen and Meghan Markle on their first royal overnight trip\n\nWhere you heard it: The Express\n\nThe report: First of all, can we just discuss the fact that Meghan and the Queen are going on their first ever sleepover so soon? People magazine has reported that Her Majesty wants to take a \u201csteadying hand\u201d with her new granddaughter-in-law to ensure the dignity of the monarchy remains intact, but isn\u2019t it also possible that they unlikely duo are new BFFs who can\u2019t get enough of hanging out and talking about their dogs? Anyway \u2014 back to the protest. According to The Express, a group that calls itself the Scrap Mersey Tolls has changed the date of a previously scheduled demonstration in Cheshire in order to coincide with the royal visit on June 14th. The reason for the protest is the plan to implement tolls on the new Mersey Gateway Bridge, which Her Majesty is there to open. (Awkwaaaaaaard).\n\nThe smell test: A post on the Scrap Mersey Tolls Facebook page proves that this story is legit, if a little overblown, given that so far only six people have confirmed they will be attending the protest (two others are \u201cinterested\u201d). At best a bit of a bloody nuisance, perhaps, but nothing that Thelma and Louise The Queen and The Duchess of Sussex can\u2019t handle.\n\nThe rumour: Meghan Markle has sparked a freckle tattoo trend\n\nSubscribe To Our Newsletters \u2014 And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your InboxWhere you heard it: Elle UK\n\nThe report: The \u201cMeghan Markle Effect\u201d has thus far been used to describe MM\u2019s considerable influence on all things fashion, style and messy bun. And now it appears the Duchess\u2019s signature sun spots are on the \u201cthings to covet\u201d list, so much so that semi-permanent freckle tattoos are a hot new beauty treatment.\n\nThe smell test: There is no question that freckled faces have a powerful ambassador in the newest royal, who has made a point of rejecting any attempts to airbrush her natural complexion. Semi-permanent tattooing may sound a bit extreme, but hey, so are a lot of the over-the-top beauty trends we hear about these days (semen facials, anyone?). The Elle story quotes an interview with an American tattoo artist (and \u201ctattoo freckle pro\u201d) who says she has been \u201ccrazy busy\u201d keeping up with demand following the royal wedding. Note that the whole process takes only an hour, and lasts up to three years, which is either a pro or a con depending on how quickly you wish you had just bought a brown eyeliner and created fake freckles DIY-style.\n\nThe rumour: Meghan and Harry want kids \u201cright away\u201d\n\nWhere you heard it: Us Weekly\n\nThe report: First comes love, then comes royal wedding, then comes \u2026 well, you know where this is going. Sighting \u201cmultiple sources,\u201d Us reports that Meghan\u2019s biological clock has been ticking loudly since the wedding. \u201cShe and Harry want to start a family right away \u2014 and she\u2019ll start trying as soon as she can,\u201d says one source, with the others making similar assertions. (One adds that MM\u2019s mom, Doria Ragland, expects to be a grandma by this time next year.)\n\nThe smell test: Isn\u2019t this kind of a non-story story? As we royal rumour watchers are well aware, both the Duke and Duchess have been vocal about their desire to start a family, so it\u2019s not like there was any big question mark. That, plus the fact that Meghan turns 37 in a couple of months, make the quick focus on family planning more of a foregone conclusion than a gossipy reveal. As for whether Doria will be a granny by next summer \u2014 that\u2019s really more of a matter for Mother Nature. (The only woman we can think of who may be more powerful than Her Majesty.)", "images": ["https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/themes/chatelaine.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-relationship-timeline-2.jpg", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/close.png", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Amal-clooney-george-meghan-markle-prince-harry-wedding.jpg", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Amal-Clooney-Meghan-Markle-Angelina-Jolie-12.00.25-PM.jpg", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/amal-meghan-angelina-social.jpeg", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/info.png"], "top_img": "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/amal-meghan-angelina-social.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courtney Shea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chatelaine.com/living/entertainment/meghan-amal-angelina-feud/", "title": "Is Meghan Markle At The Centre Of A Feud Between Amal Clooney And Angelina Jolie?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Is Meghan Markle At The Centre Of A Feud Between Amal Clooney And Angelina Jolie?\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.chatelaine.com\\/living\\/entertainment\\/meghan-amal-angelina-feud\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2018-06-07 13:24:14\",\"mod_date\":\"2018-06-07 13:52:13\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"512951\",\"author_id\":\"696252\",\"author_name\":\"Carley Fortune\",\"author_display_name\":\"Carley Fortune\",\"tags\":[\"Angelina Jolie\",\"Editor&#039;s Picks\",\"entertainment\",\"Meghan Markle\",\"Royals\"],\"categories\":[\"Entertainment\",\"Facebook Instant Articles\"],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/www.chatelaine.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2018\\/06\\/Amal-Clooney-Meghan-Markle-Angelina-Jolie-12.00.25-PM.jpg\",\"image_alt\":\"Amal Clooney, Meghan Markle and Angelina Jolie.
