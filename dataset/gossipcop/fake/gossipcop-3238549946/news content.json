Superman\u201d actor is dragging his feet because he would like to get back together with Garner, with whom he has three children.\n\nIf this description of Affleck is close to accurate, he could be the Oscar-winning, movie star version of \u201cBachelor\u201d star Arie Luyendyk Jr., who angered Bachelor Nation and the rest of America by vacillating between two women in the show\u2019s final episodes.\n\nFor her part, Garner really tried to make things work with Affleck \u2014 despite his reported struggles with alcohol addiction, gambling and monogamy, according to Us Weekly.\n\nThis fall, Affleck also had a dark cloud hanging over him following news about multiple sexual misconduct allegations against his regular producing collaborator Harvey Weinstein. In the wake of the Weinstein allegations and the launch of the #MeToo movement, Affleck was accused of groping two women and of being complicit in a Hollywood culture that allows sexually predatory men to stay in power.\n\nAfter Garner and Affleck first announced their split in 2015, the \u201cAlias\u201d actress \u201cput her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and wanted so desperately to turn things around for the children\u2019s sake as well as theirs,\u201d a source told Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cShe forgave him for so much, and still he couldn\u2019t change,\u201d the source said.\n\nIn the year since they filed for divorce, Affleck begged Garner to come back several times, even after he had officially moved on with Shookus. \u201cHe had at one point been telling friends he wanted his ex back,\u201d a source told the magazine.\n\nAffleck apparently was saying such things even after he and Shookus started being photographed together in New York City or Los Angeles. In November, Affleck reportedly introduced Shookus to Garner as a step to getting her comfortable with his children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck and Shookus also were spotted house-hunting together in the Los Angeles area over Valentine\u2019s Day, various reports said.\n\nStill, Affleck and Garner have continued to be seen in public together, attending church or taking the kids to school \u2014 though these joint appearances could simply be part of their vow to be hands-on co-parents.\n\nThe new Us Weekly report claims that there was a slim chance that the two could have reconciled in late 2017, after Affleck returned to rehab and re-dedicated himself to his recovery.\n\nAccording to reports in November, two-time rehab veteran Affleck realized he was \u201closing his grip on his alcohol addiction.\u201d\n\nAffleck poured out his heart to Garner, \u201ctelling her everything that was going on with his life,\u201d a source told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cAfter everything they\u2019ve been through, she is going to continue to be there for him when he needs her,\u201d the source told Us Weekly in November. \u201cNo matter what the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThose circumstances include all the \u201csmoking and drinking and gambling\u201d that apparently took place during the marriage \u2014 as well as Affleck possibly cheating on Garner with Shookus when they were married and reportedly dating their children\u2019s 28-year-old nanny Christine Ouzounian after they first announced their split in 2015.\n\nThe new Us Weekly report said that Garner visited her estranged husband every day while he was in rehab.\n\n\u201cThey did family counseling to work on their relationship,\u201d an insider told the magazine. \u201cThings looked positive. Jennifer was very caring, very present. They both wanted it to work.\u201d\n\nBut another source told Us Weekly that Affleck is, in fact, ready to move on and be with Shookus, whom he \u201cloves and adores.\u201d\n\nCertainly, geography could make that relationship challenging as Shookus lives in New York City, where she works and raises a son, while Affleck is committed to being close to his children, who are based in Los Angeles.\n\nThe website Gossip Cop quoted other sources \u201cclose\u201d to the couple who slammed the Us Weekly report, saying that the story actually makes clear that the two aren\u2019t reuniting, but teases the idea that they might. A contact close to the situation told Gossip Cop: \u201c(The cover) is not true. There\u2019s no reconciliation and they are in (the middle of) finalizing the divorce.\u201d\n\nAnother friend of Affleck and Garner told Gossip Cop that the exes are \u201cboth working hard to create the best relationship for the kids.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Us Weekly story said that Garner has quietly begun dating again, though that included going out with a man who is described as looking something like Affleck.\n\n\u201cJen is ready to go with her feelings and give love another try,\u201d a friend told Us Weekly.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/garneraffleck111.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emmysshookus.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/garneraffleck172.jpg?w=1024&h=803", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/garneraffleck172.jpg?w=1024&h=803", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
