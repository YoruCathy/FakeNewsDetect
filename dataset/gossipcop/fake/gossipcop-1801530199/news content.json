As many have learned, dating one of these sisters puts you under a microscope, leaving all your personal drama out for the world to scrutinize.\n\nJust ask Tristan Thompson, Khlo\u00e9\u2019s current boyfriend. We all know a whole lot about how he\u2019s allegedly neglecting his new kid to hang out with her. I suppose it takes a certain resilience to handle that level of attention. One of Khlo\u00e9\u2019s exes explained why he decided \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d to joining the gossip mill.\n\nSports Illustrated interviewed Houston Rockets baller James Harden for their March 6 issue. Harden and Khlo\u00e9 dated for about 8 months in 2015 but broke it off. In the interview, Harden doesn\u2019t say much about his relationship, but he does explain why living that tabloid life wasn\u2019t for him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like all the attention,\u201d said Harden, \u201cI feel like it was for no reason. I wasn\u2019t getting anything out of it except my name out there and my face out there, and I don\u2019t need that. It wasn\u2019t uncomfortable, but it wasn\u2019t me. I don\u2019t need pictures of myself when I\u2019m driving my car. Who cares? What shoes am I wearing? Who cares? Where am I eating? Who cares? It was unnecessary stuff that I think trickled down to my teammates. I had to eliminate that.\u201d\n\nOh my god! He doesn\u2019t care what shoes he\u2019s wearing? This guy is definitely not Mr. Kardashian material. Luckily, he seems to have quite a career going on and hopefully also some less public love in his life.\n\n[Photos: Getty]", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/field_blog_image/2017/03/james_harden.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/styles/promo-takeover--newsletter/public/2016/10/ctw_nl-495x495.jpg?itok=BOX2VM2O", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/styles/microsite-logo--mobile-1_5x/public/very-real-logo.png?itok=4qwvC6t7&timestamp=1432814811", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2015/12/khloemain.jpg?itok=ov2wM1xH&timestamp=1449254658", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2015/11/khloemain_0.jpg?itok=xUYL8bWc&timestamp=1447963765", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/styles/embedded-related-post__1_5x/public/john_daryn_promo.jpg?itok=B3zGw6f8", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/themes/custom/oxygen/images/transp-bg-60-black.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/field_blog_image/2017/03/james_harden.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aim\u00e9e Lutkin"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201/http://www.oxygen.com/very-real/khloe-kardashians-ex-james-harden-explains-why-dating-her-sucked", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Ex James Harden Explains Why Dating Her Sucked", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"app_id": 282902305377590}, "og": {"site_name": "Oxygen Official Site", "type": "article", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Ex James Harden Explains Why Dating Her Sucked", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201/http://www.oxygen.com/very-real/khloe-kardashians-ex-james-harden-explains-why-dating-her-sucked", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian sure likes dating athletes, but not all of them are the right fit for the Kardashian family.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/field_blog_image/2017/03/james_harden.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@oxygen", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/very-real/khloe-kardashians-ex-james-harden-explains-why-dating-her-sucked", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Ex James Harden Explains Why Dating Her Sucked", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian sure likes dating athletes, but not all of them are the right fit for the Kardashian family.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170301224201im_/http://www.oxygen.com/sites/nbcuoxygen/files/field_blog_image/2017/03/james_harden.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-01T11:06:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-01T11:07:37-05:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488384360.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
