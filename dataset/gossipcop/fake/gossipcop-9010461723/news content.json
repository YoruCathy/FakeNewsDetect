But differentiating between the two things is just splitting hairs, right?\n\nLaura told the Sunday People, \u2018People think I\u2019m crazy, but my flat-pack R-Patz is the closest I\u2019ll get to the real thing and he\u2019s the one for me.\u2019\n\n\n\nLauren paid $20 for her 2-D husband whom she married in a Las Vegas chapel back in January in front of 50 guests. \u2018The day cost \u00a32,000 but I didn\u2019t care \u2013 I wanted to do it properly.\u2019\n\nJust like any newlyweds, the two headed off on a honeymoon afterwards. The couple chose Los Angeles as a destination where Laura was keen to climb up to the Hollywood sign. \u2018I had to carry him, and we had to do it at night because he can\u2019t be in the sun, but everyone makes sacrifices for the man they love, right?\u2019 Right.\n\nWhile we\u2019re totally on board with doing whatever makes you happy \u2013 even if that something is marrying a cardboard version of a fictional character \u2013 there\u2019s a few questions that this story\u2019s left us asking.\n\n\n\nFor instance:\n\nGoing out\n\nAccording to Laura, she regularly takes Edward out to bars where she orders him a beer, and her a gin and tonic. Which is cool and all, but what happens to the beer? Is Laura forced to drink it herself, therefore getting doubly drunk? Or does she pour it down a little hole she\u2019s made in Edward\u2019s mouth, drying his soggy lips off under the handdryer afterwards?\n\nSustainability\n\nBeing the proud owners of a Henry VIII cutout (not even joking), myself and my housemates are basically experts in the lifecycle of such a product, and let me tell you right now, cardboard is not the most substantial of materials. Damp, open flames and general roughhousing have not been kind to Henry and he\u2019s not even a cutout that\u2019s allowed outside. Laura takes Edward on real-life holidays \u2013 how much more of a shelf-life can her husband have? Does Laura replace him every three months? Has she covered him in some form of protective laminate material?\n\nIdentity\n\nWhile the cutout is of Robert Pattison playing Edward Cullen in one of the Twilight films (sorry I don\u2019t know which one. I got halfway into the whole werewolf/vampire bro-off and couldn\u2019t handle the angst), Laura refers to it (him?) as \u2018R-Patz\u2019 therefore prompting the question; is she in love with Robert or Edward? Or an amalgamation of the two? Are they even different people? Or is Robert Pattinson actually a vampire? Might explain some things.\n\nEr, bonking\n\nSorry to take this to the lowest common denominator but have the two ever consummated their marriage? Is this something that can happen with a cardboard cutout? And if so, how? Is it any good?\n\nHusbandly duties\n\nWhile cardboard isn\u2019t heavy, six feet of it is awkward to carry around. Will Laura ever get annoyed with her husband's lack of mobility? Is there some sort of system she can rig up with a skateboard \u2013 like those dogs that lose their back legs \u2013 that means she doesn\u2019t have to carry him everywhere? More importantly, without the ability to speak, walk or think, he\u2019s kind of useless as a husband. How\u2019s he going to bring home the bacon? Provide kids? Fix the Netflix when the SCART lead comes unplugged?\n\nGoing forward\n\nPerhaps our biggest question about this whole story is: doesn\u2019t Laura deserve better? She seems like a nice girl. She\u2019s certainly inventive, media savvy and has no qualms about going out and getting exactly what she wants. So what\u2019s she doing with someone (thing?) that can\u2019t tell her how great she is every day? Our advice to Laura? Give old R-Patz the ceremonial bonfire of a goodbye he deserves and get yourself on Tinder.\n\nI mean, really\n\nLike this?
