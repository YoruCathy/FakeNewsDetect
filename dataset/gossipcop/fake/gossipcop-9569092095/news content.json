After leaving rude comments on Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s Instagram, we\u2019re hearing he\u2019ll do anything \u2018to get on her good side again\u2019\n\nYounes Bendjima, 25, has been in the doghouse ever since he left a snarky comment on Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s instagram, insinuating that his girlfriend was thirsty for likes. The comment threw their relationship into a tailspin, and Younes is willing to do what it takes to set things right. \u201cYounes is desperate to fix things with Kourtney after his regretful and rude comment,\u201d a source close to Younes shares EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife.com. \u201cThings between the two have been tense ever since his dumb Instagram remark and he wants to fix things.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com, \u201che has been travelling.\u201d While Younes has been off in Europe, the source says he\u2019s struggled to stay connected with his girlfriend during this time. While he\u2019s physically distant from his girl, he\u2019s been working on closing the emotional distance that opened up between them after he got rude on IG. \u201cHe has been apologizing, sending her sweet texts and flowers to let her know that he is sorry for the foolish remark,\u201d the insider says. \u201cBut it is impossible to make things right with her while he is on the road.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe feels horrible because he really loves her and doesn\u2019t want to lose her over the impulsive comment he regrets,\u201d the insider added. \u201cBut he feels like things have changed between them and he wants to get back to her ASAP to get on her good side again or he fears he may lose her forever.\u201d For those who forgot: Kourt uploaded a picture of her in a thong-bikini on July 16, showing off her bare butt and killer figure. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to show to get likes?\u201d Younes asked, pretty much calling her thirsty for all to see.\n\nSuddenly, Kourt is looking at Kylie Jenner\u2019s relationship with Travis Scott with envy in her eyes, while Scott Disick was reveling in the drama. Younes tried to play nice when she posted a picture of herself showing off some leg while lying in bed. Yet, when Kourt\u2019s bestie Simon Huck rolled his eyes at the comment, Younes said he was just trying to \u201cplay around fam.\u201d Hmm. Perhaps Younes should give serious thought to deleting his account \u2013 or, at least, stay out of the comments section.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F24%2Fyounes-bendjima-desperate-fix-kourtney-kardashian-relationship%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3251347", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/younes_kourt_ig-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/younes_kourt_ig-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/younes_kourt_ig-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/24/younes-bendjima-desperate-fix-kourtney-kardashian-relationship/", "title": "Younes Bendjima \u2018Desperate\u2019 To Fix Things With Kourtney Kardashian After \u2018Rude\u2019 IG Comment", "meta_data": {"description": "After screwing things up by leaving a rude comment on Kourtney Kardashian's instagram, Younes Bendjima is 'desperate' to fix it!", "news_keywords": "Kourtney Kardashian, Younes Bendjima", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Younes Bendjima \u2018Desperate\u2019 To Fix Things With Kourtney Kardashian After \u2018Rude\u2019 IG Comment", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/24/younes-bendjima-desperate-fix-kourtney-kardashian-relationship/", "description": "At this point, should Younes Bendjima just delete his account?
