That\u2019s the alarming claim being made in a recent article in The National Inquirer. According to the Enquirer, Brad has been living the \u201chippy\u201d lifestyle, refusing to take showers and change his clothes as he continues to get over his divorce from Angelina Jolie and the separation from his children. He has also allegedly been sleeping on friends\u2019 couches because he\u2019s afraid that if he remains home alone, he will relapse into addiction.\n\nBut Gossip Cop, a site that\u2019s become known for debunking celebrity rumors has said the report smells just as fishy as they claim Brad Pitt smells.\n\n\u201cBrad\u2019s gone days, if not weeks, at a time without taking a shower, so of course he stinks of body odor a lot of the time,\u201d an alleged close friend of the War Machine actor reportedly told The National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.\n\nBut Gossip Cop has a different story that they claim they received from someone who is actually in Pitt\u2019s inner circle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re told Pitt isn\u2019t living the lifestyle of a smelly drifter, and the claim otherwise is completely bogus,\u201d Gossip Cop states.\n\nThe latest report in the ongoing Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie saga is that Brad Pitt was \u201callowed\u201d to see his children to celebrate Father\u2019s Day.\n\nBrad Pitt in America's national parks. 3 different covers.
