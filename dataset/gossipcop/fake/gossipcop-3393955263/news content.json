Do you see anything different?\" she asked, as Blake caught sight of the towering pole, with the U.S. flag raised high.\n\nThe pop star then uploaded a clip of Blake standing beneath the pole with his cap held over his heart, as she giggled in the background.\n\n\"Blake's (birthday) day present from, me!! #flag #pole,\" she captioned a shot of her patriotic man.\n\nShelton also received a huge cake moulded into the shape of a vodka bottle from his own Smithworks brand.\n\nOpening the cooler to reveal the sweet treat, he exclaimed, \"What in the world is that? Wow, look at that!\"\n\n\"Thank you Smithworks family, it's the greatest birthday cake ever!,\" he added in another video, before taking a bite right out of the neck of the edible bottle.\n\nThe group went on to enjoy some time frolicking on Blake's boat, before capping off the night with a big meal at home, hosted by Gwen.\n\n\"B day dinner for my boo (sic),\" she wrote as she showed off the table setting.\n\nThe couple has been splitting its time between Gwen's home in Los Angeles and Blake's pad in Oklahoma ever since the stars started dating in the summer of 2015, following the breakdown of their respective marriages.\n\nBlake divorced fellow country musician Miranda Lambert after four years as husband and wife, while Gwen split from rocker Gavin Rossdale, the father of her three boys, after 13 years of marriage.", "images": ["http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gwen_stefani_gifts_blake_shelton_a_flagpole_for_his_birthday-620x620.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gifs_24-100x100.gif", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/daily-morning-awesomeness-38-photos-33-47-300x225.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/john_krasinski_in_talks_with_marvel_over_future_projects_-_report-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/dolly_parton_warns_love_island_star_men_will_ruin_her_career-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/crabs-try-to-sneak-past-customs-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586884629_iyrgj4t638-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02d3a502f5c2bc4267e8c0f3382212c0_width-600-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/miley_cyrus_took_control_of_publicity_during_kaitlynn_carter_relationship-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hogan-the-cat-hates-vacuums-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/images/widget-arrow.png", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rollerblading-front-flip-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/images/logo.png", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/robot-vacuum-fed-up-with-quarant-300x225.jpg", "https://x.castanet.net/TotalRestorationKelowna/19-05/display/TotalRestoration-Smoke-Man-MR2.gif", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1586884591_py2y2mn5jq-225x300.jpg", "http://thetango.net/images/logo_white.png", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/princes_siblings_denied_estate_payout-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tiger_king_star_joe_exotics_pink_shirt_up_for_auction_on_ebay-100x100.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6034663&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shrub-squirrel-takes-a-treat-100x100.jpg", "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/duck-chases-owner-then-acts-casu-100x100.jpg"], "top_img": "http://thetango.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gwen_stefani_gifts_blake_shelton_a_flagpole_for_his_birthday-620x620.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://thetango.net/2018/06/20/gwen-stefani-gifts-blake-shelton-a-flagpole-for-his-birthday/", "title": "Gwen Stefani gifts Blake Shelton a flagpole for his birthday", "meta_data": {"description": "Gwen Stefani surprised her singer boyfriend Blake Shelton on Monday\u00a0by unveiling a new flagpole on his Oklahoma ranch for his 42nd birthday.
