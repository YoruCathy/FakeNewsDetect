Only a man aka Brendan Tighe would come up with a crazy story like that.\u201d\n\nBut the 2012 Vanity Fair report confirms the essence of Tighe\u2019s assertion. The story said that Cruise had attempted to entice several of beautiful, well-known women to accept his devotion to Scientology \u2014 and Johansson was one of them.\n\nFilm industry reports from 2005 also questioned why Johansson had been dropped from co-starring with Cruise in \u201cMission: Impossible III.\u201d\n\nThe actress told the media at the time that she had been attached to Cruise\u2019s film, but said \u201cscheduling conflicts\u201d came up. She wanted to work with Woody Allen on his 2006 film \u201cScoop,\u201d after working with Allen on his critically acclaimed \u201cMatch Point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have a big production like (\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d), they can\u2019t move stuff around that easily,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI wanted to work with Woody so, unfortunately, that was a casualty, I guess.\u201d\n\nBut another report from 2005 suggests that there were other conflicts as well, and they had to do with Cruise\u2019s personal interests in Johannson. Today.com, citing a report from RadarMagazine.com, said Cruise invited Johannson to the Scientology center where he showed her literature about joining his controversial self-styled religious organization.\n\n\u201cAfter two hours of proselytizing, Cruise opened a door to reveal a second room full of upper-level Scientologists who had been waiting to dine with the pair,\u201d RadarMagazine.com reported. At that point, \u201cthe cool-headed ing\u00e9nue politely excused herself,\u201d the magazine said.\n\nIn his interview with Kelly, Tighe said he was certain he saw Johansson\u2019s name in one of the reports from Tommy Davis.\n\nThe other thing he said about the supposed audition of Johansson is that \u201cit didn\u2019t go well\u201d because she wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship with Cruise.\n\nAs a result, another actress and known Scientology member Erika Christensen \u201chad to disconnect from Johansson because (the audition) didn\u2019t go well,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cThat was in that report.\u201d\n\nScientology also issued a response to Tighe\u2019s claim regarding his association with Cruise, 55. Karin Pouw, from the Church of Scientology International, told Kelly: \u201cBrendan Tighe was a Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization security guard/night watchman from 2002 to 2009. The \u2018access\u2019 he boasts of having was largely limited to viewing security cameras from a guard booth. He was removed from that position for dereliction of duty.\u201d\n\nTighe disputed Scientology\u2019s record of his service with the organization, saying it wasn\u2019t \u201ceven remotely\u201d true. He said he was on night duty only from 2002 to 2004, then worked a day shift. He also said he wasn\u2019t removed from the job. \u201cI got fed up with the job and walked away,\u201d he told Kelly.\n\nIn another portion of the interview, Tighe said that Cruise and another high-profile Scientology member John Travolta didn\u2019t get along. That\u2019s because Travolta, whom he called \u201ca very nice guy,\u201d was annoyed that Cruise surpassed him in the church\u2019s hierarchy.\n\n\u201cThey would keep as far apart from each other as possible,\u201d Tighe said. \u201cThey could be in the same building and pass each other in the hall and give each other the cold shoulder. Honestly, it was quite jarring.\u201d\n\nTighe said the tension between the two A-list stars became especially apparently after the organization recognized Cruise as its most dedicated member by giving him with its Freedom Medal of Valor award in 2008. Before that, Travolta was known as the top disseminator of information about Scientology to the general public. But with the award, \u201cCruise bumped him out of that spot,\u201d Tighe said.\n\nTighe told Kelly he has documentation to back up his claims about Cruise and Scientology.\n\nHe also told Kelly that he owes his shiny white teeth to Cruise. \u201cDuring those years, we had to get our teeth whitened,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had anything to do with his service, we had to be seen by a dentist and undergo a full dental program.\u201d\n\nAs for the reported audition process for actresses to date Cruise, Vanity Fair reported in 2012 that the organization selected Nazanin Boniadi, an Iranian-born, London-raised actress to develop a relationship with the actor. Boniadi and Cruise dated from November 2004 until January 2005.\n\nFor their first date, Boniadi was flown to New York where she and Cruise and Boniadi went to dinner at Nobu with an entourage of Scientology aides, then to the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, which was otherwise closed to the public. The two stayed at future President Donald Trump\u2019s Trump Tower, where Cruise and his entourage rented an entire floor. But they didn\u2019t have sex that night.\n\nBoniadi felt she was being as though she was being set up for an arranged marriage with Cruise.\n\nCruise purportedly told her, \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way before.\u201d Their first month together was \u201cbliss,\u201d Boniadi told Vanity Fair. But eventually, she displeased Cruise because she was overwhelmed by the intensity of his affections, including his penchant for public displays, according to Vanity Fair. She also ran afoul of Scientology leader David Miscavige, a close Cruise friend, because she couldn\u2019t keep up with his rapid speaking style while entertaining him at Cruise\u2019s home in Telluride.\n\nCruise and Holmes began dating in April 2005 and married in November 2006 after their daughter Suri was born. They divorced in 2012, reportedly because Holmes didn\u2019t want their daughter raised in the Church of Scientology.\n\nThis story has been updated to include additional details from reports from Vanity Fair, Today.com and RadarMagazine.com.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Scarlett_Johansson_09.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/scientologycruise2.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kidman_11.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travolta_05.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20120709__peoplemag1.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scarlett_2.jpg?w=1024&h=737", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scarlett_2.jpg?w=1024&h=737", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
