At the beginning of the shot where Dern hugs her co-stars, it looks like she's pulling away from Witherspoon, as if they had just embraced.\n\nLaura Dern getting up, probably from hugging Reese Witherspoon. CBS\n\nIt's also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up. It's not totally clear.\n\nDern also, after all, did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her speech. \"I share this with my tribe of four ladies,\" she said, referring to her co-stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. So there probably isn't any beef between them.\n\nAlso, it's just kind of awkward to hug someone in the seat in front of you. The chair is in the way. What's she supposed to do? Like, hug the back of her neck? Tap her on the shoulder? Everyone watching is waiting for her to come onstage.\n\nKidman and Witherspoon are themselves nominees in the leading actress category for a TV miniseries or movie, which will be awarded Sunday night.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/59bf27c224884907fe64e391?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59bf27c124884907fe64e38f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/59bf27c224884907fe64e390?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/emmys-2017-laura-dern-snub-reese-witherspoon-big-little-lies-2017-9?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/59bf27c224884907fe64e390?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59bf27c124884907fe64e38f?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Shamsian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/emmys-2017-laura-dern-snub-reese-witherspoon-big-little-lies-2017-9", "title": "People are freaking out that Laura Dern may have snubbed Reese Witherspoon after Emmy win", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "People are freaking out that Laura Dern may have snubbed Reese Witherspoon after Emmy win", "date": "2017-09-17", "news_keywords": "Emmys 2017, Big Little Lies, Laura Dern, Celebrity, TV, Jacob Shamsian", "description": "People think Laura Dern may have snubbed Reese Witherspoon at the Emmys.
