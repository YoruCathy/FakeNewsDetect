According to a source, Kylie has felt more \u201calone\u201d than ever following Cait\u2019s change.\n\n[ Related: Surprise! Almost All Of The Kardashian & Jenner Kids Came Out To Support Caitlyn At The ESPYS! ]\n\nA source explained:\n\n\u201cKylie has not been taking this whole thing well at all and cannot come to terms with the fact that her father is now Caitlyn.\u201d\n\nHmm. Considering the youngest Jenner didn\u2019t show up to a recent Father\u2019s Day event, we\u2019re not surprised to learn she\u2019s feeling this way.\n\nThe insider added:\n\n\u201cCaitlyn has been getting more attention than anyone in the family and perhaps that is part of what bothers Kylie. But also she feels incredibly alone lately and is barely coping. She used to be daddy\u2019s girl but ever since her dad transitioned, Caitlyn does not seem to have the same time for Kylie that Bruce once did. It bothers her a lot and last night while everyone in the family was crying tears of joy, her tears were of sorrow.\u201d\n\nWe can understand why the 17-year-old is feeling left out \u2014 the 65-year-old is more in demand than ever! Long gone are the days that the Olympian was chauffeuring Kylie and Kendall Jenner around Calabasas!\n\nWe just hope Kyles will eventually come around to Caitlyn\u2026we know there\u2019s a lot of love there. Hang in there, you guys!\n\n[Image via E!.]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20111%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20108%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20465%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20244%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2094%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20112%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20287%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-hilton-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20225%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2087%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20429%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20102%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20538%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20141%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2099%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20275%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2083%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20101%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20311%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20581%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20124%22%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/kylie-jenner-caitlyn-jenner-sad-emotional-difficult-time-transition-transgender/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Reportedly An Emotional Wreck Following Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Transition", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "8jhNuv6mCy23T6U62W5nXupmY4X1fumTlO3sRfrF0Oc", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Reportedly An Emotional Wreck Following Caitlyn Jenner's Transition - Perez Hilton", "description": "Not all of Caitlyn Jenner\u2018s kids are dealing with her transition gracefully.
