Liam Hemsworth visited Miley Cyrus on the set of \u2018The Voice\u2019 last week, but he stayed hidden in the shadows so she could have the spotlight. Isn\u2019t that so adorable?!\n\nMiley Cyrus may have an amazing team on The Voice this season \u2014 Brooke Simpson and Ashland Craft both praised her during an EXCLUSIVE interview with HollywoodLife.com \u2014 but she also has an amazing boyfriend. When we asked the girls if their coach, Miley, ever brought Liam Hemsworth to set with her, Brooke admitted, \u201cHe was on set last week!\u201d But Ashland added that they \u201cdidn\u2019t talk to him\u201d because \u201che was trying to hide from people. It was during the show. He was trying to make sure no one saw him.\u201d So basically, he was trying to make sure he didn\u2019t steal Miley\u2019s thunder. \u201cIt was so cute! They\u2019re so real!\u201d Ashland gushed.\n\nAnd Ashland may have a point. Miley and Liam are so real that we recently learned their families are pressuring them to get pregnant. As you may recall, Miley shared a photo of herself the night before Thanksgiving and fans thought they saw a baby bump, but Miley later confirmed it was just a result of all the food she had eaten. \u201cMiley\u2018s tofu baby joke over the holiday got everyone in the family talking about Miley and Liam having a baby together, and the overwhelming response has been positive,\u201d a source previously told us EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cEveryone in the family is dying for Miley and Liam to make beautiful babies together ASAP\u2026 Miley\u2018s mom Tish would love nothing more this holiday season than to become a grandmother. Miley\u2018s dad would also love it if Miley were pregnant, too. He loves babies and thinks Miley and Liam would make amazingly talented babies. Tish thinks their baby would be gorgeous and that they would both be fabulous parents,\u201d our source added.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if Miley and Liam had a baby together? We\u2019d love it! But we\u2019d also be just as happy to hear about Liam visiting the set of The Voice again.\n\nHollywoodLifers, how do YOU feel about Liam Hemsworth letting Miley have the spotlight?
