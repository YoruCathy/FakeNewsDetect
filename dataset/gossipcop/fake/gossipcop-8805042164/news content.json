'The popularity contestant has caused a lot of friction at the palace.'\n\nAccording to the US publication's bombshell claims, Kate feels 'betrayed' by the woman she had become close friends with - especially because it was Kate who helped Meghan ease into royal life before her wedding to Prince Harry.\n\n'Meghan has learned everything from Kate. But since the wedding, Kate feels like Meghan has barely made any effort with her and is more interested in impressing the queen,' a palace insider tells.\n\nAdding, 'In all fairness, Meghan has been busy. But Kate feels like she's put a lot of effort into their friendship and hasn't gotten much in return.'\n\nBack before she was a polished princess, Kate had to figure everything out on her own.\n\nGetty\n\nIt took five years of dating Prince William for Kate to meet Her Majesty, and it took another three before the palace started giving the Duchess of Cambridge etiquette lessons.\n\nThe boiling tension have reportedly gotten so bad, In Touch claims the two princes have been forced to intervene.\n\n'William and Harry feel stuck in the middle,' a source tells. 'William is doing his best to smooth things over.'\n\n'The competition is out of control,' adds the source. 'Things are likely to go from bad to worse.'\n\nThe royal family is yet to respond to In Touch's report.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/29218/kate-middleton-meghan-markle.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/29218/kate-middleton-meghan-markle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ben Simons", "Ben Simons Is A Digital Content Editor At New Idea Magazine.
