{"url": "www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/02/i-miss-the-old-kanye-what-has-happened-to-raps-most-complex-star", "text": "In a video viewed more than 6m times on Twitter, 21-year-old Chika Oranika summed up the current feelings of many black Americans about Kanye West. She delivered her own lyrics over the beat of the rap star\u2019s Jesus Walks. \u201cHow you say you Yeezus but do nothing to restore us? You support the people up in power that abort us,\u201d she raps into the camera. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter how much money you got or you lack, when that cheque clear don\u2019t forget that your children are still black.\u201d\n\nWhy the opprobrium, which has come from activists, Hollywood stars and fellow musicians, as well as withering online freestyles? West, one of the most significant, complex and celebrated rappers in the US, has used a 350-tweet stream of consciousness over the past fornight to throw his support firmly behind Donald Trump. But yesterday, he went way beyond party politics in an interview with TMZ, saying, in a sloppy bit of rhetoric: \u201cYou hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.\u201d\n\nHost Van Lathan tore back at him: \u201cWhile you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you\u2019ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.\u201d Roxane Gay reacted on Twitter by calling his comments \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201ctrite, shallow \u2026 he is not a free thinker. He is a free moron.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:34 From Taylor Swift to Hurricane Katrina: five of Kanye West's memorable outbursts \u2013 video\n\nBlack America\u2019s dismay at West has been brewing for some time. He puzzled many when he posed for photos with Trump in December 2016, making him one of the first celebrities to apparently endorse the new president. But his recent tweets left no room for doubt. He posted a picture of himself wearing the Trump campaign\u2019s Make America Great Again cap, and tweeted: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with Trump but the mob can\u2019t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother.\u201d After an intervention by a presumably somewhat weary Kim Kardashian, West wrote: \u201cMy wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don\u2019t agree with everything Trump does. I don\u2019t agree 100% with anyone but myself.\u201d\n\nIn response, R&B singer Frank Ocean emerged from hibernation with a sarcastic screengrab of the time West went off-script during a 2005 Hurricane Katrina appeal to say \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d, the intimation being that it is now West who doesn\u2019t care. Samuel L Jackson suggested West was courting an audience in \u201cthe sunken place\u201d \u2013 the psychic interzone in the horror film Get Out into which black people are hypnotised and silenced (the film\u2019s director, Jordan Peele, has previously linked it to Trump\u2019s America).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dragon brothers? West with Donald Trump, 2016. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cSo many people who love you feel so betrayed right know because they know the harm that Trump\u2019s policies cause, especially to people of colour,\u201d West\u2019s friend John Legend wrote in a text message that West posted on Twitter. The rap star wrote back: \u201cYou bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.\u201d Among ordinary Americans, meanwhile, there was seething anger at West supporting someone who has reportedly said \u201claziness is a trait in blacks\u201d; who campaigned for the death penalty for the black teenagers, later proven innocent, in the Central Park Five case; and who thought there were some \u201cvery fine people\u201d marching alongside neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.\n\nReacting to \u2013 or having perhaps anticipated \u2013 all this, West released a new track, Ye Vs the People, the first music from two new albums being released in June. In a dialogue with the American people (vocalised by rapper T.I.), Kanye tries to detoxify the Trump brand and reclaim his Make America Great Again slogan: \u201cWearin\u2019 the hat\u2019ll show people that we equal,\u201d he raps, arguing for a why-can\u2019t-we-all-just-get-along humanism. He ultimately distils the debate thus: \u201cYou on some choosin\u2019 side shit, I\u2019m on some unified shit.\u201d\n\nSo many people who love you feel so betrayed right know \u2013 John Legend\n\nFor Kanye, this chapter is just the latest incident in an uncompromising career. At the turn of the century, as a beatmaker for Jay-Z and others, he really did seem to be on \u201csome unified shit\u201d, taking the chopped-up soul samples of \u201cbackpack\u201d hip-hop and pairing them with the blockbuster tropes of mainstream rap production; he then successfully segued into being a unified producer-rapper. His first two albums charmed the whole spectrum of rap fans with their diversity and humour: he riffed on black cultural reference points \u2013 slow-jam love songs, social climbers \u2013 like a standup comedian.\n\nHis albums became more ambitious with each new release, unifying diverse cultural reference points \u2013 Graduation sampled Daft Punk and explored a more electronic sound; 808s & Heartbreak used Auto-Tune to reflect and enact emotional dissonance, to brilliant effect; My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was as operatic as the title suggests. His interest in visual art grew, with artists from Takashi Murakami to George Condo commissioned for his album covers; he designed his own fashion collections and collaborated with Adidas. In 2013, he said: \u201cCreative genius, that\u2019s my title. My title is not rapper any more.\u201d West positioned himself as a rounded aesthete, obsessed with form and how art impacts society \u2013 his Twitter feed has recently featured everything from tech solutions for water desalination to artists Joseph Beuys and David Hammons. Part of his attraction to Kardashian seemed to be her very iconography: \u201cMy girl a superstar all from a home movie\u201d, he wondered admiringly on 2012 track Clique.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With his wife Kim Kardashian in the video for Famous. Photograph: Tidal\n\nHe also continued his analysis of black America. On the same track he raps: \u201cYou know white people get money, don\u2019t spend it / Or maybe they get money, buy a business / I\u2019d rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig\u2019nant.\u201d West sees himself as celebrating the economic freedom black Americans were denied for decades, and to which they still have much less access than whites. It\u2019s an extension of a key Jay-Z line \u2013 \u201cI do this for my culture, to let \u2019em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roadster\u201d \u2013 from Izzo (HOVA), a track that Kanye produced.\n\nOn New Slaves, meanwhile, from 2013 album Yeezus, West expressed a more nuanced version of his slavery comments this week: that black Americans were subject to a new kind of slavery, the rabid consumerism for Maybach cars and Alexander Wang clothes that traps them in economic bondage. Julius Bailey, a philosophy professor at Ohio\u2019s Wittenberg University, who has edited a book of essays called The Cultural Impact of Kanye West, argues that West should be criticised for his TMZ interview, but \u201con the basis that he didn\u2019t speak to the material implications of post-chattel slavery,\u201d as he has done on New Slaves and Clique. \u201cKanye\u2019s heartfelt apology [to Van Lathan on TMZ after his comments] was a way of realising that his words, when not qualified or contextualised, do more damage than the emancipating good he seeks.\u201d Some of West\u2019s other lyrics have been similarly clumsy, even offensive. He sampled Billie Holiday\u2019s Strange Fruit, a song about lynching, for Blood on the Leaves, a song about the destructive power of fame in which he also compared a man having his wife and mistress separated at a basketball game to apartheid.\n\nAnd since Yeezus, his self-obsession has become stifling. His 2016 album The Life of Pablo has a great skit called I Love Kanye, where he imagines: \u201cWhat if Kanye made a song about Kanye called I Miss the Old Kanye? Man, that\u2019d be so Kanye!\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his slavery comments, the skit stops being funny: black people really do miss the old, outward-looking Kanye. Rapper Meek Mill summed up the thoughts of many when he posted an image of Kanye to Instagram yesterday, surrounded by the words \u201cRIP Old Kanye\u201d and quoting Kanye\u2019s lyrics back at him: \u201cI feel the pressure, under more scrutiny / And what I do? Act more stupidly.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kanye West xAdidas show, autumn/winter New York, 2015. Photograph: Leandro Justen/BFANYC.com/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe problem is that Kanye\u2019s self-scrutiny has become so advanced that he is beginning to see the world purely through the prism of Kanye, rather than the eyes of black America. That\u2019s harmful not just to himself, but to an ongoing civil rights struggle in a still-racist US; his provocations have the potential to embolden the alt-right and others who would diminish the standing of African Americans.\n\nLike Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, both figures he admires, it\u2019s hard to place Kanye on to a left-right political binary. His personal political philosophy doesn\u2019t neatly dovetail with existing belief systems \u2013 witness how the alt-right embraced him after his championing of Trump, and then deserted him when he also championed Parkland shooting survivor and activist Emma Gonzalez last weekend.\n\nHis embrace of Trump \u2013 as with his embrace of black conservative commentator Candace Owens, whom he met with after tweeting \u201cI love the way [she] thinks\u201d \u2013 is, to him, apolitical. \u201cI see it as simply being contrarian and a bit arrogant, not an actual cosigning of the ideas espoused by Trump relative to immigration, urban policy or militarism,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cHe\u2019s being a fan of wealth.\u201d Kanye champions Trump\u2019s \u201cenergy\u201d and sees in him the same self-creation that he wants for himself, and, perhaps, for black America \u2013 but like other successful, moneyed libertarians, he has become cut off from reality, and assumes that all you need to make it is willpower, perhaps helped along by his inspirational bromides on Twitter (today\u2019s being \u201cMost fear is learned\u201d). Insulated by his money and cultural clout, West is immune from the draining power of Trump\u2019s energy and the legacies of slavery, and is free to celebrate or question them. The racism he has experienced \u2013 being ostracised by pop radio and high fashion \u2013 is real and clearly painful, as he returns to the subject in another interview this week with radio host Charlamagne tha God. Yet having eventually been given access to fashion at least, West seems to believe that all black people can have that kind of agency \u2013 that self-belief alone can set you free. It\u2019s the kind of illusion that makes Trumpism so seductive.\n\nAny analysis is complicated by West\u2019s hospitalisation for two weeks in 2016 after a mental breakdown, following intense touring and an incident where Kardashian was robbed in Paris. He has recast the episode as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and says he is using medication that \u201chelps calm me down\u201d; Kardashian has expressed frustration at how Kanye is framed as mentally ill when he is \u201cjust being himself when he has always been expressive\u201d. And of course, there is a long history of black people being dismissed as crazy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kanye West performing on The Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, 2015. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA\n\nA more generous reading is that Kanye still cares a lot about black America, and in some ways he is a victim of an increasingly dogmatic, polarised culture \u2013 one created, in part, by his and Trump\u2019s mouthpiece of choice, Twitter. \u201cSlavery in America was from 1618 to 1865?\u201d asks Bailey. \u201cIf so, 400 years takes us to 2018, which [chimes with] exactly what all those black nationalists, anti-colonialists, some academicians, and even George Clinton called for, namely an emancipation of the mind.\u201d Kanye is frustrated by the social homogeneity he perceives: \u201cSee that\u2019s the problem with this damn nation / All blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain\u2019t made it off the plantation,\u201d he raps in Ye Vs the People, suggesting that supporting Republicans is an expression of black freedom. \u201cI vehemently hate the \u2018sunken place\u2019 reference, for Kanye has proven his bona fides in black emancipation and black love,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cWe know, via his own words on his albums and interviews, that he stands against racism in all its forms. Kanye may be arrogant, mentally unstable, narcissistic and insensitive but, for him, he is free.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2018 to add the word \u201creportedly\u201d in relation to a quote attributed to Donald Trump: while a former employee said in a 1991 book that Trump had told him \u201claziness is a trait in blacks\u201d, Trump has denied saying that or anything like it.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a511a30b63750f7be54ee6107ab243b592c01f/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2bc214d88e08c293c0d9b0b2c13079d9", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Kanye+West%2CMusic%2CCulture", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8fb93828ce628da2b01da5f367c76bd18de10ac/0_6_4094_2456/master/4094.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fb6428ff9310a6b30b8055442f11bf0c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb7f2559f95a0ae68702d39f9b3e21f3f277119/24_0_633_380/master/633.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3268bc2b009a31db221b489c976694cb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385951350bd844542da6ed8dd41039344441eebd/0_104_2362_3296/master/2362.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e92e94652c7e29f4c4939f446c4dd66f", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61ca8478f1043e97dcf48c944b418747a007d5a5/0_53_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6ed76356a6968740626daa0e2ef893ee", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a511a30b63750f7be54ee6107ab243b592c01f/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=b857faa890ac8238b0b07afa54a60dbd"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a511a30b63750f7be54ee6107ab243b592c01f/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2bc214d88e08c293c0d9b0b2c13079d9", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/02/i-miss-the-old-kanye-what-has-happened-to-raps-most-complex-star", "title": "\u2018I miss the old Kanye\u2019: what has happened to rap\u2019s most complex star?", "meta_data": {"description": "His suggestion that black people have been complicit in their own slavery has prompted widespread outrage.
