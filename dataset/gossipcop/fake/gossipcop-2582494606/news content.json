It\u2019s been nearly five years since he and Rihanna, 30, last broke up, but it always seems like he\u2019s doing something to stir up rumors and get people talking about him and her. Take, for instance, how he sent her a birthday greeting for her big 3-0. While that might be sweet to some, as a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com, Rihanna\u2019s officially over Chris\u2019s thirsty behavior \u201cRihanna has really gotten to the point where she\u2019s just tired of the whole Chris Brown thing,\u201d the insider says. \u201cShe\u2019s tired of being asked to talk about him during interviews, she\u2019s tired of the endless speculation, and she\u2019s tired of Chris feeding into the rumor mill by constantly talking about, and name checking, her.\n\n\u201cAs far as Rihanna is concerned,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com, \u201cthat period of her life is now firmly in the past, she\u2019s put it all behind her, and she\u2019s grown a lot as a person since those days. In many ways Rihanna doesn\u2019t even recognize the girl that she was back then. It seems like a lifetime ago and so much has passed since then.\u201d Indeed. Rihanna \u2013 who was already a big star by the time she and Chris called it quits for a second time in 2013 \u2013 continues to reach new levels of professional success. On top of that, she\u2019s found new love with billionaire boyfriend Hassan Jameel. Things are so good between them that she\u2019s even considering what he would be like as a father.\n\nAs for Breezy? \u201cRihanna doesn\u2019t wish Chris any ill will\u2013the exact opposite in fact, she would love to see him happy and successful\u2014but, she really wants that chapter in her life to be closed for once and for all,\u201d the source adds, and for everyone to just move on.\u201d Someone should let Chris know, because he doesn\u2019t seem ready to let go of RiRi. He was one of the first people \u2013 literally, like he waited until it was midnight \u2013 to wish her Happy Birthday by posting a baby picture of her on his Instagram. Keeping pictures of your ex is one thing. Keeping pictures of your ex they were a toddler? Weird.\n\nChris also got people buzzing with a Feb. 9 tweet where he proposed \u201cA CRAZY WORLD TOUR\u201d that would include Beyonce, Bruno Mars himself and \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Rihanna. The tweet came exactly 9 years after he infamously attacked Rihanna. So, many were highly suspicious of this \u201ccoincidence.\u201d Perhaps Chris should stay in his own lane for a while? Rihanna is clearly ready to stay in hers.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Chris will ever stop talking about Rihanna?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10377013af.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F02%2F20%2Frihanna-over-chris-brown-talking-about-her-history%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3003329&comment_count=4", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rihanna-side-eye-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rihanna-side-eye-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rihanna-side-eye-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Jon Freeman", "Tyler Hersko", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/20/rihanna-over-chris-brown-talking-about-her-history/", "title": "Rihanna: How She Really Feels About Chris Brown Publicly \u2018Name Checking Her\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Chris Brown keeps talking about Rihanna, but as we've learned, she's ready for him to move on and get over it.", "news_keywords": "Chris Brown, Rihanna", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rihanna: How She Really Feels About Chris Brown Publicly \u2018Name Checking Her\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/20/rihanna-over-chris-brown-talking-about-her-history/", "description": "Chris Brown can\u2019t seem to keep Rihanna\u2019s name out of his mouth, but as we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY learned, she wishes that Chris and everyone would \u2018just move on\u2019 with their lives.", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rihanna-side-eye-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-20T16:52:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-20T16:52:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Rihanna: How She Really Feels About Chris Brown Publicly \u2018Name Checking Her\u2019"}, "image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rihanna-side-eye-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rihanna: How She Really Feels About Chris Brown Publicly \u2018Name Checking Her\u2019", "description": "Chris Brown keeps talking about Rihanna, but as we've learned, she's ready for him to move on and get over it."}, "author": "Jason Brow", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519056000.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
