The film covers themes including materialism, loss of innocence, coming of age, and capitalism. Best known as Cruise's breakout film, Risky Business was a critical and commercial success, grossing more than $63 million against a $6.2 million budget.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nJoel Goodson is a high-achieving high school student who lives with his wealthy parents in the Chicago North Shore area of Glencoe. His father wants him to attend Princeton University, his alma mater, so Joel participates in Future Enterprisers, an extracurricular activity in which students work in teams to create small businesses. When his parents go away on a trip, Joel's friend, Miles, convinces him to take advantage of his newfound freedom to have some fun. On the first night, he raids the liquor cabinet, plays the stereo loudly, and dances around the living room in his briefs and button-down shirt to \"Old Time Rock and Roll\". The following day, Miles calls a prostitute named Jackie on Joel's behalf. When Jackie turns out to be a man, Joel pays him just to leave, but before he does, he gives Joel the number for Lana, another prostitute. That night, Joel is unable to sleep and hesitantly calls Lana, who is a gorgeous blonde female, and they stay sexually engaged all night.\n\nLana asks Joel for $300 for her services. He goes to the bank, but when he returns, Lana is gone, along with his mother's expensive Steuben glass egg. Joel finds Lana and demands the egg back, but they are interrupted by Lana's pimp Guido, who pulls a gun. While in his father's Porsche 928, Joel is chased by Guido, but eventually escapes. Lana tells Joel that the egg is with the rest of her stuff at Guido's. Joel lets Lana stay at his house while he goes to school. When he returns, his friends have come over, and Lana has invited another prostitute, Vicki, to stay, but Joel rejects the idea. That night, Joel, Lana, Vicki, and Joel's friend Barry go out and get high on marijuana. After Lana accidentally undoes the parking brake in the Porsche while retrieving her purse, the car rolls down the hill and onto a pier (despite Joel's desperate attempt to stop it); the pier collapses, and the Porsche sinks into Lake Michigan.\n\nWhen Joel takes the car to a repair shop, he is horrified to learn how much it will cost to fix it. He and Lana later decide to turn his parents' house into a brothel for a night; Joel's share of the profits will pay for the repairs. The party is a huge success; the house is packed with Joel's friends and classmates and Lana's co-workers. However, the recruiter from Princeton, Rutherford, chooses that night to interview Joel for admission to Princeton. The interview is plagued by interruptions, and Rutherford is unimpressed by Joel's resum\u00e9. Afterwards, he stays at the party and becomes acquainted with Lana's friends. After the party, Joel and Lana go and have sex on the Chicago \"L\". The next morning, Joel finds his house has been burgled. When he tries to call Lana, Guido answers; he tells Joel that he will let Joel buy back his furniture. Joel and his friends manage to get everything moved back in just as his parents walk in, though his mother notices a crack in her egg. Later, Joel's father congratulates him; the interviewer was very impressed, and Joel will be accepted into Princeton. Joel meets Lana at a restaurant, and they speculate about their future. She tells him that she wants to keep on seeing him; he jokes that it will cost her.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThe film was scored by Tangerine Dream.

It went on to gross a total of $63.5 million domestically.[1]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nRisky Business was acclaimed by critics. It is also considered by many as one of the best films of 1983.[4][5][6] Janet Maslin, in her 1983 review of the film for The New York Times, called it \"part satire, part would-be suburban poetry and part shameless showing off\" and said the film \"shows an abundance of style\", though \"you would be hard pressed to find a film whose hero's problems are of less concern to the world at large.\"[7] She called De Mornay \"disarming as a call girl who looks more like a college girl\" and credits Cruise with making \"Joel's transformation from straight arrow to entrepreneur about as credible as it can be made.\"[7]\n\nThe film holds a 94% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews, with the site's consensus stating; \"Featuring one of Tom Cruise's best early performances, Risky Business is a sharp, funny examination of teen angst that doesn't stop short of exploring dark themes\".[8] Roger Ebert was much more positive, calling it a film of:\n\n\u201c New faces and inspired insights and genuine laughs... one of the smartest, funniest, most perceptive satires in a long time... not only invites comparison with The Graduate, it earns it.[9]\u2014The very best thing about the movie is its dialogue. Paul Brickman, who wrote and directed, has an ear so good that he knows what to leave out. This is one of those movies where a few words or a single line says everything that needs to be said, implies everything that needs to be implied, and gets a laugh. When the hooker tells the kid, 'Oh, Joel, go to school, go learn something,' the precise inflection of those words defines their relationship for the next three scenes. \u201d\n\nVariety said the film was like a \"promising first novel, with all the pros and cons that come with that territory\" and complimented Brickman on \"the stylishness and talent of his direction.\"[10]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nThe remastered 25th-anniversary edition offers \"both the upbeat studio ending and Mr. Brickman's original, more tentative and melancholic conclusion\".[11]\n\nIn 2015, the film was #31 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the 50 Best High School Movies. The magazine called the film a \"sharp satire of privileged suburban teens\", portraying the \"soul-crushing pressure to be perfect.\"[12]\n\nIn the years since the film's release, the iconic scene featuring Cruise's character dancing in just his shirt, socks and briefs to Bob Seger's rendition of \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" has been recreated in episodes of many television series, as well as in films, parodies, and advertisements. The song was #100 on AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Songs list.", "images": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/33/Risky_Business.jpg/220px-Risky_Business.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Risky_Business.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Risky_Business.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risky_Business", "title": "Risky Business", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.27", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Risky_Business.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
