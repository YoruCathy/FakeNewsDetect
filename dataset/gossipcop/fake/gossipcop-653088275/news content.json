The tweets came after Scarborough and Brzezinski criticized him on their MSNBC show, Brzezinski saying he had \"teensie\" hands and that he was \"lying every day and destroying the country.\"\n\nMorning Joe & Mika thought it was hilarious to insult the president this am. Wonder how they feel after his tweets. pic.twitter.com/IqxRELEduo \u2014 Corryn\ud83d\udc99 (@Corrynmb) June 29, 2017\n\nNEWS: Emma Thompson Says Donald Trump Asked Her Out Once -- 'I Didn't Know What to Do With Myself'\n\n\"I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore),\" Trump later tweeted. \"Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!\"\n\nI heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017\n\nAnd it appears the feud is here to stay. Brzezinski tweeted a picture of a Cheerios box on Thursday, reading, \"Made For Little Hands.\"\n\nMelania Trump, who has said that cyberbullying will be one of the main focuses of her work as first lady, stood by her husband.\n\n\"As the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder,\" her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement to CNN.\n\n\n\nA number of celebs have since responded in support of Brzezinski.\n\nI see Melania's campaign to end cyber bullying is off to a slow start \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) June 29, 2017\n\nAmerica elected a very shitty person to be President \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) June 29, 2017\n\nYou are a national embarrassment. It's like you have no idea how to even fake being a normal human being. You are the proud type of insane. \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) June 29, 2017\n\nREAL HOUSEWIVES PLAYBOOK: accuse your co-star of a face lift.

U should also get one. And a body lift. And yes, w/this duck, its ok to man shame. \u2014 Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) June 29, 2017\n\nMy faith in this country forces me to believe that even most of @realDonaldTrump's supporters think his tweets this morning are in bad taste \u2014 Jesse Tyler Ferguson (@jessetyler) June 29, 2017\n\nWhat was said this morning about @morningmika & @JoeNBC by the President of the United States is disgusting, disgraceful & beyond the pale \u2014 Josh Gad (@joshgad) June 29, 2017\n\n'Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.'

Griffin has since apologized for the photos, and burst into tears when asked by ET's Kevin Frazier at a press conference if she'd spoken with her former CNN New Year's Eve co-host, Anderson Cooper, after he condemned the photo shoot.\n\n\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg?itok=WgC1-ttf", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg?itok=W4bSGPj5", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/gettyimages-692085362.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=TnqSx9El"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg?itok=W4bSGPj5", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Antoinette Bueno"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220645_chrissy_teigen_and_more_celebs_slam_donald_trump_over_mika_brzezinski_facelift_tweet", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220645_chrissy_teigen_and_more_celebs_slam_donald_trump_over_mika_brzezinski_facelift_tweet", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "description": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg?itok=W4bSGPj5", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Antoinette Bueno", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220645_chrissy_teigen_and_more_celebs_slam_donald_trump_over_mika_brzezinski_facelift_tweet", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg?itok=W4bSGPj5"}, "description": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
