He gets to spend Christmas with his kids, and he\u2019s making sure it\u2019s their best one yet. He\u2019s ready to spoil them rotten!\n\nIt\u2019s a Christmas miracle! There were doubts that Brad Pitt, 52, would even be able to spend the holidays with his beloved children considering his tough custody proceedings with ex Angelina Jolie, 41, but it\u2019s finally happening! Brad\u2019s taking his second chance to give his kids the world for Christmas. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with spoiling the kids a little bit this Christmas,\u201d a source told OK! magazine. That includes getting six trees (one for each kid) and a sleigh full of presents.\n\n\u201cThe younger ones always loved their dad, but it took awhile for the older ones, like Maddox and Pax, to come around and trust him again, so Brad is putting extra effort into making sure their time together is special,\u201d the source told OK! mag. \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely giddy!\u201d The only Christmas present Brad really wanted was to see his children, and he\u2019s \u201cso happy he\u2019s been shedding grateful tears.\u201d Aww! He\u2019s so grateful that he was able to work things out with Angelina to make this work.\n\nTheir agreement at the moment means that they\u2019ll spend equal time with their brood over the holidays. It\u2019s all about giving the kids a happy holiday! \u201c[Brad] was afraid he\u2019d be spending the holiday alone, But Angie agreed the children should be with their father. She\u2019ll have the kids for Christmas Eve and Brad will get Christmas Day, that\u2019s the best gift he could ever ask for.\n\n\u201cThis time last year he was pretty miserable. Chalk it up to holidays, but [Brad\u2019s] feeling great and ready for a fresh start. More than anything, he can\u2019t wait to prove to his entire family that he\u2019s changed for the better.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Brad\u2019s rep for comment on this story.\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you happy that Brad\u2019s spending the holidays with his kids?
