Back in the day, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were the cutest couple around, and for a while, it really looked like those two crazy kids would really make a go of it.\n\nSadly, we all know how it worked out; seven years of \u201care they/aren\u2019t they\u201d drama that came to an explosive head last fall. After their widely-publicized Instagram feud, it seemed that the Jelena waters had calmed and everyone was moving on with their lives\u2026 until now! We\u2019ve put together an exhaustive history to help you get re-acquainted with the story\u2014and prepare you for its most recent update:\n\nDecember 2010: Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are spotted out and about together, but their relationship is only a rumour until\u2026\n\n\n\nFebruary 2011: \u2026They make their first red carpet appearance as a couple at the Vanity Fair Oscars party.\n\nNovember 2011: A (bogus) paternity suit involving Biebs and a fan fuels the first breakup rumours.\n\nMay 2012: Selena deletes her Instagram account after posting a photo from a shooting range captioned \u201creleasing some stress today,\u201d which causes some to speculate that Jelena may have split.\n\n\n\nJune 2012: Breakup rumours are put to rest when they arrive to the premiere of Katy Perry: Part of Me together (wearing colour-coordinating outfits, no less).\n\nOctober 2012: Justin posts a photo on Instagram with the caption \u201cLingse,\u201d which many commenters note is an anagram of \u2018single,\u2019 but he deletes it and soon replaces it with a self-portrait captioned \u201cjust me\u201d (which, honestly, is foreboding in its own way).\n\nNovember 2012: The pair officially break up after nearly two years together, allegedly due to their conflicting schedules, and Justin begins to be linked to other women: VS model Barbara Palvin, whom he takes a photo with after performing at 2012\u2019s Victoria Secret Fashion Show, and Miranda Kerr (who, at this time, is still married to Orlando Bloom).\n\nDecember 2012: Justin and Selena are caught kissing at an airport in Salt Lake City, but then reportedly break up again after a big fight at an NYE party in Mexico.\n\nJanuary 2013: Selena posts a photo wearing a hat with the logo of Justin\u2019s hometown hockey team (the Stratford Warriors, n\u00e9e Cullitons).\n\nMarch 2013: Selena makes a jab at Justin while on the Late Show with David Letterman, when she says \u201cthat makes two of us\u201d in response to Letterman\u2019s admission that he had once made Justin cry on the show.\n\n\n\nApril 2013: Selena reportedly flies to Norway to see Justin, and he posts a quickly-deleted black and white photo of them together where they look very cuddly. The caption is \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve been makin music for too long babe come cuddle\u2019 \u2013her\u201d.\n\nMay 2013: Selena greets Justin with a kiss on the cheek backstage at the Billboard Music Awards. It\u2019s still unclear if they have officially reconciled.\n\nJuly 2013: They spend the Fourth of July together, but in a subsequent interview Selena claims to be single.\n\n\n\nJanuary 2014: Justin posts a sweet photo of the two of them on Instagram captioned \u201clove the way you look at me.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarch 2014: Selena attends a #WeDay party with a group that includes Orlando Bloom, whose ex-wife, you will remember, was rumoured to have gotten very close to Justin back in 2012.\n\n\n\nApril 2014: Justin and Selena have a fight at Coachella, allegedly due to the fact that Selena found photos of Kylie Jenner on Justin\u2019s phone. Shortly after this, Selena is linked to Orlando after they are photographed sitting on a curb together outside a Chelsea Handler concert.\n\n\n\nMay 2014: Justin is linked romantically to various women, including Kylie, Adriana Lima, and Yovanna Ventura. He also previews a song that is almost definitely about Selena titled \u201cIt\u2019s Working\u201d (which, FYI, he never released).\n\n\n\nJune 2014: Justin posts another sappy black and white Instagram of the two of them; this one captioned \u201cour love in unconditional,\u201d and they are soon spotted out together at a host of different locations. Selena stands by him during a scandal about a racist joke Justin made on video.\n\nJuly 2014: More Bloom-Kerr drama (although at this point the two have divorced): Orlando punches Justin in Ibiza (on video!) and Justin posts a sexy photo of Miranda Kerr on Instagram (albeit not one he took himself)\n\n\n\nAugust 2014: As is tradition at this point, Justin posts a photo of him and Selena to signal that they are back on.\n\nSeptember 2014: Justin confirms that Jelena is back during the legal deposition for his DUI, telling the court \u201cwe\u2019re dating.\u201d\n\nOctober 2014: The pair is spotted fighting at an airport in France, and Selena tweets about being lonely shortly afterwards. There is speculation that the fight was over talk of getting married (Selena expected him to propose on the trip, which he did not), while others claim secret liaisons with Kendall Jenner are the fuel for this breakup.\n\n\n\nNovember 2014: An era of cryptic (or not so cryptic) subtext begins. Justin posts mushy photos on Instagram to try and win her back, and Selena releases her song \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants,\u201d which she openly admits is about Justin.\n\nJustin responds to Selena\u2019s emotional AMAs performance of \u201cThe Heart Wants What it Wants\u201d with an Instagrammed quote.\n\n\n\nDecember 2014: Justin responds to the rumours that he\u2019s dating Hailey Baldwin with an Instagram that says he\u2019s \u2018super single\u2019.\n\nJanuary 2015: Selena begins dating German music producer Zedd, but she and Justin are spotted grabbing dinner together in LA.\n\nSeptember 2015: While promoting her album Revival, Selena is consistently asked about Justin in her interviews. She tells Elle that they are no longer together, but on good terms, and that she doesn\u2019t know if she would ever get back together with him. Justin\u2019s interviews around the same time reflect a similar sentiment; he claims that they got too serious too young, and that was the reason things didn\u2019t work out.\n\nNovember 2015: On The Ellen Degeneres Show, leading up to the release of his new album, Purpose, Justin confirms that three of the songs are about Selena (\u201cWhat Do You Mean,\u201d \u201cSorry,\u201d and \u201cMark My Words\u201d), and admits \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m over it yet.\u201d Before the month is out, he is spotted serenading Selena with \u201cMy Girl\u201d at a bar in Beverly Hills.\n\nFebruary 2016: The two continue to speak about their prior relationship often in interviews, but at this point Selena says she is \u201cexhausted\u201d and that she \u201ccan\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d\n\nMay 2016: Orlando Bloom is dating Katy Perry, but he and Selena appear to be canoodling in Vegas. At a concert during her Revival tour, a fan holds up a \u201cMarry Justin Please\u201d sign, which she takes, crumples, and throws on the floor without comment.\n\n\n\nAugust 2016: Justin posts several photos with Sofia Richie, who is rumoured to be his new girlfriend, on Instagram. His fans aren\u2019t pleased, and Justin warns that if they don\u2019t learn to be nicer to Richie he\u2019ll have to make his profile private. From here, things get messy, quick:\n\n\n\nSelena comments on the photo, telling him if he can\u2019t handle the backlash then he shouldn\u2019t post photos of Sofia. She sides with his fans, claiming that \u201cthey love you and supported you before anyone ever did.\u201d\n\nSelena follows this up by posting photos of herself with her fans on her own profile.\n\nJustin posts two comments, in which he does not mention Selena by name or Instagram handle.\n\nSelena lashes back with a comment that claims Justin cheated on her: \u201cFunny how the ones that cheated multiple times, are pointing the finger at the ones that were forgiving and supportive, no wonder fans are mad. Sad. All love.\u201d\n\nJustin then insinuates that Selena cheated on HIM, with Zayn Malik: \u201cI cheated\u2026 oh I forgot about you and Zayn?\u201d\n\nHailey Baldwin sides with Selena: \u201cmisplacing the blame onto someone else isn\u2019t going to get you to the next stage in life,\u201d she says, in a post that is deleted later.\n\nJustin deletes his Instagram to end the feud, and Selena posts a brief apology to Snapchat: \u201cwhat I said was selfish and pointless.\u201d\n\nAnd that was all, for a while. After Selena opened up about her kidney transplant earlier this year, however, she and Justin appear to have reconnected on friendly terms, and with full knowledge of Selena\u2019s current boyfriend, Abel Tesfaye (The Weeknd):\n\nOctober 24th, 2017: Justin and Selena hang out with some mutual friends at her Studio City house.\n\nOctober 30th, 2017: Justin and Selena spend a full Sunday together, including attending church service together in the morning. Sources close to The Weeknd claim all is fine between the two of them, and that he knows about the two exes hanging out. However, others have noticed that he has unfollowed some of Selena\u2019s closest friends and family: her mother, her assistant, her best friend/kidney transplant donor, and the parents of her godson. Meanwhile, People is reporting that Selena and The Weeknd have split, but we\u2019ll wait for a black-and-white pic posted by Bieber to confirm if her and Selena are officially back on\u2026.\n\nNovember 1st, 2017: Alright, it\u2019s official! Jelena is back\u2014the pair were spotted on a cute day date in L.A., sipping iced coffees, walking arm-in-arm, biking around, and proving first love is forever.\n\nFebruary 2018: Gomez and Bieber are apparently taking a break \u201cmainly because of Selena\u2019s mom and her disapproval of Justin,\u201d a source told Us Weekly. \u201cJustin\u2019s family loves Selena, but Selena\u2019s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don\u2019t trust Justin.\u201d", "images": ["https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca4_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-youtube.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/close1.png", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-home.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca12.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/logo.png", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca3_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-email.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/popup-image.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca6_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/searchicon.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-luanne-ronquillo-thekit.ca-feature.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-pinterest.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-feature-thekit.ca_-491x592.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca13.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca182.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca7_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca17.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-twitter.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-facebook.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca8_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca14.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-feature-thekit.ca_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca10.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-stephanie-duong-thekit.ca-feature.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca15.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-meghan-beauty-thekit_ca-feature.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca9_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Shop-Unit-GIF.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=139559820066364&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/themes/thekitTheme/images/social-header-instagram.svg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca11.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca5_.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thekitca-2020-Spring-Shoes-Feature.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca18.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-jennifer-crawford-thekit.ca-feature-1.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-relationship-feature-thekit.ca_-699x849.jpg", "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-inpost-thekit.ca16.jpg"], "top_img": "https://thekit.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jelena-feature-thekit.ca_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mckenzie Bohn"], "canonical_link": "https://thekit.ca/life/celebrity-life/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-dating-history-of-jelena/", "title": "Selena Gomez-Justin Bieber Dating History: The Many Ups and Downs of Jelena", "meta_data": {"fb": {"pages": 152387688111337, "app_id": 231675370249970}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "pocket-site-verification": "74ee78dd4cc206779324b8bb30e528", "description": "Are you ready to ride the Gomez-Justin relationship rollercoaster once again?
