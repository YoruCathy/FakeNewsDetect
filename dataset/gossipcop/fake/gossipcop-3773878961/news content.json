James Brolin and Barbra Streisand are nearing their 20th wedding anniversary this year.\n\nET\u2019s Katie Krause spoke with Brolin at the Hallmark Channel and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries winter Television Critics Association red carpet on Saturday, where he revealed that despite his decades-long romance, he still doesn't have all the answers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, because nobody trains you,\u201d he said of the secret to his and Streisand's marriage. \u201cThis is my third time -- third marriage. I picked difficult situations the first two times, but I think you learn with each one. I\u2019m a person that believes that if I\u2019m wrong, that\u2019s when I learn, and when I\u2019m right, I haven\u2019t learned a thing.\u201d\n\nNoting that he takes his relationship \u201cday to day,\u201d Brolin revealed that he\u2019s an advocate of marriage counseling.\n\n\u201cI do believe in counseling if anybody ever has a problem in their marriage. Bring in a referee, talk it over, and I swear to you, it will dispel by the end of the session, each time!\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes in a tough marriage, it\u2019s tough to talk, but if you do, it works!\u201d\n\nThe 77-year-old actor has also learned to maintain his marriage with Streisand by not interrupting her during hectic times.\n\n\u201cWhen she\u2019s busy, she\u2019s really focused, and part of our good relationship is that I understand that,\u201d he shared. \u201cAnd if I come to her with something important and she says, \u2018I don\u2019t have time right now,\u2019 she doesn\u2019t have time, period. That\u2019s the way the mind works. You gotta focus.\u201d\n\nAs for how Streisand, 75, makes him feel special, Brolin said, \u201cI\u2019m always welcome when I get home. I always get notes, \u2018Hurry home!\u2019 When I get there, there\u2019s always something kind of great waiting for me, some plan, and I try to reciprocate.\u201d\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nBarbra Streisand Calls Out Golden Globes for Not Awarding More Female Directors\n\n\u2018Girls Trip' Star Tiffany Haddish Says She Taught Barbra Streisand All About Cardi B\n\nJosh Brolin on His Ripped Bod and How He Knew Wife Kathyrn Boyd Was the One (Exclusive)\n\nEXCLUSIVE!
