Kim Kardashian recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms.\n\nReality TV star Kim Kardashian said she is not actively considering a career in politics but she would not rule out the possibility of running for office. The 37-year-old entrepreneur recently met US President Donald Trump to discuss prison reforms after she spent months working with her legal team in a bid to get Alice Johnson parole.\n\nFollowing her meeting with the president, Alice, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1997 on money laundering and drug conspiracy charges, was released from Aliceville Correctional Facility in Alabama.\n\nWhen asked if she would ever run for office, Kardashian told CNN, \u201cI guess never say never. But that\u2019s not going to be like, \u2018Kim\u2019s running.\u2019 That\u2019s not where I am.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d star added she wants to use her celebrity status for the welfare of people.\n\n\u201cI honestly saw that if I could use my platform just to do something for one person, that it opens the conversation for so much more and for other people to want to do the same thing.\n\n\u201cIf more people would just put their personal feelings aside and talk about really important issues that have to be discussed, then so much more can get done,\u201d she said.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
