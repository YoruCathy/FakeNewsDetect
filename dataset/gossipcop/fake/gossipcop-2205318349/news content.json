Drawing particular ire was a blue and white Oscar de la Renta dress that she wore on June 17 to the wedding of Harry\u2019s cousin. The internet caught fire with incendiary criticisms of the $5,490 frock\u2019s too-long sleeves and ill-fitting torso.\n\nOn Twitter, it was compared to both a sack of potatoes and the \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d scenes where Scarlett O\u2019Hara fashions a dress from curtains.\n\nThe public disappointment with these perceived missteps may stem from the fact that the duchess is dealing with the pressures and expectations of her new role largely on her own.\n\nBefore the wedding, Meghan had a secret style weapon: her best friend, Jessica Mulroney. Now, it seems they\u2019re not working together as closely, and it shows.\n\nThe Toronto-based professional stylist is credited with advising the then-actress on her wardrobe choices and introducing her to new designers. As a result, Meghan was praised for her casual, chic style, as she embraced hip Canadian labels such as Erdem. When she wore ripped Mother jeans, a white \u201cboyfriend\u201d shirt by Misha Nonoo and an Everlane tote for a date with Harry this past September, all three pieces saw an immediate sales spike.\n\nBut with Mulroney in Canada (where Meghan lived while starring in \u201cSuits\u201d) and the duchess, 36, in England, the new royal has been left to live up to the royal rules of decorum on her own.\n\n\u201cThe royal family is a firm and the protocol is huge,\u201d said British designer Caroline Castigliano. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing everything about Meghan change. It\u2019s very difficult when you\u2019re 36 to do this \u2014 it\u2019s far easier when you\u2019re in your early 20s and they can mold and adapt you. It\u2019s a much bigger job for Meghan. It must be unbelievably difficult that Meghan was a working woman and had her own style.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s out with the ripped jeans and messy bun, in with the oh-so-modest below-the-knee dresses. Goodbye to the casual totes and body-cross bags, hello to ladylike little clutches.\n\nGone is the Meghan who dared to wear a very sexy, sheer and metallic gown by Ralph and Russo for her engagement photos.\n\nOne of the biggest changes has been to her palette. Previously, Meghan wore plenty of bold hues: scarlet red, midnight blue, forest green, plus rich plaids and stripes. Now, she all but fades into the background in white, cream and the palest of pinks. Royal watchers say the wallflower look is in deference to Queen Elizabeth, to whom the duchess has been seen cozying up at recent public events.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be seen with the queen, who wears bright colors, then this neutral palette she\u2019s been sticking to is really a measure of respect,\u201d said Castigliano. \u201cThis much more demure, classic look is absolutely right on key to what she needs to fit in with the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt events with the queen, she lets Her Majesty shine,\u201d said William Hanson, an expert on British etiquette. \u201cThe queen is top of the bill. Meghan is on the bill, not top of the bill.\u201d\n\nWith Mulroney back in Toronto, it seems Meghan has someone else guiding her, at least a bit.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, she\u2019s really dressing like Kate,\u201d Castigliano said of Meghan\u2019s sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge. \u201cAt this stage, Kate is probably giving her tons of advice on how to fit in.\u201d\n\nSources say that Kate\u2019s assistant, Natasha Archer, has been calling in clothes from designers for Meghan until she hires an assistant of her own.\n\nOne big difference, one source pointed out, is that Kate\u2019s clothes \u201cfit her like a glove\u201d because all the designers know her sizing, while Meghan is still developing her relationships.\n\nInternet critics cluck that the clothes have too often been unflattering: frumpy waistlines, too-long sleeves, hems that hit at an odd point on her calves and a series of hats and fascinators that seem to age her. The wags even latched on to Meghan\u2019s shoes appearing to be too big and gaping at the heel and toe.\n\nAs it turns out, there\u2019s a good reason why. Fashion expert Harriet Davey told the Sun this week that \u201ccelebs often go a size up, or even two, in the shoe department when they\u2019re at an event or on the red carpet . . . to avoid blisters.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hanson, Meghan will almost certainly have to find a stylist soon: \u201cI believe that the Duchess of Cambridge did not have a stylist at first and very much said, \u2018I\u2019m going to do this myself,\u2019 but soon realized she needed some help. I believe Catherine now has a stylist, at least part time, and that\u2019s highly likely what will happen for Meghan.\n\n\u201c[She] has a big tour in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga later this year and will need help,\u201d he added. \u201cIn five months, Meghan won\u2019t be making these minor mistakes.\u201d\n\nCastigliano agrees. In fact, she predicts that the duchess will slowly make a return to the stylish, youthful Meghan with whom the public first fell in love.\n\n\u201cOver the next year, Meghan will have more designers throwing themselves at her, and she will adapt her style,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be fabulous when she takes everything she learns and \u2018Meghan-izes\u2019 it.\u201d", "images": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/pagesixapp_ad_300x250_v32x1.jpg", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/meghan-markle-fashion-evolution.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/meghan-markle-fashion-evolution.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sephora.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/meghan-markle-fashion-evolution.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/07/01/meghan-markle-has-gone-from-chic-to-a-fashion-disaster/", "title": "Royal life is ruining Meghan Markle\u2019s sexy style", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
