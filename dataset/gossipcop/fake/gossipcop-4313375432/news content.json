Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child on Monday, April 23 at 11:01 a.m. in the Lindo Wing at St. Mary\u2019s hospital.\n\n\n\nJust like when Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stopped for a few quick photos in front of the hospital before they returned to Kensington Palace with their new prince. Duchess Kate wore a red dress with a white lace collar by Jenny Packham, making this the third time she\u2019s worn a bespoke dress by the British designer for her post-birth appearances.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe red dress appeared to be a nod to the outfit Princess Diana wore when she introduced Prince Harry to the world in 1984. Both dresses were bright red with a white Peter Pan collar.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThis wasn't the first time Kate paid homage to her late mother-in-law after giving birth. Kate introduced Prince George to the world in July 2013 wearing a short-sleeved blue dress by Jenny Packham that nodded to the polka-dot dress Princess Diana wore when leaving the hospital with Prince William three decades earlier.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhen Princess Charlotte arrived in May 2015, Duchess Kate opted for another pastel Jenny Packham number, but this time her yellow dress in a buttercup print had longer sleeves to accommodate for the cooler spring weather just like the red dress did today.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPrincess Charlotte also wore a knit cap when she went out into the world for the first time, while Prince George enjoyed the July weather sans-hat on his first outing. Both royal babies were swaddled in a white G.H. Hurt & Son soft wool baby shawl.\n\nThe first public appearances of Prince George (L) and Princess Charlotte (R). Getty Images\n\nSince the weather in London was rather cold and windy today, the new prince also wore a knit cap and what appears to be the same G.H. Hurt & Son baby shawl as his siblings.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe previous two times Duchess Kate stepped out with her newborns she wore light-colored heels, but her Dune sling-back espadrilles were better suited for the July weather than the leather Jimmy Choo pumps she wore to introduce Charlotte.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDuchess Kate went for neutral shoes once again with baby no. 3, opting to re-wear what appears to be her Gianvito Rossi \u201cGianvito 105\u201d pumps in taupe suede.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPrince George also made an appearance at the hospital when his little sister Charlotte was born, just like his dad Prince William did to greet Prince Harry.\n\nGetty Images\n\nToday, Prince William brought both Prince George and Princess Charlotte to meet their new little brother. This time around George didn\u2019t match with his father, since he came straight from school wearing his uniform. Charlotte, however, was dressed for the occasion in a blue floral Liberty print dress and stole the crowd's heart by showing off her royal wave, while Prince George was a little more shy this time around.\n\nGetty Images", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/shutterstock-editorial-9639910y-huge-1524503033.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.605xh;0,0.271xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-539393878-1526740752.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.889xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bridesmaids-princess-charlotte-of-cambridge-savannah-news-photo-1051958456-1539454021.jpg?crop=1xw:0.63366xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lyndsey Matthews", "Freelance Writer", "Lyndsey Matthews Is The Destination News Editor For Afar", "Previously She Was A Lifestyle Editor Across All Of Hearst Digital Media'S Brands", "A Digital Editor At Martha Stewart Weddings", "Travel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a19674665/kate-middleton-post-birth-appearance-differences-comparison/", "title": "How Kate Middleton\u2019s First Appearance With Royal Baby No. 3 Compares to George and Charlotte\u2019s Debuts", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#BE3E19", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Town & Country", "title": "How Kate Middleton\u2019s First Appearance With Royal Baby No. 3 Compares to George and Charlotte\u2019s Debuts", "description": "There are a few key differences.", "url": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a19674665/kate-middleton-post-birth-appearance-differences-comparison/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 526594570689062, "pages": 344794953432}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TownandCountryMagazine", "modified_time": "2018-04-23 05:26:32", "published_time": "2018-04-23 05:21:00", "section": "Heritage", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TandCmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "musQPiBADe3f4WpT4JNcg9uUChC3qnOhhPLSR4n1urM", "title": "How Kate Middleton's Post-Hospital Photos with Royal Baby #3 Differ From George and Charlotte", "description": "There are a few key differences between the public debuts of the new royal baby and its older siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte.", "keywords": "kate middleton, royal baby no. 3, lindo wing hospital, duchess of cambridge, royal baby 3 debut, prince george, princess charlotte, hospital debut, hospital exit photos, photos of royal baby 3", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.412xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Society,society,tradition,royal baby number 3,kate middleton", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-23T17:21:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/3-1524503754.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.412xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "How Kate Middleton\u2019s First Appearance With Royal Baby No. 3 Compares to George and Charlotte\u2019s Debuts", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524432060.0, "source": "http://www.townandcountrymag.com", "summary": ""}
