The former Yankees star jetted straight to Los Angeles from Paris on Monday for a Shark Tank press event, summing up their trip in an interview with Extra.\n\n\u201cWe landed early this morning, it was great,\" he said, claiming they got \"15 hours of sleep.\"\n\nStill riding high from their trip, Rodriguez said the couple spends time together despite their busy schedules. \u201cIf you want to be together you are together,\u201d he said. \u201cOur kids get along really well, we\u2019re both from New York, we\u2019re both Latin, we\u2019re both in our forties, we\u2019re really enjoying life, but she really is one of the most impressive and smartest human beings I have ever met.\"\n\nReports of Rodriguez and Lopez' courtship originally emerged in March, with the couple making their public debut at the Met Gala in May.\n\nPDA at the Met Gala?
