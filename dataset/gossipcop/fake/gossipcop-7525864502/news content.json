Production on the $50 million film, which wrapped this summer in advance of an April 6 release, was moved to Georgia to take advantage of a generous tax credit.\n\nThen the studio played hardball with the actors, who have experienced mixed levels of success outside of the franchise.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood's 10 Highest-Grossing Actors\n\nAccording to sources, Universal is paying Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott a robust $5 million each, plus a small slice of first-dollar gross, to reprise their roles.\n\nAlyson Hannigan, star of CBS' How I Met Your Mother, is getting about $3 million. And veteran Eugene Levy, who starred in four profitable direct-to-DVD Pie films that helped make the property a billion-dollar franchise, is said to have received a payday also in the $3 million range.\n\nPHOTOS: 'How I Met Your Mother' and Fall TV's Other Returning Shows\n\nThe rest of the cast -- which includes Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Natasha Lyonne, Jennifer Coolidge, Mena Suvari and Shannon Elizabeth -- is being paid far less, say sources, most in the $500,000 to $750,000 range (though bonuses for some could kick in if the film is a hit, as expected).\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood's 10 Highest-Paid Actresses\n\nRounding out the list is Tara Reid, who is said to have joined Reunion for close to the $250,000 that Universal initially offered. A studio rep calls the figures \"inaccurate\" but declines further comment.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2011/09/pie_a.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2011/09/pie_a.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2011/09/pie_a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Belloni", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-pie-reunion-salaries-242160", "title": "Who Got Paid What for the 'American Pie' Reunion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-pie-reunion-salaries-242160", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Who Got Paid What for the 'American Pie' Reunion", "description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2011/09/pie_a.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Who Got Paid What for the 'American Pie' Reunion", "description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-pie-reunion-salaries-242160", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2011/09/pie_a.jpg", "width": 648, "height": 365, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Who Got Paid What for the 'American Pie' Reunion", "sailthru.description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Belloni", "sailthru.vertical": "Business", "sailthru.date": "2011-09-29 16:36:00", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Business,Eugene Levy,Jason Biggs,Seann William Scott,American Pie,American Reunion,American Wedding"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1317285360.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
