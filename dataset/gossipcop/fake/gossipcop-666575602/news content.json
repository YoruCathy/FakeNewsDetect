Kim and Kourtney reportedly demanded that the other children at a Color Me Mine store not attend the pottery workshop so North and Penelope could have it all to themselves.\n\nA source tells the Enquirer, \u201cKim and Kourtney left lotsa tots crying their eyes out. Passersby kept stopping to ask miffed moms what the ruckus was, and one angry lady groused, \u2018Those darn Kardashians had the place shut down, so now we\u2019re left out in the cold while our kids have a damn meltdown!\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Kim\u2019s and Kourtney\u2019s reps have already shut down the report, we\u2019ve heard stories like this about the Kardashians before. We\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re entitled and behave as such, not making room for other people they deem to be \u2018beneath\u2019 them. Since they consider themselves on the level of Beyonce, they probably didn\u2019t want their children to associate with the \u2018plebeians\u2019. However, they\u2019ll soon find out what it\u2019s like to be plebeians themselves, especially if their show continues deteriorating in ratings the way it has the last few weeks.\n\nEventually, they won\u2019t be able to demand separate spaces for themselves or their children, because no one will listen to their requests. The store owner who agreed to kick out the other children might have been all aflutter from being in the presence of \u2018celebrities\u2019, but that will no longer be an asset for the Kardashians once their fame drifts away.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the chance that this report is pure \u2018fake news\u2019, driven by anti-Kardashian sentiment. Knowing that their ratings are crashing and that nobody cares about them anymore should really force the family to be more humble, especially Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian (being that they have children and all). However, it might be doing the exact opposite\u2026 but hey, desperation makes people do crazy things sometimes.\n\nWhat do you guys think?
