Gossip Cop, however, can exclusively debunk this bogus story.\n\nAccording to the National Enquirer, Harington recently purchased a home near Clooney\u2019s estate in England, and now Clooney is desperately trying to become friends with the TV star. A supposed \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine, \u201cGeorge has been pestering Kit with invites to his mansions in Berkshire and Lake Como \u2013 but he\u2019s in for disappointment. Kit doesn\u2019t want to be his new pal.\u201d\n\nThe outlet\u2019s dubious insider goes on to say Harington is trying to avoid the Hollywood scene, adding, \u201cKit\u2019s mind is pretty made up. He doesn\u2019t want to be George\u2019s buddy, but George keeps begging him to come away on a motorbike tour. It\u2019s getting annoying!\u201d The seemingly phony source adds, \u201cKit\u2019s home is too far to take a boat, thank goodness \u2013 or else George would probably row by.\u201d\n\nOf course, Clooney has a wife and newborn twins at home, so it seems very unlikely he\u2019s looking to spend his free time with a young actor he doesn\u2019t know. Regardless of how absurd the tabloid\u2019s story sounds, Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the situation, who laughed off the report before assuring us it\u2019s \u201cfalse.\u201d Unfortunately, the Enquirer has a habit of publishing phony reports about the movie star, so this latest piece of fiction comes as no surprise.\n\nGossip Cop recently called out the tabloid for making up a story about Clooney loving his wife Amal\u2019s \u201cpregnancy curves.\u201d We also busted the outlet after it concocted a tall tale about Clooney\u2019s baby boy peeing in his face during a diaper change. This latest article from the untrustworthy publication is similarly untrue.\n\nhttps://www.gossipcop.com/george-clooney-kit-harington-friends-begging-hang-out/Truth rating: 0", "images": ["https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/twitte12.jpg", "https://7img.net/users/2515/13/22/24/avatars/1224-70.jpg", "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/button37.jpg", "https://7img.net/users/2515/13/22/24/avatars/1112-12.jpg", "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/logo3s10.jpg", "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/button36.jpg", "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/facebo13.jpg", "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/button26.jpg", "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/button29.jpg", "https://7img.net/users/2515/13/22/24/avatars/2-43.jpg", "https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/George-Clooney-Kit-Harington-Friends-645x395.jpg", "https://7img.net/users/2515/13/22/24/avatars/393-38.jpg", "https://illiweb.com/fa/empty.gif"], "top_img": "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/logo3s10.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.clooneysopenhouse.com/t7857-george-clooneys-game-of-thrones-crush-blows-him-off", "title": "George Clooney\u2019s \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Crush Blows Him Off", "meta_data": {"description": "Hello gossip cop, where are you? \u00a0The national enquirer has something new for you to debunk: http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/george-clooney-begs-kit-harri", "og": {"title": "George Clooney\u2019s \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Crush Blows Him Off", "site_name": "www.clooneysopenhouse.com", "url": "https://www.clooneysopenhouse.com/t7857-george-clooneys-game-of-thrones-crush-blows-him-off", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.servimg.com/u/f44/15/94/75/48/logo3s10.jpg", "description": "Hello gossip cop, where are you? \u00a0The national enquirer has something new for you to debunk: http://radaronline.com/celebrity-news/george-clooney-begs-kit-harri"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Forumotion", "title": "George Clooney\u2019s \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Crush Blows Him Off"}, "title": "George Clooney\u2019s \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Crush Blows Him Off"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.clooneysopenhouse.com", "summary": ""}
