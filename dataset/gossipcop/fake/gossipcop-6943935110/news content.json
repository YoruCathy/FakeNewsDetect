This summer, the same thing is happening, but there\u2019s one crucial difference: Artists are throwing everything they have into projects with actual concrete release dates. By the end of June alone, we\u2019re all but guaranteed to have new albums from Kanye West, Drake, Pusha-T, Christina Aguilera, and much more. By the end of summer, there\u2019s a very real chance that a Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z album could exist \u2026 or maybe not? Check out the list of just some of the (major, major) highlights of this summer\u2019s stacked crop of album releases. If all of these actually come out in the next three months, maybe everyone can take the rest of the year off from making music so we can catch up.\n\nChvrches, Love Is Dead (May 25)\n\nChvrches never gets enough credit for arriving early to modern pop music\u2019s booming trap/EDM party, but one hopes the new Love Is Dead will win the Glasgow trio the respect it deserves for its solid track record of windswept hooks and disarming lyrics. The sticky melodies and explosive drums of the new single \u201cMiracle\u201d seem to suggest that lead singer Lauren Mayberry and her bandmates Martin Doherty and Iain Cook are playing for keeps the third time around. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nPusha-T, Daytona (May 25)\n\nAs far as excuses for not releasing an album go, being president of Kanye West\u2019s record label isn\u2019t bad at all. The sequel to Pusha-T\u2019s 2013 solo debut, My Name Is My Name, has been awaited for so long that many a fan might have forgotten to await it any longer; even the brief prelude album, Darkest Before Dawn, that Push released to tide listeners over is three years old at this point. To be sure, the ex-Clipse rapper has had his hands full since being named head of GOOD Music (just imagine having to field responses to Kanye\u2019s recent antics), but he\u2019s long overdue for a collection of his own quality sound. Here\u2019s hoping that Daytona\u2019s Ye-curated beats and Push\u2019s hallmark coke-rap lyrics are enough to stem the drought. \u2014Frank Guan\n\nFather John Misty, God\u2019s Favorite Customer (June 1)\n\nIf Father John Misty could cut back on his antics long enough to let his music speak for itself, he might enjoy a reputation as one of the sharper singer-songwriters working today. He can be a ham off record, but in song, he is a humorist whose preening nihilism is a mirror on the principal absurdity of being alive right now, and whose earnest moments deal in heartbreaking sentimentality. The forthcoming God\u2019s Favorite Customer is a batch of clever, silly love songs like \u201cDisappointing Diamonds Are the Rarest of Them All\u201d and gutting confessionals like \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Die.\u201d \u2014CJ\n\nNatalie Prass, The Future and the Past (June 1)\n\nNatalie Prass is a singer-songwriter as true to the form as they come. She makes quietly devastating songs that are committed to that genre\u2019s fundamentals, but her new album is something different. It\u2019s what singer-songwriters sound like when they experiment with jazz and give their sound an old-school R&B sheen. Her new music is polished and upbeat (\u201cSisters, \u201cShort Court Style\u201d), reminiscent of Feist at her best. Every ounce of fun that it sounds like Natalie had making the record comes through, from front to back. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nOneohtrix Point Never, Age Of (June 1)\n\nAfter a productive few years that included scoring the Safdie Brothers\u2019 film Good Time, collaborating with FKA Twigs, Anohni, and David Byrne, opening for Nine Inch Nails, and releasing his seventh album as Oneohtrix Point Never, Garden of Delete, Dan Lopatin is back with the follow up to GoD. It\u2019s a more subdued affair, and it\u2019s often paranoid and beautiful \u2014 filled with dread, anxiety, and a fractured take on rock mythology as filtered through prog, smooth jazz, and noise music. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nKanye West, TBA (June 1)\n\nKanye West\u2019s cockiness has always been a gift and a curse, but the rapper\u2019s last month of questionable political and ideological choices still feels impossible to process. It\u2019s tough to take your eyes off modern pop music\u2019s most controversial and compelling figure, even when he looks to be hurtling into a bad space and carrying you with him. New music is imminent; one hopes it breaks the trollish tone of the scat rhyme \u201cLift Yourself\u201d and the dry Inherit the Wind vibes of the combination rap battle and political debate \u201cYe vs. the People.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t \u2026 it was a good run. \u2014CJ\n\nJorja Smith, Lost & Found (June 8)\n\nThere are a lot of singers born from the SoundCloud R&B generation that, like their rap counterparts, all kind of blend together. But Jorja Smith stands out because she\u2019s vocally a touch above the rest: She sings at whisper volume like all her peers have apparently been trained to do, but there\u2019s so much quality, clarity, and texture to her voice that you forgive her for playing to the trend. Jorja\u2019s a bit Gabrielle, a bit Sade, and a whole lot of pure talent. Her debut album is not to be missed. \u2014DL\n\nLily Allen, No Shame (June 8)\n\nYou either like Lily Allen, really fuck with her, or think she\u2019s a hack. There\u2019s really no in-between. Lily Allen has been polarizing from out of the gate. Her new music, though, wrestles with getting older, motherhood, and the tremendous personal loss she\u2019s experienced in her life. How do you exist as an adult when you\u2019re still emotionally an adolescent? Lily Allen\u2019s still figuring it out, and she sounds better for it. Skeptical? Give \u201cHigher\u201d a spin. \u2014DL\n\nSerpentwithfeet, toil (June 8)\n\nJosiah Wise, who records as serpentwithfeet, has a voice that sounds sacred. It\u2019s too big to be intimate, but too fragile to be for everyone. In other words, this isn\u2019t music you\u2019re going to throw on at your next summer barbecue. If you can, unplug all the electronics in your house, close all the windows, and sweat through the whole album in one go. You\u2019ll come out the other side feeling like you went through something spiritual. \u2014SHS\n\nSnail Mail, Lush (June 8)\n\nSnail Mail\u2019s Lindsey Jordan is only 18 years old, but she\u2019s already got the genre buzzing about her. And for good reason: Her songs are honest and shockingly self-aware for her age, and she knows how to write a memorable hook (\u201cDon\u2019t you like me for me?\u201d on \u201cPristine\u201d gets me every time). \u2014DL\n\nLykke Li, so sad so sexy (June 8)\n\nWe could tell you that Lykke Li\u2019s new album sounds part trap, part lush pop, and part completely indescribable \u2014 kind of like all the music of her past but with a Charli XCX filter (see: \u201chard rain\u201d). Or we could just tell you that the Meryl Streep is apparently a big, big fan. What more do you need to know? \u2014DL\n\nKids See Ghost, Kids See Ghost (June 8)\n\nIt\u2019s not rude, at this point, to suggest that the partnership between Kanye and Kid Cudi has seen better days. Though highly influential on a younger generation, Cudi\u2019s left-field, art-damaged hip-hop has suffered from bloat and aimlessness in recent years; Ye\u2019s reputation for keen trendspotting and canny trendsetting has hardly fared better. Uniting under the banner of Kids See Ghost, the duo\u2019s first album together will show how much they have left to bring out in each other. \u2014FG\n\nKanye and Nas, TBA (June 15)\n\nRap summits like \u201cStill Dreaming,\u201d \u201cWe Major,\u201d and \u201cFigure It Out\u201d are proof Nas and Kanye West have great chemistry, so a full-length Nas album produced by West sounds like a hip-hop head\u2019s pipe dream. It exists now \u2026 but true to the crucible of improbability and disappointment that is 2018, both men have come under fire in the weeks since the project was announced, Ye for attempting to establish a brotherly rapport with Donald Trump, and Nas for an interview in which his ex-wife Kelis said that he got physical with her during disputes. Does it come up on the record? Do they carry on business as usual? Can they? \u2014CJ\n\nChristina Aguilera, Liberation (June 15)\n\nWhat does an Xtina album sound like in 2018? That\u2019s the million-dollar question, given her six-year absence from making music. Christina has struggled to adapt to the evolving pop sphere \u2014 usually because she\u2019s ahead of the curve. Lately, she\u2019s been continuing her tradition of weird collaborative choices by having Kanye West co-produce Liberation\u2019s first single, \u201cAccelerate\u201d (and he has another on the album), but her second single with Demi Lovato, \u201cFall in Line,\u201d is more traditional Big Pop vocal gymnastics. Which means this album could go either way. \u2014DL\n\nJay Rock, Redemption (June 15)\n\nJay Rock is an extremely charismatic rapper, which is why it feels odd to say that he\u2019s also TDE\u2019s secret weapon. He\u2019s forceful, with a cocky sense of humor. He\u2019s got a great ear for beats, and, in the form of \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d he\u2019s already in possession of one of the year\u2019s best singles (\u201cWin\u201d isn\u2019t too shabby either). For whatever reason, though, he hasn\u2019t carved out the same distinct lane for himself as Kendrick, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul have. Whatever happens, Redemption has a strong chance at being a standout of 2018. \u2014SHS\n\nOnyx Collective, Lower East Side Suite Part Three (June 15)\n\nThat this is not the only jazz album on this list says a lot about the extended, multiyear moment jazz is having in pop culture right now. Onyx Collective, the crew of downtown New York jazz kids, are making music that recalls the genre\u2019s greats, without being beholden to years and years of jazz rules and stuffiness. This is vital music made by a bunch of people who are young enough that they\u2019ll soon make something transcendent. \u2014SHS\n\nGang Gang Dance, Kazuashita (June 22)\n\nGang Gang Dance, 21st-century art-music heroes of downtown New York, are back with their first album since 2011\u2019s Eye Contact. The musical landscape has shifted since then, but the band\u2019s qualities are still intact. They still sound like a band entirely without musical boundaries, and they still have a knack for pulling together disparate elements \u2014 think traces of Japanese New Age, poolside house, and modern classical composition \u2014 into a whole that somehow actually all fits together. \u2014SHS\n\nKamasi Washington, Heaven and Earth (June 22)\n\nKamasi Washington is not known for his brevity. His albums regularly run over two hours, and only become truly rewarding after repeat listens. But still, anything Washington does is worth paying attention to. His sax playing was a crucial part of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly, and his previous looooong player, 2015\u2019s The Epic, catapulted him into a strange world where jazz that leaned toward the spiritual was suddenly right at home on major festival stages all over the globe. Will his new album go further down that path? Will it be the album where Washington decides to get truly weird? Whatever happens, Heaven and Earth is another entry in the catalogue of an artist who is carving out an important space for himself at the intersection of popular music and new jazz. \u2014SHS\n\nNine Inch Nails, Bad Witch (June 22)\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since the last album from Trent Reznor\u2019s band, but the profile of the industrial auteur and his crew has remained high. With a pair of EPs, much touring, and a beyond-electrifying performance on the new season of Twin Peaks under their belt, Nine Inch Nails remain one of the more polished monoliths left standing in rock\u2019s world of rusty titans. Will their punishing aesthetic yield new revelations? In either case, much grimness awaits. \u2014FG\n\nTeyana Taylor, TBA (June 22)\n\nA lifetime seems to have passed between now and the release of Teyana Taylor\u2019s debut album, VII, in 2014. Then and now, Kanye West\u2019s GOOD Music is Taylor\u2019s label, but GOOD Music no longer carries the same meaning or cachet that it used to: With Kanye drifting into fields other than music, the label has been effectively rudderless. It\u2019s hardly the situation a gifted R&B singer still searching for her breakout collection would want, but it\u2019s the one Taylor\u2019s stuck with; no doubt she\u2019ll be doing her best to make her own voice heard over the unruly cant of her executive producer. \u2014FG\n\nFlorence + The Machine, High As Hope (June 29)\n\nA voice as huge as Florence Welch\u2019s was bound to tip fully into the mainstream at some point, and if the credits for her upcoming fourth album are any indication, that point is now. It\u2019s a tasteful turn, of course: Executive producer Emile Haynie (Bruno Mars, Lana Del Rey) governs the transition, with Jamie xx and Sampha pitching in on a track each. \u201cSky Full of Song\u201d and \u201cHunger,\u201d the two lead singles, suggest a collection whose beauty lies in its boldness; even before its release, High As Hope is living up to its name. \u2014FG\n\nLet\u2019s Eat Grandma, I\u2019m All Ears (June 29)\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to mention the British indie-pop duo Let\u2019s Eat Grandma without mentioning their extreme precocity. With both members still in their teens, the fact can\u2019t easily be overlooked. Perhaps aided by the fact that they\u2019ve been friends since childhood, Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth have already succeeded in carving out a strange lane of their own. Their sound borrows widely without ever sounding derivative; as the three singles for their sophomore effort I\u2019m All Ears show, they come in at smart, weird, synthetic angles with a lot of verve. \u2014FG\n\nDirty Projectors, Lamp Lit Prose (July 13)\n\nDave Longstreth is full of ideas and in a rush to transmit them. Dirty Projectors, his band, released its first four albums in the space of three years; the pace slackened somewhat once Amber Coffman joined the band on vocals and guitar, but now that Coffman and Longstreth have broken up, he seems eager to make up for lost time. From the looks of the single \u201cBreak-Thru,\u201d the successor to last year\u2019s breakup album, Dirty Projectors, is shaping up to be bizarre. \u2014FG\n\nNicki Minaj, Queen (August 10)\n\nThe title of Nicki\u2019s new album, her fourth, takes two meanings at once: Along with its usual regal meaning, it\u2019s a reference to her home borough of Queens. In both cases, there\u2019s a sense of reiteration that suggests either renewal or exhaustion. Little that has passed since the 2014 release of The Pinkprint has dented Nicki\u2019s commercial appeal or her superstar status, but all the same, her lyrics have showed signs of staleness and her public image has lost some of its candy-colored luster. Not to mention how, in the distant Bronx, a new monarch has been crowned. You don\u2019t have to compare Nicki to Cardi or Queen to Invasion of Privacy, but if you do, the comparison is only going to flatter one side. Can Nicki\u2019s punch lines and posturing outmatch Cardi\u2019s realism and novelty? There\u2019s only one way to find out. \u2014FG\n\nMitski, Be the Cowboy (August 17)\n\nMitski\u2019s music works through concentration: By giving up range, it gains in intensity. The solo artist\u2019s indie rock locks onto her relationship status and seizes it for dear life. It\u2019s an aesthetic that doesn\u2019t expand or expound, but also doesn\u2019t need to. The fundamentals are always complicated enough if you really zoom in. The title of the lead single, \u201cGeyser,\u201d is a helpful metaphor \u2014 an abrupt blast of feeling that ends no less abruptly. After Be the Cowboy comes out, expect Mitski\u2019s small but fanatical audience to grow somewhat less small and even more fanatical than ever. \u2014FG\n\nAnderson .Paak, TBA (TBA)\n\nLike the brilliant rapper and producer Madlib, Anderson .Paak is from Oxnard, California. Also like Madlib, .Paak\u2019s whole style to date skews more toward smoking weed at sunrise and spending days buried in mounds of rare records as a way of avoiding the harsh realities of the world. Up to this point, .Paak\u2019s music has existed largely in the realm of stoned soul and introspective rap that took its time to get to where it wanted to go. Then he released \u201cBubblin,\u201d a track that manages to evoke Busta Rhymes\u2019s hoarse growl without being annoying about it. Songs this good don\u2019t really tend to come out in a vacuum, which (hopefully) means we\u2019ll be getting a full album from .Paak this summer. \u2014SHS\n\nWild Nothing, TBA (TBA)\n\nGemini, the 2010 debut LP from Jack Tatum, a.k.a. Wild Nothing, was a gorgeous slice of bedroom pop that \u2014 stay with me here \u2014 sounded like a warm summer evening. That\u2019s a major clich\u00e9, but I\u2019m using it because it\u2019s really the best way to capture the combination of hope and calm that radiated from every track on that album. Ensuing releases were more robust and fleshed out with a full band. While they didn\u2019t retain the same magic as the first LP, they made up for it through instrumental intricacy and strong hooks. We\u2019re due for another Wild Nothing album this summer, and while it\u2019d be a long shot to assume that it would have the same low-budget (in a good way), gauzy feel of Gemini, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be another excellent entry in the catalogue of a project that has virtually perfected the art of writing about romance. \u2014SHS\n\nPopcaan, Forever (TBA)\n\nThere are few better songs than Popcaan\u2019s \u201cEverything Nice.\u201d I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best song of all time, but it belongs in a category that bears the hallmarks of perfection: It\u2019s catchy, wistful, warm, and though it sounds very much like the era we live in, it\u2019s not going to sound dated in a couple decades either. With the bar set that high, it\u2019s not surprising that Popcaan\u2019s \u201cBody So Good,\u201d the first single from his upcoming album Forever, is not as good as \u201cEverything Nice,\u201d but what is? It\u2019s just another sign that Forever is going to be full of jams to soundtrack pretty much anything you\u2019d ever want to do outside. \u2014SHS\n\nMozzy, TBA (TBA)\n\nSacramento\u2019s Mozzy, already hugely popular in some rap circles, got offered a prime spot on the Kendrick Lamar\u2013helmed Black Panther soundtrack, and in a perfect world, it would open the door to a whole new swath of fans who didn\u2019t even realize that they needed Mozzy in their lives. The main question for me: Will this album reach the heights of 2017\u2019s excellent 1 Up Top Ahk, which was an often brutal, touching meditation on violence, death, and the struggles that come from both? \u2014SHS\n\nSOB X RBE, TBA (TBA)\n\nThe Bay Area teen rappers of SOB x RBE are spiky, enthusiastic rhymers whose syllables sometimes tumble out so quickly it feels like they\u2019re racing against time. The quartet\u2019s first two mixtapes, SOB x RBE and GANGIN, were cluster bombs bursting with youthful energy, banging West Coast beats, clever sample choices, and frightening, precocious street wisdom. A studio album is a chance to build on what has been a great start. It\u2019ll be exciting to watch this group grow. \u2014CJ\n\nBrockhampton, Puppy (June TBA)\n\nMusic fans are impatient. Pretty much the second after an album comes out, we\u2019re speculating about a follow-up. It\u2019s definitely unhealthy, but I get it: It\u2019s exciting to think that an artist you love may have the best song you\u2019ve ever heard in their back pocket, and they just need to get it together to release it. Brockhampton \u2014 the rap group/boy band (they\u2019re really just a rap group but they call themselves a boy band, so let\u2019s just go with it) \u2014 released three albums in 2017, each one better than the previous, which implies that Puppy, which is probably an album and not an actual baby dog, and is potentially due to come out next month, could be their most fully realized work yet. \u2014SHS\n\nDrake, Scorpion (June TBA)\n\nIf you read much astrology, you know that Scorpios are said to be passionate, guarded, occasionally vengeful people. If you listen to much Drake, you\u2019ve often heard \u201cOctober\u2019s Very Own\u201d live up to the characteristics of his sign. Drake naming the next album Scorpion and leading with a song like \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d \u2014 where the rapper-singer celebrates his friends and successes while obsessing over the many people he knows can\u2019t stand him \u2014 most likely means this summer we\u2019ll be awash in joyous, passive-aggressive jams like \u201cEnergy\u201d and \u201cFake Love.\u201d \u2014CJ\n\nAriana Grande, Sweetener (July TBA)\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Ariana Grande\u2019s fourth album so far: It\u2019s led by the outstanding U.K. garage-indebted first single, \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d; was half produced by Pharrell, and the other half by Max Martin; will reportedly sound like 1,000 Arianas multiplied and layered over each other; song titles include \u201cGod Is a Woman\u201d (!!!) and \u201cGet Well Soon\u201d; and she took the lead on writing all of its songs for the first time in her career. Oh, and if it\u2019s about love, then that lover will no longer be Mac Miller, but SNL\u2019s Pete Davidson. She said just this week that she\u2019s been adding more songs, so it\u2019s possible! \u2014DL\n\nTroye Sivan, Bloom (August 31)\n\nBy now it should be clear what our sweet prince Troye Sivan intends to serve with his sophomore album, Bloom: bops on bops on more bops. \u201cMy My My!\u201d and \u201cBloom\u201d are a breath of fresh air in the straight-and-narrow pop landscape, and it appears his new album will lean even heavier on the \u201980s pop palette he clearly loves. If Hayley Kiyoko is our Lesbian Jesus, Troye Sivan is the Gay Holy Spirit. #20GayTeen is still going strong! \u2014DL\n\nCarrie Underwood, Cry Pretty (September 14)\n\nCarrie Underwood is one of the great singers of our time; her rise to country industry dominance is one of American Idol\u2019s most resounding success stories. Across records like \u201cBefore He Cheats,\u201d \u201cBlown Away,\u201d and \u201cChurch Bells,\u201d Underwood offers note-perfect vocal performances and intimate glimpses into the struggles of complicated American women. If the boiling intensity of the title track is any indication, this year\u2019s Cry Pretty will serve up more of the same. \u2014CJ\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, ???? (TBA)\n\nWhat are Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z up to? It\u2019s the perennial question of our time. But for the purposes of this list, let\u2019s take a stab at answering it: On June 6, Bey and Hov will hit the road for the sequel to their On the Run tour, which can mean two things. (1) They\u2019ll use this as another opportunity to promote their old solo work in a two-for-one deal, or (2) they have that long-rumored joint album (which was recently confirmed by Jay-Z to exist) dropping imminently. The two were spotted in Jamaica pre-Beychella filming visuals for something, so stay tuned. \u2014DL\n\nA$AP Rocky, Testing (TBA)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fault Rocky for being late with his third album, the dude has had a lot on his plate. Since A$AP Yams\u2019s untimely death, he\u2019s had to take over direction of the entire A$AP crew; between building bridges with the fashion world and bringing projects from his affiliates into fruition, the question wasn\u2019t whether Testing would be delayed, but for how long. Specific details are lacking, but heralded by the tripped-out video for the Moby-sampling \u201cA$AP Forever,\u201d Rocky\u2019s Testing album is sure to show off an artist carefully negotiating between disparate realms: Harlem streets and Paris runways, the sounds of the South and the East. \u2014FG\n\nChildish Gambino, TBA (TBA)\n\nIf the fifth element of hip-hop is arguing, then the sixth is wild speculation \u2014 so let\u2019s do some speculating. In between beefing up the Star Wars franchise and making the best television show, Donald Glover has been working on new music.
