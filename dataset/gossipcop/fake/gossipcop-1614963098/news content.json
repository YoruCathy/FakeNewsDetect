The once saccharine pop star has slowly evolved into the calculated queen of the long game. Her machinations range from admirably extra (buying a house next door to the Kennedy compound in a thinly veiled attempt to marry a Kennedy) to just too much (the \u201cI heart T.S.\u201d tank top). And that\u2019s just her personal life\u2014when it comes to professional supremacy, Taylor Swift outsmarts every one of her competitors. She has more hits, receives more press (good and bad), and will threaten to sue the shit out of any Etsy seller who gets in her way. Most importantly, Taylor Alison Swift has way more UPS trucks with her face on them than any of her peers.\n\nWhile the foundation of Swift\u2019s success is her ability to write good songs that speak to the middle-school loser in all of us, her fame feeds on a regular diet of romantic gossip and celebrity feuds. If Taylor Swift isn\u2019t in the news because a B-lister may or may not be planning to propose to her, she\u2019s making tabloid headlines for her prime beefs. Following a Swift feud all the way from its inception, it becomes abundantly clear that you do not want to get on this woman\u2019s bad side, because she is smarter and shows far more restraint than the average human being. Also, she might run you over with a UPS truck.\n\nAs an example, let\u2019s look at Taylor Swift vs. Katy Perry. When this feud first flared up in 2014, it seemed like a perfect match-up between two major pop stars. In a Rolling Stone interview, Swift revealed the circumstances behind her single \u201cBad Blood,\u201d referencing an unnamed female peer. \u201cFor years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\u201d Swift said. \u201cShe would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away and I would think, \u2018Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?\u2019\u201d Eventually, it was confirmed that Perry hired some of Swift\u2019s backup dancers\u2014or as Swift put it, she \u201cbasically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.\u201d In keeping with the PG nature of this beef, which felt more like an argument staged through AIM away messages than a public showdown between two adults, Perry responded with a Mean Girls reference: \u201cWatch out for the Regina George in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d\n\nIn a move that basically made Perry\u2019s point for her, Swift assembled her squad of models to star alongside her in the \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video, literally ganging up on Katy Perry. Since \u201cBad Blood\u201d is a banger, people seemed to overlook the fact that the mean-spirited video was completely at odds with the girl power feminism that Swift and her girl squad allegedly stood for. Katy Perry tried to counter-attack, but her attempts paled in comparison. \u201cSwish Swish,\u201d a much-hyped Swift diss track featuring Nicki Minaj, was corny and boring. The video, in which Perry attempted humor and basketball and failed at both, was just further disappointment. Somehow, the turban-wearing, therapy session-live-streaming queen of doing too much had produced a thoroughly tepid clap back.\n\nHaving failed to elect Hillary Clinton or dethrone Taylor Swift, Perry has seemingly retreated, emerging every so often to kiss an American Idol contestant without their consent or debut a new set of 6-foot-tall Versace wings. And so it was hardly a surprise when a defeated Perry was revealed to have reached out to Taylor Swift with a literal olive branch on Tuesday, effectively ending their years-long feud.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that in a 2017 interview, Perry talked about the Swift situation with James Corden, insisting, \u201cI tried to talk to her about it and she wouldn\u2019t speak to me. She started it, and it\u2019s time for her to finish it.\u201d So the fact that Perry ended up initiating the truce is quite a coup for Swift; no wonder she bragged about the ceasefire on her social media.\n\nIn a 2017 meditation on Swift\u2019s single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Vulture\u2019s Mark Harris called it a \u201ctour de force of deflective petulance.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a catalogue of every public feud she\u2019s had that, without naming them, manages to extend, mock, and, most important, commodify them.\u201d Swift, who\u2019s just as horny for profit as she is for Kennedys, will suck any feud dry. Whether or not she started it, she will get the most out of it\u2014attention, sympathy, or, preferably, a hit single. Anyone who tries to argue that Swift is simply reacting in real time, without an endgame or artifice, needs to re-examine the particulars of her never-ending, infamous feud with Kanye West. While Swift did not initiate the drama, she did play into it\u2014until she got burned, at which point she hilariously requested to be \u201cexcluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.\u201d\n\n\u201c Swift, who got her friends to dress up in pleather and publicly come for Katy Perry, is about as convincing an anti-bullying advocate as Melania Trump. \u201d\n\nWhile Swift did briefly disengage, trading her boyfriend for a slightly more anonymous boyfriend and hiding out in her apartment and/or luggage for a bit, she eventually re-emerged only to take more shots at Kanye West. Reputation is not the work of someone who wants to be excluded from a narrative, but rather that of someone who\u2019s been told, time and time again, that this victim narrative is unflattering, counter-factual, and potentially dangerous, but just doesn\u2019t give a shit. For Swift, playing the victim is familiar and comforting, like winged eyeliner and red lips or curling up in the fetal position inside of a giant suitcase. In \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Swift isn\u2019t subtle about calling Kanye out on his \u201clittle games\u201d and \u201ctilted stage.\u201d On \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d she adds, \u201cIt was so nice being friends again / There I was, giving you a second chance / But then you stabbed my back while shaking my hand / And therein lies the issue / Friends don\u2019t try to trick you/ Get you on the phone and mind-twist you.\u201d\n\nConveniently for Swift, Kanye West\u2019s likability is at an all-time low right now\u2014which makes it a lot easier for her to twist the narrative and cast the rapper as her aggressor/bully. With Kim Kardashian busy dealing with West\u2019s sharp turn into Trump country, it\u2019s unlikely that this manipulation will backfire on Swift like it did last time.\n\nSwift has wasted no time taking advantage of these unique circumstances. During the opening night of her Reputation tour on Tuesday, Taylor was joined onstage by a bunch of enormous snake props\u2014her reclamation of the emoji that Kardashian West fans used to flood her social media. She explained her unusual set to fans, saying, \u201cA couple of years ago, someone called me a snake on social media and it caught on. Then a lot of people were calling me a lot of things on social media and I went through some really low times for a while because of it. I went through some times when I didn\u2019t know if I was going to get to do this anymore.\n\n\u201cI guess this means I wanted to send a message to you guys,\u201d Swift continued, \u201cthat if someone uses name calling to bully you on social media, and even if a lot of people jump on board with it, that doesn\u2019t have to defeat you. It can strengthen you instead.\u201d\n\nSwift, who got her friends to dress up in pleather and publicly come for Katy Perry, is about as convincing an anti-bullying advocate as Melania Trump. In a better, more just world, Kanye\u2019s valid points about how he was unfairly punished and demonized in the wake of Swift-gate wouldn\u2019t be drowned out by his Candace Owens-approved soundbites, and no one would buy this social media victim bullshit. And in a more interesting world, Swift would pull out one of her rare unabashedly petty moves, like when she released her entire back catalogue on Spotify to coincide with Katy Perry\u2019s album release. She could even stick it to Kanye by finally announcing who she voted for. Unfortunately, Swift is too smart to be so blatant. This feud won\u2019t end with a bang or a bold outmaneuvering. It will peter out, slowly, unspectacularly, when Taylor Swift decides that she has nothing left to gain.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1525899436/180509-zimmerman-katy-perry-taylor-swift-hero-1_tyum67", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1525899436/180509-zimmerman-katy-perry-taylor-swift-hero-1_tyum67", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1525899436/180509-zimmerman-katy-perry-taylor-swift-hero-1_tyum67", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-taylor-swift-kicking-kanye-and-kim-while-theyre-down", "title": "Is Taylor Swift Kicking Kanye and Kim While They\u2019re Down?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Is Taylor Swift Kicking Kanye and Kim While They\u2019re Down?", "keywords": "Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Kanye West", "og": {"title": "Is Taylor Swift Kicking Kanye and Kim While They\u2019re Down?", "description": "While Katy Perry is finally off the hook, Swift doubled down on her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, just as the rapper\u2019s MAGA mania has soured him in the public eye.", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-taylor-swift-kicking-kanye-and-kim-while-theyre-down", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1525899436/180509-zimmerman-katy-perry-taylor-swift-hero-1_tyum67"}, "description": "While Katy Perry is finally off the hook, Swift doubled down on her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, just as the rapper\u2019s MAGA mania has soured him in the public eye.", "authors": "Amy Zimmerman", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2018-05-09T21:35:58.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/amy-zimmerman"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@ahzimm", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1525899436/180509-zimmerman-katy-perry-taylor-swift-hero-1_tyum67"}, "sailthru.date": "2018-05-09T21:35:58.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2018-05-23T21:35:58.000Z", "publicationDate": 201805092135, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Amy Zimmerman\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-taylor-swift-kicking-kanye-and-kim-while-theyre-down\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\",\"rubric\":\"VILLAINOUS\"},\"post_id\":\"is-taylor-swift-kicking-kanye-and-kim-while-theyre-down\",\"pub_date\":\"2018-05-09T21:35:58+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"tags\":[\"Taylor Swift\",\"Kim Kardashian West\",\"Katy Perry\",\"Kanye West\",\"typeArticle\"],\"title\":\"Is Taylor Swift Kicking Kanye and Kim While They\u2019re Down?\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525901758.0, "source": "http://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
