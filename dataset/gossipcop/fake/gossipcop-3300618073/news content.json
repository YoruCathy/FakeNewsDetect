He was still married to actress Jennifer Garner at the time.\n\nThe next month, witnesses spotted Affleck and Shookus acting \u201cflirty\u201d at a premiere afterparty for the movie \u201cThe Heat.\u201d They were at the bar of the Stone Rose Lounge on New York City\u2019s Upper West Side, \u201cchatting and laughing together.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe definitely looked interested in her,\u201d a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar.\n\nSince then, Affleck would always stop by and visit her at the \u201cSNL\u201d studios whenever he was appearing on Jimmy Fallon\u2019s show, according to a source. \u201cThey were both married at the time, but there was definitely a flirtation.\u201d\n\nDarrell Hammond (left) and Lindsay Shookus (center) attend The Museum Gala at American Museum of Natural History on Nov. 16, 2006 in New York City.

The insider said that Affleck and Shookus were having a \u201cfull-blown affair,\u201d contending that, \u201cThey were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could.\u201d\n\nGet more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.\n\nSign up for our Coffee Break newsletter here.\n\nBoth Garner and Shookus\u2019 ex-husband, Kevin Miller, discovered the relationship in 2015, the Garner source claims, saying, \u201cThey were devastated when they found out about the affair.\u201d\n\nBut Us Weekly also says that Garner has since come to terms with her estranged husband\u2019s relationship with Shookus.\n\nThose who talked to People insist that Affleck and Shookus were \u201cjust friends\u201d up until a few months ago. The romance is \u201crelatively new,\u201d a source told People, adding, \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a long time. Marriages break up for a number of reasons.\u201d\n\nYet another source backs up that claim that that their relationship has been platonic until recently, saying \u201cthis is newer waters for them. \u2026 They\u2019ve been trying to take it slow but it\u2019s progressing quickly. Their feelings are strong.\u201d\n\nE! News previously reported that Affleck met up with Shookus in London recently, where they enjoyed a number of dates. A source told E! that they are in the early stages of a relationship, but insisted: \u201cIt\u2019s more than a summer fling.\u201d\n\nAffleck and Garner filed for divorce in April. They previously announced they were separating in 2015 after more than a decade of marriage. They have three children together \u2014 Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5 \u2014 and continue to closely co-parent them.\n\nShookus previously married Miller, a then-fellow SNL producer, in 2010 before splitting a few years ago. They share one child.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14oscars_5.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "http://thumbnail.newsinc.com/32660881.sf.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/14oscars_5.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
