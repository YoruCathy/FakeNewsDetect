What I mean, you can\u2019t see it, but it\u2019s super, superthin. I looked at how much Tiffany\u2019s [cost] and I was like, \u2018They\u2019re how much? This is astronomical.\u2019 So I went on Etsy and I was like, \u2018$90?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Buy now!\u2019 $90, everybody!

We took them to the bird lady that you recommended and when we brought our little lovebirds in to get their nails trimmed \u2014 you know, things that people do with birds \u2014 she informed us that we, in fact, did not have lovebirds.
