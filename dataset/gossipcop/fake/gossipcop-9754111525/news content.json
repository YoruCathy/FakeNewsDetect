That\u2019s according to a new report in \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201d\n\nOf course, at this stage, things are still pretty new, which means \u201cit\u2019s not serious,\u201d a source told ET.\n\nBut the so-called real estate agent, who has not been identified, reportedly has a few things going for him that would make him appealing to the glamorous 42-year-old actress and mother of six, ET said.\n\nHe\u2019s handsome, a source close to the actress told ET. He\u2019s also \u201colder-looking\u201d and isn\u2019t \u201ca celebrity or high-profile\u201d in any way, the source added. These are qualities that would probably make him relatively down-to-earth \u2014 by Jolie standards \u2014 and confer on him a maturity and stability that could be comforting to her.\n\nAfter all, she was \u201cin a very bad place\u201d after her acrimonious split from Pitt in September 2016, \u201cET\u201d reported. Their breakup included allegations of drinking and anger management problems \u2014 on his part \u2014 and led to investigations by child welfare authorities until the couple quietly worked out visitation and other issues. The estranged couple share children Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\n\u201cJust having another adult to spend time with has been helpful,\u201d the source added to ET.\n\nBut not so fast, sources have told both Us Weekly and People. Both outlets reported Tuesday, citing their own Jolie sources, that Jolie isn\u2019t dating a real estate agent \u2014 or anyone for that matter at the moment.\n\n\u201cYes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it\u2019s extremely low-key,\u201d a source told Us.\n\nUnfortunately, things are still difficult between her and Pitt, added The Daily Mail. \u201cThings between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they\u2019ve attempted therapy with the children, they can barely be in the same room together,\u201d a source said.\n\nABOVE: Today\u2019s top stories include an expansion at Yosemite\u2019s Bridal Falls to make parking easier, California is at odds with the feds again, this time it\u2019s over the 2020 census and find out how to ease your allergies woes now that the sun is back in the Bay Area.\n\nBecause the breakup has forced Jolie to curtail her globe-trotting ways and base herself in Los Angeles \u2014 close to Pitt for the sake of the children \u2014 there is speculation that if Jolie were seeing a real estate agent \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 the man would be based in Los Angeles, the Daily Mail said.\n\nAnd if there is a real estate agent with whom she has become friendly, he could be someone with celebrity clientele.\n\nPerhaps he could have been someone involved in settling Jolie into her new house \u2014 the $25 million estate in Los Feliz she bought last year, which once belonged to legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Incidentally, Jolie\u2019s mansion is \u201cjust down the street\u201d from Pitt\u2019s estate in Los Feliz \u2014 for the sake of the kids, of course.\n\nWhether or not there is a real estate agent boyfriend in Jolie\u2019s life, or she\u2019s just single and focusing on her kids, her friends are relieved to see her happy for a change, ET reported.\n\nShe also seems to have settled into enjoying her day-to-day life. She is often spotted out and about in Los Angeles, usually with one of her six kids in tow, doing ordinary-people things like shopping at a neighborhood Whole Foods or going to the movies \u2014 including, reportedly, the new \u201cTomb Raider\u201d reboot, starring Alicia Vikander in the iconic role that Jolie made famous in 2001\u2019s \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider\u201d and the 2003 sequel.\n\nBut fans should get over the idea that Jolie and Pitt will reunite. \u201cIt will never happen,\u201d a source told ET. The 54-year-old Pitt is quietly and casually going out on dates, but mostly getting out to spend time with friends, \u201cET\u201d added.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jolie_2.jpg?w=1024&h=733", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2000demilledr_1-800x500_c.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/joliehouse4.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/joliepittdivorce.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jolie_5.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jolie_2.jpg?w=1024&h=733", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
