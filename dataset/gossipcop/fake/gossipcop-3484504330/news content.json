The programme aims to recognize the work of exceptional young people and the work that they do within the Commonwealth nations.\n\nTaking on his new job in April 2018, Prince Harry said (via The Daily Mail), \"In my new role I will work to support The Queen, my father The Prince of Wales, and my brother William, all of whom know that young people are the answer to the challenges of today.\"\n\nAt the time, he made it clear that he wanted Meghan to join him, saying, \"I am also incredibly grateful that the woman I am about to marry, Meghan, will be joining me in this work, of which she too is hugely excited to take part in.\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.9996073812328229xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-974108668-1528993164.jpg?crop=1xw:0.69412xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-godmother-1529783045.jpg?crop=0.9997449630196379xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.9996073812328229xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a21923170/meghan-markle-taking-over-royal-duty-from-queen-elizabeth/", "title": "Meghan Markle Will Take Over One of Queen Elizabeth's Royal Duties", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Meghan Markle Will Take Over One of Queen Elizabeth's Royal Duties", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex is being given more responsibility.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a21923170/meghan-markle-taking-over-royal-duty-from-queen-elizabeth/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.9996073812328229xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-06-24 05:13:54", "published_time": "2018-06-24 05:13:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.9996073812328229xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Meghan Markle Taking Over a Royal Duty from Queen Elizabeth II - Duchess of Sussex Role", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex is being given more responsibility.", "keywords": "duchess meghan, duchess of sussex, meghan, meghan markle, meghan markle prince harry, meghan markle queen elizabeth, meghan markle queen elizabeth ii, meghan markle royal duties, meghan markle royal duty, meghan markle royal family, meghan markle the queen, prince harry, prince harry meghan markle, queen elizabeth, queen elizabeth ii", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.49980369061641144xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest,meghan markle queen elizabeth ii,meghan markle royal duties,meghan markle royal duty,duchess meghan,meghan markle queen elizabeth,duchess of sussex,meghan,meghan markle royal family,prince harry meghan markle,meghan markle the queen,meghan markle prince harry,Prince Harry,Meghan Markle,Queen Elizabeth,queen elizabeth II", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-24T17:13:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.9996073812328229xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-royal-duties-1529859602.jpg?crop=0.49980369061641144xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Meghan Markle Will Take Over One of Queen Elizabeth's Royal Duties", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529788380.0, "source": "http://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
