The object of several contestants' affection on the ABC dating show has taken to Instagram to debunk rumors that he and Lauren Bushnell have called it quits.\n\nThe Coloradan shared an image Wednesday that was taken shortly before the pair was engaged in Jamaica. In the sweet photograph, Lauren's eyes are blissfully closed as she revels in Ben's embrace.\n\nThough Ben doesn't feel the need to address the untruths, he assured his 1.5 million followers that his feelings for Lauren have not diminished.\n\n\"We have entered into a world where rumors will exist we know that,\" he wrote, \"but just know as @laurenbushnell celebrates her birthday tomorrow I am still extremely lucky to be able to share life with her and be by her side.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, the birthday girl had not responded to rumors of a break-up, probably because she was too busy posting envy-inducing photos from the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita in Mexico.\n\nWhile Ben was not pictured, about a week ago the two enjoyed a basketball game at Denver's Pepsi Center. They look cozy, don't you think?\n\nIt might be easy for some to believe the rumors since the couple had a tumultuous journey during season one of their reality show, Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After? Ben called their plans to have a televised wedding off because he didn't want to \"rush it,\" only to announce the wedding was back on in the show's season finale.\n\nFor, now this couple is still in the running to be a Bachelor success story.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97fa3a194161db765fb6bb8469b88911b65a4c3a/c=0-0-999-564/local/-/media/2017/02/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636216157106391553-144212-1753.jpg?width=999&height=564&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97fa3a194161db765fb6bb8469b88911b65a4c3a/c=0-0-999-564/local/-/media/2017/02/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636216157106391553-144212-1753.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/97fa3a194161db765fb6bb8469b88911b65a4c3a/c=0-0-999-564/local/-/media/2017/02/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636216157106391553-144212-1753.jpg?width=999&height=564&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/02/02/bachelor-ben-higgins-lauren-bushnell-split-rumors/97388098/", "title": "Ben Higgins fights 'fake news' of split with Lauren Bushnell with romantic Instagram", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Ben Higgins fights 'fake news' of split with Lauren Bushnell with romantic Instagram", "description": "'...
