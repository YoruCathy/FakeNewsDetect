After singing in church during her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music after Red Hill ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007.\n\nPerry rose to fame in 2008 with her second album, One of the Boys, a pop rock record containing the singles \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\". The former track also sparked controversy for its themes of lesbianism. Her third album, Teenage Dream (2010), ventured into disco, and was her first record to top the U.S. Billboard 200. It peaked at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 with the singles \"California Gurls\", \"Teenage Dream\", \"Firework\", \"E.T.\", and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\", while \"The One That Got Away\" reached number three on the chart. The album became the first by a female artist to produce five number one songs in the U.S., and the second overall after Michael Jackson's Bad. In 2012, Perry re-issued the album as Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, which produced the songs \"Part of Me\" and \"Wide Awake\". Her next record was Prism (2013), which became her second to top the U.S. charts. It is influenced by pop and dance, and she became the first artist with multiple videos to reach one billion views on Vevo with the videos for its songs \"Roar\" and \"Dark Horse\". She followed this with 2017's Witness, which delved into electropop and became her third album to chart at number one in the U.S. \"Chained to the Rhythm\" was the album's most successful single, breaking Spotify's record at the time for most first-day streams for a song by a female artist.\n\nPerry has received various awards, including four Guinness World Records, five Billboard Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, a Juno Award, and thirteen Grammy Award nominations. She has been included in the annual Forbes lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011\u20132019. Her estimated net worth as of 2016 is $125 million. She is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 18 million albums and 125 million singles worldwide. In film, she released an autobiographical documentary titled Katy Perry: Part of Me in 2012, and voiced Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs and its sequel in 2013. Perry also began serving as a judge on American Idol in 2018.\n\nLife and career\n\n1984\u20131998: Early life\n\nKatheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in Santa Barbara, California, to Pentecostal pastors Mary Christine (n\u00e9e Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson.[2] Her parents are born again Christians, each having turned to religion after a \"wild youth\".[3] Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry.[4] Through her mother, she is a niece of film director Frank Perry.[5] She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer,[6] and an older sister, Angela.[7]\n\nFrom ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in Arizona and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her elementary years.[2][8] Her family struggled financially,[9] sometimes using food stamps and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.[10]\n\nGrowing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the word \"luck\" reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs \"angeled eggs\".[11] Perry primarily listened to gospel music,[12] as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends.[13] While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, \"I pray all the time \u2013 for self-control, for humility.\"[14] Wanting to be like her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who let her take vocal lessons as Angela was at the time. She began training at age 9,[15] and was incorporated into her parents' ministry,[3] singing in church from ages 9 to 17.[16] At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday,[3][17] and publicly performed songs she wrote.[9] She tried to \"be a bit like the typical Californian girl\" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Perry's brother David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence.[18] She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.[19]\n\n1999\u20132006: Career beginnings\n\nPerry completed her General Educational Development (GED) requirements at age 15,[20] during her freshman year of high school,[21] and left Dos Pueblos High School to pursue a musical career.[22] She briefly had music lessons in facilities rented from the Music Academy of the West.[23] Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and Jennifer Knapp from Nashville, Tennessee, who brought her there to improve her writing skills.[22] In Nashville, she started recording demos and learned how to write songs and play guitar.[12] Perry signed with Red Hill Records and recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled Katy Hudson, which was released on March 6, 2001. She also went on tour that year as part of Phil Joel's Strangely Normal Tour[24][25] and embarked on other performances of her own in the United States.[26] While Katy Hudson received positive reviews from critics, it was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December.[27][28] Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer Glen Ballard, and moved to Los Angeles at age 17.[30] In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress Kate Hudson. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.\n\nIn 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with The Island Def Jam Music Group. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped.[32] Ballard then introduced Perry to Tim Devine, an A&R executive at Columbia Records, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including Desmond Child, Greg Wells, Butch Walker, Scott Cutler, Anne Preven, The Matrix, Kara DioGuardi, Max Martin, and Dr. Luke.[33][34] In addition, after Devine suggested that songwriting team The Matrix become a \"real group\", Perry recorded with them.[35] Perry was dropped from Columbia in 2006 as her record neared completion. After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company called Taxi Music.[36]\n\nPerry had minor success prior to her breakthrough. One of the songs she had recorded for her album with Ballard, \"Simple\", was featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.[37] She provided backing vocals on Mick Jagger's song \"Old Habits Die Hard\",[38] which was included on the soundtrack to the 2004 film Alfie.[39] In September 2004, Blender named Perry \"The Next Big Thing\".[37] She recorded background vocals on P.O.D.'s single \"Goodbye for Now\" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006. That year, Perry also appeared in the music video for \"Learn to Fly\" by Carbon Leaf, and played the love interest of her then-boyfriend, Gym Class Heroes lead singer Travie McCoy, in the band's music video for \"Cupid's Chokehold\".[40]\n\n2007\u20132009: Breakthrough with One of the Boys\n\nAfter Columbia dropped Perry, Angelica Cob-Baehler, then a publicity executive at the label, brought Perry's demos to Virgin Records chairman Jason Flom. Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to Capitol Records in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an \"undeniable smash\" to her existing material.[41][42] Perry and Dr. Luke co-wrote the songs \"I Kissed a Girl\" and \"Hot n Cold\" for her second album One of the Boys. A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to \"Ur So Gay\", a song aimed at introducing her to the music market.[43] A digital EP of the same name was also released that month.[44] Madonna helped publicize the song by praising it on the JohnJay & Rich radio show in April 2008,[45] stating \"Ur So Gay\" was her \"favorite song\" at the time.[46] In March 2008, Perry made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the Wildfire episode \"Life's Too Short\"[47] and appeared as herself during a photo shoot that June on The Young and the Restless for the show's magazine Restless Style.[48]\n\nPerry released her first single with Capitol, \"I Kissed a Girl\", on April 28, 2008,[49] as the lead single from One of the Boys. The first station to pick up the song was WRVW in Nashville, who were inundated with enthusiastic calls the first three days they played it.[50] The track reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[51] \"I Kissed a Girl\" created controversy among both religious and LGBT groups. The former criticized its homosexual themes while the latter accused her of using bi-curiosity to sell records. In response to speculation that her parents opposed her music and career, Perry told MTV that they had no problems with her success.[52] One of the Boys, released on June 17, 2008, garnered mixed critical reviews and reached number nine on the US Billboard 200.[53][54] The album went on to sell 7 million copies worldwide.[55] \"Hot n Cold\" was released the following September[56] and became the album's second successful single, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100[57] while topping charts in Germany,[58] Canada,[59] the Netherlands[60] and Austria.[61] Later singles \"Thinking of You\" and \"Waking Up in Vegas\" were released in 2009[62][63] and reached the top 30 of the Hot 100.[57] The Matrix's self-titled debut album, which Perry had recorded with the band in 2004, was released onto iTunes on January 27, 2009, as a result of her solo success.[39][64]\n\nAfter finishing the 2008 Warped Tour,[65] Perry hosted the 2008 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2008, where she won the award for Best New Act.[66] At the 2009 Brit Awards, she also won the award for International Female Solo Artist.[67] Perry embarked on her first headlining world tour, the Hello Katy Tour, from January to November 2009 to support One of the Boys.[68] On August 4, 2009, she performed as opening act for one date of No Doubt's Summer Tour 2009.[69] Perry also hosted the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2009, becoming the first person to host two consecutive ceremonies of the European awards.[70] On July 22, 2009, Perry recorded a live album titled MTV Unplugged, which featured acoustic performances of five tracks from One of the Boys as well as one new song, \"Brick by Brick\", and a cover of Fountains of Wayne's \"Hackensack\".[71] It was released on November 17, 2009.[72] Perry also appeared on two singles with other artists; she was featured on a remix of Colorado-based band 3OH!3's song \"Starstrukk\" in September 2009,[73] and on a duet with Timbaland entitled \"If We Ever Meet Again\", from his album Shock Value II, in January 2010.[74][75] The Guinness World Records recognized her in its 2010 edition as the \"Best Start on the U.S. Digital Chart by a Female Artist\", for digital single sales of over two million copies.[76]\n\nAfter her relationship with Travis McCoy ended in December 2008,[77] Perry met her future husband Russell Brand in the summer of 2009 while filming a cameo appearance for his film Get Him to the Greek. Her scene, in which the two kiss, does not appear in the film.[78] She began dating Brand after meeting him again that September at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[79] The couple became engaged on December 31, 2009, while vacationing in Rajasthan, India.[80]\n\n2010\u20132012: Teenage Dream and marriage\n\nAfter serving as a guest judge on American Idol,[81] Perry released \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg on May 7, 2010.[82] The song was the lead single from her third studio album, Teenage Dream, and reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in June.[83] She also served as a guest judge on British The X Factor later that month[84] before releasing the album's second single, \"Teenage Dream\", in July.[85] \"Teenage Dream\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in September.[86] Released on August 24, 2010,[87] Teenage Dream debuted at number one on the Billboard 200,[88] and received mixed reviews from music critics.[89] It has since sold 6 million copies worldwide.[90] Teenage Dream would go on to win the 2011 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.[91] In October, \"Firework\" was released as the album's third single.[92] It became the album's third consecutive number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on December 8, 2010.[93]\n\n\"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West was released as the fourth single from Teenage Dream on February 16, 2011.[94] It topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five non-consecutive weeks, making Teenage Dream the ninth album in history to produce four number one singles on the chart.[95] \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" followed as the fifth single in June,[96] and Perry became the first female artist to achieve five number-one Billboard Hot 100 songs from one album when the single topped that chart on August 17, and the second artist after Michael Jackson with his album Bad.[97] For this record, she received an honorary American Music Award in November 2011[98] and a 2013 Guinness World Record.[99] On September 7, she set a new record by becoming the first artist to spend 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the Hot 100.[100] After \"The One That Got Away\" was released as the album's sixth single in October, Teenage Dream became the third album to spawn six top-five songs on the Billboard Hot 100 after Rhythm Nation 1814 by Janet Jackson and Faith by George Michael.[101][102] The song peaked at number three in the US[103] and number two in Canada.[59]\n\nOn January 5, 2012, Perry was named the sixth best-selling digital artist in the United States, with sales of 37.6 million units according to Nielsen SoundScan.[104] That month, she became the first artist to have four songs sell over 5 million digital units when \"E.T.\" reached that mark along with \"Firework\", \"California Gurls\", and \"Hot N Cold\".[105] On February 13, Capitol released the lead single from Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection, \"Part of Me\", which debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Perry's seventh single overall to top the chart.[106] Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection was released on March 23.[107] \"Wide Awake\" was released on May 22 as the re-release's second single,[108] peaking at number two on the Billboard Hot 100[103] and number one in Canada[59] and New Zealand.[109]\n\nPerry embarked on her second tour, the California Dreams Tour, in support of Teenage Dream[68] from February 2011 to January 2012.[110] The tour grossed $59.5 million globally[111] and won her the award for Best Live Act at the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards.[112] On September 23, 2011, she performed on the opening day of the 2011 Rock in Rio festival along with Elton John and Rihanna.[113] In September 2010, Perry was scheduled to appear on the 41st-season premiere of Sesame Street. After her scene was uploaded to YouTube, viewers criticized Perry's exposed cleavage. Four days before the scheduled airing, Sesame Workshop announced that the segment would not air on television, but would still be available to watch online.[114] Perry subsequently mocked the controversy on Saturday Night Live, where she was a musical guest and wore an Elmo-themed shirt showing large amounts of cleavage during one skit.[115]\n\nIn December 2010, Perry played Moe Szyslak's girlfriend in the live-action segment from a Christmas episode of The Simpsons titled \"The Fight Before Christmas\".[116][117] In February 2011, she made a guest appearance on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Oh Honey\", playing a woman known as Honey.[118] The role won her the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Guest Star in January 2012.[119] She made her film debut in the 3D family motion picture The Smurfs as Smurfette on July 29, 2011.

Perry has not yet spoken out on his claims.[232]\n\nFollowing the release of her single \"Never Worn White\" on March 5, 2020, Perry revealed in the accompanying music video that she is expecting her first child with fianc\u00e9 Orlando Bloom.[233]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nAlanis Morissette (left) and Freddie Mercury (right) both heavily influenced Perry and her music.\n\nDuring the early stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as successful as Amy Grant.[234] At the age of 15, she heard Queen's \"Killer Queen,\" which inspired her to pursue a career in music.[235] She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the \"combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude\" inspired her music.[236] She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen.[182] Perry described the Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: \"Pet Sounds is one of my favorite records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds.\"[237] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as \"the only things I listened to for probably two years straight.\"[238]\n\nPerry cites Alanis Morissette and her 1995 album Jagged Little Pill as a significant musical inspiration, and opted to work with Morissette's frequent collaborator Ballard as a result. Perry stated, \"Jagged Little Pill was the most perfect female record ever made. There's a song for anyone on that record; I relate to all those songs. They're still so timeless.\" Additionally, Perry borrows influence from Flaming Red by Patty Griffin and 10 Cent Wings by Jonatha Brooke.[239] Perry intends to become \"more of a Joni Mitchell\", releasing folk and acoustic music.[240] Perry's autobiographical documentary Katy Perry: Part of Me was largely influenced by Madonna: Truth or Dare. She admires Madonna's ability to reinvent herself, saying \"I want to evolve like Madonna\",[241] and has credited Madonna for inspiring her to make Prism \"darker\" than her previous material.[242]\n\nPerry names Bj\u00f6rk as an influence, particularly admiring her \"willingness to always be taking chances\".[239] Other musicians who Perry has cited as influences include ABBA, the Cardigans,[243] Cyndi Lauper,[244] Ace of Base, 3OH!3,[245] CeCe Peniston, C+C Music Factory, Black Box, Crystal Waters, Mariah Carey,[240] Heart, Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Imogen Heap, Rufus Wainwright,[246] Pink,[247] and Gwen Stefani.[239] \"Firework\" was inspired by a passage in the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac in which the author compares people who are full of life to fireworks that shoot across the sky and make people watch in awe.[248] Her second concert tour, the California Dreams Tour, was reminiscent of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.[249] She also credits the 1996 movie The Craft for inspiring her song \"Dark Horse\",[250] and Eckhart Tolle's book The Power of Now for influencing Prism.[139]\n\nMusical style and themes\n\n\"When I am in between records, sometimes I doubt myself. I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate the world into thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And then I go back into the studio and I start writing, and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes.\" \u2014Perry on her confidence as a songwriter[251]\n\nWhile Perry's music incorporates pop, rock, and disco, Katy Hudson contains gospel. Her subsequent releases, One of the Boys and Teenage Dream, involve themes of sex and love. One of the Boys is a pop rock record, while Teenage Dream features disco influences.[252][253] Perry's fourth album, Prism, is significantly influenced by dance and pop music. Lyrically, the album addresses relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life.[254] The singer's fifth studio effort Witness is an electropop album that she described as a \"360-degree liberation\" record, with themes including political liberation, sexual liberation, and liberation from negativity.[255][256] Many of her songs, particularly on Teenage Dream, reflect on love between teenagers; W described the album's sexual innuendos as \"irresistible hook-laden melodies\".[30] Self-empowerment is a common theme in Perry's music.[257]\n\nPerry describes herself as a \"singer-songwriter masquerading as a pop star\"[258] and maintains that honest songwriting is very important to her. She told Marie Claire: \"I feel like my secret magic trick that separates me from a lot of my peers is the bravery to be vulnerable and truthful and honest. I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable.\"[14] Kristen Wiig commented that \"as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a Carole King record.\"[238] According to Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, \"being taken seriously may be Perry's greatest challenge yet.\"[259] In 2013, The New York Times labeled her \"the most potent pop star of the day \u2013 her hits are relatable with just a hint of experimentation\".[260] Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times criticized her use of idioms and metaphors in her lyrics and for frequent \"clich\u00e9s\".[261] Throughout her career, Perry has co-written songs recorded by other artists, including Selena Gomez & the Scene,[262][263] Jessie James,[264] Kelly Clarkson,[265] Lesley Roy,[266] Britney Spears,[267] Iggy Azalea,[268] Ariana Grande, and Nicki Minaj.[269]\n\nVoice\n\nPerry has a contralto vocal range.[270][271] Her singing has received both praise and criticism. Betty Clarke of The Guardian commented that her \"powerful voice is hard-edged\"[272] while Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described Perry's vocals on Teenage Dream as \"processed staccato blips\".[253] Darren Harvey of musicOMH compared Perry's vocals on One of the Boys to Alanis Morissette's, both possessing a \"perky voice shifting octaves mid-syllable\".[273] Alex Miller from NME felt that \"Perry's problem is often her voice\" on One of the Boys, stating that \"somewhere along the line someone convinced her she was like, well, a ballsy rock chick\".[274] Conversely, Bernadette McNulty from The Daily Telegraph praised her \"rock chick voice\" in a review of a concert promoting Prism.[275]\n\nPublic image\n\nPerry's characteristic spinning peppermint swirl dress which she wore during the California Dreams tour\n\nOn social media, Perry surpassed Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter in November 2013.[276] She won the 2015 Guinness World Record for most Twitter followers,[277] and became the first person to gain 100 million followers on the site in June 2017.[278] Keith Caulfield of Billboard stated that the singer is \"the rare celebrity who seems to have enormous popularity but genuine ground-level interaction with her adoring KatyCats.\"[279] With a combined total of over 263 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, she is the fifth most followed musician across social media.[280] In June 2017, Time listed Perry among its \"25 Most Influential People on the Internet\" of the year, writing that her live-stream for Witness was \"blazing a trail\" for being \"the closest any major entertainer has come to giving fans the kind of 'real' intimacy that social media purports to provide\".[281]\n\nIn 2011, Forbes ranked Perry third on their \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" list with earnings of $44 million[282] and fifth on their 2012 list with $45 million.[283] She subsequently ranked seventh on the 2013 Forbes list for \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" with $39 million earned,[284] and fifth on their 2014 list with $40 million.[285] With earnings of $135 million, Forbes also ranked Perry number one on their 2015 \"Top-Earning Women In Music\" list as well as the \"World's Highest-Paid Musicians\" and declared her the highest earning female celebrity in 2015, placing her at number 3 on the Forbes Celebrity 100 list.[286] In 2016, the magazine estimated her net worth was $125 million,[287] and ranked her number six on their list of \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" with earnings of $41 million.[288] The following year, she was ranked number nine on the list with $33 million.[289] In 2018, she topped its \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" listing and ranked at number four on the \"Highest-Paid Female Celebrities\" list with earnings of $83 million.[290][291] Perry subsequently was placed at number four on the 2019 \"Highest-Paid Women in Music\" listings with $57.5 million.[292] Later that year, with earnings of $530 million throughout the 2010s, the magazine also ranked her as the 9th highest earning musician of the decade.[293]\n\nFashion\n\nPerry is considered a sex symbol; GQ labelled her a \"full-on male fantasy\",[9] while Elle described her body \"as though sketched by a teenage boy\".[21] Vice described her as a \"'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol\".[294] She was placed at number one on the Maxim Hot 100 in 2010 as the \"most beautiful woman in the world\", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a \"triple \u2013 no quadruple \u2013 kind of hot\".[295] Men's Health readers voted her the \"sexiest woman of 2013\".[296] In November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar that she was proud of and satisfied with her figure.[297]\n\nPerry's fashion often incorporates humor, bright colors, and food-related themes[298] such as her characteristic spinning peppermint swirl dress.[299] Vogue described her as \"never exactly one to shy away from the outrageous or the extreme in any realm\",[300] while Glamour named her the \"queen of quirk\".[301] In February 2009, Perry told Seventeen that her fashion style was \"a bit of a concoction of different things\" and stated she enjoyed humor in her clothing.[302] She has also described herself as having \"multipersonality disorder\" for fashion.[297] Perry lists Gwen Stefani, Shirley Manson, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Daphne Guinness, Natalie Portman, and the fictional character Lolita as her style icons.[30][303]\n\nOther ventures\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nPerry became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in December 2013.\n\nPerry has supported various charitable organizations and causes during her career.

We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future.\"[325] In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by The Trevor Project for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth.[326] On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from Human Rights Campaign for \"using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality\", with the organization further stating that \"Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world\".[327]\n\nPerry describes herself as a feminist,[328] and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the \"Chime For Change\" campaign that aimed to spread female empowerment.[329] She has also said that America's lack of free health care drove her \"absolutely crazy\".[330] Following the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in June 2016, Perry and nearly 200 other artists and executives in music signed an open letter organized by Billboard addressed to United States Congress demanding increased gun control in the United States.[331]\n\nThrough Twitter and by performing at his rallies, Perry supported President Barack Obama in his run for re-election and praised his support for same-sex marriage[332] and LGBT equality.[333] She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of \"Let's Stay Together\" as well as a number of her songs.
