It also has its own cinema, a state-of-the-art gym, floodlit tennis court (perfect for when sporty Kate comes to stay) and a two-storey guest house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s everything Harry and Meghan could want \u2013 and it\u2019s perfect for when they have kids.\u2019\n\nThe lovestruck young royal is splurging with the millions he received in inheritance from his mum Princess Diana when he turned 30, in 2014.\n\nAnd actress Meghan is chipping in some cash too.\n\n\u2018They are planning on spending $1 million refurbishing the house to their own tastes,\u2019 explains the pal.\n\nEven before the pair got engaged they decided that they were going to split their time between London and LA.\n\n\u2018They toyed with the idea of getting a house in Beverly Hills, but thought it would be much more fun to have a place by the beach,\u2019 they continued.\n\n\u2018They plan on spending three or four months a year in Malibu. It means that Meghan gets to see her mum and friends a lot.\n\n\u2018In fact, they are trying to convince her mum to move into the guesthouse, so she gets the run of the place when they are away,\u2019 says the source.\n\n\u2018Harry has had the cash sitting in his bank account for more than three years now and he always intended to spend it on property.\n\n\u2018He knows his mum will approve of the purchase.\u2019\n\nMalibu is home to dozens of celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Britney Spears, Halle Berry, Mel Gibson and Orlando Bloom.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not grand like the houses Harry is used to in London, but he is mesmerised by the thought of living right next to the sea and somewhere so glamorous and exciting.\n\n\u2018Meghan thinks it\u2019s funny because she is the exact opposite. She is used to the Malibu lifestyle, but has to pinch herself that she now gets to live in a palace and is getting married in a castle!\u2019\n\nWilliam is said to be \u2018a tad jealous\u2019 that Harry and Meghan are getting a pad in California.\n\nRoyal duties for the future king of England would prevent the first-born prince and Kate from spending too much time away from the mother country.\n\nInstead, William and Kate will divide their time between multiple estates across the UK, and use Harry and Meghan as an excuse for the odd cheeky escape from royal duty.\n\n\u2018He knows it\u2019s not something that he and Kate could get away with \u2013 but they plan on visiting them a lot!\u2019 the source says.\n\nThe insider also says that Harry and Meghan will still make London their main home.\n\n\u2018But Meghan plans to do a lot of charity work in the US and she and Harry want to have a base in LA so they can host fundraisers and invite Hollywood movers and shakers to contribute. But, also, that Malibu beach house is just a cool place to hang out and get away from the pressures of royal life,\u2019 the source added.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/25818/harry-and-meghan.jpg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/25818/harry-and-meghan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
