We\u2019re republishing it here in celebration of Sex and the City\u2019s twentieth anniversary next week.\n\nWe\u2019re on the corner of West 10th and Hudson Streets when the young woman appears.\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m your biggest fan.\u201d\n\nThe girl is stylish, faintly mod, with enormous fringed pinwheels for eyes. She\u2019s speaking very quickly in a British accent and rifling through her handbag for something I can\u2019t quite see.\n\n\u201cI love your eyelashes,\u201d says Sarah Jessica Parker.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d says Pinwheels, digging deeper. \u201cI have a denim brand. It\u2019s British. And I would absolutely die if I could give you a pair.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Parker. \u201cYou just tell me the name, I\u2019ll find them, you don\u2019t have to give me anything \u2014\u201d But her fan has indeed produced from her handbag an entire pair of designer jeans, crosshatched on the rear pockets. She is literally pressing them into Parker\u2019s hand, which is trying to press them back. \u201cOh, my,\u201d says Parker in astonishment. \u201cYou just, you just happen to have them in your bag?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was meant to see you. What size are you?\u201d\n\nParker tries hard to say no, as politely as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t like to take anything from a new designer, because you need to sell them,\u201d she explains \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re at Intermix!\u201d interjects the British designer \u2014 \u201cOh, good, I can go there, I can find them on my own. Don\u2019t give them away. Give them to people that need them. Don\u2019t give them away to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you and would absolutely die if \u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI will. I\u2019m happy to purchase them! And much good luck to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. Bye.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Nice to meet you. Bye,\u201d Parker says and turns toward me with an arched eyebrow. \u201cAll types! Wonderful types here in the city.\u201d\n\nWe begin to cross the intersection toward Gourmet Garage, where Parker is planning to pick up some pork chops for dinner. She shops there all the time, she tells me. She worries about her son being such a picky eater, since she and Matthew Broderick love good food: They used to have a regular post-theater Sunday dinner date across the street, at a French restaurant that burned down a few years back. But suddenly, the designer has returned. And this time she won\u2019t take no for an answer. She forces the jeans into Parker\u2019s hand and begs: \u201cIt would make my whole entire world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all right,\u201d says Parker finally, giving in, the jeans dangling from her hands like a fish from a hook. \u201cThank you very much. Don\u2019t get hit \u2014\u201d Because Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s biggest fan is already running away from us, back into the traffic streaming down Seventh, her hair flying behind her, yelling out a final passionate \u201cI love you!\u201d\n\nCynthia Nixon, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, and Kristin Davis on the set of Sex and the City: The Movie, October 2007. Photo: James Devaney/WireImage\n\nIt is a famous fact about Sarah Jessica Parker that she is a good girl. She objects to things that are \u201cvulgar.\u201d She uses phrases like \u201ca bee in my bonnet.\u201d She is reflexively prim and has been that way since her teen years \u2014\u201calthough prim is not a good word; modest,\u201d clarifies Cynthia Nixon, her co-star on Sex and the City, who got to know Parker when the two were 13, filming a movie of the week in Nashville, back when rolling down a hill outside their hotel seemed like the best fun in the world. (In Nixon\u2019s memory, the actress was a conservative dresser but a master accessorizer: \u201cShe would take a different ribbon every day and braid it into her hair.\u201d)\n\nBut Parker, now 43, is also a person who knows how to steer her own ship. We meet just after a photo shoot she\u2019s doing in the East Village, in a studio that used to be a gay bathhouse. Parker runs downstairs, having changed from her stilettos into silver flats, and she is so hostesslike, so obliging, it\u2019s almost indecent \u2014 full of compliments, her head tilted, touching me on the knee, offering me a drink, literally running off theatrically when she has to go pee. It\u2019s a type of friendliness that might seem over-the-top if it weren\u2019t so disarming. She\u2019s tiny, with enormous blue eyes. She looks her age, but then, so do I.\n\nThe last time we\u2019d met, four years ago, it was in a trailer outside Silvercup Studios, where Parker was worrying out loud about Sex and the City\u2019s final episode, parsing the future of Carrie Bradshaw as if she were a real person \u2014 could she please her single-girl fans and be happy \u201con her own terms\u201d? That question seemed to apply to Parker as well. The show she was ending (and it had been her choice, both as star and as executive producer) had transformed her at 35 from a quietly famous person into the sort of celebrity who is as much brand as actress, a fashion magnet who tugs strangers down the street, convinced that Parker will make their entire world.\n\nAnd truth be told, even as they were filming those last scenes in Paris, Parker and her collaborator, writer-director Michael Patrick King, were kicking around a movie concept. King\u2019s original pitch sounds like a palate cleanser intended to follow the hype surrounding the series finale \u2014 it was a light, summery, Bob Hope\u2013style road movie, with the girls following separate paths. \u201cThen the deals weren\u2019t happening,\u201d King tells me. \u201cAnd the money people didn\u2019t believe in it.\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s co-star Kim Cattrall reportedly scuttled the project, wanting more money and creative control. \u201cIf I had thought it was any of my business at the time,\u201d Parker tells me carefully, \u201cwhat I would have said is, \u2018Isn\u2019t it okay for Kim to think that the money wasn\u2019t right?\u2019\u201d (She also drily notes, \u201cPerhaps she was some kind of emotional psychic, because this why we made a better movie.\u201d)\n\nCattrall herself sounds somewhat humbled when I speak to her, less the sassy promoter of sex manuals and more the actress who recently turned 50. \u201cHaving this fantastic character that I love and enjoy playing, it has a dark side,\u201d she says as cabs honk in the background. \u201cNot just because people don\u2019t think of you for anything else. But people get out of touch with you as a person \u2014 and you can get out of touch with you as well.\u201d The show\u2019s final season was a painful one: She\u2019d lost her job, her marriage was falling apart, and her father was diagnosed with dementia. Though she\u2019s clearly still rankled by aspects of the series\u2019 aftermath (\u201cOh God, you\u2019re going to make me cry,\u201d she says when I complain how little Sam shows up in the edited reruns), she sounds guardedly thrilled, if there is such a thing, to be back to \u201cthis phenomenon.\u201d\n\nIn any case, by 2006, when Parker revived the film, Cattrall cut a deal. In the interim, Parker had made her own gestures toward breaking away from her iconic character, releasing a few critical misfires like The Family Stone and Failure to Launch (though the latter was a hit). But she\u2019d also begun to pursue a parallel career, monetizing her Carrie-based status as a fashion icon with ads for the Gap (from which she was peremptorily dumped for Joss Stone) and producing the fragrances Lovely and Covet and the inexpensive clothes line Bitten. Meanwhile, in the ensuing years, the Sex and the City phenomenon had only grown, with those bubble-gum-pink DVD sets bringing in both international viewers and the \u201ccocoa time\u201d women (in King\u2019s phrase) who found the bowdlerized reruns comfort fare. This time, the money people could believe.\n\nAnd Parker had an intuition that time was running out: \u201cIt had this shelf life.\u201d The resulting film, which opens May 30, is no summery lark. Instead, it has a surprisingly serious tone, exploring questions of forgiveness in long-term relationships. (Reader, I cried.) The trademark elements are all there \u2014 rat-a-tat dialogue, sex scenes, and unsettlingly orgasmic excitement upon access to designer goods \u2014 but the mood is bittersweet. When the story begins, Carrie and Big have been together for ten years, and the melodrama of their off-and-on dynamic has faded. \u201cShe would probably long for that earlier type of heartbreak versus what she experiences this time around,\u201d Parker says, dishing cryptic tidbits that are sure to be ruined when the movie gets spoiled online. \u201cThe disappointment and the loss is so painful because they\u2019re grown-ups now, and it just changes, as we all know.\u201d\n\nOf course, for any longtime fan of the series \u2014 and I am one \u2014 the movie also has a significant level of terror attached to it. The series consisted of arch, neatly structured half-hours. If it didn\u2019t succeed, a two-hour film could feel more like Godzilla in heels, stomping cluelessly back into the meatpacking district. My boss summarized his response to the trailer as: \u201cThis is the worst idea ever\u201d and \u201cGod, I can\u2019t wait to see this.\u201d And there is the question of whether these characters can age without seeming ridiculous, whether the film\u2019s Manhattan will seem dated in this recessionary age, whether it\u2019s all so very 2004.\n\nMichael Patrick King has an answer for that question. \u201cIf you want to see them at 38, doing a variety of come jokes, it\u2019s available on DVD.\u201d\n\nFrom left: Parker and Brooke Shields at Sardi\u2019s, 1979; Parker circa 1983; Matthew Broderick and Parker circa 1993. Photo: Getty Images\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you do this with your husband,\u201d Parker says. \u201cBut say one of us is walking down the street, I\u2019ll call him and say, \u2018You know, the laundromat is closed!\u2019 And he\u2019ll say, \u2018What?\u2019 I\u2019ll be like, \u2018The laundromat at 11th and West 4th Street is closed!\u2019 \u201d\n\nParker and Broderick keep a running count of these changes, a mutual mourning for the transformation of their neighborhood into a luxe, tree-lined shopping mall. She knows this sounds absurd coming from her, that people blame Sex and the City for the ruination of the West Village; even Broderick says, \u201cThat\u2019s your fault!\u201d when he sees a thong poking up from low-slung jeans, and her close friend John Benjamin Hickey, an actor, longs for the days before \u201cthose girls on buses.\u201d Parker clarifies that she doesn\u2019t want to sound like Madonna bemoaning what\u2019s happened to New York: It\u2019s not that there\u2019s no \u201ccreative energy\u201d in the air, it\u2019s simply been priced out of this particular borough.\n\nStill, she says, her New York, like that of many New Yorkers, is one that is no longer quite there. \u201cYou know, when I arrived in the city in 1976, New York was financially a wreck,\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut to me it\u2019s the New York that Matthew and I literally try to find every day of our lives. It was the best place in the world. It was literature. It promised everything. And for someone who loved food and smells and stimulation, who was rocked to sleep by the sound of taxis \u2014 well, there\u2019s just so much money now, and the city is so affluent, and all the colors, all the shops, the look of a street from block to block is just terribly absent of distinguishing coffee shops, bodegas. All of that stuff that made it possible to live in New York is gone.\u201d Even Brooklyn is \u201cvery chic\u201d now, she adds. \u201cI guess there are places in Queens that are affordable.\u201d\n\nShe recommends that I watch Jill Clayburgh in An Unmarried Woman, which she calls an earlier version of Sex and the City, set in a far rawer seventies Manhattan. (It is: Netflix it; I recommend it.) She also brings up an 1891 novel called New Grub Street, by George Gissing. \u201cThere\u2019s this protagonist, this leading character who is really battling art versus commerce,\u201d she explains, sipping on a dark-green health drink. \u201cAll of his friends are having enormous success serializing their books, and he\u2019s really reluctant to be that person, but he knows in order to survive \u2014 literally in order to survive, because those times were so freaking bleak \u2014 that he\u2019s, like, this crucible. And, I believe, there was a girl in his life who wants the finer things, and there is the great story.\u201d\n\nBroderick recommended the book to her. The two share an interest in Victorian literature; their 5-year-old son, James Wilkie, is named after Matthew\u2019s father and Wilkie Collins, author of The Moonstone, one of the couple\u2019s favorite books. And in fact, Broderick\u2019s influence on Parker rises into almost every conversation we have. Parker is clearly fascinated by her husband: his values, his style, his mind. In her portrait, he\u2019s at once an old fogey and a computer geek, a pessimist and a guide to life \u2014 the very opposite of a bullshit artist, a kind of lie detector in a world of fluff. As a parent, she\u2019s the more traditional of the two, she says, the one who is (like her mother was) concerned with etiquette, the \u201cprimary caretaker.\u201d Yet Matthew \u201chas this soft, porous part of him that is more transparent to me since we\u2019ve had a son. I think it\u2019s just who he has become.\u201d\n\nShe can be hilariously unguarded about saying things that, when taken out of context, might seem absurdly suggestive. For instance, when I talk about my husband, who like Broderick is a science geek and a gadget-hound, she suggests that we should set them up as friends. \u201cMatthew doesn\u2019t have enough friends,\u201d she tells me, sounding very mother-hennish and adding that Matthew has mostly gay friends in New York. Because this is such a crazy thing to say to a reporter \u2014 surely she knows that the higher her star has risen, the more the gossips insist her marriage must be a fake \u2014 I decide that this means that Matthew is definitely not gay.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very bright,\u201d she tells me. \u201cHe\u2019s very dry, and he\u2019s a contrarian, because he enjoys it. And he\u2019s not soft, and he basically turns out to be a very good judge of character, and it just wasn\u2019t his nature prior to having a child to be \u2014 he\u2019s kind of immune to anything that even stank of being treacly or insipid.\u201d Broderick\u2019s mother, a writer and painter who died in 2003, was the same way, she adds. \u201cIt really was anathema. They just had an allergy to it.\u201d\n\nThe couple have led oddly parallel lives. As teens, they played iconic whiz kids: Ferris Bueller and Square Pegs\u2019 Patty Green. Both are half-Jewish, from theater families with actor dads. But whereas Broderick is a native New Yorker, a graduate of Walden raised in the Village in an intellectual, slightly intimidating clan, Parker arrived in an overcrowded red VW van from Cincinnati \u2014 a poor kid with seven siblings who hovered on the border between theater gypsy and welfare case. Her family camped out on Roosevelt Island for a time: \u201cIt was meant to be a Utopia,\u201d she says. (\u201cIt was slightly like a penal colony,\u201d recalls her brother Pippin, a playwright and director.) But it was Woody Allen\u2019s \u201crarefied and special\u201d Manhattan Parker was seeking, a fantasy she had picked up from a mother who kept up her subscriptions to New York periodicals even when they were living in the Midwest.\n\nThough they were both on Broadway in the early eighties \u2014 Broderick in Neil Simon\u2019s memoir trilogy and Parker in Annie (where the 15-year-old rose from ensemble to star) \u2014 they never met. \u201cWhich I\u2019m happy about,\u201d Parker says. \u201cHe was in a stage of his life where he was dating the obvious girl, like he should have been, like it\u2019s a developmental stage.\u201d (Later, she adds, she \u201cdabbled in my own textbook scenarios\u201d \u2014 by which I imagine she must mean Robert Downey, Jr., with whom she lived for seven years, moving in when she was 19.)\n\nThat Sarah Jessica was, despite her newcomer status, a very New York type: the ethnic girl nerd with crazy hair, a schnoz, big eighties glasses.\n\nShe regarded herself as \u201can outsider,\u201d recalls Pip. \u201cNot popular, she didn\u2019t perceive herself as in the most popular clique. And she was working a lot.\u201d On Square Pegs, she struck many viewers as a potential role model \u2014 a cuddlier variant of Barbra Streisand, a smart chick who was appealing in a way that it was hard to imagine as a mainstream taste. The fate of Square Pegs seemed to prove it: The show was canceled after one season.\n\nBut even then she had the future in mind. \u201cShe\u2019ll tell you she\u2019s shy, but she also has a very clear image of what she wants,\u201d notes her brother Timothy Britten Parker, an actor. \u201cI think once she moved to New York, Sarah realized what was available to her in her life: the possibilities. She saw that she could break out of \u2014 we certainly didn\u2019t have a lot when we moved to New York! It enabled her to meet people from all over the world, in all different professions. It propelled her.\u201d\n\nSo I go home and read New Grub Street. I can see why Parker recommended it: It\u2019s a nasty little fable about a culture in which art is so reflexively commodified that it kills artists, a lament for the fact that in a market-based economy, fear of poverty turns everyone into a deal-maker. \u201cArt must be practiced as a trade, at all events in one\u2019s time,\u201d states the girl who wants finer things, Amy, to the tortured one-hit novelist she married, who can\u2019t bring himself to write another book because he can\u2019t compromise. \u201cThis is the age of trade. Of course if one refuses to be of one\u2019s time, and yet hasn\u2019t the means to live independently, what can result but breakdown and wretchedness?\u201d\n\nI feel very ashamed,\u201d says Parker. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m the town trollop. And I feel cheapened, like I\u2019m cheapening the school, like I\u2019m bringing dirt, like I\u2019m bad for the neighborhood.\n\nIt reminded me of my first reaction to Sex and the City, which I hated on sight: Those women seemed so brittle and scary, batting their eyelashes at the finance hounds I thought were such bores. That was before I watched a few more episodes, perhaps three. And suddenly I was hooked, enthralled! With each season, I loved the show more; the scariness I\u2019d sensed, the anxiety and the anger, was still there, but so was a sweet fantasy of female friendship. The characters were archetypes and real people at once, a neat trick. As a single woman in my thirties, I was grateful for it all: Wouldn\u2019t you rather have your family fear for your life as a glamour-grotesque than pity it as a Cathy cartoon?\n\nThe series\u2019 glossy surfaces were deeply romantic about New York, but its staying power was its ability to tolerate ambiguity; Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha got knocked down as often as they triumphed. (King describes this as the cream-pie factor: \u201cThe minute Miranda said, \u2018Blah blah blah, I\u2019m so smart\u2019 \u2014 cream pie.\u201d) And despite the gobbling consumerism of its characters, the show had unsettling insights into women and money: the way bodies function as currency, the degree to which a woman alone can be truly autonomous or free, the marriage hunt as negotiation disguised as romance. The value of a single woman, in other words: something that degrades or stays steady.\n\nBut if the original Carrie, avatar of Observer writer Candace Bushnell, was a cold-eyed urban anthropologist, a modern sister to New Grub Street\u2019s bitchy observer Jasper Milvain, Parker transformed her. She made Carrie both likable and maddening, funny in a screwball way. She was also more than a little flaky, a bit self-centered, but in a way that surely rings true for many women in New York. Her friends owned; she rented. Her credit cards ran out, and she was astonished to find that a man she slept with left $100 bills on her bedside. She had the self-image of a freewheeling bohemian, but she lived like a wealthy woman, gliding along on fashionable freebies, rent control, and a not-always-appealing faith in soul mates. It was precisely the kind of thing that in a different kind of narrative might be a tragedy.\n\nThree days later, Parker and I meet to take a walk through her neighborhood. As we turn onto West 12th Street, she bends down and plucks a washer off the sidewalk. \u201cI find so many things in the streets, and my husband makes fun of me because there\u2019s almost not one walk I\u2019ve taken in New York City where I haven\u2019t found a coin. Something of value. Once I found a big metal N.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of those damp days when Manhattan seems to flip straight from January to August. We head toward Bleecker Playground, passing three teen girls who do a New York triple take: confirmation \u2014 feigned indifference \u2014 giggling. I\u2019d wondered if Parker would prefer to skirt this notorious strip, the wormhole that marks the intersection between the series and its social side effects. Yet here we are, headed toward the most famous stop on the Sex and the City bus tour, Magnolia Bakery, with its eternal cluster of proto-Carries craving red-velvet cake.\n\nHilariously, the line doesn\u2019t even glance up as its goddess passes by the Biography Bookshop. She\u2019s wearing humongous sunglasses and a floppy slate-blue bodysuit made of chambray. We gamely try to have a conversation about the ways the neighborhood has changed: the Marc Jacobs effect; Broderick\u2019s theory that Christopher Street\u2019s \u201cnasty shops\u201d won\u2019t disappear (although she adds that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t patronize them\u201d); Parker\u2019s worries that a friend who owns a framing shop will get priced out. We discuss her first apartment, on Greenwich between Charles and Perry, when she rented from the infamous West Village landlord Bill Gottlieb (\u201cHe slept on a mattress made of my checks!\u201d).\n\nBut every ten feet or so, there\u2019s a fan: a young actress who calls her \u201cthe big meet\u201d; the manager of Mulberry, who offers her a gift bag.\n\nThere are also people Parker actually knows, like a local mother who fills her in on her daughter\u2019s recent tonsillectomy, and her longtime friend Eric Hughes, who gabs with us about real estate.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always, always kind,\u201d Parker emphasizes about her fans. \u201cAnd I think to see me on the streets of New York, in a place that they might imagine the character would be \u2014 it makes people feel good.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the paparazzi that rankle her, this \u201cculture of thuggery\u201d that makes her \u201clong for the Ron Galella days.\u201d She knows how it sounds to complain, that people don\u2019t like to hear this from stars: She understands that if you kvetch about things like receiving that creepy Maxim magazine \u201cunsexiest woman\u201d award, it stimulates the tabloids to repeat the slam. It was a subject that was dealt with several times on Sex and the City, in which Carrie had a penis scrawled on her bus poster and took a pratfall on a fashion runway \u2014 not to mention that strange opening sequence, in which she grins at her own image passing by only to get dirty water splashed onto her white tutu.\n\nBut Parker can\u2019t help it. Some of these changes are very recent, certainly the willingness of photographers to shove her son\u2019s schoolmates out of the way to get a picture of him. As a result, James Wilkie has begun to cover his face even during family photos. This idea that children are fair game has appeared \u201cover the last four years, even more so the last 24 months,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we just kind of eat it. It\u2019s like empty calories. It\u2019s shit. And it\u2019s so base.\u201d Earlier, she\u2019d told me, \u201cI feel very ashamed, I feel like I\u2019m like a \u2014 the town trollop. It makes me feel ashamed of my work. And I\u2019m not. But I\u2019m attached to this culture now in a way that, it\u2019s kind of vulgar. And I feel cheapened. And I feel like I\u2019m cheapening the school, like I\u2019m bringing dirt, like I\u2019m bad for the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nWhen we turn the corner, she waves hi to the guy in the flower shop, whom she\u2019s known for years.\n\nParker uses language like this a lot: \u201cbase,\u201d \u201cvulgar,\u201d \u201cthe town trollop.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s a way of setting herself apart from a generation of panty-free starlets. Maybe it\u2019s the Matthew influence. It certainly seems linked to Parker\u2019s ambivalent relationship with her sex-columnist character, who, she emphasizes, was never naked (true; has any other character worn so many bras to bed?), did not use profanity, wasn\u2019t a slut but a romantic. (Kim Cattrall seems to be the last person waving the flag of third-wave sexual rebellion that the series championed early on: \u201cLoose woman, hussy, slut, nympho \u2014 now it\u2019s a cougar,\u201d she says with a sigh.)\n\nBut then, Parker has an anxiety about purity in general, ever more so as she\u2019s become as much businesswoman as performer. In the theater, there\u2019s no product placement. It was her job as executive producer, though, to be aware of the marketing deals that financed Sex and the City, with brands from Apple to Manolo Blahnik to Absolut vodka integrated so seamlessly that unless you had the legal contracts on your desk, or were doing some kind of abstract comparison in your head (how would you feel if Jonathan Lethem cut a deal with Kodak?), you would have had to concentrate hard to notice at all.\n\nNow Parker does have those contracts on her desk. \u201cIt\u2019s an eye-opener,\u201d she says. \u201cI do understand that it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d And then there\u2019s her own brand, of which she says she tries to be \u201cunconsciously conscious.\u201d Ten years ago, she says, actors who created products were a rare breed, like Liz Taylor. Today it\u2019s common, either as a covert layer of income \u2014 doing commercials in Asia, like George Clooney \u2014 or an open one. Parker\u2019s solution is to be almost religiously involved in product development, creating her own perfumes and insisting on a democratic ethic for her clothing line, which runs up to size 22, \u201cso I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s vulgar. So I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s just arbitrary or mercenary.\u201d\n\nStill, she lies in bed and worries. \u201cThere are those actors who don\u2019t do it. And some that wish they could. And some who never will. It\u2019s like nudity.\u201d She recalls a conversation back when she was considering doing the Garnier ads she eventually signed up for, \u201cand I thought, I can\u2019t do that, it\u2019s not part of being an actor, and this one actor I really, really respected, we were talking about endorsements, and he said, \u2018At least you\u2019re not doing hair care.\u2019 I thought, Oh, thank God. I would have been so ashamed.\u201d She was reassured when a playwright she respects told her there was \u201cno taint\u201d to taking the deal.\n\nKim Cattrall seems to be the last person waving the flag of sexual rebellion that the series championed: \u201cLoose woman, hussy, slut, nympho \u2014 now it\u2019s a cougar,\u201d she says with a sigh.\n\nThere\u2019s a case to be made that if she has marketed her own personality \u2014 funny, effusive, motherly, girlish \u2014 as a brand, as what her friend John Benjamin Hickey jokingly calls \u201cSJP Inc.,\u201d this is a smart move.\n\nShe has taken other roles, some of them playing against her own likability, but there\u2019s no guarantee she can break through again. Like a single woman in an earlier age or a blocked artist in Victorian London, an actress growing older can easily find that her world is shrinking. That will never happen to Parker, who has made certain to seize control of her own larger-than-life image.\n\nStill, I can\u2019t help but wonder if a little more shamelessness might not be a good thing for her \u2014 a bit more direct ownership of the culture of appetite her show so famously celebrated. One night I watch Parker on Conan, her hair scraped into a tight ponytail, talking seriously (or anxiously; the two combine) about how she hates the subject of sex or even thinking about it, how she avoids anything \u201cribald, salty, cheeky.\u201d Conan teases her for sounding like an eighteenth-century preacher. It\u2019s a little depressing, since I\u2019ve been watching Jill Clayburgh pirouette in her panties (\u201cso sexy and raw,\u201d marveled Parker) and enjoying clips of the younger Parker on YouTube, flirting with David Letterman. In those clips, she seems spontaneous, urbane, smart-assed \u2014 a sassy perfect girlfriend. She reminds me, in fact, of Carrie Bradshaw.\n\n\u201cWho will we meet next?\u201d asks Parker playfully. \u201cThis is Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood.\u201d And when we turn the corner to walk toward Hudson, a handsome man with close-cropped hair appears.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s Officer Smith!\u201d she says. (Not his real name.)\n\n\u201cListen, I have a message to you from my sister,\u201d says Smith. \u201cTo tell these Maxim people to go to hell, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell your sister thank you,\u201d she replies, with deadpan emphasis.\n\n\u201cYou should mail them pictures of when you were in \u2014 what was your first thing you were ever in on television?\u201d Officer Smith asks.\n\n(\u201cSquare Pegs?\u201d I suggest nonsensically.) \u201cMy favorite, the first thing I ever saw you in\u201d \u2014 and he turns to me and adds, \u201cand then you\u2019re going to be able to tell that I\u2019m a homo\u201d \u2014 \u201cwhen you wore the short dress to the Oscars? Mail them a picture of that.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t know Officer Smith was gay, it turns out. \u201cBecause you have a strong not-gay vibe, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s the whole cop thing.\u201d\n\nWe take off down the street, and Parker begins to tell me how she and the cop had met, a story that\u2019s off the record \u2014 until suddenly he appears again, to suggest another hot outfit she should send to Maxim: the silver one she wore on Sex and the City when she saw Big in front of the Plaza, that great scene where she compares their romance to The Way We Were. \u201cThat could have turned me straight,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWould you mind telling Emily that story?\u201d she asks.\n\nSo he tells me. He had signed up for the qualifying exam to be a cop in Suffolk County. He\u2019d be a fool to turn it down, he knew: On Long Island, he could make twice the salary \u2014 a living wage at last. Then the night before the test, he watched the episode of Sex and the City titled \u201cSplat,\u201d the one where Kristen Johnston, playing a party girl who has aged out of her own social world, falls out the window at a fancy New York cocktail party. It\u2019s a fairly devastating episode, the moment in the final season where Carrie seems to take an anxious look at her options and decide it\u2019s simply too chilly to be alone in this world, at her age, as a woman; it\u2019s the one where she decides that it\u2019s better to believe in the fairy tale and head off with the wealthy artist who will support her in Paris, lending her one kind of freedom. The trade-off will be worth it.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Smith recalls about the episode. Instead, he remembers \u201cthat beautiful scene where it had just snowed. And I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t take this test, because I have to stay\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s how much I love New York. Of course I had to tell my mom and everybody that I took it. But I couldn\u2019t take it, because I cannot leave here. It\u2019s hindering me from getting promoted, because if you get promoted, you have to leave the borough. And I can\u2019t leave lower Manhattan. I can\u2019t go to the Bronx. I would kill myself.\u201d\n\nParker and I are sitting in the back of her Town Car, across the street from her building. She left her keys in the door that morning, when she was blocked in by the paparazzi, and now she\u2019s locked out.\n\n\u201cShite. I can\u2019t believe this. It\u2019s kind of funny,\u201d she says, BlackBerrying like crazy. \u201cWho else has freaking keys? And where\u2019s my poor, sweet, overworked assistant who is not picking up?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a Manhattan survivalist scenario, I joke \u2014 trapped in a Town Car with nothing but Gourmet Garage.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it glamorous? Do you want a potato chip?\u201d She offers me both Classic Lays and barbecue. \u201cDo you want any, sir?\u201d she asks the driver.\n\nAs we wait for someone to show up and let her in, she looks dreamily out onto the street. \u201cIn the summer, when the weather is perfectly perfect, I will do nothing but sit on that stoop. I will make all my calls on that stoop, return all my e-mails. There is nothing more wonderful than the stoop. A stoop is really \u2014 is heaven.\u201d\n\nWe talk about her life as a child, when her family was constantly on the move, from Cincinnati to the Wellington Hotel in midtown to Roosevelt Island to New Jersey. Did she have any rituals to make a new place feel like a home? I ask.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing of value to bring with us. Nothing \u2014 it was a chance to start over and actually leave it all behind and start fresh. It wasn\u2019t scarring. Honestly, it was like, \u2018Oh, this could be good. We could start again. We could have a clean house for at least three weeks before it all goes to pot.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA New York City that lost its financial bearings might not be an entirely bad thing, she says. \u201cI\u2019m very careful about how I say this. I don\u2019t think being below the poverty line is good for anybody. And I don\u2019t think barely clinging to it is good or healthy, especially for children. But there were things that I know I learned because of my circumstances, which were not Dickensian by any stretch, but there was no disposable income, there was no \u2018What should we do with this extra $200?\u2019 It was, \u2018How can we disguise the lack of money?\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe worries about what her son will learn growing up rich.\n\nEven now, she says, \u201cWe use the word earn. You\u2019ve got to earn things. And he\u2019ll say, like, \u2018One day, when I\u2019m older\u2019 \u2014 and I\u2019ll say, \u2018You know, you have $42 in your piggy bank. That is yours to do with what you want. And one day, you\u2019ll work hard, and hopefully you\u2019ll find work that is good and fun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs the street gets darker \u2014 her friend Eric Hughes is on his way over with the keys \u2014 we talk about the series again, the heightened Manhattan moment that it captured. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Jeff Koons piece,\u201d she says, munching a chip. \u201cHe takes a diamond ring, and he just blows it up. That\u2019s what the show did. It highlighted the best angle of the Chrysler Building, the shiniest part of it \u2014 and those parts of the city seemed like they were for the rarefied few. A life that isn\u2019t really how anybody lives. Even people who do love shoes, they don\u2019t have the time like that to be with their friends. That was the thing that struck me more than anything about the show as the most unrealistic, the time they all had.\u201d\n\nAs for Carrie, Parker rejects entirely my theory that she had any attraction, conscious or unconscious, to Big (or Aleks or Aidan, for that matter) because of his money. Carrie wasn\u2019t like that! she says. Charlotte was, but Carrie wasn\u2019t. Hey, she dated Berger, didn\u2019t she? \u201cI really don\u2019t think that money was a criteria. It never would have occurred to her to take money from a man.\u201d\n\nIn the modern version of New Grub Street, Parker seems to be both characters: the artist who longs to be good and pure and the pragmatic girl he marries, the one who knows that the world doesn\u2019t work that way. She\u2019s a disciplined businesswoman whose iconic role is the flightiest freelancer who ever lived. And if this sometimes makes her feel a bit conflicted, a mite defensive, cognitive dissonance on two legs? Well, we\u2019re talking about a woman who has a proven ability to walk in heels.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bb5/68c/d5c253cb3bcbad8a3f68277174493b554d-25-sarah-jessica-parker2.2x.h600.w512.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/25/25-sarah-jessica-parker-3a.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/25/25-sarah-jessica-parker2.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/25/25-sarah-jessica-parker-2.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/25/25-sarah-jessica-parker2.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Nussbaum", "Andrew Eccles August", "Photograph By"], "canonical_link": "https://nymag.com/movies/profiles/46660/", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker Would Like a Few Words With Carrie Bradshaw", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Sarah Jessica Parker Would Like a Few Words With Carrie Bradshaw", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/sarah-jessica-parker-on-sex-and-the-city.html", "description": "Revisiting New York\u2019s 2008 profile of the Sex and the City star.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/25/25-sarah-jessica-parker2.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Sarah Jessica Parker Would Like a Word With Carrie Bradshaw", "description": "Revisiting New York\u2019s 2008 profile of the Sex and the City star.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/25/25-sarah-jessica-parker2.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-30T09:00:01.171-04:00", "tag": "sarah jessica parker, sex and the city, hbo, culture, from the archives, profile", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Revisiting Emily Nussbaum\u2019s 2008 New York Magazine profile of Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker.", "sailthru.tags": "sarah jessica parker, sex and the city, hbo, culture, from the archives, profile", "author": "Emily Nussbaum", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527685201.171, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
