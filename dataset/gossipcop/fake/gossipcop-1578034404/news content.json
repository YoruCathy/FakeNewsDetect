Which, to be clear, is definitely not anyone's business, and is also pretty sexist!\n\nThat aside, a pap caught up with Justin while he was buying coffee, and made the mistake of asking him about the rumors, saying \"Is Hailey pregnant right now? You stated that you guys are family, so everybody was thinking she might be pregnant.\"\n\nJustin's response? To stop in his tracks and call this dude out, saying \"What\u2019s your deal, bro? You just seem too like, you just seem too normal to be doing this job... I just don\u2019t understand why you gotta try to get a rise, you know what I\u2019m saying?\" He also said \"No, you know what you\u2019re doing\" when the pap tried to defend himself, and eventually asked for the camera to be turned off.\n\nHonestly, Justin handled himself pretty well in the face of a highly inappropriate and boundary-crossing question. Agree?", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=0.575xw:0.192xh;0.220xw,0.0865xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-466344544-1532188062.jpg?crop=1xw:0.6649305555555556xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=0.575xw:0.192xh;0.220xw,0.0865xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mehera", "Mehera Bonner Is A News Writer Who Focuses On Celebrities", "Royals"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a22508617/justin-bieber-asked-hailey-baldwin-pregnant-reaction-video/", "title": "Justin Bieber Was Asked If Hailey Baldwin Is Pregnant and He Got So Pissed", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Justin Bieber Was Asked If Hailey Baldwin Is Pregnant and He Got So Pissed", "description": "Honestly, he has every reason to be!", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a22508617/justin-bieber-asked-hailey-baldwin-pregnant-reaction-video/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=0.575xw:0.192xh;0.220xw,0.0865xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-07-22 01:10:06", "published_time": "2018-07-22 01:11:00", "section": "Celebrities & Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=0.575xw:0.192xh;0.220xw,0.0865xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Justin Bieber Asked If Hailey Baldwin's Pregnant - Justin Bieber Responds to Hailey Baldwin Pregnancy Rumors", "description": "Justin Bieber was asked if Hailey Baldwin's pregnant, and he was so pissed off.", "keywords": "Justin Bieber, hailey baldwin, hailey baldwin pregnancy rumors, hailey baldwin pregnant rumors, is hailey baldwin pregnant, Justin Bieber responds hailey baldwin pregnant rumors, Justin Bieber asked hailey baldwin pregnant", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-22T13:11:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=0.575xw:0.192xh;0.220xw,0.0865xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-997301624-1532264418.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Justin Bieber Was Asked If Hailey Baldwin Is Pregnant and He Got So Pissed", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532193060.0, "source": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
