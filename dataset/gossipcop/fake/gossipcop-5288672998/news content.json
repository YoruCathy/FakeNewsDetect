A supporter of President Donald Trump, Morgan yesterday on the program described some of the women who marched as \u201crabid feminists\u201d and said he didn\u2019t \u201csee the point of the march(es)\u201d which he called \u201cgeneric\u201d and \u201cvacuous.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter this morning, McGregor, who is out promoting Trainspotting sequel T2: Trainspotting, wrote, \u201cWas going on Good Morning Britain, didn\u2019t realise Piers Morgan was host. Won\u2019t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch.\u201d\n\nRelated Story Madonna Clarifies Nonviolent Intent Of Women's March Speech For Critics Immune To Context\n\nWas going on Good Morning Britain, didn\u2019t realise @piersmorgan was host.

You\u2019re just an actor after all. \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017\n\nMorgan also tweeted he expected McGregor was reacting to his Monday column in the Daily Mail in which he called himself \u201ca feminist,\u201d but decried comments made by Madonna on Saturday saying, \u201cI can\u2019t abide the feminazis, the radical, extreme feminists like Madonna.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Morgan took to the middle-market UK tabloid to launch a vicious attack on McGregor where he referred to the actor as \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn actor who had contractually agreed to appear on a TV show to promote his new film pulls out at the last minute because he doesn\u2019t like the political opinion of one of the presenters,\u201d said Morgan.\n\nMorgan said that after scrolling through McGregor\u2019s Twitter feed, it \u201crevealed a man absolutely enraged by both Donald Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency, and by Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union.\u201d He added: \u201cHis fury at the latter may strike some as slightly disingenuous given that McGregor himself quit the EU years ago to go and live the life of a pampered millionaire movie star in Hollywood. But I\u2019ll leave others to decide whether that is hypocritical or not.\u201d\n\nThe presenter continued his tirade by taking a swipe at celebrities who take the podium to make \u201cpolitical statements that remain unchallenged,\u201d which he says was \u201ctypified by Meryl Streep\u2019s extraordinarily pompous and elitist anti-Trump speech at the recent Golden Globes.\u201d\n\nMorgan even suggested that those who voted for Trump or for Brexit to \u201cnow boycott his movies\u201d before criticizing McGregor for being \u201cpaedophile-loving\u201d due to the fact he worked on Roman Polanski\u2019s film The Ghostwriter.\n\nA spokesperson for Good Morning Britain told the BBC today that McGregor \u201ccame into GMB this morning to be interviewed about his new film but decided not to go ahead with it.\u201d\n\nPer the Guardian, Morgan said on the telecast this morning, \u201cSorry that Ewan McGregor\u2019s not here.
