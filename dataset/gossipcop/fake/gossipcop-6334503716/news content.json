She told us last year that she always makes a point of teaching her kids \u2014 and her husband, Keith Urban \u2014 about the importance of sunscreen , so it makes perfect sense that she's partnered with Neutrogena on the brand's latest \"Every day is SUNday\" campaign . (Because if Kidman can spend hours in the California sun filming season two of Big Little Lies and not destroy her skin, you can avoid a sunburn after a day at the beach.)", "images": ["http://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/2f8/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1985688/image.jpg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg", "http://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/2f8/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1985688/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thatiana Diaz", "Megan Decker", "Aimee Simeon", "Rachel Krause", "Erika Stalder", "Elly Belle", "Nicole Kidman Gets Honest About Her Best Beauty Looks"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/202772/nicole-kidman-best-beauty-looks", "title": "Nicole Kidman Gets Honest About Her Best Beauty Looks", "meta_data": {"title": "Nicole Kidman Gets Honest About Her Best Beauty Looks", "description": "We talked red-carpet beauty with Nicole Kidman, from 1995 to today.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/202772/nicole-kidman-best-beauty-looks", "title": "Nicole Kidman Gets Honest About Her Best Beauty Looks", "description": "We talked red-carpet beauty with Nicole Kidman, from 1995 to today.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/2f8/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1985688/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/2f8/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1985688/image.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1050}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Nicole Kidman Gets Honest About Her Best Beauty Looks", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "We talked red-carpet beauty with Nicole Kidman, from 1995 to today.", "image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/2f8/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1985688/image.jpg"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/2f8/112,0,1776,2400/x,80/1985688/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "news_keywords": "nicole kidman beauty, nicole kidman makeup, nicole kidman hair, nicole kidman curls, nicole kidman blonde, best red carpet beauty, oscars beauty looks, golden globes beauty looks", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.slideshow", "author": "Samantha Sasso", "channel": {"tag": "skin-care"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529424000.0, "source": "http://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
