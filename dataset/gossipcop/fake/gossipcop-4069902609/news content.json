Getty Images\n\nThe Duke of Gloucester, one of Queen Elizabeth II's cousins, and his wife, the Duchess of Gloucester, were the last to reside in Apartment 1. They have called the apartment home since 1972. The Sun had previously reported that the couple offered to vacate the property to make way for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, though this plan did not come to fruition in light of their move to Windsor.\n\nMoving vans were spotted outside of Kensington Palace and are reportedly going to relocate the Duke and Duchess to the Old Stables, a smaller residence on Kensington Palace grounds. The Old Stables recently received a $493,000 renovation in preparation for the move.\n\nApartment 1 is a large complex of rooms in the main palace building, much like like William and Kate's home at 1A. The two used to be one enormous set of rooms until they were divided in the 1950s.\n\nThe complex has 21 rooms, slightly topping the size of William and Kate's, but few details are available other than its overall size.\n\nA palace spokesperson told Hello! Magazine in June that the decision regarding who would move in to the residence had \"not yet been finalized.\"", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5e162eb3f4423143cd787f3c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5d975de5138e4a0dfd17a2b8?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5dd564cffd9db20ff61f4ddb?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5aef5e0f19ee8621008b491e?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5dd56578fd9db20fda79c2b1?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5aef971919ee8619008b4942?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-prince-william-kate-and-11-other-royals-all-live-in-the-same-palace-2018-5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975e2bb151020cca578937?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975e58ee40e40d8e3241d0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5d975d8c4b65070c4f785e4f?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5aef5e0f19ee8621008b491e?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975d71ee40e40e2a442a12?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975d0649e03f0dce0aba57?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975dfe5288790dfc105329?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5dd570c1fd9db220fe14f216?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975e6c72fd820e317c3972?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5d975d4f2be6580b955d7db9?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5bc0a6f6bde70f7a286c2756?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e162d6f24fe1240a3075e48?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5e162eb3f4423143cd787f3c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kieran Corcoran", "Sin\u00e9ad Baker", "Taylor Borden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-prince-william-kate-and-11-other-royals-all-live-in-the-same-palace-2018-5", "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry just revealed they're planning to take a 'step back' from the royal family and split time between the UK and North America.
