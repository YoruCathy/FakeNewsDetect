Read more details about how she feels here!\n\nJennifer Garner, 45, isn\u2019t too thrilled with the sexual harassment allegations that have been coming out this week regarding her ex, Ben Affleck, 45, and now her main focus is to protect their children. \u201cJen is heartbroken over Ben\u2019s situation and all of the horrible things that are being said about him,\u201d a source close to Jennifer EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cJen is worried for their children and especially their daughters. She is doing her best to teach the kids that their father is a good man but still everyone is human and we all make mistakes sometimes.\u201d Former TRL host, Hilarie Burton, 35, publicly revealed on Oct. 10 that Ben grabbed her breast inappropriately during the taping of a segment of the show back in 2003 and since then, other women have come forward also accusing the actor of sexual assault at a Golden Globes party. Ben took to Twitter to post an apology to Hilarie on Oct. 11.

Jen is embarrassed for Ben but also not surprised. She knew what a wild guy he could be, it is the reason she fell in love with him and also part of the reason they are no longer together. She definitely knew about his demons but hoped they wouldn\u2019t be exposed. Now that some of this stuff is coming to light, she is doing her best to be a good mother and do what is best for their children.\u201d\n\nDespite their split, Jennifer and Ben have remained amicable while co-parenting their three children: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Sam, 5. With Jennifer\u2019s doting mom qualities, it\u2019s no surprise that she would want to do everything in her power to keep her kids safe and help Ben along the way. \u201cJen fully supports Ben in his recovery process,\u201d the source went on. \u201cShe is hopeful that he can work on himself and improve as a man and as a father. Jen feels that therapy will help Ben through this challenging time.\u201d We wish the best to Jennifer, Ben, and their family as they get through their issues.\n\nI acted inappropriately toward Ms. Burton and I sincerely apologize \u2014 Ben Affleck (@BenAffleck) October 11, 2017\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about Jennifer\u2019s feelings on Ben\u2019s situation?
