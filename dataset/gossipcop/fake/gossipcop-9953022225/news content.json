We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she won\u2019t let the singer \u2018bully\u2019 her hubby Kanye West with more diss tracks.\n\nThe world is waiting for midnight on Oct. 20 when Taylor Swift, 27, drops her new single \u201cGorgeous.\u201d Among those who are anxiously eager to hear her new tune is nemesis Kim Kardashian, 36. She doesn\u2019t want her husband Kanye West, 40, to be the subject of another diss track like Tay\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d As a result, the reality star is on guard. \u201cKim loves her man dearly and she refuses to let Taylor bully him or their family. Kanye is working on himself and has not been the same since his health challenges this year. He has slowed down a little and is not the same old Kanye that was always ready to fight on a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cBut Kim is feeling fine, alert and she watching Taylor like a mama bear protecting her cubs. Kim will be listening closely as Taylor continues to release new music. Kim and Kanye were willing to let the first song slide, but if Taylor wants to pick another fight, Kim is ready for it,\u201d our insider adds. T-Swift\u2019s new track has the same title as Kanye\u2019s 2010 song off of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, so everyone\u2019s wondering if it\u2019s going to be another diss at the rapper in their ongoing feud.\n\nTaylor came out swinging hard against Kim and Kanye in \u201cLWYMMD,\u201d where she made it abundantly clear in her lyrics that \u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d She dissed his tilted concert stage, Kim\u2019s Paris armed robbery and saying karma was coming back around to bite them after the reality star released the tape of a private conversation between Tay and Yeezy where she appeared to give consent to being shaded in the lyrics to his song \u201cFamous.\u201d Come ON, just the lines \u201cThe world moves on, another day, another drama, drama. But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma. And then the world moves on, but one thing\u2019s for sure. Maybe I got mine, but you\u2019ll all get yours,\u201d show Taylor is willing to come hard. See pics of the singer\u2019s \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video looks, here\n\nAll we know so far is that \u201cGorgeous\u201d features a deep synth beat from the teaser she shared with fans on Oct. 19. Interestingly enough, she also showed off the song title in the same font that she\u2019s using for her new album Reputation, which practically mirrors the lettering that Kanye used to market merchandise from his St. Pablo tour. Oh man, midnight can not come fast enough!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think \u201cGorgeous\u201d will be another diss track at Kanye?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kim-refuses-to-let-taylor-swift-bully-kanye-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F19%2Fkim-kardashian-taylor-swift-gorgeous-kanye-west-diss-track%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2835519&comment_count=10", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kim-refuses-to-let-taylor-swift-bully-kanye-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/19/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-gorgeous-kanye-west-diss-track/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Refuses To Let Taylor Swift \u2018Bully\u2019 Kanye West With More Diss Tracks", "meta_data": {"description": "Kim Kardashian is ready and waiting to fight back if Taylor Swift disses Kanye West on her new single.", "news_keywords": "Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Taylor Swift", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Refuses To Let Taylor Swift \u2018Bully\u2019 Kanye West With More Diss Tracks", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/19/kim-kardashian-taylor-swift-gorgeous-kanye-west-diss-track/", "description": "Taylor Swift is about to drop a new single and arch enemy Kim Kardashian is ready and waiting.
