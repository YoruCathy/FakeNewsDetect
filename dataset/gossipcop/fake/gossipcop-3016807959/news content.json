But it seems that the reality TV star is ready for baby No. 4 and it\u2019s not with her ex.\n\nAt 39, Kourtney Kardashian is still a young woman. But her boyfriend Younes Bendjima is even younger \u2013 24 to be exact. So, even though she currently has her hands full with her kids Mason, 9, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 3, that doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t thinking about having more children later. In fact the reality TV star even toyed with the idea in a February 2018 episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. During the show she told her sisters Kim Kardashian and Khloe Kardashian that she\u2019d been \u201cthinking about freezing\u201d her eggs. Kourtney made it clear why she was thinking about having that extra \u201cinsurance,\u201d saying, \u201cWhat if I want my love to come into the world?\u201d\n\nNow it seems that Kourtney wasn\u2019t just toying with the idea. She\u2019s serious. An insider has exclusively told HollywoodLife of the mom\u2019s future baby making plans. Our Kardashian source said, \u201cYounes wants kids and he wants them with Kourtney \u2013 just not yet. She\u2019s on the same page. She loves the way their lives are now and is very happy with her three wonderful kids. But she knows down the road he\u2019ll want children and she wants to be able to give him a baby. And she loves the idea of having him as her baby daddy. She just doesn\u2019t want to rush. That\u2019s why she\u2019s freezing her eggs so that they don\u2019t have to stress about having a baby right away and rush their relationship.\u201d\n\nBut what about Kourtney\u2019s current baby daddy, Scott Disick? What does he think? The insider said, \u201cScott is furious that Kourtney is seriously planning to have a baby with another man. She always told him that she\u2019d never want to have anyone else\u2019s child. It\u2019s hard enough for Scott to see Kourtney all loved up with Younes. Hearing her talk about her plan to have his kid, even if it\u2019s not anytime soon, sends him over the edge. He\u2019s furious and trying to talk her out of it.\u201d", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F19%2Fkourtney-kardashian-baby-younes-bendjima-scott-disick-furious%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3093297", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kourtney-ready-for-baby-younes-ftr1.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/marissa_charles1.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kourtney-ready-for-baby-younes-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kourtney-ready-for-baby-younes-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marissa Charles", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "News Director", "Senior Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/19/kourtney-kardashian-baby-younes-bendjima-scott-disick-furious/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Planning To Have A Baby With Younes \u2014 & Scott Disick\u2019s \u2018Furious\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Kourtney Kardashian is planning to have a baby with boyfriend Younes Bendjima, according to a source who has the inside scoop.", "news_keywords": "Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick, Younes Bendjima", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Planning To Have A Baby With Younes \u2014 & Scott Disick\u2019s \u2018Furious\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/19/kourtney-kardashian-baby-younes-bendjima-scott-disick-furious/", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian already has three kids with Scott Disick.
