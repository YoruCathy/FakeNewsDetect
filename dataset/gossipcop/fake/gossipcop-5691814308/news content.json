West had mentioned the sunken place in previous tweets this week, writing that he was producing music from there.\n\n\n\nTwitter/@kanyewest\n\nKim Kardashian retweeted the initial post calling her hubby out on publishing pics of their home, which they've agreed was off limits. The mogul made light of the photos and asked if this means her hit show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians,\" could start filming there. Kanye and Kim are notorious for keeping their private residence away from cameras, making shooting a reality show of Kim's life a smidge more difficult.\n\n\n\nTwitter/@kimkardashian\n\nThis isn't the first time Kim has thrown herself into the recent flurry of tweets coming from Kanye. Last week after he said he wanted to get rid of everything, she jokingly responded asking if that meant her too. Chrissy Teigen came to her defense and hilarity ensued.\n\nHowever, many people in Kanye's inner circle say the tweets are part of a larger issue that most certainly isn't light-hearted or hilarious. As we previously reported, sources close to the rapper say his \"erratic\" behavior has his team worried about the state of his mental health. In addition to the endless mercurial tweets, we also reported that West parted ways with his manager and members of his legal team. Our story became fodder for more Kanye tweet rants earlier today about the split.\n\nThe Kardashian side is singing a different tune, however. Sources told The Blast that they are steadfast in their belief that the \"I Am a God\" rapper has \"never been better.\"", "images": ["http://theblast.com/static/theblast/logo.svg", "http://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-25-at-9.04.10-AM.png", "http://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-25-at-9.01.00-AM.png", "http://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-25-at-9.00.47-AM.png", "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//UDZVNFpXdk01YnBQaTdTOW1qN0ouanBn.jpg", "http://theblast.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-25-at-9.00.22-AM.png"], "top_img": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//UDZVNFpXdk01YnBQaTdTOW1qN0ouanBn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff", "Jeff Mazzeo", "Ryan Naumann"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-tweets", "title": "Kim Kardashian Jumps into Kanye West Twitter Storm with 'KUWTK' Joke", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#f60", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Jumps into Kanye West Twitter Storm with 'KUWTK' Joke", "url": "https://theblast.com/c/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-tweets", "site_name": "The Blast", "description": "Kanye West apparently violated a long-held\u00a0Kardashian/West family mandate: no showing their\u00a0home on social media and Kim called him out for it.", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//UDZVNFpXdk01YnBQaTdTOW1qN0ouanBn.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2018-04-25T09:37:20.000+00:00"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2019-06-10T22:40:32.000+00:00", "published_time": "2018-04-25T09:37:20.000+00:00", "section": "News", "tag": "Kanye West", "publisher": "https://facebook.com/theblastnews"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBlastNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim Kardashian Jumps into Kanye West Twitter Storm with 'KUWTK' Joke", "description": "Kanye West apparently violated a long-held\u00a0Kardashian/West family mandate: no showing their\u00a0home on social media and Kim called him out for it.", "image": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//UDZVNFpXdk01YnBQaTdTOW1qN0ouanBn.jpg"}, "description": "Kanye West apparently violated a long-held\u00a0Kardashian/West family mandate: no showing their\u00a0home on social media and Kim called him out for it.", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/theblast/icon-270.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "4ade90087d8ddeecef93bced91147809"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524649040.0, "source": "http://theblast.com", "summary": ""}
