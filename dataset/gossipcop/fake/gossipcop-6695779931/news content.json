I was like, \u2018What the f\u2014 is going on here?\u2019 One of the great memories.\u201d\n\nBesides talking about his oldest daughter\u2019s music skills, the Grammy Award winner said his family will be joining him on tour.\n\n\u201cI booked the tour for October so I could have at least four months to just really bond and see their fingers and s\u2014 like that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be with me [on tour] anyway, but I\u2019m just saying, like, [I needed] a space where I\u2019m not doing anything,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on them. I\u2019m not thinking about a show at night or anything like that.
