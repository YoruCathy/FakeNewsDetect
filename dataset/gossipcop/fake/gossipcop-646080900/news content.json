She\u2019s done a commendable share of philanthropic work (although she doesn\u2019t advertise it) for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, among other causes. She\u2019s reached impressive new heights as a dramatic actress, with a performance in last year\u2019s Cake so heartbreaking that many believed it deserved Oscar recognition. And she wrote a powerful essay this summer, trying to redirect the endless tabloid attention on her to more important issues in the world.\n\nNevertheless, when Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie were divorcing earlier this month, Aniston found herself swept back up into the magazine headline melee. Despite the suddenly aggressive tabloid and paparazzi attention since news of a celebrity breakup that has nothing to do with her, it seems as though Aniston has gone about her business as usual\u2014joining husband Justin Theroux in New York this week for the premiere of his latest film, The Girl on the Train. And while there, Theroux was tossed a question about the Brangelina breakup and Aniston\u2019s new involvement in the headlines. Rather than refuse to answer the question, as is certainly his red-carpet right, the Leftovers actor took the decidedly classy route in responding.\n\n\u201cAs a child of divorce all I can say is that\u2019s terrible news for those children and that's all you can really say,\u201d Theroux told the Business Insider, referring to Pitt and Jolie\u2019s six children. \u201cIt\u2019s boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time, that's horrible.\u201d\n\nTheroux also commented on the fact that Aniston has been dragged back into Pitt-Jolie headlines of late, calling the new tabloid narratives \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don\u2019t have that appetite,\u201d Theroux continued. \u201cBut I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to bitch about. It\u2019s shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.\u201d\n\nThis past summer, Aniston herself became so fed up with a different variation of the nonsense tabloid headlines\u2014at that time, related to whether or not she was pregnant\u2014that she took it upon herself to write an essay on Huffington Post.\n\n\u201cLet me start by saying that addressing gossip is something I have never done,\u201d Aniston wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t like to give energy to the business of lies, but I wanted to participate in a larger conversation that has already begun and needs to continue . . . For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u201cjournalism,\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment,\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e159bf0a8ec0db67d1fda8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-tom-hiddleston-breakups-2016.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e332480a8ec0db67d1fde9/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/marion-cotillard-brad-pitt.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ab9a117a51b09e1bf347e2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a-celebrity-breakups-2016-taylor-swift-calvin-harris.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5761b8e80904a5835f0daef2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-jennifer-aniston-pregnant-rumors.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e2c6721e9e7cc118c45925/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Angelina-Jolie-Brad-Pitt-Divorce.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ab9ccef114d3ca724a0da2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/b-celebrity-breakups-2016-taylor-swift-calvin-harris.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5db88b725720ea00089a61dd/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Contributor-Julie-Miller-by-Peter-Hapak.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Miller", "Julie Mille", "Hilary Weave", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/jennifer-aniston-angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce", "title": "Justin Theroux Reacts to Jennifer Aniston Being Dragged into Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s Divorce News", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Julie Miller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s an endless appetite for trash, apparently,\u201d Theroux said in response to the recent headlines.", "id": "57ea7c681e9e7cc118c459ec", "keywords": "celebrity,jennifer aniston,brad pitt,angelina jolie", "news_keywords": "celebrity,jennifer aniston,brad pitt,angelina jolie", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "57ea7c681e9e7cc118c459ec", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cThere\u2019s an endless appetite for trash, apparently,\u201d Theroux said in response to the recent headlines.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cThere\u2019s an endless appetite for trash, apparently,\u201d Theroux said in response to the recent headlines.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Justin Theroux Reacts to Jennifer Aniston Being Dragged Into Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s Divorce News", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/jennifer-aniston-angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s an endless appetite for trash, apparently,\u201d Theroux said in response to the recent headlines.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ea7e8d7dd0d7d276c7cc8c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Justin-Theroux-Jennifer-Aniston-Brad-Angelina-Divorce.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Justin Theroux Reacts to Jennifer Aniston Being Dragged Into Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s Divorce News"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
