HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY learned the couple\u2019s carefully thought out plan behind their video release, and it was all \u2018to defend her family.\u2019 Get the scoop here!\n\nThe phone call Kim, 35, released on her Snapchat between Taylor, 26, and Kanye, 39, was no random action. In fact, the reality star and the fashion designer tag-teamed the entire thing. \u201cKim and Kanye discussed everything about the Taylor Swift video before releasing it. Kanye was in on the plan to release the tape as was Kim\u2018s entire team of lawyers, managers and publicists. Everything Kim did was carefully planned, timed and calculated for maximum effect,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com.\n\nAlthough it could have been seen as an attack on the \u201cBad Blood\u201d singer, it was all in the name of defense for the pair. The two both had their own part in the plan and \u201cKim wanted to set the record straight with Taylor and Kanye once and for all. This was not something Kim did spontaneously or without discussing it with her husband, or the people she leans on for support and guidance. Kanye was part of digging up the film and making it available to Kim so she could post it. This was coordinated and well-planned.\u201d With her loved ones in mind, \u201cKim was adamant on doing what was right to defend her family name and that is why she released the tape,\u201d the source added.\n\nEven though Kim and Kanye revealed the phone call in defense of their family name, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to stop the singer from her plans to release a revenge song against the rapper. Not to mention, HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY told you that Taylor could take the couple to court over the phone call release.\n\nSince many celebs have spoken out about the reignited feud already and even taken sides, this battle doesn\u2019t seem to to be slowing down any time soon. As the story develops, you know we will keep you guys updated!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about this new revelation?
