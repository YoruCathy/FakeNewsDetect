New reports claims that they still get under each other\u2019s skin, and Lambert \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d her ex\u2019s high-profile romance with Gwen Stefani. So, how will she react if Blake Shelton proposes to Gwen Stefani on Valentine\u2019s Day?\n\nThat there is still animosity between the former couple and it is all because Shelton parades his relationship with Stefani around for the world to see. An insider claims that seeing Shelton happy with his hot girlfriend \u201cburns\u201d Lambert.\n\n\u201cI do this thing called whatever I want\u201d pic.twitter.com/C3TawRy5FW \u2014 Miranda Lambert (@mirandalambert) February 7, 2018\n\nThe insider went on to say that Shelton and Lambert have traded scathing messages, and she has accused him of using Stefani to make her jealous. But, Shelton allegedly responds that Stefani has everything that Lambert doesn\u2019t.\n\nIt seems the former couple may be still throwing jabs at each other even though they have both moved on to happy relationships.\n\nShelton and Stefani have been together since late 2015, and Lambert has been with Anderson East for about the same amount of time.\n\nLambert did take a shot at her ex during a recent concert on her Livin\u2019 Like Hippies tour. During her song Little Red Wagon, she changed the lyric \u201cI live in Oklahoma\u201d (which is where Shelton is from and where they lived while they were married) to \u201cI got the hell out of Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nShelton quickly hit back. While performing at Luke Bryan\u2019s Crash My Playa festival in Mexico, he covered George Strait\u2019s hit All My Exes Live in Texas. Of course, Lambert is from Texas.\n\nLuke Bryan and Blake Shelton Sing \"All My Exes Live In Texas\" https://t.co/VCBxAQArie pic.twitter.com/P1Y4aSJ8DH \u2014 92.3 WCOL (@923WCOL) January 25, 2018\n\nThe country superstar may still be feuding with his ex, but that hasn\u2019t kept him from enjoying his time with Stefani and her boys. Shelton, Stefani, and her kids, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo, attended the Super Bowl last weekend, and they looked to be having a great time.\n\nThe couple and the kids sat in the stands and watched the Philadelphia Eagles beat the New England Patriots 41-33 to win their first Lombardi Trophy.\n\nStefani even shared several photos and videos of the day on her Instagram account.\n\nRumors have also surfaced that one of Shelton\u2019s assistants has been shopping for a diamond ring in Beverly Hills. Some believe the I\u2019ll Name the Dogs singer is preparing to propose to Stefani on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nThe high-end broker deals expensive, multi-carat, rare diamonds in simple settings, and it is not unheard of for customers to drop half a million dollars on a piece of jewelry in the store.\n\nCould Stefani and Shelton be headed down the altar? Fans will just have to wait and see. But, one thing is for sure, the couple has been quick to share their relationship on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Blake Shelton does pop the question to Stefani, they will surely let everyone know as soon as it happens, and there is no telling just how Miranda Lambert will react to the news.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlynn-Carter-BoxClue.com_-300x199.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gwen-stefani-gives-blake-shelton-a-quarantine-haircut-on-tonight-show-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Miranda-Lambert-Explains-Her-Throwback-Photo-With-Joe-Exotic-After-Fan-Backlash-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Fixer-Upper-Star-Joanna-Gaines-Finally-Debuts-Baby-Bump-No-5-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-Will-Miranda-Lambert-React-When-Blake-Shelton-Proposes-To-Gwen-Stefani.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gavin-Rossdale-gwen-stefani-wendy-williams-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/corey-feldman-and-corey-haim-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-vz.cnwimg.com--300x237.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-Will-Miranda-Lambert-React-When-Blake-Shelton-Proposes-To-Gwen-Stefani.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/how-will-miranda-lambert-react-when-blake-shelton-proposes-to-gwen-stefani-113972/", "title": "How Will Miranda Lambert React When Blake Shelton Proposes To Gwen Stefani?", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "blake shelton, gwen stefani, miranda lambert,", "keywords": "celebrity news, blake shelton, gwen stefani, miranda lambert,", "description": "It has been two-and-a-half years since Miranda Lambert divorced Blake Shelton, but there still seems to be some bad blood between the former", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How Will Miranda Lambert React When Blake Shelton Proposes To Gwen Stefani?", "description": "It has been two-and-a-half years since Miranda Lambert divorced Blake Shelton, but there still seems to be some bad blood between the former", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/how-will-miranda-lambert-react-when-blake-shelton-proposes-to-gwen-stefani-113972/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/How-Will-Miranda-Lambert-React-When-Blake-Shelton-Proposes-To-Gwen-Stefani.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-10", "modified_time": "2018-02-10", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/suzykerr/", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "miranda lambert"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518192000.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
