The star, who recently opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about her estranged relationship with her mother, also defended her interview after it sparked some backlash online.\n\n\n\nIn a series of tweets posted late Monday night, the \u201cModern Family\u201d actress wrote, \u201cRant \u2013 Something I wish people would realize\u2026 I am NOT trying to be featured on Snapchat, I am not trying to be pap\u2019d everywhere I go, I am literally just LIVING and unfortunately, I can\u2019t do that without paparazzi following me around everyday. I\u2019m not trying to show you my a-- in shorts when I go to the grocery store. I\u2019m trying to live my life. People wear shorts. People have wardrobe malfunctions. No one is perfect.\u201d\n\nWinter continued, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to wear everyday so I look \u2018appropriate\u2019 and \u2018fashionable.\u2019 Also, screw to always having to look appropriate and fashionable. For what? Society? Who gets to decide what is appropriate and fashionable? I wear what I like and no one should fault me for that. I don\u2019t want people to constantly see me in the news for going to dinner, or grocery shopping, or anything. I want to be in the news when I ASK for it by going to a publicized event. So trust me, I don\u2019t want to see me in shorts putting water in my car every single d--- day as much as you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe went on to address the cruel criticism she received after her interview with The Hollywood Reporter, in which she spoke openly about being sexualized by her mother at a young age. \u201cI\u2019d also like to address the tweets I get saying \u2018you accused your own mother of sexualizing you yet you\u2019re a w----.\u2019 I was a CHILD being dressed like I was 24. I was 8-13 years old. I wasn\u2019t an ADULT as I am now. As a child, you do what you\u2019re told regardless of what is good for you,\u201d Winter said. The star added, \u201cJust because I DECIDE to show my body occasionally doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m unintelligent or that I\u2019m talentless or that I have no self respect.\u201d\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, Winter slammed the suggestion that she was \u201casking for it\u201d by posting a photo on Instagram of herself wearing a bikini while on a boat with her nieces in 2015. After she uploaded the picture on social media, the comments section soon filled with remarks criticizing the actress\u2019s body. Winter later wrote, \u201cIt sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I\u2019m \u2018asking for it.\u2019 Celebrate you and don\u2019t let anyone\u2019s comments allow you to think less of yourself. Us girls have to stick together!!!\u201d\n\nRelated video: Ariel Winter wore a rubber dress to an Emmy's pre-party, and here's where you can get one just like it (Provided by Hello Giggles)", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/d3/9f8e92.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&rn=636416471238717874&c7=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Fariel-winter-slams-media-body-shamers-in-twitter-rant%252Far-AAscESa&c8=&c9=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=1275&pi=&ps=&su=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Fariel-winter-slams-media-body-shamers-in-twitter-rant%252Far-AAscESa&pageid=articlevnext&mkt=en-us&pn=article&pp=False&cv.product=prime&cv.partner=Gossip%2BCop&cv.publcat=Gossip%2BCop%2BMedia&st.dpt=tv-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636416471238717874&rf=&rid=4c601853ded8486aad94aa5e7663d7c2&cvs=Browser&subcvs=tv&cv.entityId=AAscESa&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AAdsRm7&ar=0&d.dgk=tmx.pc.webkit&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=4c601853ded8486aad94aa5e7663d7c2&pm=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=4c601853ded8486aad94aa5e7663d7c2&rnd=636416471238717874&rf=&tp=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Fariel-winter-slams-media-body-shamers-in-twitter-rant%252Far-AAscESa&di=1275&lng=en-us&cv.product=prime&pn=article&activityId=4c601853ded8486aad94aa5e7663d7c2&d.dgk=tmx.pc.webkit&d.imd=0&st.dpt=tv-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=tv", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAscxVe.img", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/9b/e151e5.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAscxVe.img", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842/https://www.gossipcop.com/ariel-winter-slams-media-body-shamers-twitter-rant-tweets/", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Media, Body Shamers In Twitter Rant", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Ariel Winter Slams Media, Body Shamers In Twitter Rant", "cq": "passed", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ab1142", "msapplication-TileImage": "//static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/1f/08ced4.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "description": "Ariel Winter slammed the media and body shamers in a lengthy Twitter rant on Monday night.&nbsp;", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "sharing_url": "http://a.msn.com/0A/en-us/AAscESa", "og": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842/http://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/ariel-winter-slams-media-body-shamers-in-twitter-rant/ar-AAscESa", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Media, Body Shamers In Twitter Rant", "description": "Ariel Winter slammed the media and body shamers in a lengthy Twitter rant on Monday night.&nbsp;", "type": "article", "site_name": "MSN", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170922031842im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAscxVe.img"}, "fb": {"app_id": 125117174535490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
