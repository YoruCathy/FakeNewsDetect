His remarks were from a radio conversation with Sirius XM's Salena Zito on Monday morning.\n\n\"I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a really tough person, but he had a big heart,\" Trump said, despite the fact that Jackson was behind Native American removal, the Trail of Tears and owned about 150 slaves.\n\n\"He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this,'\" Trump added. Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War began in 1861.\n\n\"People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?,\" he added, seeming to forget the basic curriculum of an American history class. \"People don't ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?\" Hint: slavery. Another hint: \"states' rights.\"\n\nHere's Trump's full answer on \"swashbuckler\" Andrew Jackson and the Civil War: \"Why could that one not have been worked out?\" pic.twitter.com/Zb8OQaDqyq \u2014 Edward-Isaac Dovere (@IsaacDovere) May 1, 2017\n\nListen to the exchange here:\n\n\"Had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later, you wouldn\u2019t have had the Civil War\" @realDonaldTrump told @SalenaZito.

Here's what some people had to say:\n\n1 word answer: Slavery. Longer: When Andrew Jackson died in 1845 (16 yrs before the Civil War began), he owned 150 men, women and children. https://t.co/Icg6puG2JZ \u2014 Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 1, 2017\n\nPresident Trump doesn't understand why there was a Civil War.\n\n\n\nIt's because my ancestors and millions of others were enslaved. https://t.co/dFjpbp1pUy \u2014 Rep.
