It might win him his grittiest film role yet, and his dream co-star Margot,\u201d a source exclusively told OK!.\n\n\u201cHe's already met with Quentin about this role, and he's been dying to work with Margot for a while now,\u201d the insider dished.\n\n\u201cThey've had close calls before,\u201d added the source, \u201cbut for Rob the ultimate thing would be to get to work with Margot under Quentin's direction.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rob will have to be okay with a non-leading role, and some on-set competition, as it was recently announced that Leonardo DiCaprio has been cast to play Charles Manson in the film.\n\nThat\u2019s not Rob\u2019s only dilemma. Margot just so happens to be married. So, unless there\u2019s just some Angelina and Brad type of chemistry on set, it looks like Rob might have to settle for a mere friendship with the Australian movie star.", "images": ["https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jwoww-coparenting-roger-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/robert-pattinson-crush-on-margot-robbie-hero.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/becca-kufrin-ben-higgins-phone-probe-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-11.37.31-AM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-888079914.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-2.18.36-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jax-taylor-tom-sandoval-wedding-regret-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kevin-dobson-rhylee-gerber-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kevin-dobson-cheap-or-chic-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ben-higgins-engagement-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-904001678.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-902394936.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/robert-pattinson-crush-on-margot-robbie-hero.jpg?fit=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-873366698.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-630800606.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/robert-pattinson-crush-on-margot-robbie-hero-2.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-17-at-2.57.44-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/robert-pattinson-crush-on-margot-robbie-hero.jpg?fit=800%2C400&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/robert-pattinson-crush-on-margot-robbie/", "title": "Robert Pattinson Is Really Crushing On Margot Robbie", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Robert Pattinson is going all out to land a part in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming Charles Manson themed movie, all because of his monster crush on Margot", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "news_keywords": "Robert Pattinson dating", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Robert Pattinson Is Really Crushing On Margot Robbie", "url": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/robert-pattinson-crush-on-margot-robbie/", "description": "Robert Pattinson is going all out to land a part in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming Charles Manson themed movie, all because of his monster crush on Margot Robbie!", "site_name": "OK!
