Make no mistake about it.\"\n\nThe bill, which now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate, will keep children on family policies until age 26 but will cut the Medicaid program for low-income people and end tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act on the health industry and those who earn high-paying salaries.\n\nThe bill will also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year and allows states to get waivers to free insurers from coverage requirements, which could cause them to charge people with pre-existing illnesses higher rates than they charge healthy customers.\n\nIn a viral video, Jimmy Kimmel expressed his views on equal healthcare for those with pre-existing conditions such as his newborn son. \"If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it should not matter how much money you make,\" he said while tearing up during his monologue on his show Monday night.\n\nThe hashtag #IAmAPreexistingCondition became a trending topic quickly after the bill was passed. America Ferrera, Sarah Hyland, Mark Ruffalo and George Takei took to Twitter to express their views.\n\nSee how Hollywood reacted on social media to the passing of the health care bill below.\n\nInquiring minds want to know, and #GA06 voters deserve to know, where @KarenHandel stands on #Trumpcare. So far, her silence is deafening. \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) May 4, 2017\n\nThe commanders have decided our healthcare is unnecessary #AHCA pic.twitter.com/5sVSI5T12k \u2014 Cameron Esposito (@cameronesposito) May 4, 2017\n\nThe #MAGA C.H.U.D.S. on Twitter right now, cheering the #AHCA being passed.\n\n\n\nCattle cheering McDonald's. \u2014 Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) May 4, 2017\n\nRep @MarioDB - you're not answering your calls so I thought I'd try you here.
