In a recent interview with ET, Kim said she was the \"real one\" with Khloe about how everything's \"going to go down.\"\n\n\"You cannot tell her anything right now that's too sensitive because she's just so freaked out. So, I can't really get into the whole, like, nipples and breastfeeding thing,\" she quipped. \"She's just going to have to figure that all out and slowly.\"\n\n\"It'll be fine. She knows,\" Kim noted. \"She's seen all of us go through it. She's prepared, but I feel her and I are on a really good communication about everything.
