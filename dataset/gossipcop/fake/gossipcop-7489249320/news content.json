The successful actor has an important message for anti-Trump celebrities.\n\nWhile being interviewed for Task & Purpose for his new movie \u201cPatriots Day,\u201d Wahlberg went after celebrities who \u201clined up to denounce Donald Trump is the months and weeks leading up to Election Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cYou know, it just goes to show you that people aren\u2019t listening to that anyways. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don\u2019t put food on their table. You don\u2019t pay their bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble,\u201d Wahlberg continued. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family. Me, I\u2019m very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities it\u2019s afforded me, I also understand what it\u2019s like not to have all that.\u201d\n\nWahlberg\u2019s point is well taken. What makes Hollywood liberals qualified to speak on politics? They should have respect for the President of the United States.\n\nDo you agree?", "images": ["https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/RqM6ZHm9yPvrDl.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/339a27a3e2484a1295c80f1e7cb7ba14.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/5f3babc57515476480e280019930581b.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/fd7aa2cb7e32416e87a94fc5d7491843.jpg", "http://www.twoeggz.com/pic/int/2018-01-02/010160a22353003290f1941b70e5157c.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/RqLUEqzA5iuIjz.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/RqM6rv9DF2OqPa.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/9f7144a480b8413b89bb77fb91348bbd.jpg", "http://www.twoeggz.com/res/images/logo.png", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/RwJ69ibBPlZVC0.jpg", "https://p0.ipstatp.com/large/005a49b150df4094da57", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/54aeed46011843998df5b67f520aeaf8.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/870f6ce14fe34ae78e29b36af6fbca52.jpg", "https://p9.pstatp.com/list/300x196/pgc-image/0c1d9a2901a949448a128f818d6c45a8.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.twoeggz.com/pic/int/2018-01-02/010160a22353003290f1941b70e5157c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Mark Wahlberg Blackballed From Hollywood After Say THIS About Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mark Wahlberg Blackballed From Hollywood After Say THIS About Trump", "description": "Mark Wahlberg has come a long way from his Funky Bunch days.
