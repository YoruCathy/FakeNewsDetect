This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nThe duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux\u2019s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, called it quits in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.\n\n\u201cJen has struggled with the perception that she is this pathetic woman after the divorce from Brad,\u201d the insider tells Us. \u201cIt played a role in her wanting to marry Justin.\u201d\n\nFor more on Aniston and Theroux\u2019s split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uw1018_cover.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-theroux-found-post-its-from-brad-pitt-during-jen-aniston-marriage/", "title": "Justin Theroux Found Post-Its From Brad Pitt During Jen Aniston Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Justin Theroux discovered old post-it notes from Brad Pitt during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 exclusive details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Theroux Found Post-Its From Brad Pitt During Jen Aniston Marriage", "description": "Justin Theroux discovered old post-it notes from Brad Pitt during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 exclusive details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-theroux-found-post-its-from-brad-pitt-during-jen-aniston-marriage/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-05T20:40:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-21T13:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-05T20:40:26+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Justin Theroux discovered old post-it notes from Brad Pitt during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 exclusive details", "title": "Justin Theroux Found Post-Its From Brad Pitt During Jen Aniston Marriage", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519218040.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
