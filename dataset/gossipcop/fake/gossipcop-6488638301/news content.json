MORE >>\n\nOn behalf of loners and miserable bastards everywhere, welcome to our esteemed club, Brad Pitt\n\nIn the November issue of British GQ, the A-lister opened up about his semi-charmed kind of life.\n\nThe actor, who\u2019s been shying away from the limelight in past years, admitted that he\u2019s been \u201cslowing down for a while\u201d and \u201ctransitioning to other things.\u201d \u201cI do want to spend more time with my kids before they\u2019re grown up and gone,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut maybe you\u2019re taking this whole \u201cslowing down\u201d thing a bit too far if George Clooney calls you \u201cunreachable.\u201d Come on Brad, you can\u2019t play George Clooney like that! Just send the man a text or a Snapchat every now and then!\n\nWhen asked to comment on his friend\u2019s description, Brad Pitt answered, \u201cWell, you know, George is extremely accessible. He\u2019s one of our best representatives. He\u2019s funny as shit. He\u2019s a joy to be around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess maybe I\u2019m more of a miserable bastard,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a loner you know? I\u2019m more quiet by nature. And coming from, you know, hillbilly country, I\u2019m probably more reserved.\u201d\n\nSo you\u2019re telling me that being married to AngelinaJolie and sequestered with your beautiful brood of children in a French chateau is not a winning formula for eternal happiness? Is there any hope for the rest of us??\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always believed happiness is overrated, you know?\u201d Pitt continued. \u201cIt\u2019s those difficult times that inform the next wonderful time, and it\u2019s a series of trade-offs, of events, of wins and losses.\u201d", "images": ["https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035951&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bDyt5XZ5yC-sg.gif", "https://www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/29/brad-pitt-british-gq-092914-lead-682x1024.jpg", "https://www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/29/brad-pitt-british-gq-092914-lead-600x450.jpg", "https://www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celebuzz_logo_alt.png"], "top_img": "https://www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/29/brad-pitt-british-gq-092914-lead-682x1024.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebuzz.com/2014-09-29/brad-pitt-calls-himself-a-miserable-bastard-and-loner-in-british-gq/", "title": "Brad Pitt Calls Himself a \u2018Miserable Bastard\u2019 and \u2018Loner\u2019 in British \u2018GQ\u2019", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "https://www.celebuzz.com/2014-09-29/brad-pitt-calls-himself-a-miserable-bastard-and-loner-in-british-gq/", "title": "Brad Pitt Calls Himself a 'Miserable Bastard' and 'Loner' in British 'GQ' | Celebuzz", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/29/brad-pitt-british-gq-092914-lead-682x1024.jpg", "site_name": "Celebuzz", "description": "On behalf of loners and miserable bastards everywhere, welcome to our esteemed club, Brad Pitt!
