The pair is expecting a child together, but have decided not to go through with a wedding, according to a new report. Find out why here!\n\nWill Katie Holmes, 37, be raising another child all on her own?! She\u2019s reportedly pregnant with Jamie Foxx\u2019s baby, but while they originally wanted to take their relationship to the next level and get married, a new report claims the plans have drastically changed. Get the scoop right here!\n\nIt was actually Jamie, 48, who originally got \u201cpanicked\u201d about the pace at which things were moving, and asked the actress if they could postpone the wedding, according to OK! magazine. But it was Katie who decided to pull the plug entirely \u2014 and she told him they should just \u201ccancel altogether!\u201d UPDATE: A rep for Jamie has denied these reports, and says the singer was \u201cnever engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything was going so well,\u201d the mag\u2019s insider claims. \u201cBut with this latest development, it\u2019s understandable that Katie would start to feel insecure about the relationship. And she definitely wouldn\u2019t want to raise another child on her own, as she\u2019s been forced to do with Suri since she left Tom [Cruise].\u201c\n\nKatie is reportedly four months pregnant with her and Jamie\u2019s baby girl, but according to the source, he plans on sticking by her, regardless of their relationship status.\n\n\u201cThey love each other and everyone says they are really good together,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cKatie just has to get over this stumbling block. It\u2019s the first real issue they\u2019ve had, and while it\u2019s a big one, it shouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker.\u201d This couple was first linked in 2013, although they\u2019ve both made it a point to keep their romantic relationship private.\n\nKatie and Jamie have both been spotted wearing matching gold bands on their wedding fingers in recent months, so it\u2019s been speculated that they\u2019ve actually already married in a low-key ceremony. Regardless of their official status, though, we just hope these two are happy!\n\nWatch Katie Holmes in the thrilling Miss Meadows here on iTunes!\n\nWhat do you think is going on in Katie and Jamie\u2019s relationship, HollywoodLifers? Do you think they\u2019ll ever go public?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-call-off-wedding-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-call-off-wedding-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2016%2F05%2F18%2Fjamie-foxx-katie-holmes-wedding-cancelled-pregnant-baby%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2106057&comment_count=14", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-call-off-wedding-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2016/05/18/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-wedding-cancelled-pregnant-baby/", "title": "Katie Holmes Calls Off Wedding To Jamie Foxx While 4-Months Pregnant With His Kid", "meta_data": {"description": "It looks like Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have ended their relationship before even going public with it!
