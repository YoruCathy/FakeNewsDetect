Ever since he rose to fame through his YouTube covers and released his debut EP My World in 2009, his love life has been under a microscope -- even at age 15.\n\nThere have been plenty of rumors, including one fan who suggested the \u201cSorry\u201d singer fathered her child after a backstage rendezvous. But in an interview clip Bieber used as the intro for \u201cMaria\u201d -- a track from his 2013 studio album Believe that addressed the allegation -- he said he \u201cset the record straight, none of it is true.\u201d\n\nHere's what is true: We\u2019ve collected all of Bieber\u2019s reported hook-ups, flings and fully fledged relationships in a chronological history of the \u201cBoyfriend\u201d singer\u2019s girlfriends below.\n\n2008-2009: Justin Bieber Met Caitlin Beadles, His First Girlfriend, at Church\n\nWhen Bieber moved to Atlanta in 2008 to work as Usher\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, he met Beadles at church. Over the last few years, the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer has been very vocal about his faith, and Beadles shares the same devotion to her faith, as seen in her Instagram bio: \u201cJesus knew about rejection His entire time on earth, but it did not change how He loved.\u201d The two split when his touring schedule and rising fame grew too overwhelming to maintain their relationship. His song \u201cNever Let You Go\u201d from My World 2.0 from 2010 is rumored to be about Beadles. They spent Thanksgiving together last year when Christian Beadles, Caitlin\u2019s brother and Justin\u2019s friend, posted a picture of their reunion with the caption \u201cSo thankful for my brother and sister this thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nJanuary-September 2010: Bieber Briefly Dated My World Tour Partner Jasmine Villegas\n\n\u201cIt was like a little kid thing, it was like puppy love, if you could even call it that,\u201d Jasmine Villegas recalled about her relationship with the \u201cBaby\u201d artist in a 2015 interview. He featured her in his \u201cBaby\u201d music video in April 2010, which has since garnered 1.9 billion YouTube views. According to Villegas, Bieber asked her mom for her phone number, which is how their nine-month relationship took off. But the fans at their concerts were not having it. \u201cI got a couple middle fingers in the crowds, a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comes from really anything when you\u2019re in the eye and when you date somebody who\u2019s a pop star.\u201d They later both mutually decided to stay friends.\n\nDecember 2010-November 2012: A Silly IHOP Date with Selena Gomez Turns Into a Serious Relationship\n\nBefore the roller coaster romance between Bieber and Selena Gomez took off, the two met for pancakes at an IHOP in Philadelphia in December 2010. She told Us Weekly that \u201cIt was pancakes! Oh my gosh!\u201d but their appetite fed into a two-year commitment -- replete with red-carpet dates, a private viewing of Titanic at Staples Center, and a \u201cJ\u201d diamond ring as a Valentine\u2019s Day present. Baldwin wasn\u2019t the first girl he gave a ring to, but Gomez and him called it quits for the first time in 2012.\n\nromance isnt dead. treat your lady right fellas. #REAL \u2014 Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) September 24, 2011\n\nNovember 2012: He and Model Barbara Palvin Went on a Date to a Broadway Show\n\nThe 2012 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show was a busy time for Bieber, not just regarding his performance during the show itself. That\u2019s where he met model Barbara Palvin, who saw the Broadway musical The Lion King with Bieber the following evening. She later denied serious dating rumors, but the outing seemed to officially end things with Gomez at the time.\n\nlast time im saying it. please calm down.there is nothing going on w him.i met him and did a pic w him. wouldnt u do the same?:) #friendship \u2014 Barbara Palvin (@BarbaraPalvin) November 10, 2012\n\nNovember 2012: Miranda Kerr Denies Hooking Up With Bieber After Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show\n\nPalvin wasn\u2019t Bieber\u2019s only short-lived fling from the 2012 Victoria\u2019s Secret event. He was rumored to have hooked up with Miranda Kerr after the show, which she denied. They also allegedly sent each other flirty text messages and cheek kisses while Kerr was married to Orlando Bloom. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor later duked it out with Bieber in Ibiza in July 2014 when the rumors reignited, one year after he and the Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel divorced.\n\nJanuary-April 2014, July 2016: Bieber Gets Arrested for DUI With Chantel Jeffries in the Car\n\nRemember when Bieber was arrested for a DUI? Chantel Jeffries does, because she was in the car with her then-casual beau when it happened in Miami. In a February 2014 interview with E! News, Jeffries deflected from answering whether she and Bieber had kissed or slept in the same bed before. But PDA aside, the two were spotted hanging out after one of his Purpose Tour shows at Madison Square Garden in July 2016, where they privately screened The Secret Life of Pets. He also shared a zoomed-in picture of Jeffries\u2019 lips in February 2017, but the original picture -- an old-school photo of Jeffries -- has since been deleted from her Instagram.\n\nA post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Feb 10, 2017 at 10:39pm PST\n\nMay 2014: Adriana Lima and Bieber Allegedly Hook Up at Cannes Film Festival\n\nCannes Film Festival is renowned for having a wild party scene, and Victoria\u2019s Secret model Adriana Lima, who had just announced her separation from ex-husband Marko Jaric earlier that month, reportedly took advantage of her newly single status. The two were rumored to have hooked up in the French Riviera after partying at 1 Oak Club Gotha, where Bieber posted on Instagram a picture of him and the Brazilian model with the caption \u201cI think she foreign, I think she foreign\u201d -- lyrics from his song \u201cConfident\" featuring Chance the Rapper from his 2014 album Journals. Lima clapped back at the rumors on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen when she responded, \u201cAnybody below 6\u20197\u201d, you know how I call them? Friends.\u201d\n\nOctober-December 2015: Kourtney Kardashian Romance Rumors Flare Up\n\nDating in Hollywood is geographically predictable: If it\u2019s October, couples cuddle up at Universal Studios Hollywood for its \u201cHalloween Horror Nights,\u201d and if it\u2019s a weekend, The Nice Guy in West Hollywood is the perfect bar to lounge around with the elite. Kourtney Kardashian and Bieber were seen canoodling on December 11 when the \u201cWhere Are \u00dc Now\u201d vocalist hosted a surprise show at The Nice Guy after the two headed to \u201cHalloween Horror Nights.\u201d But the then-21-year-old singer addressed his alleged romance with the then-36-year-old reality star during a December interview on The Bert Show when he joked regarding the headlines, \u201cI\u2019m being used, man. What can I say?\u201d He later complimented Kardashian on the radio show, calling the mother of three \u201cgreat\u201d and saying he\u2019s \u201cknown [the family] for years.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Oct 10, 2015 at 11:42am PDT\n\nJanuary-August 2016: Bieber Romantically Links Up With Hailey Baldwin for the First Time\n\nBieber and Baldwin first met in 2009 in a fan meet-and-greet caught on video. But when rumors were circling about them dating, Bieber laid them to rest with an Instagram from December 2015 of the two saying, \u201cPeople are crazy. I\u2019m super single and this is my good friend u would know otherwise.\u201d A year later, the couple rang in a second New Year\u2019s together -- but this time with a sultry make-out. They served fans sexy Instagram posts, and in a GQ cover story, Bieber asked, \u201cWhat if Hailey ends up being the girl I\u2019m gonna marry, right?\u201d The teaser of their announced engagement didn\u2019t go unnoticed back then, and neither did Baldwin\u2019s since-deleted Instagram post that was a note about honesty and blame -- something Jelena fans mistook as her weighing on Bieber\u2019s drama with Gomez. He reportedly unfollowed Baldwin on the app before deleting his account altogether.\n\nA post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 3, 2016 at 4:12pm PST\n\nJune 2016: Actress Nicola Peltz & Bieber Entertain a Short Spring Fling\n\nTransformers: Age of Extinction actress Nicola Peltz went out with the \u201cAs Long as You Love Me\u201d singer for a few weeks. They reportedly met at an album release party in Toronto and were later having sleepovers at his Beverly Hills estate, but their fling ran its course quickly.\n\nAugust-September 2016: Sofia Richie Dishes to Billboard About Her Relationship With Bieber\n\nBieber might have strikingly similar taste to Scott Disick, because his next girl was Sofia Richie, who dated the singer briefly. They went on a romantic getaway for Richie\u2019s 18th birthday in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, which she told Billboard about in her September 17 cover story. \u201cWe have a special relationship,\u201d she said. \u201cJustin is very easy to talk to, and that\u2019s hard to find with people in Los Angeles.\u201d Bieber was not just a good conversationalist, but protective significant other who threatened to make his Instagram account private if haters didn\u2019t stop posting disturbing comments targeted at Richie. He eventually deleted his account altogether for a while, but their relationship eventually fizzled out.\n\nA post shared by Sofia Richie (@sofiarichie) on Aug 13, 2016 at 10:37pm PDT\n\nSeptember-October 2017: Bieber Connects With Actress & Model Paola Paulin\n\nBallers actress and Colombian model Paola Paulin and Bieber started going out when the two went to church together on September 27. He insisted they attend together, and they headed to an intimate, private date afterward. They went back to church Oct. 4, the same night Kardashian and current fianc\u00e9e Hailey Baldwin were in attendance. Although they enjoyed each other\u2019s company, it wasn\u2019t meant to be.\n\nNovember 2017-March 2018: He Reunites with On-Off Girlfriend Gomez for the Last Time\n\n\u201cJelena,\u201d as fans dubbed Bieber and Gomez together, had taken a long stroll down memory lane on social media over the years they weren\u2019t together by posting pictures of the two or cryptic tweets. But after taking a bike ride together in Los Angeles in November, they reignited their relationship and sent Twitter into an uproar. The stars\u2019 moms had something to say about it too. Bieber\u2019s mother Pattie Malette said she loved Gomez. \u201cI support anything [he does], if he loves her I love her,\u201d she told People in December 2017. But Mandy Teefy, Gomez\u2019s mother, was \u201cnot happy\u201d about her daughter\u2019s reunion with her famous ex, she admitted to Gossip Cop. The \u201cBack to You\u201d singer posted for her beau\u2019s birthday, with a Polaroid on her head and a caption dedicated to \u201csomeone I know that happens to be super cool.\u201d But her family wasn\u2019t all too keen on the idea of them back together, and allegedly caused their second official split.\n\nMarch-May 2018: Bieber Has Model Baskin Champion on His Arm\n\nRight after his second breakup with Gomez, Bieber was spotted with model Baskin Champion, sister of Abby Champion who\u2019s currently dating Bieber\u2019s buddy Patrick Schwarzenegger. They were first seen together at a Craig David concert in West Hollywood on March 20. Their fling never blossomed into a serious relationship, and things cooled down between them after two months of casually dating.\n\nJune 2018-Present: Baldwin Secures Bieber\u2019s Heart in a Rekindled Romance, and He Proposes!\n\n\u201cJailey,\u201d another couple name Bieber was christened with, seemed to be back on when they hit church and the club together and were seen kissing in New York City earlier this summer. But things really heated up when the two were vacationing in the Bahamas and Bieber proposed. He confirmed their engagement after TMZ initially reported the news with a heartfelt Instagram post. \u201cSo committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindLY,\u201d he wrote as part of the caption. Baldwin tweeted about the engagement Monday, writing, \u201cNot sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with!\u201d", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/justin-bieber-grammy-2016-billboard-b-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?c596412deda54d9a807d"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/justin-bieber-grammy-2016-billboard-b-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heran Mamo"], "canonical_link": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8464893/justin-bieber-dating-history-timeline", "title": "A Timeline of Justin Bieber's Dating History", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-07-11T13:58:40-04:00", "published_time": "2018-07-10T21:11:20-04:00"}, "description": "Before proposing to on-and-off girlfriend and model Hailey Baldwin Saturday (July 7), Justin Bieber had a few other one less lonely girls under his arm.
