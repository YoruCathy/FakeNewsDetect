Time does not comment on our choice until publication.\"\n\nSecuring the magazine's title \u2014 which was launched in 1927 \u2014 has long been a preoccupation of Mr Trump's.\n\nIn June the magazine asked Mr Trump to take down framed copies of a fake March 2009 Time cover featuring Mr Trump that had been prominently displayed in at least five of the President's golf clubs.\n\nThe photoshopped image featured Mr Trump alongside a headline claiming his Apprentice reality TV series was a \"television smash\".\n\nThe cover also said: \"Trump is hitting on all fronts \u2026 even TV.\"\n\nThe counterfeit cover also had several other \"telling mistakes\", including a skinnier red border, no white border and an issue with the placement of the secondary headlines.\n\nAs his campaign for the presidency picked up steam in late 2015, the then New York businessman was hopeful of being featured on the cover as Person of the Year.\n\nHe even sat for a photo shoot with a bald eagle.\n\nIt wasn't to be, though, with the billionaire missing out to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nMr Trump was less than impressed.\n\nIn the following months the magazine was critical of his presidential campaign, featuring caricatures of him on the front describing his bid as being in \"meltdown\".\n\nDespite their criticism, he was finally named Person of the Year in 2016, a month after securing the presidency.\n\nHe said it was a \"great honour\" which \"meant a lot\". But that didn't stop him again going on the attack a few days later.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to receive the Time Person of the Year,\" Mr Trump told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, on his Thank You victory tour.\n\n\"They used to call it 'Man of the Year,' but they can't do that anymore, so they call it 'person'. They want to be politically correct. That's OK.\"\n\nThere were also suggestions on social media that the cover featuring Mr Trump was designed in a way that made it seem he had \"devil horns\" with the placement of the letter \"M\" in the magazine's name directly behind his head.\n\nTime magazine denied this and posted a gallery on their website of past covers that also appeared to give their subjects horns.\n\nAfter a year of headlines, the naming of Mr Trump as Person of the Year for a second time, as he has claimed, may not come as a surprise to many.\n\nBut former Time editor Richard Stengel was sceptical and tweeted that the photo and interview request does not mean Mr Trump was likely to take out the title for the second year in a row.\n\nEither way, Mr Trump's claim that he was \"PROBABLY\" going to take out the title when it's announced on December 6 has predictably been a source of mirth on social media.\n\nTopics: donald-trump, print-media, social-media, offbeat, human-interest, information-and-communication, united-states\n\nFirst posted", "images": ["https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/11967070-16x9-220x124.jpg", "https://res.abc.net.au/bundles/2.5.0/images/logo-abc@2x.png", "http://secure-au.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=abc-aust&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.abc.net.au/cm/image/12150620-16x9-220x124.jpg", "https://res.abc.net.au/bundles/2.5.0/images/icon-search-grey@1x.png", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/12154156-16x9-220x124.jpg", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8101808-16x9-700x394.jpg", "http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/8212704/data/news-logo2017-data.png", "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8101808-3x4-340x453.jpg", "https://res.abc.net.au/bundles/2.5.0/images/icon-menu-grey@1x.gif", "http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/8212706/data/news-logo-2017---desktop-print-data.png", "https://www.abc.net.au/radio/image/12027716-16x9-220x124.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8101808-16x9-700x394.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Australian Broadcasting Corporation"], "canonical_link": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-25/donald-trump-says-hell-probably-be-named-times-person-of-year/9193246", "title": "Donald Trump and Time magazine dispute Person of the Year plans", "meta_data": {"title": "Trump says he turned down Time's Person of the Year \u2014 but the magazine denies asking him", "description": "There's been a fresh twist in Donald Trump's long and complicated relationship with Time magazine \u2014 the US President says he's the frontrunner to take out 2017 Person of the Year but he took a pass.", "keywords": "donald trump, time, magazine, 2017, person of the year", "ICBM": "38,-97", "geo.position": "38;-97", "ContentId": 9193246, "ABC.site": "ABC News", "ABC.editorialGenre": "News & Current Affairs", "ABC.tags": "donald-trump;print-media;social-media;offbeat;human-interest;information-and-communication", "ABC_WCMS_sitesearch_include": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "image": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8101808-16x9-700x394.jpg", "site": "@ABCNews"}, "ABC.productionUnit": "National news desk", "ABC.ContentType": "CMArticle", "DC.Publisher.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "DC.rights": "https://www.abc.net.au/conditions.htm#UseOfContent", "DC.rightsHolder": "ABC", "DC.type": "Current", "DC.title": "Trump says he turned down Time's Person of the Year \u2014 but the magazine denies asking him", "DC.creator.CorporateName": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", "DC.date": "2017-11-25T12:28:49+1100", "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.identifier": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-25/donald-trump-says-hell-probably-be-named-times-person-of-year/9193246", "DC.language": "en-AU", "DC.subject": "Person:Donald Trump;Information and Communication:Print Media;Information and Communication:Internet Culture:Social Media;Human Interest:Offbeat;Human Interest;Information and Communication", "DCTERMS.issued": "2017-11-25T12:28:49+1100", "DCTERMS.modified": "2017-11-25T23:51:34+1100", "DCTERMS.spatial": "east=-97;north=38", "og": {"title": "Trump says he turned down Time's Person of the Year \u2014 but the magazine denies asking him", "description": "US President Donald Trump says he's the frontrunner to take out 2017 Person of the Year but he took a pass.", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-25/donald-trump-says-hell-probably-be-named-times-person-of-year/9193246", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8101808-16x9-700x394.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 700, "height": 394}, "type": "Article", "updated_time": "2017-11-25T23:51:34+1100", "site_name": "ABC News"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-25T12:28:49+1100", "modified_time": "2017-11-25T23:51:34+1100", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/abcnews.au", "tag": "Human Interest"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ABC News", "fb": {"pages": 72924719987}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511539200.0, "source": "http://www.abc.net.au", "summary": ""}
