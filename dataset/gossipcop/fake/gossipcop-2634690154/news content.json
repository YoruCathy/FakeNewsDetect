The superstar took to Instagram to slam the gossip blog for a false story it published about him and former girlfriend Selena Gomez.\n\nSingling out just one of the numerous, fabricated Jelena claims the website has made up over the years, Bieber called out a story the blog posted on Thursday, May 28 headlined, \u201cJustin Bieber & Selena Gomez: Why Their Church Believes They Should Be Together.\u201d\n\n\u201cHollywood Life is the most outrageous fake weird non factual garbage website I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the 21-year-old ripped on Instagram, alongside a screenshot of the headline.\n\nExplaining why he finally spoke up, Bieber went on, \u201cThey literally make up whatever they want and usually I don\u2019t care, but this one is so ridiculous I had to say something. Don\u2019t go to their website and give them any traffic.\u201d\n\nThe heartthrob subsequently deleted his Instagram posting, but not before it was picked up by media outlets and commended by his fans.\n\nWhat\u2019s more insane is how much other outlets quotes their fanfics as facts https://t.co/4vBBbjmDu9 \u2014 Anzi (@JustinK007) May 29, 2015\n\nThe fake jelena stories are the worst\u2026 when they decided to drag the church into it, he had enough \u2014 banjokofolake (@banjokofolake) May 29, 2015\n\nFinally he said it\u2026suck on that @HollywoodLife. \u2014 JustinBieberCrew.com (@JBCrewdotcom) May 29, 2015\n\nIf i ever see a RT on my TL from @HollywoodLife you\u2019re getting automatically blocked i don\u2019t want to see any of their nonsense anymore. \u2014 Irene (@Tanziirene) May 29, 2015\n\nselena stans need to chill. he wasn\u2019t being mean to her at all. he\u2019s defending their church, which is important not only to him but her too \u2014 Laura (@PraiseNDream) May 29, 2015\n\nIn typical Hollywood Life fashion, the blog exploited Bieber and Gomez\u2019s Internet-igniting, joint appearance in a Snapchat story posted by Pastor Rich Wilkerson Jr. from a church-related meet in Los Angeles on Wednesday, (May 27). The pair were also reportedly seen at Hillsong Church in Los Angeles on May 24.\n\nAmong the claims Bieber found so \u201cridiculous\u201d in the site\u2019s subsequent report was a quote from a so-called \u201csource\u201d which alleged, \u201c[Justin and Selena\u2019s] pastors are pretty much all married and they married very young. They are very pro-marriage and pro-family and the feeling in that group is that Justin and Selena belong together.\u201d\n\nThe imaginary insider went on, \u201cJustin has said many many times that he believes Selena is his soul mate, and that isn\u2019t something his pastors take lightly. (sic)\u201d\n\nThe site also alleged that Selena\u2019s friend Taylor Swift was miffed over Bieber and Gomez hanging out. It\u2019s claimed that \u201conce she [Swift] heard about Selena being with Justin again, she just shook her head and was very disappointed.\u201d\n\nThe watchdog website Gossip Cop has since confirmed Swift made no such comment. In addition, both E! News and TMZ reported Bieber and Gomez are not remotely considering reuniting and ran into each other unexpectedly at Wilkerson\u2019s gathering.\n\n\u201cThey are definitely not back together whatsoever,\u201d an insider told E! \u201cDefinitely not.\u201d The source added that the duo were \u201ccordial and friendly to each other,\u201d and that, \u201cfor the first time, it wasn\u2019t awkward. It was harmless.\u201d\n\nBefore Bieber deleted his riot act Instagram, fans noticed Ariana Grande was among the thousands who left a comment. The songstress wrote, \u201cyaaaaasss justin yaaaaasss.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Screenshot of Ariana Grande comment At Justin Bieber's pre-deleted Instagram post)\n\nIn so doing, Grande joins an ever-expanding list of celebrities who have publicly criticized Hollywood Life for fabricating reports. That list includes Gomez, who previously stated that the site\u2019s stories about her were \u201cnever true.\u201d Austin Mahone angry-tweeted the site after it reported a false story about his breakup with Fifth Harmony\u2019s Camila Cabello.\n\nMore recently, Hailey Baldwin slammed the site as \u201cabsolutely disgusting\u201d after it claimed that she, Bieber, and mutual pal Kendall Jenner, are involved in a sexual love triangle.\n\nHey @HollywoodLife I think u guys are absolutely disgusting. U should really learn to leave teenagers be and stop writing so much garbage. \u2014 Hailey Baldwin (@haileybaldwin) May 13, 2015\n\nConsidering the disgraced Hollywood Life topped Gossip Cop\u2019s \u201cWorst Outlet in Celebrity Journalism\u201d report last November, and has just been shamed again by the watchdog site for falsely claiming Bieber recently contacted Gomez about recording a new duet \u2014 only one question remains:\n\nWhy is any media outlet of repute still citing Hollywood Life as a credible source? Is it at all likely that this repeatedly exposed clickbait-chaser has access to insiders close enough to Bieber and Gomez to back up its risible, 24/7 \u201cExclusives!\u201d?\n\nUpdate: Tellingly, the story in question has since been taken down from Hollywood Life\u2019s website since Bieber\u2019s \u201cfinal straw\u201d statement. Whether the blog intends to remove the rest of its extensive Jelena content remains to be seen.\n\n[Images via Juliano-KMMix/x17online/Instagram]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/yas.jpg", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Justin-Bieber-Shames-Hollywood-Life-Over-Ridiculous-Selena-Gomez-Story.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b911717e2a01903d946c8f1136c6928f?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Page Mackinley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/2129366/justin-bieber-hollywood-life-site-selena-gomez-fake-garbage-media/", "title": "Justin Bieber Destroys Gossip Site Over Bogus Selena Gomez Church Story", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/L_m-pXGNXd4"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
