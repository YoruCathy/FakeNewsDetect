That would be so amazing if you have a little girl and Stormi and Chicago all get to grow up together being so close in age! Either way I\u2019m so happy for you and @RealTristan13!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay guys, is @khloekardashian also having a girl? All pink diner party?\u201d asked a third.\n\nThe speculation comes just days after the Kardashian-Jenner clan welcomed another baby into the family, with Kylie Jenner giving birth to Stormi Webster.\n\nThe 20-year-old kept her pregnancy away from the spotlight and revealed the arrival of her healthy baby with rapper Travis Scott in a sweet YouTube video last weekend.\n\nIn an accompanying post, Jenner wrote: \"I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions. I understand you're used to me bringing you along on all my journeys.\n\n\"My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how.\"\n\nThe 11-minute clip showed fans a glimpse into her pregnancy and included shots with her whole family, including her pregnant sister Khlo\u00e9 and newborn niece Chicago West.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed their third child, nickname Chi, earlier this year via a \u201cgestational carrier\u201d.", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/08/khloek.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/08/khloek.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natasha Sporn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/khloe-kardashian-has-fans-convinced-shes-expecting-a-baby-girl-with-dinner-party-snaps-a3760681.html", "title": "Khloe Kardashian has fans convinced she's expecting a baby girl", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/khloe-kardashian-has-fans-convinced-shes-expecting-a-baby-girl-with-dinner-party-snaps-a3760681.html", "title": "Khloe Kardashian has fans convinced she's expecting a baby girl with dinner party snaps", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has sparked speculation that she is expecting a baby girl after throwing an all-pink dinner party.
