Despite the intense emotional toll that this might take on someone, Selena Gomez has managed to navigate a path with grace and has it figured out.\n\nAt a mere 25-years-old, the actress-slash-singer is pretty much a confident sage when it comes to body positivity\u2014especially since her life-saving kidney transplant, which she got earlier this year to help with her autoimmune disease called lupus.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at my body now, I just see life,\u201d Gomez tells Billboard in a recent interview (oh yeah, she just won their \u2018Woman of the Year\u2019 award, NBD). \u201cThere are a million things I could do\u2014lasers and creams and all that stuff\u2014but I\u2019m okay with it. I don\u2019t have perfect abs, but I feel like I\u2019m wonderfully made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have perfect abs, but I feel like I\u2019m wonderfully made.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say this self-confidence came easily\u2014especially as she\u2019s facing a newly minted surgery scar (which she admits was \u201chard in the beginning\u201d). \u201cI remember looking at myself in the mirror completely naked and thinking about all the things that I used to bitch about and just asking, \u2018Why?'\u201d she says.\n\nNow, after all that she\u2019s been through (which is a lot), Gomez is feeling all of the positive vibes. \u201cI just keep thinking about how much my body is my own,\u201d she says. \u201c[After the surgery] I had this sense of gratitude for myself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever just stopped and been like, \u2018I\u2019m actually grateful for who I am.\u2019 I do. I didn\u2019t, but I do now.\u201d Hey, everyone should love themselves like a love song (had to).\n\nFor more Selena love, this is the super healthy way that Gomez starts her day. And these are her empowering bags that she made in collab with Coach.", "images": ["https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/plant-paradox-diet-getty-HoxtonTom-Merton-600x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WG-Plusfactor-Cookbook-April-150x150.png", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/themes/wellgood-2016/assets/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EditCoverFX-092bw-e1576182266766-150x150.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1192882801-sized.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1753-Estee-CCA-Branded-Feature-1400px-v2.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lentil-balls-vegan-snack-attack-607x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MitoQ_CCA3_Branded-Feature-1400px-2-609x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-455115875-599x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stocksy_txp8d0248cbaYQ200_Small_1389457-forgot-my-bra-600x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-confidence.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1709-Kroger_CWU2-Feature_1400px.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/themes/wellgood-2016/assets/img/made-in-ny.png"], "top_img": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-confidence.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/selena-gomez-feels-the-self-love/", "title": "Why Selena Gomez is so self-confident", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/favicon-194x194.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"pages": 91915774693}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@iamwellandgood", "site": "@iamwellandgood", "title": "Why Selena Gomez is so self-confident | Well+Good", "description": "After a kidney transplant, Gomez has a new and inspiring philosophy on body positivity.", "image": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-confidence.jpg"}, "description": "After a kidney transplant, Gomez has a new and inspiring philosophy on body positivity.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Selena Gomez is so self-confident | Well+Good", "description": "After a kidney transplant, Gomez has a new and inspiring philosophy on body positivity.", "url": "https://www.wellandgood.com/good-advice/selena-gomez-feels-the-self-love/", "site_name": "Well+Good", "updated_time": "2020-01-24T15:34:46+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-confidence.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-confidence.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/iamwellandgood", "tag": "news", "section": "Good Advice", "published_time": "2017-12-01T22:11:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-24T15:34:46+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "pocket-site-verification": "e5ab52bbadc2281f4803a907a07a48"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512166295.0, "source": "http://www.wellandgood.com", "summary": ""}
