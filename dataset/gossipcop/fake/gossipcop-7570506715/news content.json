The way you have handled all of this has been more inspiring and made me more proud than you\u2019ll ever know.\n\nThe compassion, kindness, love, strength and oneness that you\u2019ve shown one another this past week is the exact opposite of the heinous intentions it must take to pull off something as evil as what happened Monday.\n\nYOU are the opposite.\n\nI am sorry for the pain and fear that you must be feeling and for the trauma that you, too, must be experiencing.\n\nWe will never be able to understand why events like this take place because it is not in our nature, which is why we shouldn\u2019t recoil.\n\nWe will not quit or operate in fear.\n\nWe won\u2019t let this divide us.\n\nWe won\u2019t let hate win.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go the rest of the year without being able to see and hold and uplift my fans, the same way they continue to uplift me.\n\nOur response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before.\n\nI\u2019ll be returning to the incredibly brave city of Manchester to spend time with my fans and to have a benefit concert in honor of and to raise money for the victims and their families. I want to than my fellow musicians and friends for reaching out to be a part of our expression of love for Manchester. I will have details to share with you as soon as everything is confirmed.\n\nFrom the day we started putting the Dangerous Woman Tour together, I said that this show, more than anything else, was intended to be a safe space for my fans. A place for them to escape, to celebrate, to heal, to feel safe and to be themselves. To meet their friends they\u2019ve made online. To express themselves.\n\nThis will not change that.\n\nWhen you look into the audience at my shows, you see a beautiful, diverse, pure, happy crowd.\n\nThousands of people, incredibly different, all there for the same reason, music.\n\nMusic is something that everyone on Earth can share.\n\nMusic is meant to heal us, to bring us together, to make us happy.\n\nSo that is what it will continue to do for us. We will continue in honor of the ones we lost, their loved ones, my fans and all affected by this tragedy. They will be on my mind and in my heart everyday and I will think of them with everything I do for the rest of my life.\n\nAri", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg", "http://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/manchester-attack-read-ariana-grandes-full-statement-benefit-concert-a7758621.html", "title": "Manchester attack: Read Ariana Grande's statement in full as she announces benefit concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/manchester-attack-read-ariana-grandes-full-statement-benefit-concert-a7758621.html", "title": "Read Ariana Grande's fresh statement about the Manchester attack in full", "updated_time": "2017-05-26T21:20:09+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/7758621"}, "description": "Ariana Grande has penned a heartfelt letter to her fans urging bravery and compassion just days after the tragic attack in Manchester that left 22 people dead and scores more injured.
