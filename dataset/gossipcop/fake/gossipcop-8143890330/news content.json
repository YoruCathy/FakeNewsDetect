This may help to explain his tragic actions, as despite being relatively unfamiliar, it is a deeply serious and unpleasant condition\n\nNearly a year and half ago, I wrote a piece about suicide and depression in the wake of Robin Williams\u2019 death. You may have read it. A lot of people did. I didn\u2019t expect to have revisit this subject again, and yet here we are. But for good reason.\n\nThe original piece, and the unpleasant comments from numerous people that first inspired it, stemmed from the widespread assumption that Robin Williams ended his life due to struggles with depression, a condition he was known to have dealt with often.\n\nHowever, a recent interview with his widow, Susan Williams, reveals that the beloved actor was actually struggling with dementia with Lewy Bodies, sometimes known as Lewy Body dementia. While making the loss of such a beloved individual no less tragic, this does throw a different light on matters.\n\nDementia with Lewy Bodies is not as common or well known as depression, or the more familiar forms of dementia, most obviously Alzheimer\u2019s disease. However, even among the grim spectrum of neurological disorders and mental illnesses, dementia with Lewy Bodies is a particularly nasty condition. Here\u2019s why.\n\nWhat are Lewy Bodies?\n\nThe most obvious question when encountering dementia with Lewy Bodies is, what are Lewy Bodies? What do they do? Why are they important? What damage do they cause?\n\nPut simply, Lewy Bodies are lumps, known as aggregates, of misshapen protein (of the type Alpha-synuclein) that occur in nerve cells (neurons) of people with certain conditions, most often Parkinson\u2019s disease, and but also (obviously) dementia with Lewy Bodies. Cells as complex and important as neurons produce a bewildering array of proteins, to aid in the necessary functions and form the delicate cytoskeletal structure in place to maintain everything.\n\nSometimes, certain proteins are formed wrongly, and rather than integrating seamlessly into the cell they form (relatively) big clumps. Exactly why this happens is currently unknown, but the fact that it occurs in cells throughout the brain suggests some sort of underlying genetic effect.\n\nWhatever the initial cause, these protein aggregates build up in neurons, and are believed to clog and disrupt the vital processes taking place within, damaging the cell and eventually causing it to die. Similar processes are believed to take place in other neurodegenerative disorders, like tau tangles in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and inclusion bodies in Huntington\u2019s disease.\n\nWhat problems do they cause?\n\nThe thing about dementia with Lewy Bodies is that it\u2019s not at all restrained when it comes to causing debilitating symptoms. The Lewy Bodies occur in regions throughout the brain, all of which provide important, often crucial functions for everyday life. The presence of Lewy Bodies mean multiple problems occur in conjunction, but for a diagnosis of probable dementia with Lewy Bodies, two of the following three symptoms must be evident\n\nFluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness (meaning a wildly varying level of mental ability and thinking)\n\n\n\nRecurrent visual hallucinations that are typically well formed and detailed (striking and persistent hallucinations, seeing things that aren\u2019t there)\n\n\n\nSpontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism (stiffness, tremor, involuntary jerks etc.)\n\n\n\nWe say \u201cprobable\u201d dementia with Lewy Bodies because at present it can only be confirmed with a post-mortem. But there are numerous features that back up a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy Bodies if added to the three core symptoms above, and these include sleep disruption, repeated falls, non-visual hallucinations, loss of consciousness, delusions and, back where we started, depression.\n\nTaken all together, a severe case of dementia with Lewy Bodies means you potentially can\u2019t think, can\u2019t sleep, can\u2019t stay awake, can\u2019t trust what you see, can\u2019t move, can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going and can\u2019t be happy. Judging by her Susan Williams\u2019 comments about the speed of progression of his symptoms, it sounds like Robin Williams had a severe case of dementia with Lewy Bodies.\n\nHow common is dementia with Lewy Bodies?\n\nCurrent figures suggest that dementia with Lewy Bodies is the third most common type of distinct dementia, after Alzheimer\u2019s disease and vascular dementia successively. Around 4% of dementia cases are believed to be dementia with Lewy Bodies (although some estimates put it as high as 10%), and that\u2019s an increasingly large number. With 850,000 dementia sufferers in the UK at present, and an increasingly ageing population meaning this is predicted to increase to 1.15 million over the next 10 years, this means we can expect to see 46,000 cases of dementia with Lewy Bodies by 2025 in the UK alone.\n\nThe most likely people to develop dementia with Lewy Bodies are men, aged early 60s to 70s. Sadly, Robin Williams fell right into this category.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t it more well-known?\n\nAs stated, it\u2019s not the most common dementia. Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most familiar type of dementia, is far more common, and tends to get the most attention and recognition as a result. Dementia with Lewy Bodies is also somewhat hard to pin down. You\u2019re relying on observations of people who have it, and as detailed above their current mental state is severely compromised, so it\u2019s very hard to get consistent or reliable reports from them on what they\u2019re experiencing.\n\nThis is also compounded by the fact that not every possible symptom occurs in every patient, and many symptoms are also evident in other types of dementia, further confounding diagnosis. The big overlap with Parkinson\u2019s disease is the same problem from another angle.\n\nOn top of this, there\u2019s also disagreement among the relevant experts as to how to classify it. Some argue that it shouldn\u2019t be a distinct type of dementia and is more of a subtype of Parkinson\u2019s disease, but the current consensus is that it is a separate disorder. But if even the experts in possession of all the available data can\u2019t quite agree on what it is, it\u2019s unsurprising that more among the general public don\u2019t have much of an idea about it.\n\nWhat can be done about dementia with Lewy Bodies?\n\nThere\u2019s little to be done about it, sadly. Behavioural and therapeutic interventions exist that can help manage the symptoms, but that\u2019s about it. Some pharmacological treatments may help, but frustratingly dementia with Lewy Bodies rules out some of the already limited drugs for neurological disorders. Levodopa, the typical treatment for symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, is known to worsen the mental symptoms of dementia with Lewy Bodies. And antipsychotics are ruled out entirely, as they exacerbate things to the point where risk of death is greatly increased.\n\nSo it wasn\u2019t depression?\n\nAs Susan Williams said, if Robin Williams had depression at the time of his death, it was one of countless other symptoms he was dealing with. A look at the brief summary above shows just how all-consuming dementia with Lewy Bodies can be.\n\nBut depression and dementia with Lewy Bodies often occur together, as is the case with most dementias. This is entirely understandable; it would take someone of superhuman mental fortitude to not let such a diagnosis affect them very deeply.\n\nWe will never know exactly what Robin Williams was thinking when he opted to end his own life, and at this point it seems disrespectful and more than a little sinister to keep asking. However, given the number of things dementia with Lewy Bodies can put a person through, accusations of \u201cselfishness\u201d now seem more unwarranted than ever.\n\nThe NHS has detailed information on dementia with Lewy Bodies for individuals who may be concerned or interested in the condition. Organisations like The Alzheimer\u2019s Society, Parkinson\u2019s UK or The Mental Health Foundation are also available to help.\n\nDean Burnett would really rather not have to write about this again, to be honest.
