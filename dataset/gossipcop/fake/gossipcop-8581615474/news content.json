That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.\n\nAccording to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.\n\nBut then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn\u2019t ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s birthday party in November, the site alleges.\n\nSo Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d boyfriend they needed to break up.\n\n\u201cJamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,\u201d a source told RadarOnline. \u201cKatie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie\u2019s behavior. She knew it wasn\u2019t healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri\u2019s life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn\u2019t see her.\n\n\u201cTom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn\u2019t see Suri, he didn\u2019t question it,\u201d an insider told the Star. \u201cBut Tom\u2019s tired of being bossed around by them. He\u2019s had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he\u2019s missed out on so much. He\u2019s dying to be a part of her life!\u201d\n\nHolmes isn\u2019t a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to \u201cbrainwash\u201d her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what\u2019s best for Suri.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,\u201d an insider told the Star. \u201cSuri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what\u2019s best for her. Tom has assured her he won\u2019t bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.\n\nBut notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes\u2019 publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.\n\n\u201cThe Radar story is 100 percent untrue,\u201d Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.\n\nPeople and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes\u2019 publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.\n\nAfter the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.\n\nThe secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.\n\nThose reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.\n\nSince then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis\u2019s Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx\u2019s 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.\n\nHolmes\u2019 romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.\n\nHolmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.\n\nHolmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.\n\nWhat appears certain about Holmes\u2019 life is that she\u2019s been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.\n\nNumerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter\u2019s philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.\n\n\u201cMy little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,\u201d Holmes said, according to People.\n\nOver the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.\n\nHolmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/babydriver_4.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20150318_100415_OSCARS.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/20120709__peoplemag1.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/KatieHolmes11.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/suricruise2.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/KatieHolmes11.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
