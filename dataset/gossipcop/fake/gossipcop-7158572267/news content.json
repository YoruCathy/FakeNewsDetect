{"url": "www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/prince-harry-meghan-markle-united-states-tour-report", "text": "The cover of Us Weekly this week features a Photoshopped composite of our pals Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, with an American flag floating just above Meghan\u2019s head. \u201cCOMING TO AMERICA!\u201d the cover line shouts (with the similarly all-caps question touted beneath: \u201cBUT IS HER DAD ON THE LIST?\u201d).\n\nYes, the magazine claims that, per a Palace insider, Harry and Meghan are in the midst of planning a U.S. tour in the spring of 2019 (their first full-scale overseas tour as a married couple is set for this October, when they will travel to Australia and New Zealand timed for the Invictus Games). \u201cThey are so excited to head to the U.S.\u201d the insider told the magazine. \u201cMeghan is looking forward to introducing Harry to everything she loves about the U.S.\u201d (Feel free to begin searching through the entries from the Tig you printed and arranged in a scrapbook to start deducing to which eateries and boutiques Meghan might introduce her husband.)\n\nUs Weekly has additional posited details it is offering up, as well, claiming that the duo are \u201cthinking New York, Washington, D.C., and California,\u201d though they are \u201cworking to finalize locations and venues.\u201d In California, they will reportedly visit San Francisco, where \u201cthey will meet with C.E.O.s and female tech entrepreneurs to encourage their involvement in the industry.\u201d (Perhaps Meghan can pitch some Silicon Valley types on a Tig-esque recommendations app; or Harry can offer some suggestions on . . . maybe a polo V.R. experience?) \u201cMeghan and Harry want to solidify ties between the U.K. and the U.S.,\u201d the source says. \u201cThey want to highlight and foster these relationships.\u201d There might be a Chicago component, as well, involving a stop at the Obama Foundation. While this is starting to sound like a quite sprawling tour already, there is also apparently talk of extending it to Canada, where Meghan lived (in Toronto) while she was filming Suits, for seven seasons.\n\nThe royal-related rumors\u2014particularly Meghan-related ones\u2014come fast and furious these days, so it\u2019s hard to know exactly how seriously to take this report. A trip that involves stops in New York City, D.C., San Francisco, Chicago, and Canada, seems somewhat insane; on the other hand, they will surely visit the U.S. at some point soon, especially since Meghan is from here. (The publication notes that Meghan will be making an \u201cunofficial\u201d solo trip to New York and Los Angeles later this summer \u201cto see family and friends.\u201d We can only imagine what sort of comments Thomas Markle will be making if that trip does not involve a stop to see him.)\n\nVanity Fair has reached out to the Palace for comment on the report.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab056c0055288786e119/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/l-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/josh-duboff-square.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Duboff", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/prince-harry-meghan-markle-united-states-tour-report", "title": "Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Coming to the U.S.?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Josh Duboff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.", "id": "5b4faa7712afc00c253e5cbb", "keywords": "style,royals,prince harry,meghan markle", "news_keywords": "style,royals,prince harry,meghan markle", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b4faa7712afc00c253e5cbb", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Coming to the U.S.?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/prince-harry-meghan-markle-united-states-tour-report"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "A new report claims the couple will be making stops across the nation.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4fab05b7dc810b67cf7664/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Meg-Harry-US-Tour.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Coming to the U.S.?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
