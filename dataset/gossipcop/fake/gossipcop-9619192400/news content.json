She enjoys being single but knowing Justin is moving on still hurts.\u201d\n\nAlthough Selena and Justin have both seemed to be living their best single lives since their split, we can understand why Justin\u2019s public romantic moments would get to her. \u201cSelena is sad things are the way they are between her and Justin because despite everything, she still has strong feelings for him,\u201d the source continued. \u201cSelena still misses him and thinks about Justin all the time.\u201d Selena\u2019s own experience with having a love life with Justin keeps her weary of his relationship with anyone else. \u201cSelena has major doubts that Justin and Hailey will stay together very long,\u201d the source said. \u201cSelena knows better than anyone how challenging it can be to maintain a relationship with Justin. She wishes Justin the best and hopes he does not break Hailey\u2019s heart by quickly losing interest again.\u201d\n\nHailey doesn\u2019t seem to be too concerned with getting her heart broken just yet. The blonde beauty always seems to have a carefree and fun-loving attitude whenever she\u2019s around Justin. Whether she\u2019s drying him off with a towel or grabbing coffee with the singer, her happiness shines through. It will be interesting to see where things go from here!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-trying-to-ignore-justin-hailey-romance-hurt-rex-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F18%2Fselena-gomez-hurt-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-romance%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3187919", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-trying-to-ignore-justin-hailey-romance-hurt-rex-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-trying-to-ignore-justin-hailey-romance-hurt-rex-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/18/selena-gomez-hurt-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-romance/", "title": "Selena Gomez Trying To Ignore Justin Bieber\u2019s Romance With Hailey Baldwin But It Still Hurts", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez is trying to ignore Justin Bieber's relationship with Hailey Baldwin", "news_keywords": "Hailey Baldwin, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez Trying To Ignore Justin Bieber\u2019s Romance With Hailey Baldwin But It Still Hurts", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/18/selena-gomez-hurt-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-romance/", "description": "Selena Gomez has been doing her best to not pay attention to ex Justin Bieber\u2019s new romance with Hailey Baldwin and despite being bothered by it, she doesn\u2019t think their relationship wi\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-trying-to-ignore-justin-hailey-romance-hurt-rex-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-19T03:54:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-19T03:54:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Selena Gomez Trying To Ignore Justin Bieber\u2019s Romance With Hailey Baldwin But It Still Hurts"}, "image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/selena-gomez-trying-to-ignore-justin-hailey-romance-hurt-rex-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena Gomez Trying To Ignore Justin Bieber\u2019s Romance With Hailey Baldwin But It Still Hurts", "description": "Selena Gomez is trying to ignore Justin Bieber's relationship with Hailey Baldwin"}, "author": "Erin Silvia", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529251200.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
