Brad Thinks Angelina\u2019s Iraq Trip A Big Publicity Stunt, Says Source Pitt suspects Jolie\u2019s goodwill work is \u2018only to benefit her own ego.\u2019\n\nAngelina Jolie recently headed to the Middle East for the United Nations amid her ongoing custody battle with Brad Pitt, but could she have more than helping refugees on her mind?\n\n\u201cBrad used to admire Angie\u2019s humanitarian work, but is now more suspicious of her true motivations,\u201d a source exclusively told RadarOnline.com. \u201cBrad wasn\u2019t surprised that Angie went to Iraq over the weekend when he was with the kids for Father\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nAs Radar reported, Pitt, 54, recently won more visitation rights with the kids he shares with Jolie \u2014 Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 9-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox.\n\nThe exes\u2019 eldest son, Maddox, 16, can decide for himself how much time he spends with his famous dad.\n\n\u201cAngie had already been fuming that details of the temporary custody agreement for the kids this summer had been made public, and according to Brad, she probably hoped the trip to Iraq would deflect negative coverage of her,\u201d said the source.\n\n\u201cFor someone to claim to not care about what the press says about her, Angie seems deeply engaged and in the know about what the public perception of her is.\u201d\n\nWhile the source noted Jolie\u2019s Iraq trip had been planned before the custody deal was leaked, \u201cBrad thinks a lot of her work is only to benefit her own ego.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
