His lady Gwen Stefani is happy to be celebrating with him, but a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that she has some mixed emotions too. Here\u2019s why.\n\nBirthdays are always a blast! So why is Gwen Stefani, 47, sulking over her man Blake Shelton\u2019s? He\u2019s turning 41 on June 18, but she\u2019s having some conflicting feelings about it. \u201cGwen is having some varied emotions this year when it comes to Blake\u2019s birthday since it lands on Father\u2019s Day,\u201d an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. What\u2019s so bad about Father\u2019s Day? See pics of Gwen & Blake, here.\n\n\u201cFather\u2019s Day reminds her of Gavin [Rossdale],\u201d said the source, explaining that she still aches thinking about her kids\u2019 dad. That doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t see a plus side, though. \u201cIt also reminds her of the family she is starting with Blake because he is now getting into the role of step dad even with them not being officially married.\u201d We think it\u2019s sweet that he\u2019s stepping up to play dad for her sons!\n\n\u201cSo as much as she wants to celebrate Blake\u2019s birthday, she also has to think of Gavin that day and it\u2019s a little weird and gets her to be a little emotional,\u201d continued the insider. \u201cBut Blake is taking things as they come with humor. He\u2019s putting her at ease saying that all they have to do is be together and he will be there for her regardless of what emotions she has on that day. He respects Gavin as the father of her kids and knows he will be in the picture forever so he is okay with Gwen\u2019s feelings and will do his best to make her not worry about it as much.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you feel bad for Gwen being conflicted over Blake\u2019s b-day?
