He released a statement to Us saying that it was a \u201cmisinterpretation of an entirely innocent situation.\u201d\n\nKlum confirmed the split to People on Monday, September 25, and while Schnabel hasn\u2019t commented publicly, he has posted telling updates on Instagram this week that hint at heartache and loss.\n\nIn one post, he shared the song \u201cJust One of Those Days\u201d by Sizzla, which features the lyrics, \u201cOh girl and you know I care / Why does it have to be this way / Can\u2019t tell you go, can\u2019t tell you to stay.\u201d\n\nIn another, he shared the song \u201cOh Honey\u201d by Delegation, with the lyrics, \u201cWhen I feel low, I\u2019ve nowhere to go / She\u2019ll be my inspiration / Yeah, when my poor heart is breakin\u2019 apart / She\u2019ll put it back together.\u201d\n\nThe America\u2019s Got Talent judge, 44, and the art dealer and son of director Julian Schnabel, 31, began dating in 2014, two years after Klum split with husband Seal. She and the British singer share three children, Henry, 12, Johan, 10, and daughter Lou, 7. The Project Runway host is also the mom of daughter Leni, 13, from a previous relationship.\n\nKlum was in Vegas over the weekend and caught Jennifer Lopez\u2019s show, sharing a backstage photo with the singer and actress on Instagram. She also attended the Emmy Awards in L.A. on September 17 solo.\n\nLove you @jlo \u2026\u2764\ufe0fYour show was absolutely AMAZING #vegas #allihave A post shared by Heidi Klum (@heidiklum) on Sep 24, 2017 at 12:55am PDT\n\nThe supermodel and Seal finalized their divorce in 2014 and she went on to date her bodyguard Martin Kirsten. Klum was spotted spending time with British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, 32, at the Harper\u2019s Bazaar Icons event at New York Fashion Week on September 8, but a source told Us at the time that they weren\u2019t dating.\n\nSchnabel was previously linked to Demi Moore, Elle Macpherson and Liv Tyler.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645735658_heidi-klum-vito-schnabel-zoom-0f5ed1fe-7b1a-48ed-9076-1427c7c1e4d4.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645735658_heidi-klum-vito-schnabel-zoom-9e106e5e-a901-4444-a663-7cfae6eceb9c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1578px%2C828px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645735658_heidi-klum-vito-schnabel-zoom-9e106e5e-a901-4444-a663-7cfae6eceb9c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1578px%2C828px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vito-schnabel-shares-his-heartbreak-over-heidi-klum-split-w505616/", "title": "Vito Schnabel Shares His Heartbreak Over Heidi Klum Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Heidi Klum and Vito Schnabel have broken up after dating for three years and the art dealer is sharing his pain on Instagram \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vito Schnabel Shares His Heartbreak Over Heidi Klum Split", "description": "Heidi Klum and Vito Schnabel have broken up after dating for three years and the art dealer is sharing his pain on Instagram \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vito-schnabel-shares-his-heartbreak-over-heidi-klum-split-w505616/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:30:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645735658_heidi-klum-vito-schnabel-zoom-9e106e5e-a901-4444-a663-7cfae6eceb9c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1578px%2C828px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645735658_heidi-klum-vito-schnabel-zoom-9e106e5e-a901-4444-a663-7cfae6eceb9c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1578px%2C828px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-09-27T00:15:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:30:05+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Heidi Klum and Vito Schnabel have broken up after dating for three years and the art dealer is sharing his pain on Instagram \u2014 get the details", "title": "Vito Schnabel Shares His Heartbreak Over Heidi Klum Split", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/645735658_heidi-klum-vito-schnabel-zoom-9e106e5e-a901-4444-a663-7cfae6eceb9c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1578px%2C828px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506471318.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
