She has many reasons,\u201d a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.\n\nGarner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.\n\nThough the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck\u2019s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is \u201cthe fact that Ben had an affair with her.\u201d\n\nHowever, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, \u201cBen understands and has honored her request.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re good friends,\u201d the source adds. \u201cShe wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what\u2019s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.\u201d\n\nWhile the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck\u2019s past struggles with alcohol abuse.\n\n\u201cThe one thing she\u2019s not flexible on is sobriety,\u201d the source tells Us. \u201cJen is hesitant to sign off until she\u2019s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.\u201d\n\nFor more on Garner and Affleck\u2019s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d below!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/us-weekly-cover-jennifer-garner.jpg?w=222", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-Lindsay-Shookus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-Lindsay-Shookus.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-Lindsay-Shookus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-garner-doesnt-want-her-kids-around-lindsay-shookus/", "title": "Jennifer Garner \u2018Doesn\u2019t Want\u2019 Her Kids Around Lindsay Shookus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jennifer Garner \u2018doesn\u2019t want\u2019 her three kids with Ben Affleck around his girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Garner \u2018Doesn\u2019t Want\u2019 Kids Around Ben Affleck\u2019s GF Lindsay Shookus", "description": "Jennifer Garner \u2018doesn\u2019t want\u2019 her three kids with Ben Affleck around his girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-garner-doesnt-want-her-kids-around-lindsay-shookus/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:09:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-Lindsay-Shookus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-Lindsay-Shookus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Exclusive", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-26T20:03:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:09:19+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jennifer Garner \u2018doesn\u2019t want\u2019 her three kids with Ben Affleck around his girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 details", "title": "Jennifer Garner \u2018Doesn\u2019t Want\u2019 Kids Around Ben Affleck\u2019s GF Lindsay Shookus", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-Lindsay-Shookus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532635435.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
