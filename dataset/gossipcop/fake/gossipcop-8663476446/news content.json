Borris is also the location of one of Ireland\u2019s most successful arts festivals, the Borris House Festival of Writing and Ideas, which this year included speakers such as Margaret Atwood, Cillian Murphy, Led Zeppelin\u2019s John Paul Jones and Bob Geldof.\n\nHolmes is believed to have flown to Ireland from Paris where she was spotted last week, and stayed the night in one of the house\u2019s opulent bedrooms with stunning views over the Irish countryside.\n\nHolmes was also spotted in the nearby town of Kilkenny.\n\nHolmes and Foxx kept their relationship secret for several years, prompting speculation that Tom Cruise had \u2018banned\u2019 Holmes from dating for five years after the split as part of their divorce settlement.\n\nFoxx was recently accused of slapping a woman in the face with his penis in 2002 after she refused to give him oral sex, triggering PTSD, but that case has now been closed without charge. Foxx emphatically denied the allegation.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_336,w_598,x_0,y_148/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1531125797/Screenshot_2018-07-09_09.42.49_upypuq", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779071/author/tom-sykes-author-new.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_336,w_598,x_0,y_148/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1531125797/Screenshot_2018-07-09_09.42.49_upypuq", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_336,w_598,x_0,y_148/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1531125797/Screenshot_2018-07-09_09.42.49_upypuq", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-holmes-checks-out-irish-wedding-venue", "title": "Katie Holmes Checks Out Irish Wedding Venue", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Katie Holmes Checks Out Irish Wedding Venue", "keywords": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx", "og": {"title": "Katie Holmes Checks Out Irish Wedding Venue", "description": "With Jamie Foxx\u2019s penis-slapping case out of the way, and Holmes making a trip to an Irish stately home and wedding venue, could love be in the air for the Hollywood couple?", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-holmes-checks-out-irish-wedding-venue", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_336,w_598,x_0,y_148/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1531125797/Screenshot_2018-07-09_09.42.49_upypuq"}, "description": "With Jamie Foxx\u2019s penis-slapping case out of the way, and Holmes making a trip to an Irish stately home and wedding venue, could love be in the air for the Hollywood couple?", "authors": "Tom Sykes", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2018-07-09T10:57:12.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/tom-sykes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@royalist", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_336,w_598,x_0,y_148/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1531125797/Screenshot_2018-07-09_09.42.49_upypuq"}, "sailthru.date": "2018-07-09T10:57:12.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2018-07-23T10:57:12.000Z", "publicationDate": 201807091057, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Tom Sykes\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-holmes-checks-out-irish-wedding-venue\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\",\"rubric\":\"Ding Dong?\"},\"post_id\":\"katie-holmes-checks-out-irish-wedding-venue\",\"pub_date\":\"2018-07-09T10:57:12+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"tags\":[\"Katie Holmes\",\"Jamie Foxx\",\"typeArticle\",\"express\"],\"title\":\"Katie Holmes Checks Out Irish Wedding Venue\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531133832.0, "source": "http://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
