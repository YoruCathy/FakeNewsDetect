He is feeling \u2018tense\u2019 over her ex, Chris Brown!\n\nDespite keeping their relationship super private, Rihanna, 29, and Hassan Jameel, stepped out on Grammys night, proving they\u2019re still going strong. However, Hassan \u2014 a billionaire businessman and Toyota heir \u2014 is stressing over RiRi\u2019s ex, Chris Brown, 28. \u201cHe is uncomfortable with her ex Chris lurking in her past,\u201d a source close to Rihanna tells HollywoodLife.com. As previously reported, Chris has been keeping a close eye on his ex and her new man, as he\u2019s been known to have lingering feelings from their past romance. With that being said, \u201cHassan doesn\u2019t trust Chris and he feels like he is unpredictable when it comes to Rihanna.\u201d\n\nAlthough the insider says Rihanna has opened up to Hassan about her relationship with Chris and assured him that that\u2019s all part of her past, Hassan isn\u2019t entirely convinced. \u201cHe feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy,\u201d the source admits. \u201cHassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.\u201d\n\nRihanna and Hassan have yet to confirm their relationship since they were first romantically linked in June 2017. The pair were photographed in each other\u2019s arms amidst a make-out session at a private villa in Spain. However, both RiRi and Hassan have kept things under wraps, only stepping out separately and never being photographed in the same shot. The two were spotted dining at the same London restaurant in September 2017, and then they travel to Boston in October of that year.\n\nThe rumored new couple attended hit the same Grammy afterparty at 1Oak Nightclub in New York City on Sunday, where they were photographed leaving separately. But, RiRi excited the club shortly after Hassan had left.\n\nHassan\u2019s worries over Chris come at the same time reports claim the singer is dating Indonesian singer/songwriter, Agnez Mo. Chris and Mo have been fueling the romance rumors, posting flirty photos together and stepped out together. They were most recently spotted holding hands during a Disneyland date over the January 6/7 weekend.\n\nHollywoodLifers, who would you like to see Rihanna date?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rihanna_chris-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F30%2Frihanna-boyfriend-hassan-jameel-worried-chris-brown-relationship-not-over%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2971755&comment_count=4", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rihanna_chris-ftr.jpg?w=620"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/rihanna_chris-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/30/rihanna-boyfriend-hassan-jameel-worried-chris-brown-relationship-not-over/", "title": "Rihanna\u2019s BF Hassan Jameel Worried About \u2018Unpredictable\u2019 Chris Brown & Fears He Wants Her Back", "meta_data": {"description": "Although Rihanna and Hassan Jameel just spent Grammys night together, they're still working through some things from her past.
