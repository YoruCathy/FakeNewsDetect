Mila Kunis is no stranger to the spotlight, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can completely turn the other cheek when it comes to gossip about herself and her family.\n\nThe 34-year-old Bad Moms actress opened up about life in the public eye \u2014 and how she tries to avoid the rumor mill \u2014 for Cosmopolitan magazine\u2019s August cover story published on Monday, July 2.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t read anything about myself. I genuinely don\u2019t know what\u2019s written about me \u2026 other than I know that I\u2019m pregnant about once a year and my husband [Ashton Kutcher] and I are getting a divorce once a year,\u201d she told the mag. \u201cI know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh boy, OK!\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not as easy for those closest to her to know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors, making some fake stories stressful. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,\u201d she noted before reflecting on one tough time in particular.\n\n\u201cAt one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover,\u201d Kunis said. \u201cThe amount of stress that caused my family, nobody will understand.\u201d\n\nAs for one person who\u2019s in the cheering section every time there\u2019s speculation of another little Kutcher? \u201cMy dad is always very hopeful that the pregnancies are true,\u201d the Friends With Benefits star dished. \u201cHe\u2019s always like, \u2018Is there really another?'\u201d\n\nKunis and Kutcher tied the knot in 2015 and share two kids \u2014 daughter Wyatt, 3, and son Dimitri, 1. The pair costarred together from 1998 to 2006 on That \u201870s Show.\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews subscribe to our new podcast \u2018In Case You Missed Us\u2019 below!\n\n", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mila-kunis-cosmopolitan-cover.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/mila-kunis-cosmopolitan.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mila-kunis-talks-pregnancy-divorce-rumors/", "title": "Mila Kunis Talks Pregnancy, Divorce Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Mila Kunis opened up about the constant pregnancy and divorce rumors surrounding her in a new interview published on Monday, July 2, where she revealed she doesn't 'read anything about' herself \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mila Kunis Addresses All Those Pregnancy and Divorce Rumors", "description": "Mila Kunis opened up about the constant pregnancy and divorce rumors surrounding her in a new interview published on Monday, July 2, where she revealed she doesn't 'read anything about' herself \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mila-kunis-talks-pregnancy-divorce-rumors/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:10:47+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-07-02T17:03:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:10:47+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Mila Kunis opened up about the constant pregnancy and divorce rumors surrounding her in a new interview published on Monday, July 2, where she revealed she doesn't 'read anything about' herself \u2014 details", "title": "Mila Kunis Addresses All Those Pregnancy and Divorce Rumors", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis.jpg?crop=0px%2C55px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530550990.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
