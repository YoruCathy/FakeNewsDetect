{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_with_Me_(Sam_Smith_song)", "text": "\"Stay with Me\" is a song by English singer Sam Smith from their debut studio album In the Lonely Hour (2014). It was released in the United States on 14 April 2014 and in the United Kingdom on 18 May 2014. \"Stay with Me\" is a gospel-inspired ballad that details the protagonist pleading with their one-night stand not to leave them.[1] The song was written by Smith, James Napier, and William Phillips, with the late Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne later receiving co-writer credits due to the song's noted melodic similarity to Petty's single \"I Won't Back Down\".\n\nThe song has become Smith's most successful single to date, peaking at number one in the UK Singles Chart (becoming their third chart-topper there, second as a solo artist), topping the charts in Canada and New Zealand, and reaching number two on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has also reached top 10 status in over twelve countries worldwide. At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Darkchild's version of \"Stay with Me\" won two Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year.[2][3]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nIn an interview with NME, Sam Smith said that the song was written in a studio in Old Street with James Napier (Jimmy Napes) and William Phillips (also known as \"Tourist\").[4] Phillips started playing with three chords on the piano, and Napier quickly provided a drum pattern, and according to Sam Smith, \"the song just flowed out of us so naturally,\" and the song was written in 30 to 40 minutes. After finishing the song, Smith started to layer their vocals about 20 times, singing in different parts of the studio and harmonizing. The result sounded like a gospel choir, but all from Smith's own voice, and this demo was then used in the released song.[4][5]\n\nAccording to Smith, \"the song is about the moment in the morning after a one night stand, where the person you are with leaves your house, and you are left by yourself, and it's just a second, where you are just like: 'I wish, I wish'. You don't even love them, you don't really fancy them that much, it's just nice to have someone in the bed next to you.\"[4] The song won the Grammy Awards for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, and in their acceptance speech for winning the Record of the Year, Smith said that \"I want to thank the man who this record is about who I fell in love with last year. Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys.\"[6]\n\nOn 25 March 2014, the song was played for the first time on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show at 7:30 pm.[7][8][9] On 29 March, they performed the song live on Saturday Night Live in the United States. On 16 May, they performed the song on The Graham Norton Show. In June, they returned to the United States as part of their tour where they performed the song on Good Morning America, at the Apollo Theater in New York with Mary J. Blige, and David Letterman.\n\nAgreement with Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2015, it was revealed that a settlement had been reached with Tom Petty's publishing company to add Petty and Jeff Lynne as co-writers, and that they would receive a 12.5% songwriting credit. Petty's publisher contacted Smith's team after it noticed a likeness between \"Stay with Me\" and the melody of Petty's 1989 song \"I Won't Back Down\".[10] Petty clarified that he did not believe Smith plagiarized him, saying \"All my years of songwriting have shown me these things can happen. Most times you catch it before it gets out the studio door but in this case it got by. Sam's people were very understanding of our predicament and we easily came to an agreement.\"[11] According to Smith, they had never heard \"I Won't Back Down\" before they wrote \"Stay with Me\",[12][13] but they acknowledged the similarity after listening to the song, and said that the likeness was \"a complete coincidence\".[14][15] Petty and Lynne, however, were not eligible for a Grammy as the Recording Academy considered \"Stay with Me\" to have been interpolated from \"I Won't Back Down\" by Napier, Phillips and Smith; instead Petty and Lynne would be given certificates to honor their contribution to the work, as is usual for writers of sampled or interpolated work.[16]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n\"Stay with Me\" A 17-second sample of \"Stay with Me\" by Sam Smith, where the chorus is heard.
