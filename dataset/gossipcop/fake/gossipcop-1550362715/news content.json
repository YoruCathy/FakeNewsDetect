The pair had a public two-year romance.\n\nAmber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West\n\nIn mid-2010, Rose called things off with West. A year after the split, Rose appeared on The Wendy Williams Show, noting, \u201c[Kanye] said that he was an a-hole and he was mean to me and he didn\u2019t treat me the way he was supposed to. I accepted his apology because I feel like he\u2019s remorseful for how he treated me.\u201d\n\nBlac Chyna and Tyga Have a Son, Get Engaged\n\nMeanwhile, an up-and-coming rapper named Tyga welcomed a baby boy named King Cairo Stevenson with his then-girlfriend, model Blac Chyna, in October 2012. \u201cMost amazing feeling ever. #Blessed #2Kings,\u201d Tyga captioned a Twitter photo cradling his little boy. That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna\u2019s giant diamond ring.\n\nKanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian\n\nFresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian\u2019s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!).\n\nKanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose\n\nAs West\u2019s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fianc\u00e9, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song \u201cCold\u201d in which he rapped, \u201cOnly n\u2014a I got respect for is Wiz / And I\u2019ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.\u201d\n\nAmber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian\n\nIn February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter. In July 2013, the couple secretly wed; the next month, they had a big ceremony in which Rose wore a stunning Pnina Tornai for Kleinfeld gown. She didn\u2019t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary.\n\nNorth West Is Born\n\nFollowing a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013. West penned the song \u201cOnly One\u201d for his little girl. Click here to see the most adorable pics of Nori.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Jan 4, 2014 at 6:20pm PST\n\nBlac Chyna Befriends Kim Kardashian\n\nChyna started making regular appearances in Kardashian\u2019s Instagram photos in early 2014. As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side.\n\nKanye West Marries Kim Kardashian\n\nAfter gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014.\n\nRob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar\n\nThings got awkward when Kim\u2019s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim\u2019s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family\u2019s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He\u2019s stayed out of the public eye ever since. \u201cHe sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,\u201d Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. \u201cThere was no fight.\u201d\n\nBlac Chyna and Tyga Split\n\nIn August 2014, the parents called it quits. \u201cThey are trying to keep it amicable,\u201d an insider told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cThey also have a lot of friends in common \u2014 Tyga is Kanye [West\u2019s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] \u2014 so they don\u2019t want to make it weird.\u201d\n\nAmber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa\n\nDespite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa \u201cfor the rest of my life,\u201d Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. \u201cI never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,\u201d Rose tweeted several weeks later.\n\nTyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner\n\nIn the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner\u2019s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner\u2019s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance.\n\nAmber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga\n\nFresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner\u2019s relationship with Tyga. \u201cShe\u2019s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o\u2019clock and relax,\u201d Rose said of Jenner. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. [Tyga] should be ashamed of himself. For sure. He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian Sparks Twitter Feud With Amber Rose\n\nNot willing to let her little sister get thrown under the bus, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian weighed in on the feud on Twitter. \u201c\u2019I was a stripper since I was 15 years old,\u2019 Amber Rose told Foxx. Please don\u2019t worry about my sister who has a career & her s\u2013t together at ONLY 17 people who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 tweeted, making note of Rose\u2019s past as a stripper. \u201cPlease stop talking about us in interviews mama. None of us talk about you.\u201d Her comments prompted an intense back-and-forth between the two.\n\nKanye West Gets Involved in Twitter Feud\n\nRose responded to Khlo\u00e9\u2019s tweets with a series of West-inspired memes. One read, \u201cWhen ur sister in law calls out ur ex for being a stripper but ur wife has a sex tape,\u201d referencing Kim\u2019s sex tape with singer Ray J. West shot back a few days later, making his own appearance on The Breakfast Club. \u201cShe\u2019s just soakin\u2019 in the moment. If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, there wouldn\u2019t be an Amber Rose,\u201d West said of his ex. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that\u2019s with Amber Rose. \u2026 I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc8b A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Apr 21, 2015 at 4:34pm PDT\n\nBlac Chyna Mocks Kylie Jenner Online\n\nAs Jenner\u2019s romance with Tyga continued, his ex posted several telling photos via Instagram in April 2015, making light of the new relationship. While the #KylieJennerChallege started trending, Chyna shared a photo of herself wearing giant fake lips. Then she posted screengrabs, which she alleged were from Tyga. One such text read: \u201cI want to be with u.\u201d\n\nKylie Jenner Goes Public With Tyga on 18th Birthday\n\nIn August 2015, Jenner finally turned 18 and, now legal, went public with Tyga. The social media starlet had a blowout birthday bash, and her new official beau gifted her with two cars, including a $260,000 Ferrari.\n\nTyga Feuds With Blac Chyna Over Kylie Jenner\u2019s Ferrari\n\nThe pricey purchase sparked a fresh feud between Tyga, Chyna and Rose. TMZ reported that Tyga had leased the swanky gift, which Tyga claimed was a lie. \u201cWhen the hating don\u2019t work they start telling lies. #WhereYoFerarriTho?\u201d he captioned an Instagram selfie. Naturally, Rose chimed in, defending her friend with a photo of her own pink Ferrari. \u201cShe don\u2019t need a Ferrari she can Drive mine,\u201d she captioned the shot.\n\nKylie Jenner and Tyga Split, Get Back Together\n\nOn Tyga\u2019s 26th birthday in November 2015, the couple split and Jenner deleted almost all mentions of her flame from her Instagram account. But days later they made up, and Jenner described the rekindling romance as \u201cChaos\u201d in a new post.\n\n#nofilter A post shared by Annalu (@annalucardosod) on Dec 11, 2015 at 3:39pm PST\n\nTyga Has a Fling With a Brazilian Model\n\nUs exclusively broke the story in January 2016 that Tyga had been cheating on Jenner with Brazilian model Annalu Cardoso for months. The pair started texting in late 2014 and had \u201chooked up a couple of times,\u201d an insider told Us. Around the same time, 14-year-old model Molly O\u2019Malia also accused the \u201cStimulated\u201d rapper of sending her \u201cuncomfortable\u201d messages.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BA9v0LFxvip/\n\nBlac Chyna Posts Photo With Rob Kardashian\n\nRumors abounded on January 25, 2016, when Chyna posted a black-and-white Instagram of herself in the loving embrace of Rob Kardashian with the caption \u201cThe beginning.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian Seemingly Reacts to Rob\u2019s News\n\nShortly after the photo was posted, Khlo\u00e9 tweeted a telling quote from The Godfather: \u201cYou can do anything. But never go against the family.\u201d After followers noted her quote was likely about Rob and Chyna, the reality star replied, \u201cYou guys do know I have about 100 family members correct? I was referring to a family member who just bailed out of doing my talk show today. But hey, maybe my quote can go towards a few people today.\u201d\n\nRob Kardashian Confirms the Relationship\n\nA day after Chyna\u2019s Instagram post, Rob reposted a meme of his new love holding a car seat. \u201cBlac Chyna probably out shopping rite now as she plan to give birth to the only next generation of the Kardashian Name! #BabyKardashian.\u201d He captioned the meme with the clover emoji, which became a secret symbol between the pair.

It started when Khalifa dissed the title of West\u2019s upcoming album, Waves. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take the wave,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMax B is the wavy one. He created the wave. There is no wave without him.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to write, \u201cHit this kk and become yourself.\u201d Misunderstanding Khalifa\u2019s reference to Khalifa Kush weed, West then started ranting against the rapper on Twitter. \u201cLike, oh that\u2019s Ye and I can put his wife\u2019s initials on my twitter @WizKhalifa,\u201d West wrote. \u201cYou have distracted from my creative process. I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants.\u201d\n\nAs the tweets raged on, West slammed his ex Rose, writing, \u201c4th you let a stripper trap you. 5th I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years.\u201d\n\nAmber Rose Weighs In on Kanye/Wiz Twitter Beef\n\nNot willing to let her ex\u2019s insults slide, Rose responded with the tweet, \u201cAwww @kanyewest are u mad I\u2019m not around to play in ur a\u2013hole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch.\u201d West later deleted his tweets, apologizing for the misunderstanding about Kim\u2019s initials, to which Rose replied, \u201cLol @kanyewest Now u wanna delete ur tweets cuz Muva has arrived?
