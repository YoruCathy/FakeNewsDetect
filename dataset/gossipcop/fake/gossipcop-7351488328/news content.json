So will he return to the public eye soon?\n\nKanye West, 39, is doing well these days, as a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling very positive and upbeat. Kanye\u2019s done a lot of soul searching over the past year, he\u2019s worked through a lot of issues, and he\u2019s in a better place than he has been for ages,\u201d the insider reveals. Glad to hear it! (You\u2019ll remember that Kanye was hospitalized in November 2016, which had him canceling the rest of his tour and fueling rumors that he and Kim Kardashian, 36, were on the verge of divorce.)\n\nAs to what Ye has been up to lately? \u201cKanye has been spending a lot of time in the studio working on his new album, and he believes it\u2019s some of the best music he\u2019s ever produced,\u201d the source shares. \u201cTaking a year out of the spotlight is exactly what he needed, to help get his head together and get back on track.\u201d Nothing wrong with taking some time off! Ye also joined Kid Cudi, 33, on stage in Chicago, IL on Nov. 4 for his first official performance since his breakdown. Hope it means Kanye will head out on tour again soon!\n\nOh, and don\u2019t believe the rumors \u2014 Kim and Kanye are doing just fine, thank you. \u201cTheir marriage is flourishing,\u201d the source insists. \u201cHe\u2019s really looking forward to the new baby arriving.\u201d Fortunately, Kimye\u2019s surrogate is reportedly about seven months along, so he won\u2019t have to wait much more! See photos of Kim and Kanye\u2019s children\u2019s clothing line here.\n\nFinally, the \u201cFamous\u201d rapper is also facing forward, as the insider tells us. \u201cKanye\u2019s calmer and more focused,\u201d the source says, \u201cAnd he\u2019s ready to take on the world again. He\u2019s excited for the future.\u201d Can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s in store!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you glad that Kanye is feeling better?
