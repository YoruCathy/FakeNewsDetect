Of course, there\u2019s nothing unusual about any of that, except in this situation, attention was focused on Blake\u2019s song choice because his ex, Miranda Lambert, 33, was also at the show with her boyfriend, Anderson East, 28. Cameras made sure not to cut to Miranda while Blake was onstage (it\u2019s not even confirmed if she was in her seat at the time), but the mag claims she initially felt a bit awkward when the 40-year-old started singing.\n\n\u201cNo one [in the audience] quite knew where to look,\u201d the source explains. \u201cMiranda kept her cool during the performance, but it was really uncomfortable for her, especially with Anderson [there].\u201d Eventually, though, she felt \u201ctouched\u201d by what she heard. The mag claims Blake intentionally sang the track to send Miranda a message for \u2018closure,\u2019 however, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that the song choice was not calculated \u2014 Blake was simply singing his current single.\n\nIt seems show producers made certain Miranda and Blake would not have an awkward run-in at the awards ceremony \u2014 he skipped the red carpet, while she walked with Anderson, and their seats were not near each other. Meanwhile, Blake\u2019s girlfriend, Gwen Stefani, 47, didn\u2019t join him, but she took to Instagram to reveal she was watching his performance from home. \u201c[Gwen] had absolutely no problem [with the song choice],\u201d OK!\u2019s source reveals. \u201cShe\u2019s confident Blake has no leftover feelings for Miranda.\u201d\n\nBlake and Miranda abruptly divorced in July 2015, and just one month later, Gwen ended her marriage to Gavin Rossdale. While working on The Voice that fall, Blake and Gwen bonded over their mutual heartbreak, and they\u2019ve been happily in love ever since!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Blake was sending Miranda a message with the song?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript",
