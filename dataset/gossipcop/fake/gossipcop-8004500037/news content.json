Find out their plans here!\n\nJustin Bieber, 24, can\u2019t wait to have a family of his own and now that he\u2019s engaged to the love of his life Hailey Baldwin, 21, he\u2019s been thinking about it more than ever before. \u201cJustin wants to be a dad more than pretty much anything else in the world, he absolutely loves and adores children, and cannot wait to have kids of his own,\u201d a source close to Justin EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. \u201cJustin would love to have a big family, and he is going to be an awesome dad\u2014he\u2019s already an amazing big brother to Jaxon, and when you see how he is with his young fans you can just see how much he loves children.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Justin, Hailey is a huge fan of children and seems to embody the qualities that would make her an excellent parent. \u201cHailey loves kids too, and they both share the same morals and family values, it\u2019s one of the many things Justin loves so much about Hailey,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThey\u2019ve spoken about starting a family and it\u2019s definitely something they want to do as soon as they are married. Because of their shared faith, neither Justin or Hailey would want her to get pregnant before they were married. That\u2019s very important to them both. They really want to do things how they perceive to be the right way.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Justin keeps his beliefs close to his heart and although he\u2019s usually very pleasant to photographers, he was clearly annoyed last week when one of them asked him if Hailey was pregnant. With such an important and private subject we can definitely understand why the \u201cLet Me Love You\u201d singer would feel the way he did.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/justin-bieber-would-love-to-have-a-big-family-with-hailey-baldwin-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F23%2Fjustin-bieber-big-family-hailey-baldwin-amazing-dad%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3250606", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/justin-bieber-would-love-to-have-a-big-family-with-hailey-baldwin-ftr.jpg", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/justin-bieber-would-love-to-have-a-big-family-with-hailey-baldwin-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/23/justin-bieber-big-family-hailey-baldwin-amazing-dad/", "title": "Justin Bieber Would Love To Have A Big Family With Hailey Baldwin \u2014 Why He\u2019ll Be An \u2018Amazing Dad\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Justin Bieber would love to have a big family with Hailey Baldwin", "news_keywords": "Hailey Baldwin, Justin Bieber", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber Would Love To Have A Big Family With Hailey Baldwin \u2014 Why He\u2019ll Be An \u2018Amazing Dad\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/23/justin-bieber-big-family-hailey-baldwin-amazing-dad/", "description": "Justin Bieber has wanted to become a father for a long time and he\u2019s so smitten with fiancee Hailey Baldwin that he\u2019s already thinking about starting a family with her.
