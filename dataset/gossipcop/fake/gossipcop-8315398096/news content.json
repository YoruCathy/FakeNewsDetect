Here\u2019s EXCLUSIVE scoop on why he won\u2019t settle down with the look-alikes.\n\nSince his split from Kylie Jenner in March 2017, Tyga has been spotted out and about with various different women who look like the reality star, but they\u2019ll never hold a candle to the reality star in his mind. \u201cKylie fits the profile of Tyga\u2019s ideal woman, physically \u2014 he loves brunettes with big lips, big brown eyes and a big butt,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThe thing with Kylie, though, is that it was about so much more than just what she looked like. Obviously, she was sexy and all, but Tyga had a really strong connection with her that went far deeper than the physical side of things.\u201d\n\nTyga and Kylie broke up and got back together several times throughout their three-year relationship, but he probably didn\u2019t realize that the 2017 split would mean it was really over for good. Just one month later, Kylie started dating Travis Scott, and on Feb. 1, she gave birth to his child. However, Tyga is convinced that there\u2019s still hope for a reconciliation between himself and Kylie. \u201cTyga truly believes deep down in his heart that they\u2019re not over,\u201d our source adds. \u201cHe has faith that there\u2019s no way it will last with Travis and that one day Kylie will come running back to him again. He\u2019s just playing a waiting game for now.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that he\u2019s sitting around by himself during this waiting period, though. In fact, on the same day Kylie gave birth, Tyga was spotted leaving a nightclub with a brunette woman who definitely resembled his 20-year-old ex. He has to pass the time somehow\u2026\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kylie would ever take Tyga back?", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F02%2F06%2Ftyga-dating-kylie-jenner-look-alike-reason-split%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2982959", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tyga-obsessed-kylie-jenner-look-a-likes-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tyga-obsessed-kylie-jenner-look-a-likes-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/tyga-obsessed-kylie-jenner-look-a-likes-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/06/tyga-dating-kylie-jenner-look-alike-reason-split/", "title": "Tyga: Why He\u2019s Obsessed With Dating Kylie Jenner Look-Alikes, But None Can Take Her Place", "meta_data": {"description": "Tyga has been dating various Kylie Jenner look-alikes, but it's just a way for him to pass time as he waits for her to take him back.", "news_keywords": "Kylie Jenner, Tyga", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tyga: Why He\u2019s Obsessed With Dating Kylie Jenner Look-Alikes, But None Can Take Her Place", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/06/tyga-dating-kylie-jenner-look-alike-reason-split/", "description": "Dating women who resemble his ex, Kylie Jenner, is just a way for Tyga to pass the time.
