I\u2019ve actually never been a true-blue fan of either separately. I\u2019ve read some of Anna\u2019s interviews where she seemed funny and \u201creal\u201d and interesting, but mostly I just kind of find her sad these days. I think she was more famous than Pratt when they got married, and now he\u2019s this big movie star and she\u2019s supposed to play the Rita Wilson role, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s comfortable with that. Plus, I believe some (but not all) of the rumors and blind items about them. I think Chris and Anna\u2019s marriage isn\u2019t all that. I think they love each other and they adore their son but they\u2019re one of those couples which\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I guess I just wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they announced their split tomorrow, you know? Their vibe is not one of happiness, despite the happy-couple act they performed on the red carpet of the Passengers premiere.\n\nSpeaking of the premiere, Anna told E! News that Chris had already given her a Christmas present \u2013 he upgraded her engagement ring. She told E!: \u201cHe just got me this ring. I know. Like two days ago. I look [at it] and I\u2019m like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe it either!\u2019 He\u2019s an incredibly romantic man and I\u2019m very, very lucky.\u201d Chris explained what Anna had gotten him for Christmas too: \u201cShe got me a tractor, so we\u2019re kind of even!\u201d You can see a half-decent shot of her huge new ring in this video.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful. And huge. E! described it as a \u201cdiamond,\u201d but Anna doesn\u2019t say that and I\u2019m not so sure? Maybe it was just the light or the reflection off her dress, but it looks like a colored stone to me? It looks like a pale amethyst to me, but it could be a pink diamond. But if Pratt bought her a pink diamond that big, he probably shelled out mid-seven figures for it. And her original engagement ring was a decent size and cut too! This is a good shot of her original engagement ring back in 2015:\n\nPerfectly pretty. Of course, jewelry is always nice, and who would say no to a huge new sparkly ring? Chris and Anna sure want you to believe that they\u2019re totally fine. But did her face say \u201cwe\u2019re totally fine\u201d in that interview? Does Chris\u2019s face say \u201cwe\u2019re totally fine\u201d in these photos?", "images":
