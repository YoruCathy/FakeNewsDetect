So on February 5, she took to Instagram and Twitter for a shoutout to her boyfriend, Sam Asghari. \u201cI\u2019ve been with this man for over a year\u2026 everyday (sic) he inspires me to be a better person and that makes me feel like the luckiest girl in the world!!\u201d she wrote on a #relationshipgoals snap of the couple in front of a waterfall.\n\nWhat would make her feel even luckier \u2014 an insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 is having a baby with her beau. \u201cBritney has talked with Sam about having babies together,\u201d says the insider. \u201cShe was young when she had Sean and Jayden, and she feels much more mature now.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPiece of Me\u201d songstress first became a mom in 2005 when she welcomed son Sean Preston, now 12, with then-husband Kevin Federline. She had Sean\u2019s brother, Jayden, almost exactly a year later.\n\nSpears, 36, met Iranian fitness model Asghari, 23, on the set of her steamy \u201cSlumber Party\u201d video in 2016. And \u201cthe attraction was immediate,\u201d says the insider. \u201cThey had intense chemistry.\u201d\n\nAt first, no one on her team \u2014 least of all the chart topper \u2014 thought the union would last. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t looking for a relationship. It just sort of happened,\u201d a second source reveals in the new issue. \u201cThey were having fun and enjoying each other\u2019s company, but then they fell in love.\u201d\n\nNow, adds the insider, it seems Spears has finally found her match. \u201cBritney is head over heels in love with Sam. The relationship is very serious.\u201d Marriage, however, isn\u2019t high on her priority list, notes the insider: \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem important to her at this point in her life.\u201d\n\nAs for that 13-year age gap? Not a problem for young-at-heart Spears! \u201cSam has a lot more in common with Britney\u201d than her past boyfriends, says the insider. \u201cHe\u2019s very fun.\u201d The singer last dated film producer Charlie Ebersol from 2014 to 2015, and was engaged to former manager Jason Trawick, whom she was with for about four years starting in 2009.\n\nThe model\u2019s easygoing vibe is perfect for the singer \u2014 and her boys. When Spears is around him, says the source, \u201cshe always has a huge smile on her face. It\u2019s really sweet.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Asghari has plenty of fun with Spears\u2019 sons. \u201cSam will skateboard with them around the gated community, play sports and spend a lot of time in the pool,\u201d says the insider, adding that\u2019s when the games really begin: \u201cSquirt gun and water fights are a constant.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s affecting Spears\u2019 other desire. As the insider reveals, \u201cShe would love to have a baby girl.\u201d\n\nFor more on Spears\u2019 relationship with her man, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly on stands now.\n\nWith reporting by Nicholas Hautman and Jennifer Heger.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears.jpg?crop=176px%2C0px%2C1443px%2C758px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uw0918_cover_ns.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears-sam-asghari-kissing.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears.jpg?crop=176px%2C0px%2C1443px%2C758px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/britney-spears-wants-a-baby-with-boyfriend-sam-asghari/", "title": "Britney Spears Wants a Baby With Boyfriend Sam Asghari", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "An insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly that Britney Spears wants to have a baby with her 23-year-old boyfriend, Sam Asghari \u2013 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Britney Spears \u2018Very Much Wants to Have Another Baby\u2019", "description": "An insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly that Britney Spears wants to have a baby with her 23-year-old boyfriend, Sam Asghari \u2013 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/britney-spears-wants-a-baby-with-boyfriend-sam-asghari/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-10-12T22:15:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears.jpg?crop=176px%2C0px%2C1443px%2C758px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears.jpg?crop=176px%2C0px%2C1443px%2C758px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-02-14T14:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-12T22:15:48+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An insider reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly that Britney Spears wants to have a baby with her 23-year-old boyfriend, Sam Asghari \u2013 details", "title": "Britney Spears \u2018Very Much Wants to Have Another Baby\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/britney-spears.jpg?crop=176px%2C0px%2C1443px%2C758px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@anna_banana"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518616820.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
