Dating the director was different. We\u2019d be on the [press] tour together, I\u2019d come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe comes back from the tour, and that\u2019s all he wants to talk about and I get it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s his baby. He wrote it. He conceived it. He directed it. I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner, while also being like, \u2018Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?\u2019\u201d\n\nLawrence said that reading the reviews made her be extra protective of him, so she had to put an end to it. \u201cI finally was just like, \u2018It\u2019s not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.\u2019 Especially because it\u2019s my man,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome, what we did \u2014 some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it\u2019s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.\u201d\n\nThe American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. \u201cThey get along really well,\u201d a source told Us at the time.\n\nIn September, Lawrence spoke about the director in an interview with Vogue: \u201cWe had energy. I had energy for him. I don\u2019t know how he felt about me,\u201d Lawrence told the magazine. \u201cFor the past year, I\u2019ve been dealing with him as just a human. I\u2019ve been in relationships before where I am just confused. And I\u2019m never confused with him.\u201d\n\nThe Hunger Games actress has previously dated Nicholas Hoult and Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin. Aronofsky was previously engaged to Rachel Weisz, with whom he shares 11-year-old son Henry.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/846641848_jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-zoom1.jpg?crop=123px%2C0px%2C1877px%2C985px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/846641848_jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-zoom1.jpg?crop=112px%2C0px%2C1888px%2C1066px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/846641848_jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-zoom1.jpg?crop=123px%2C0px%2C1877px%2C985px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-lawrence-says-mother-led-to-darren-aronofsky-split/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Says \u2018Mother!\u2019 Led to Darren Aronofsky Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence says the negative response to \u2018mother!\u2019 with her director ex, Darren Aronofsky, caused a strain in their relationship \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: \u2018mother!\u2019 Affected My Relationship With Darren Aronofsky", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence says the negative response to \u2018mother!\u2019 with her director ex, Darren Aronofsky, caused a strain in their relationship \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-lawrence-says-mother-led-to-darren-aronofsky-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:00+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/846641848_jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-zoom1.jpg?crop=123px%2C0px%2C1877px%2C985px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/846641848_jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-zoom1.jpg?crop=123px%2C0px%2C1877px%2C985px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-29T18:52:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:00+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence says the negative response to \u2018mother!\u2019 with her director ex, Darren Aronofsky, caused a strain in their relationship \u2014 details", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: \u2018mother!\u2019 Affected My Relationship With Darren Aronofsky", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/846641848_jennifer-lawrence-darren-aronofsky-zoom1.jpg?crop=123px%2C0px%2C1877px%2C985px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511981562.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
