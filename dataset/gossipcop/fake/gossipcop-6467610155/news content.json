The Broadway alum and Oscar nominee is in talks to headline the film musical La La Land. According to The Wrap, Damien Chazelle\u2019s song-and-dance romance has also eyed both Ryan Gosling and Tony winner Eddie Redmayne for the male lead.\n\n\n\nStone would play wannabe actress Mia, who is anxious to fit in. She falls in love with Sebastian, a magnetic jazz musician, in Los Angeles, but the city that united them may split them up. Emma Watson was originally tapped for the role of Mia, before taking on Belle in Beauty and the Beast instead.\n\nWe were recently happy to see Stone make her Broadway debut in Cabaret. Oscar nominated for Birdman, her additional screen credits include the Amazing Spider-Man film series, Magic in the Moonlight, The Croods, Gangster Squad, Easy A, The Help, Crazy, Stupid, Love, Friends with Benefits, Paperman, Marmaduke, Zombieland, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, The House Bunny, The Rocker and Superbad.", "images": ["https://static.broadway.com/img/responsive/logos/buzz-logo.a35598b13a81.svg", "https://static.broadway.com/img/responsive/icons/close-444.134bd306f41a.svg", "https://imaging.broadway.com/images/square-11/w68/90521-14.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=682878898465597&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imaging.broadway.com/images/social/w630/21074-0.jpg", "https://static.broadway.com/img/responsive/icons/close.43ce688c7eba.svg", "https://static.broadway.com/img/responsive/icons/menu.0d4bb9b6bc52.svg", "https://static.broadway.com/img/logos/logo-white-bg@1x.4b56030e062c.png", "https://static.broadway.com/img/logos/logo-white-bg@2x.3a2e82121c80.png"], "top_img": "https://imaging.broadway.com/images/social/w630/21074-0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.broadway.com/buzz/180410/broadway-alum-oscar-nominee-emma-stone-eyes-la-la-land-movie-musical/", "title": "Broadway Alum & Oscar Nominee Emma Stone Eyes La La Land Movie Musical", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=0.1, initial-scale=1", "description": "Emma Stone must have had a perfectly marvelous time headlining a tuner!
