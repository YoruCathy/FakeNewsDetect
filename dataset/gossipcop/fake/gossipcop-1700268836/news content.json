But they\u2019ve decided to not focus on it for the time being.\u201d\n\nStefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it\u2019s made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is \u201cabsolutely devoted\u201d to Gwen\u2019s sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: \u201cBlake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.\u201d\n\nShelton\u2019s devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. \u201cBlake has always wanted children,\u201d explains a friend. \u201cAnd he\u2019s great with Gwen\u2019s kids, which prompted them wanting their own.\u201d\n\nThe No Doubt singer was all in \u2014 but not anymore. \u201cNot because of a change in her love for Blake,\u201d explains the source, \u201cbut because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.\u201d The country star is on board with her thoughts. \u201cHe is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,\u201d shares the insider.\n\nWith no baby, they\u2019ve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, \u201cGwen is very traditional and wouldn\u2019t want to be pregnant without being married.\u201d\n\nStill, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. \u201cTheir relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,\u201d explains the source. \u201cThe need to get married and have kids isn\u2019t the priority it once was.\u201d\n\nWhen the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.\n\nNow, the pair have settled in to an \u201ceasy, effortless love\u201d together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton\u2019s Oklahoma ranch \u2014 something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? \u201cGwen loves hanging out with Blake\u2019s friends and wives,\u201d says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples\u2019 trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.\n\nFor more on the couple\u2019s decision to put their baby plans on hold, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani1.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1671px%2C877px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-02.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani1.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/uw1018_cover.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani1.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1671px%2C877px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-put-baby-wedding-plans-on-hold/", "title": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Put Baby, Wedding Plans on Hold", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Struggling to conceive, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton decide to stop trying for a baby \u2014 which means they\u2019ve put their wedding plans on hold too, explains a source", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Put Baby, Wedding Plans on Hold", "description": "Struggling to conceive, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton decide to stop trying for a baby \u2014 which means they\u2019ve put their wedding plans on hold too, explains a source", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-put-baby-wedding-plans-on-hold/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-20T22:04:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani1.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1671px%2C877px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani1.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1671px%2C877px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-21T14:00:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-20T22:04:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Struggling to conceive, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton decide to stop trying for a baby \u2014 which means they\u2019ve put their wedding plans on hold too, explains a source", "title": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Put Baby, Wedding Plans on Hold", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani1.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1671px%2C877px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@lizzzabts"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519221655.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
