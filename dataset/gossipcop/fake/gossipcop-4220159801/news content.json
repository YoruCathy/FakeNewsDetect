The actress still breaks down in tears thinking about her ex Brad Pitt having more custody of them in the future, we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY learned. Find out why!\n\nBrad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, are reportedly in a better place with each other in the wake of their Sept. 2016 split. Even so, she\u2019s still coming to terms with the reality of not having her children around all the time \u2014 given how things can change with their custody agreement. \u201cAngelina\u2019s not at all comfortable with the idea of being separated from her kids, just talking about it can make her cry,\u201d a source close to the By The Sea actress tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for her to imagine Brad taking them all overseas without her, she would not like it if the shoe was on the other foot. There\u2019s a huge double standard but she doesn\u2019t see it that way.\u201d\n\nBrad has been spending as much time as possible repairing his relationship with their precious kids Maddox, 15; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh, 11; and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. Luckily, Angelina reportedly moved into an epic abode just two miles away from Brad\u2019s home, which gives him the opportunity to see his kids more often. The family, sans Brad, was spotted jetting out of LAX for Father\u2019s Day and they were all smiles while together.\n\nAs we previously reported, \u201cHe\u2019s not complaining, but he had planned to spend some time with them for Father\u2019s Day,\u201d a source close to Brad told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe was working on his place to make it special for them, adding a new skateboard ramp. He saw Angie\u2019s 100 foot water slide and wanted to make his place special for them as well. Although their relationship has improved, communication is a struggle at times.\u201d\n\nTo get their family back on track, Brad\u2019s taking extra measures. \u201cThe kids don\u2019t love therapy, but they know that Brad has to do it,\u201d an OK! magazine insider claims. \u201c[Therapy\u2019s] allowed them to get a better sense of his issues and come to terms with what went wrong in their parents\u2019 marriage. Brad has firmly but gently explained that no matter how much he loves their mother, they are not getting back together. He doesn\u2019t want them to have false hopes.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina and Brad will work out the best agreement?
