She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.\n\nWhen the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.\n\nEach has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.\n\nBut Pattinson\u2019s engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said \u201cthere\u2019s trouble in paradise,\u201d with regards to Stewart and Maxwell\u2019s relationship.\n\nIn April, the Twilight stars were reported to have \u201cgotten together a few times over the past several weeks,\u201d according to OK!\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep it low-key, but there\u2019s still chemistry there,\u201d a source told OK! \u201cPeople in their circles are starting to wonder if they\u2019re considering a reconciliation.\u201d\n\nSupposedly, Stewart hopes Pattinson is \u201cserious\u201d about having forgiven her, an insider told OK!\n\nIf there is the possibility of a reconciliation, Twihards on Twitter can hardly contain their excitement:\n\nRobert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart were photographed together for the 1st time in 5 years and my inner Twihard is really showing pic.twitter.com/1x5myv9GLf \u2014 Linds (@Lindsertart19) June 3, 2018\n\n*new pictures of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart hanging out in LA 5 years after breaking up* pic.twitter.com/ymrOlkO1xV \u2014 katha \ud83c\udf38 (@allkindsof_RK) June 5, 2018", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PattinsonStewart.jpg?w=1024&h=692", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/PattinsonStewart.jpg?w=1024&h=692", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
