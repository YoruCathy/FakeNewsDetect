She was so lovely and was saying how she\u2019s into halal cosmetics and what she\u2019s actually wearing on her face today was all halal! Well all I can say is if it\u2019s good enough for Lindsay Lohan, (girl, what are you) all waiting for?\u201d\n\nRunning alongside London Fashion week, the event, which charges up to \u00a3200 for tickets, features shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops \u2013 including a \u2018sharia legal hub\u2019.\n\nMore than 40 designers from around the world showcased scarves, hijabs and loose-fitting maxi dresses at the annual style showcase organised by Haute Elan, who consider \u2018modest fashion\u2019 to be one of the fastest growing consumer markets.\n\nRumour mills abuzz as Lindsay Lohan spotted wearing headscarf\n\nIn January, Lohan deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio to \u2018Alaikum salam.\u2019\n\nHowever, the actor has not yet revealed whether she is converting to Islam, while her representative refused to respond to a question proposed by a Daily Mail correspondent too.\n\nLindsay Lohan reveals her \u2018Muslim\u2019 side\n\nWhen appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the Quran she was holding was actually just a gift from some friends.\n\n\u201cMy very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,\u201d said Lohan.\n\nIn a post that\u2019s now deleted, the starlet took to Instagram to give a sneak peak on her upcoming fashion line. And, by the modest looks of it, seems like it will be comprising hijabs.\n\nCaptioned as, \u201cNew Fashion Line coming soon \u2026.#fashion\u201d, the star is seen wearing a headscarf, with her face half hidden.\n\nThe actor had also said that she had tried praying \u201cthe Muslim way\u201d and even fasted during Ramazan. \u201cI did Ramazan for three days with my friend from Kuwait. It was hard but it was good. It felt good,\u201d she said.\n\nHave something to add to the story?
