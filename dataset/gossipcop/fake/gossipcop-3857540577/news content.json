I've seen these numbers, about how speech is apportioned in films, but this chart is really striking. ht @ellentejle pic.twitter.com/JIwgDKOPhQ \u2014 Soraya Chemaly (@schemaly) March 4, 2018\n\nMany films which have picked up the Best Picture trophy, such as 12 Years a Slave, No Country for Old Men, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and Schindler's List, have had very few female characters with a significant amount of dialogue.\n\nEven in some of the most recent winning films, such as 2016's winner Spotlight, the proportion of men speaking heavily outweighs female dialogue.\n\nThis year's Best Picture winner, The Shape of Water, features a woman (played by Sally Hawkins) as the lead, but she is mute and does not speak in the film.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\nThe researchers found that even in films which feature female leads, the majority of the dialogue is spoken by men.\n\nWhen comparing Disney films, only four \u2013 Inside Out, Alice in Wonderland, Maleficent and Sleeping Beauty \u2013 featured women speaking over 60% of the dialogue.\n\nDespite Pocahontas, Mulan and The Little Mermaid all focusing on female characters, women had less than half of the film's lines.\n\nDisney\n\nThey also found that, as actors age, men get more and more lines in films while women's speaking time diminishes as they get older.\n\nPeople are, needless to say, not very impressed with these findings:\n\nThe best thing about this is all the men commenting that there are no women speakers because these films are ABOUT men. Umm, kinda the problem?Maybe? https://t.co/Y2e3krI5jZ \u2014 Mamasama (@mamasama) March 6, 2018\n\nWhat I find most disturbing about this is the way it's so \"normal\", we barely even see it any more. \u2014 Kate Long (@volewriter) March 5, 2018\n\nRegarding film dialogue in film. Even films with female leads the dialogue swings male. Screenwriters, your time is up! #womeninfilm https://t.co/AJz1dOVWKF \u2014 Ellen Tejle (@ellentejle) March 5, 2018\n\nFrances McDormand, who won the Best Actress award at this year's Oscars, took a stand while accepting her trophy by asking all the female nominees in the room to stand with her.\n\nWe're right with you, Frances.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
