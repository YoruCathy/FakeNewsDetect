The site claims the rapper is head over heels for Taylor and her smoking bod. \u201cKanye was intrigued by her innocence, and her body,\u201d an insider tells the site, adding, \u201c[Teyana] must have put it on him, all [Kanye] talks about is her \u2026 he even signed her to a deal and is featuring her on his new album with Jay-Z.\u201d We thought this rumor smelled fishy because \u2013 when is MTO ever correct about a dating story? Anyway, it looks like our suspicion was well placed. (RumorFix)\n\nEarlier this month, female rapper Missy Elliott denied MTO reports connecting her to R&B singer Keri Hilson.\n\n\u201c@MissKeriBaby.
