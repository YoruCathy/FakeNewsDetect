Newly single Scarlett Johansson packed on the PDA with \u2018SNL\u2019 star, Colin Jost, at an after-party on May 20, according to a new report. Could she be rebounding from her divorce with the comedian!?\n\nScarlett Johansson showed up for the cold open of the May 20 episode of Saturday Night Live, and she stuck around for the after-party! The actress joined the show\u2019s cast and crew for the season finale party at 30 Rock, and reportedly got quite cozy with \u201cWeekend Update\u201d host, Colin Jost. \u201cScarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party,\u201d an insider told Page Six. \u201cThey would make out a bit, then go back to talking. They were at the bar in front of everyone. They made out at least twice, then they went back to talking and hanging with other people.\u201d\n\nIn January, it was reported that Scarlett and her husband, Romain Dauriac, had separated after just over two years of marriage. Then, in March, she officially filed for divorce. The pair have attended events together in the months since the split, but if this PDA report is true, it definitely seems like ScarJo is moving on! \u201cScarlett and Colin were flirting and canoodling in full view of everyone at the after-party,\u201d another source confirmed to the paper. \u201cThey were laughing and seemed to really hit it off.\u201d\n\nAs HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY reported, Scarlett wasn\u2019t looking to waste any time when it came to getting back into the dating pool. \u201cShe is not going to wait until her divorce is complete,\u201d an insider told us EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe is going to live her life. She will certainly date and has no problem doing it sooner than later.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Scarlett and Colin would make a cute couple?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scarlett-johansson-dating-snl-star-colin-jost-ftr-1.jpg?w=600", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scarlett-johansson-dating-snl-star-colin-jost-ftr-1.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F05%2F22%2Fscarlett-johansson-dating-colin-jost-hook-up-snl%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2599879", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/scarlett-johansson-dating-snl-star-colin-jost-ftr-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/22/scarlett-johansson-dating-colin-jost-hook-up-snl/", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Dating Colin Jost?
