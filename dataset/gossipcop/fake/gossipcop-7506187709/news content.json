Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it in 2008 for \u20ac45 million (about $67 million at the time), and it hosted their wedding six years later.\n\nAfter three years of legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but wasn't revealed until French media broke the story last week. Meanwhile, the aggrieved designer, Odile Soudant, has filed another suit demanding to be legally recognized as the creator of the project.\n\nThe artist, who specializes in light installations, accused the Jolie-Pitt company of driving her business, Lumi\u00e8res Studio, into bankruptcy. She's also fighting Pitt for the intellectual property rights to the lighting she designed for the 17th century chateau and its outbuildings. Of the payout, \u20ac60,000 ($70,800) covers damage to her reputation, which she says has been severely affected by the failed project.\n\nPitt's lawyers had argued that the project was late and over budget\u2014and that the design was Pitt's brainchild.\n\n\u201cWhen, in 2010, Brad Pitt came to ask her to bring to light four buildings of his domain at Miraval, the plastic artist Odile Soudant did not suspect that this Pharaonic building site was going to cause her ruin,\u201d writes Le Point.\n\nThe Hollywood couple, according to the newspaper Liberation, which broke the story, launched a large remodeling plan intended to transform the property to their liking. Pitt hired Soudart in 2010 to run a \u20ac25 million project that would bring natural light into four of the buildings of the 40-bedroom domain where, in the late 1970s, the band Pink Floyd had recorded an album.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, he wanted the visual artist to create \"an exceptional place with light at the center of everything.\"\n\nThe collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor managing the network of businesses involved in the remodeling was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments.\n\nUntil then, the artist and her 17 assistants and subcontractors had been working for the project in a Paris studio and partially completed the redesign at the property. Despite the fact that Pitt was no longer paying, according to her declaration, he asked her to continue working.\n\n\u201cOdile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,\u201d Brad Pitt wrote in an email to Soudart, according the court documents published by Liberation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don\u2019t attack friends,\" he wrote her in another email. \"I\u2019ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let\u2019s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend,\u201d he wrote to her in another.\n\nIn a third message, he wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don\u2019t worry about the rest.\u201d\n\nHer answers were desperate: \"My company and my bank accounts are well beyond the maximum. I can no longer use my credit card. I'm sinking. I do not ask you to pay everything, but at least a part...I do not know how to make you understand the urgency in which we are now. Without a quick solution, the consequences will be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nBut the legal struggle has not yet ended. Soudart is now accusing Pitt of appropriating the creation of her work. The actor\u2019s lawyers replied that the castle is \"purely private\" and not subject to copyright.\n\nBut Le Point concludes that \u201cthe estate is not as private as its owners claim: Recently it served as a backdrop for the latest Guerlain ad campaign by Terrence Malick. In one of the scenes, we see clearly\u2014no pun intended\u2014a luminous installation conceived by the plastic artist.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5e4342aa817e8f02961bf8651d8b4563?s=62&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/454285974/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/519805204/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/698517178/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/665134610/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/454285994/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/3c2b36ac46844ae78e1a4b3c5d1395c1/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/519805204/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cecilia Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/08/21/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-lose-court-case-over-their-french-miraval-castle/", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Lose Court Case Over Their French Miraval Castle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Lose Court Case Over Their French Miraval Castle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/519805204/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "updated_time": "2017-08-21T18:41:24-04:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/08/21/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-lose-court-case-over-their-french-miraval-castle/", "description": "Their life as one may be over, but the former Brangelina are bound together in a lawsuit over the castle where they married.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Lose Court Case Over Their French Miraval Castle", "description": "Their life as one may be over, but the former Brangelina are bound together in a lawsuit over the castle where they married.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170822011135im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/519805204/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "creator": "@ceciliarodriguez"}, "description": "Their life as one may be over, but the former Brangelina are bound together in a lawsuit over the castle where they married.", "author": "Cecilia Rodriguez", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Cecilia Rodriguez", "section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/business/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/1961-8420", "published": "2017-08-21", "modified": "2017-08-21"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503244800.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
