I just want to have a good time and show people that I\u2019m normal.\u201d\n\nDespite wanting to be viewed as an average guy, the \u201cWhat Do You Mean?\u201d singer said that he\u2019s appreciated the doors that success has opened for him and his family.\n\n\u201cIt felt really cool, man,\u201d Bieber said when asked what it was like to get his first big paycheck. \u201cIt felt like \u2026 I used to have to, my mom would always make me order water at restaurants. I could never get a soft drink. Those are like little things that when you\u2019re a kid, they matter. Like, you get disappointed, like, \u2018I just wanted a soda, Mom.\u2019 Or like, I would go and share meals with my mom and stuff. It\u2019s not like we were like, really, really, really dirt poor, but there were struggles, and when I got my first check I just felt the security to be able to take care of my mom because she always took care of me. Just being able to take care of your mom feels really good.\u201d\n\nStill, he admitted that the fact that he\u2019s famous doesn\u2019t mean that he never feels alone.\n\nJustin Bieber Says He's Single and 'Ready to Mingle' on 'Ellen'\n\n\u201cPeople would never guess that artists like myself would feel lonely, with all things that are always around us and people, but a lot of it is really surface-y, and there\u2019s no depth to those relationships. So you just end up feeling like, well, I\u2019m connecting but I\u2019m not feeling what I want to feel,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo, that\u2019s where I ended up. I was just in a place of like searching because I felt like people weren\u2019t what I needed them to be for me. So now, I\u2019m really surrounded by really cool people who are like, really for me, and I can really connect with [them]. I\u2019m in the best place ever, probably [that] I\u2019ve ever been in my life.\u201d\n\nThe discussion then turned to Kanye West, who has collaborated with Bieber for the singer\u2019s next album.\n\n\u201cWe did this one song -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gonna make the album, but it was really cool, a really New York vibe,\u201d Bieber revealed.\n\n\u201cKanye\u2019s a talker, so you get him in a room and he just starts talking, and he just starts ranting, and I just sit and I listen because he\u2019s been through a lot of stuff. He\u2019s not just talking to just talk. He\u2019s obviously got something to say that he\u2019s feeling from his heart. So when I hear that, I like to just sit and listen. He\u2019s a really, really smart guy,\u201d he added.\n\nSince Kanye recently announced his intentions to run for president in 2020, Bieber was asked what he would do in that position -- if he, of course, was eligible to be elected as President of the United States. While answering the question, Bieber took the opportunity to open up about his views on gun control.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably just fix some of the gun laws,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Canada, we don\u2019t really have any guns and there\u2019s no gun violence, so that really solves it. I mean, they think that it\u2019s for protection and stuff, but it always ends up in some bozo\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nBieber also named his all-time favorite rappers, talked about his friends in the skateboarding community and more.
