The taping featured \u2018non-stop fighting\u2019 between two housewives, a source reveals.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills have laughed, cried, and traveled together all season long \u2013 but a source exclusively spilled to RadarOnline.com that Tuesday\u2019s reunion taping featured an all-out war between the women!\n\nIn typical housewives\u2019 fashion, the drama began before cameras even started rolling. As Radar previously reported, the taping was originally scheduled for March 21 but was postponed due to a major snowstorm that left Andy Cohen and Kyle Richards stranded on the East Coast!\n\nThe episode was finally filmed in Los Angeles on March 27. An insider told Radar that the drama was so intense that the taping lasted \u201call day.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, newcomer Teddi Mellencamp was at the center of the bloodbath as she duked it out with notorious hothead Dorit Kemsley.\n\n\u201cDorit and Teddi had major drama,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey were pretty much non-stop fighting the entire time.\u201d\n\nAs Radar readers know, Mellencamp and Kemsley\u2019s friendship have duked it out all season. Their distaste for one another began when Kemsley stood up Arroyave, an accountability coach, for drinks. Mellencamp was furious that she waited for Kemsley for over an hour.\n\nKemsley then went on an infamous \u201capology tour\u201d but Mellencamp wasn\u2019t buying it. The ladies\u2019 feud then exploded when Kemsley called Mellencamp a \u201cpsycho, lying b***h!\u201d\n\nThe RHOBH insider said the blonde beauties wouldn\u2019t let go of the drama on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThey rehashed everything from the season,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey really, really don\u2019t like each other.\u201d\n\nBut for Mellencamp, the battle didn\u2019t end there. She and the ever-outspoken Erika Girardi also had a rage-filled fight. Their drama began earlier this season when the \u201cXXXPEN$IVE\u201d singer brought Mellencamp to tears after Mellencamp accused Girardi of pretending to have amnesia.\n\nAt the time, Girardi vowed she would not apologize for blasting Mellencamp for telling her \u201cdon\u2019t f**k with me.\u201d\n\nAccording to the insider, Mellencamp and Girardi still \u201caren\u2019t in a great place.\u201d\n\nThe reunion taping was proof that \u201ctheir friendship is still strained,\u201d the insider added.\n\nWhat else do you think went down at the RHOBH reunion taping?
