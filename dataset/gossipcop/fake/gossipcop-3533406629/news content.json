Of course, there were lots of weather jokes, with most of them tying in the rest of the Kardashian Jenner family\u2019s names that include \u201cReign,\u201d \u201cNorth,\u201d and \u201cChicago.\u201d\n\nMany were also disappointed that the elaborate fan theory that said Kylie would name her child Butterfly or Mariposa as a nod to Travis Scott turned out not to be true, though obviously, some Twitter users are still living in hope.\n\nRead our roundup of the funniest reactions below.\n\nstormi webster ??
