That\u2019s according to an article in Radar Online where an alleged insider source claims that Jane wants Brad to get back with Jennifer now that her relationship with Justin Theroux is over.\n\n\u201cJane and the whole Missouri-based Pitt family haven\u2019t been disrespectful about Jen and Justin\u2019s marriage, but once it became apparent things wouldn\u2019t work out they actively pushed Brad to get back in touch,\u201d the source said to Radar. \u201cNow they\u2019re determined to see them back together for a second chance.\u201d\n\nBut celebrity rumor watchdog, Gossip Cop, is saying that the story is false based on their research. They confirmed that the two exes communicate sometimes via text but they haven\u2019t seen each other in a long time. There was also no contact between them during the week since Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their divorce.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Radar Online has made allegations that Jane Pitt has tried to influence her son\u2019s dating decisions. They have previously reported that she called Aniston to help Brad \u201cget back on his feet.\u201d According to Gossip Cop, Radar Online\u2019s sister publication has also made up stories about Brad Pitt\u2019s mom. They recently claimed that Jane Pitt moved into his home after his divorce from Angelina Jolie. Gossip Cop debunked each of these stories.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Brad Pitt gives ex-wife Jennifer Aniston a shoulder to cry on amidst Justin Theroux split! https://t.co/SrLJUpgx8D pic.twitter.com/LWFObLk8zw \u2014 In Touch Weekly (@intouchweekly) February 16, 2018\n\nThere was also a claim from Radar that Jane Pitt called Aniston to complain about Jolie. But that story was debunked as well.\n\nRadar Online isn\u2019t the only tabloid that\u2019s publishing questionable stories about Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, and Justin Theroux. Us Weekly recently reported that Justin found post-it notes from Brad to Jennifer two years ago. According to their source, the notes reportedly contain sweet messages like \u201cYou looked nice tonight\u201d or \u201cMiss you already.\u201d The notes allegedly caused a rift in Jennifer and Justin\u2019s relationship. He was reportedly bothered by it even though Aniston said that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Theroux was nevertheless insecure about it.\n\nJustin Theroux found Brad Pitt's old love notes to Jennifer Aniston. https://t.co/7p3LUgfVgi pic.twitter.com/Q1EWBnw0KN \u2014 Toronto Sun (@TheTorontoSun) February 21, 2018\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split on February 15 in a joint statement that they released to the press.
