Chmerkovksiy jokingly slid by a few minutes later, making Lachey giggle before they got into their place as the show picked up after the commercials.\n\nImage zoom\n\nPEOPLE\u2019s special issue 25 Seasons of \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 is on stands now\n\nAfter they received their scores (24/30), fans continued to comment on their demeanor, calling it \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d\n\nBut when the cameras stopped rolling, Chmerkovskiy was seen comforting Lachey, who seemingly had been hoping for higher scores.\n\nDespite sources telling PEOPLE that things have been tense in the rehearsal room, Lachey relied on Chmerkovskiy for comfort during Monday\u2019s emotional elimination.\n\nWhen it was announced that her husband, Nick Lachey, was not in jeopardy of elimination for the first time in three weeks, she threw herself into Chmerkovskiy\u2019s arms.
