{"url": "953bull.iheart.com/content/2017-09-02-no-zayn-is-not-desperate-to-defend-girlfriend-gigi-hadid/", "text": "Here\u2019s where the fake news begins: \u201cZayn Malik Desperate To Defend Gigi Hadid After Racist Accusations,\u201d reads the headline of an \u201cexclusive\u201d from HollywoodLies, which claims it \u201cEXCLUSIVELY learned\u201d he \u201ccan\u2019t stand to see\u201d his girlfriend \u201churting over the racist accusations made against her.\u201d A so-called \u201csource close to the supermodel\u201d is quoted as saying, \u201cZayn is furious people are accusing Gigi of being racist. He\u2019s begging her to let him go on a Twitter rant defending her but she\u2019s asked him to stay quiet for now. She doesn\u2019t want him feeding the trolls.\u201d\n\nThe webloid is trying to play this two ways. If Malik does tweet, it can claim it was right about him wanting to defend Hadid. If he doesn\u2019t, the site can claim it was right about Hadid requesting he \u201chold back.\u201d Just like the tabloids, the bad blog often tries to cover itself. But HollywoodLies can\u2019t cover up the fact that this story is inauthentic. The assertion that Malik wants to go on a Twitter rant defending Hadid isn\u2019t really coming from a \u201csource.\u201d It\u2019s coming from the singer\u2019s own past.\n\nHe tweeted in defense of Hadid during the original controversy earlier this year, which led to additional angry messages as the backlash grew. (As previously reported, Malik said he was called \u201cignorant\u201d and a \u201cterrorist.\u201d) Because Malik did that before, it\u2019s not exactly a stretch to think he\u2019d be upset now and want to defend her again. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly pointed out, HollywoodLies likes to take hot topics (in this case, Hadid doing the fashion show in China) and craft \u201cexclusives\u201d around it (Malik wanting to defend Hadid from haters) for the sake of traffic. But far from being pieces of genuine reporting, these are often fake news stories that contain information anyone could guess.\n\nThat is all that\u2019s going on here. By the way, while HollywoodLies is also maintaining a \u201cdevastated\u201d and \u201cdistraught\u201d Hadid has been \u201ccrying a lot\u201d over the situation, she actually looks pretty happy in the above photo from yesterday.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/934ecfe85e38d18805edd1cfbe1937d8?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-02-no-zayn-is-not-desperate-to-defend-girlfriend-gigi-hadid/", "title": "No, ZAYN Is Not 'Desperate To Defend' Girlfriend Gigi Hadid", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Earlier this year, Gigi mocked Asians by squinting her eyes in a Snapchat video back in February", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "country, country music, country music nh, country hits, country hits nh, country music new hampshire, listen to country music, play country music, play country tunes, ZAYN (31119356), country, country music, country music nh, country hits, country hits nh, country music new hampshire, listen to country music, play country music, play country tunes, ZAYN (31119356)", "og": {"title": "No, ZAYN Is Not 'Desperate To Defend' Girlfriend Gigi Hadid | 95.3 The Bull", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://953bull.iheart.com/content/2017-09-02-no-zayn-is-not-desperate-to-defend-girlfriend-gigi-hadid/", "description": "Earlier this year, Gigi mocked Asians by squinting her eyes in a Snapchat video back in February", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "95.3 The Bull"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://953bull.iheart.com/content/2017-09-02-no-zayn-is-not-desperate-to-defend-girlfriend-gigi-hadid/", "site": "@953bull", "creator": "@953bull", "title": "No, ZAYN Is Not 'Desperate To Defend' Girlfriend Gigi Hadid | 95.3 The Bull", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "Earlier this year, Gigi mocked Asians by squinting her eyes in a Snapchat video back in February", "domain": "953bull.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "No, ZAYN Is Not 'Desperate To Defend' Girlfriend Gigi Hadid | 95.3 The Bull", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-02-no-zayn-is-not-desperate-to-defend-girlfriend-gigi-hadid/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "country, country music, country music nh, country hits, country hits nh, country music new hampshire, listen to country music, play country music, play country tunes, ZAYN (31119356), country, country music, country music nh, country hits, country hits nh, country music new hampshire, listen to country music, play country music, play country tunes, ZAYN (31119356)", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59aaf33749c58da2263b83bd?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "95.3 The Bull", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "fb": {"pages": 705438462826673, "app_id": 158892214720826}, "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-02T17:58:00Z", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-section": "On The Move With Enrique Santos (502176)"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504281600.0, "source": "http://953bull.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
