When Season 11 of his reality show Sister Wives debuted in late 2016, \u201cTLC was less than impressed by the ratings,\u201d an insider revealed, explaining that premiere viewership of 1.8 million \u201cwas not enough\u201d for the network. \u201cSo Kody told them he\u2019d be willing to have the network slash his family\u2019s pay from $180,000 for each adult to $180,000 total if it meant they could make Season 12. He put everything on the line to convince them it could still work.\u201d\n\nBut, he couldn\u2019t deliver and now his wives are turning on him. They\u2019ve been struggling for the past few years, and Kody\u2019s three \u201cspiritual marriages\u201d have all fizzled out. \u201cHis only real connection seems to be with [legal wife] Robyn now,\u201d an insider revealed to Life & Style. \u201cThe other wives have all but given up on him. They mostly see him as an ex-husband who turns up to help with the children.\u201d\n\nBut, Kody doesn\u2019t want to accept that it\u2019s all coming to an end. \u201cHe\u2019s been blaming everyone for the current state of the show \u2014 except himself,\u201d the insider admitted. \u201cHe\u2019s too proud for that.\u201d When the show began in 2010, viewers were fascinated to see a seemingly happy polygamous family on TV. But those days are over. \u201cTLC has discovered you can only pretend things are all rosy for so long. Fans now realize the Browns are anything but a happy group.\u201d\n\nMeri has pulled away completely. She first shattered the illusion that all was well when she had an emotional online and phone affair in 2015 with a man, Sam Cooper, who turned out to be a female catfisher. \u201cKody has never forgiven Meri for it,\u201d the insider said. She moved out of their Las Vegas culdesac months ago after purchasing a Utah bed-and-breakfast in late 2017 and rarely returns to Vegas except for family events or when TLC needs to film something with her there. \u201cKody\u2019s happy with that arrangement. He doesn\u2019t want to have too much to do with her. Their relationship is dead.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Iamges)\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want his reality-TV career to die too, but it\u2019s out of his hands. TLC is planning to create a series focusing on the children of sister wives, the insider says, which will feature Meri and Kody\u2019s daughter, Mariah, who came out as a lesbian last year. \u201cShe\u2019s a favorite with fans because of her maturity,\u201d the insider added. \u201cBut while Meri will make the occasional appearance on the show, there are no plans to feature Kody. For him, things are very much over.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sister-wives-cast.jpg?w=1180&h=600&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Harry-Potter-Star-Rupert-Grint-and-Girlfriend-Georgia-Groome-Pregnant-Expecting-Baby-No.-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C396px%2C2232px%2C1266px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/do-sister-wives-sleep-with-each-other.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/brother-husbands.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sister-wives-scoliosis-ysabel-brown.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robyn-kody.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teen-mom-og-maci-doesnt-think-ryan-is-sober.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robyn-kody.jpg?resize=360%2C240", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robyn-kody.jpg?resize=360%2C240", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/sister-wives-kody-brown-robyn-153443/", "title": "Sister Wives Star Kody Brown Only Has a Relationship With Robyn", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Things aren't looking good for Kody Brown!
