I wrote a verse, then I wrote a chorus, then I realized it was going somewhere and I felt good about it. Like I always [have] in the last couple of years, I called up my friend Jessi Alexander and said, \u2018Man, I think I\u2019m onto something and I need somebody way better than me to try to bring this thing home.\u2019 She and I and Josh Osborne ended up writing this song, I\u2019m super proud of it\u2014and it\u2019s not hard to figure out who this song is about.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing Blake record the new song, what did Gwen think of her beau\u2019s ode to her? \u201cShe liked it,\u201d Blake told Seth Meyers. \u201cI didn\u2019t say I wrote the song about her then. I just said I wrote the song and then she figured it out. There\u2019s a line that says \u2018She\u2019s Revlon red,\u2019 because she\u2019s the Revlon girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when my body\u2019s beside hers / There ain\u2019t no turning back / She\u2019s Revlon red in the blackest night / Lighting up the room in the world just like she\u2019s turnin\u2019 me on.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurnin\u2019 Me On,\u201d featured on Blake\u2019s current album Texoma Shore, is the follow up to Blake\u2019s No. 1 hit \u201cI\u2019ll Name the Dogs,\u201d and most recent single, \u201cI Lived It.\u201d", "images": ["https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2615691521997&noscript=1", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blake-Shelton-1.jpg", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lisa-konicki-96x96.jpg", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/oc-logo-white.png", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/one-country-logo-horizontal-1.png", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/one-country-logo-horizontal.png"], "top_img": "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blake-Shelton-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Konicki"], "canonical_link": "https://www.onecountry.com/country-artists/blake-shelton/blake-shelton-new-single-inspired-by-gwen/", "title": "Blake Shelton Releases \"Turnin' Me On\" About Girlfriend Gwen Stefani -", "meta_data": {"description": "Blake Shelton is releasing a third track, \"Turnin' Me On,\" from his album Texoma Shore and it's a love song inspired by his girlfriend Gwen Stefani.\u00a0The new release from Blake has the country singer and \"The Voice\" coach singing about all the things that turn him on about his girlfriend of 3 years.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton Releases \"Turnin' Me On\" About Girlfriend Gwen Stefani -", "description": "Blake Shelton is releasing a third track, \"Turnin' Me On,\" from his album Texoma Shore and it's a love song inspired by his girlfriend Gwen Stefani.\u00a0The new release from Blake has the country singer and \"The Voice\" coach singing about all the things that turn him on about his girlfriend of 3 years.", "url": "https://www.onecountry.com/country-artists/blake-shelton/blake-shelton-new-single-inspired-by-gwen/", "site_name": "One Country", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blake-Shelton-1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blake-Shelton-1.jpg", "width": 1203, "height": 600}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/onecountry", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Lisa-Konicki-181275359294344/", "tag": "Turnin Me on", "section": "Blake Shelton", "published_time": "2018-07-17T14:56:22+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1689312497997940, "pages": 165995820119861}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Blake Shelton is releasing a third track, \"Turnin' Me On,\" from his album Texoma Shore and it's a love song inspired by his girlfriend Gwen Stefani.\u00a0The new release from Blake has the country singer and \"The Voice\" coach singing about all the things that turn him on about his girlfriend of 3 years.", "title": "Blake Shelton Releases \"Turnin' Me On\" About Girlfriend Gwen Stefani -", "site": "@onecountry", "image": "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blake-Shelton-1.jpg", "creator": "@onecountry"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.29", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cutmypic.png"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZdYxVkuJr4"], "publish_date": 1531839382.0, "source": "http://www.onecountry.com", "summary": ""}
