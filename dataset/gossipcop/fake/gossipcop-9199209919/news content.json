Will their friendship lead to a risky rekindled romance? Get the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\n\n\nJennifer Aniston, 49, is a single woman again after separating from husband Justin Theroux, 46, and that means she\u2019s free to be friendly and even flirt with whoever she wants, including ex Brad Pitt, 54! The talented actress has recently become friends with the newly single Brad again after years of not being in touch and although she\u2019s thrilled about the reconciliation, friends are hoping she\u2019ll steer clear so her heart doesn\u2019t get broken by her former love. \u201cJennifer is psyched that she and Brad are friends again,\u201d a friend of Jennifer\u2019s EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. \u201cFor years she was so angry at him, it\u2019s a relief to have that all be water under the bridge. But not a lot of people in her life are encouraging the friendship, the fear of course is that she\u2019ll fall for him again and he\u2019ll break her heart all over again. It makes sense they\u2019d be worried, Brad\u2019s her kryptonite.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough Jen and Brad haven\u2019t been together since 2005, the former Friends funny lady still thinks he\u2019s the most attractive man she\u2019s ever been with. \u201cA few weeks ago at a dinner party in L.A., she admitted that she still thinks he\u2019s the hottest man she\u2019s ever been with,\u201d the friend continued. \u201cHer attraction to him is still alive and well. At this point they\u2019re still in the early stages of rekindling a friendship but there\u2019s always been an undeniable chemistry between them. Nothing romantic has happened yet but who knows what could happen down the line, anything is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nWe have to admit that although a rekindled romance may be risky for these two, the fact that they\u2019ve been able to put their rocky past behind them and be on good terms is totally amazing! We\u2019re getting serious nostalgia from the former lovebirds and it will be interesting to see how things progress from here. No matter what, though, we wish both Jen and Brad all the happiness in the world!\n\n", "images": ["http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif", "https://s2.gossipcop.com/up/2018/01/Tabloid-Scorecard-2017.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/seagulls-32b6c85d8065e4adbb2d87a1bbb9e9a15dc0ab54.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/t/tiger-5117e3f2cb071e456e3d5fc7d5872570741e2150.jpg", "https://a.collective-media.net/seg/etu/1b", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/i/image001-7.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/b/baby-in-blanket-d9f538e519d4a1a6b0ea54a26a9a8316f1843d15.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/thefinger.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eyes8.gif", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/k/knife-322808f87044c4eed4d3f820b0d9d516785eb2db.jpg", "http://images.gawker.com/18k2u03d0yydjjpg/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/f/flamingo-d55b313720a065a21c500962fe670c6b3474768d.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/avatars/gallery/newimages/eye7.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/l/lightning-7027059984b9945d9a0fb63a76cf3a332c79bc2f.jpg", "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/images/smilies/puke.gif", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/f/fighter-jet-081b86e576474c00b187601078a4027476a9c19c.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/z/zebra-6a816e66761bf274817e7d770bc3c715fc9e5cf3.jpg", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/c/cat-breaks-into-couples-home-ef4a392f7387557515cfffa911a82ff.jpg"], "top_img": "http://images.gawker.com/18k2u03d0yydjjpg/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=751342", "title": "Female First Forum", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://discussion.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
