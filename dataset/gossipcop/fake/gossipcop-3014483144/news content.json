As the numbers supposedly continue to fall, Ky\u2019s mama is doing everything in her power to keep the show alive.\n\n\u201cKylie is beginning to see that fans don\u2019t care about her as much as she thinks, and is devastated by the show\u2019s reception,\u201d a source told Radar Online. The 61-year-old is reportedly even asking her other daughters to help out with some promotion on their individual social media pages.\n\n\u201cKris ordered Kim, Kourtney and Khloe to help by promoting Life of Kylie on their social media,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe is even going so far as to try to add newly filmed footage to the show\u2019s existing edit.\u201d\n\nHey, desperate times call for desperate measures! And, according to TV By The Numbers, the most recent Life of Kylie episode only drew in 660,000 viewers.\n\nIt also came in 21st place out of the top 25 programs on Sunday, falling behind even the Weather Channel.\n\n\u201cHer friends are just telling her the truth.
