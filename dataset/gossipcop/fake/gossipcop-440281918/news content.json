The 42-year-old even has a special ritual that involves tricking her children Jackson, 6, and August, 2, into early lights out.\n\n\u201cOn Monday nights because my kids can\u2019t read a clock yet,\u201d Theron told host James Corden. \u201cI get them to bed at like 5:45 and then I open a bottle of wine, take a bath. I get all ready and that\u2019s my date night. I date the show.\u201d\n\nWhen Corden, 39, inquired about who the Oscar winner would like to receive a rose from, she replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to be on the show. I just want to watch.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Theron will have to find a new \u201cboyfriend.\u201d The season finale of The Bachelor aired on Monday, March 5!\n\nThe Bachelor wasn\u2019t the only thing Theron got candid about. Theron was joined on Corden\u2019s stage with Gringo costar David Oyelowo and she shared a hilarious memory about how they first bonded while filming in Mexico City. According to the actress, she and Oyelowo, 41, were at a restaurant and he began telling a funny story.\n\n\u201cI kept saying, \u2018You have to stop,\u2019 and he wouldn\u2019t stop,\u201d she recalled. \u201cHe kept going with the story until I actually urinated myself. Not drizzle, I had to go back to the hotel, that\u2019s how hard he made me laugh.\u201d\n\nOyelowo didn\u2019t realize what was happening. \u201cShe ran out,\u201d he quipped. \u201cAnd I looked at the chair.\u201d\n\nFor all the latest Bachelor news subscribe to our new podcast \u2018Watch With Us\u2019 below!\n\n", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlize-theron2.jpg?w=300", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlize-theron2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C663px%2C348px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/james-corden-charlize-theron.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlize-theron2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C663px%2C348px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlize-theron-says-she-is-dating-abcs-the-bachelor/", "title": "Charlize Theron Says She Is \u2018Dating\u2019 ABC\u2019s \u2018The Bachelor\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Charlize Theron joked on Thursday, March 8, that she is \u2018dating\u2019 ABC\u2019s \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Charlize Theron Shares Her Elaborate \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Watching Ritual", "description": "Charlize Theron joked on Thursday, March 8, that she is \u2018dating\u2019 ABC\u2019s \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlize-theron-says-she-is-dating-abcs-the-bachelor/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:14:32+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlize-theron2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C663px%2C348px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlize-theron2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C663px%2C348px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-09T16:41:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:14:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Charlize Theron joked on Thursday, March 8, that she is \u2018dating\u2019 ABC\u2019s \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 \u2014 get the details", "title": "Charlize Theron Shares Her Elaborate \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Watching Ritual", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charlize-theron2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C663px%2C348px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520613675.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
