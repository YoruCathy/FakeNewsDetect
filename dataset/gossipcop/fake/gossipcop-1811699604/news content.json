HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies won five total, including Best Limited Series, while Veep nabbed Best Comedy series.\n\nWith 22 nods, Westworld tied Saturday Night Live for the most nominated show this year, though it didn\u2019t end up winning any statues at Sunday\u2019s show. (It picked up a few during the Creative Arts Emmys last weekend, though.) Saturday Night Live, however, won six awards, including Best Variety Sketch Series.\n\nMaster of None\u2018s Lena Waithe made history by being the first black woman to win a writing Emmy, while Atlanta\u2018s Donald Glover is the first black director to win an Emmy for directing a comedy series. This Is Us star Sterling K. Brown became the first black actor to win the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series award since 1998, when Andre Braugher won for his performance on NBC\u2019s Homicide: Life on the Street.\n\nOther notable achievements included Julia Louis-Dreyfus winning her sixth consecutive Emmy for Veep, and Elisabeth Moss winning her first ever Emmy for her starring role on The Handmaid\u2019s Tale after being nominated six times before for Top of the Lake and Mad Men.\n\nSee the full list of winners below.\n\nBest Drama Series\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale (WINNER)\n\nBetter Call Saul\n\nThe Crown\n\nHouse of Cards\n\nStranger Things\n\nThis Is Us\n\nWestworld\n\nBest Comedy Series\n\nVeep (WINNER)\n\nAtlanta\n\nBlack-ish\n\nMaster of None\n\nModern Family\n\nSilicon Valley\n\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\n\nBest Limited Series\n\nBig Little Lies (WINNER)\n\nFargo\n\nFeud: Bette and Joan\n\nGenius\n\nThe Night Of\n\nBest Actress in a Drama Series\n\nElisabeth Moss, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (WINNER)\n\nViola Davis, How to Get Away With Murder\n\nClaire Foy, The Crown\n\nKeri Russell, The Americans\n\nEvan Rachel Wood, Westworld\n\nRobin Wright, House of Cards\n\nBest Actor in a Drama Series\n\nSterling K.
