Mr RocknRoll has propelled himself into the position of public figure.\"\n\nMr Browne added: \"He tries to pretend his lifestyle is not rock and roll at all. That does not hold water.\"\n\nHe said Mr RocknRoll took the job at Virgin Galactic and \"apparently made up for himself\" the job title of \"Head of Astronaut Relations and Marketing\".\n\nMr Browne said Mr RocknRoll was not embarrassed at the party and photographs were posted on Facebook for \"all to see\".\n\n\"It seems to have been regarded as an innocent joke,\" he added. \"If it was so innocent what is the problem? Why not let the public judge what is acceptable behaviour?\"\n\nMr Browne added: \"The conduct here was such that some people might legitimately regard it as being unacceptable behaviour - therefore something where public interest for justification for publication arises.\"\n\nDavid Sherborne, for RocknRoll, told Mr Justice Briggs that the photographs had been taken at a private fancy dress party which was \"innocent and well-intentioned\".\n\nHe said the party's theme was \"outrageous\" and RocknRoll had been wearing a costume.\n\n\"The photographs were taken by a private individual,\" he said. \"They were not intended to be seen by the world at large.\n\n\"They are plainly private. There is plainly a reasonable expectation.\"\n\nHe said anyone trying to find the photographs on Facebook would need \"some pretty specialist knowledge\".\n\nMr Sherborne added: \"This cannot possibly be described as 'in the public domain'.\"\n\nHe said Mr RocknRoll was not a public figure and did not court publicity.\n\n\"It is simply because he is married to Miss Winslet,\" added Mr Sherborne. \"I am sure he would not mind if I described him as a relative nobody up until the point he married Miss Winslet.\"\n\nHe argued that the intention was \"to say something embarrassing about Miss Winslet's future husband.\"\n\nWinslet married RocknRoll, her third husband, in an intimate ceremony in New York after getting engaged to him in the summer.\n\nThey kept their nuptials a secret from almost everybody, with even their parents left in the dark, it was reported.\n\nWinslet, 37, was said to have been given away by her Titanic and Revolutionary Road co-star Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom she enjoys a close friendship.\n\nRocknRoll who changed his name from Abel Smith, works for his uncle\u2019s space venture Virgin Galactic and has previously been married to Eliza Pearson, the eldest daughter of Viscount Cowdray.\n\nThe hearing, part of which was heard in private, continues tomorrow.", "images": ["http://www.telegraph.co.uk/template/ver1-0/i/telegraph_print_190.gif",
