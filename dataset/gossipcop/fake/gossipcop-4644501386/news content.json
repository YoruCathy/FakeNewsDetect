One person who won\u2019t be lucky enough to score a ticket? President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Noma Dumezweni, who plays Hermione, said when asked if Trump should see the show. \u201cAnybody else, yes.\u201d\n\nEven though the play itself is not overtly political, Harry Potter fans have drawn comparisons between Trump and the Dark Lord, Lord Voldemort, since the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cI really do believe that\u2019s why it\u2019s resonating at the moment,\u201d Dumezweni said on the red carpet at the Tony Awards. \u201cWe, all as human beings, are fighting to be connected. If you\u2019re not seen and not heard, that\u2019s where dangerous stuff happens. That\u2019s where people under the radar do very cruel things.\u201d\n\nThe two-part stage play, based on J.K. Rowling\u2019s boy wizard Harry Potter, is set 19 years after the events of the seventh book installment, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what this play is about,\u201d Dumezweni said. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing things into the light. Letting your light shine. This is what J.K. has always been about. Let the darkness out into the light. That\u2019s why i\u2019m very proud to be here telling this story right now. Those things are very important.\u201d\n\n\u201cCursed Child\u201d is up for 10 Tonys, including best play, best performance by an actor, and best performance by an actress.\n\nRELATED VIDEO:", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/noma-dumezweni.jpg?w=1000", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Flegit%2Fnews%2Fdonald-trump-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-tony-awards-1202839684%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202839684&comment_count=15", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/noma-dumezweni.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/noma-dumezweni.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/legit/news/donald-trump-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-tony-awards-1202839684/", "title": "Donald Trump Is Not Welcome at \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u2019 Says Play\u2019s Hermione", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "President Donald Trump will not be lucky enough to score a ticket to \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" if play's Hermione has her way.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202839684, "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-06-10T16:27:01"}, "pmc-tag": "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,Noma Dumezweni,Tony Awards", "title": "Donald Trump Is Not Welcome at \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u2019 Says Play\u2019s Hermione", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "legit", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "legit", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump Is Not Welcome at \u2018Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u2019 Says Play\u2019s Hermione", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/legit/news/donald-trump-harry-potter-and-the-cursed-child-tony-awards-1202839684/", "description": "\u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d is currently Broadway\u2019s hottest ticket.
