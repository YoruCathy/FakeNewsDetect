That's not to say her life is perfect, of course. Not too long ago, she says, \"I felt like I'd lost everything. Just because it's not plastered everywhere doesn't mean I didn't have my rock bottom. I've had my moments, and it's almost unsafe for me to even talk about them, because I'll be taken advantage of.\"\n\nIn 2013, after releasing her debut solo album Stars Dance, Gomez abruptly canceled the end of her tour, saying she needed to \"spend some time on myself.\" Then, in January 2014, she checked herself into The Meadows, an Arizona-based rehab.\n\n\"I was diagnosed with lupus, and I've been through chemotherapy,\" the actress reveals. \"That's what my break was really about. I could've had a stroke.\"", "images": ["http://www.eonline.com/resources/newsletter/images/newsletter_sticky_check.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1611373942516879&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.eonline.com/resources/customSocialBar/images/twitter.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1007010875/?value=0&label=y3zzCL2IiwgQu4iX4AM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://www.eonline.com/resources/customSocialBar/images/Facebook_hover.png", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201598/rs_1024x683-151008095135-1024.selena-gomez-billboard-4.10815.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201598/rs_634x951-151008095133-634.selena-gomez-billboard-1.10815.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "http://www.eonline.com/resources/customSocialBar/images/email_hover.png", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201598/rs_634x824-151008064625-634.selena-gomez-billboard.10815.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201598/rs_300x300-151008095132-600.selena-gomez-billboard-4.10815.jpg?fit=around|600:315&crop=600:315;center,top&output-quality=90"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201598/rs_300x300-151008095132-600.selena-gomez-billboard-4.10815.jpg?fit=around|600:315&crop=600:315;center,top&output-quality=90", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/704344/selena-gomez-i-ve-never-had-a-problem-with-drinking", "title": "Selena Gomez: I've Never Had a Problem With Drinking", "meta_data": {"description": "Singer also opens up to Billboard about lupus, chemotherapy, double standards and Justin Bieber", "google-site-verification": "jOadQCDbZTkKw5sn27yXszjIb9c3PdMPHENN92uPWy8", "msvalidate.01": "564B986CE3CECCAE84779191BEC6B755", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez: I've Never Had a Problem With Drinking", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.eonline.com/news/704344/selena-gomez-i-ve-never-had-a-problem-with-drinking", "image": {"identifier": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201598/rs_300x300-151008095132-600.selena-gomez-billboard-4.10815.jpg?fit=around|600:315&crop=600:315;center,top&output-quality=90", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "site_name": "E!
