But she added, \u201cWe never once considered calling Donald, let\u2019s just put it that way.\u201d\n\nThe Enquirer incident came to light as the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d stars reacted to a furor that broke out on Thursday, when Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Scarborough was a \u201cpsycho\u201d and claimed he had once seen Ms. Brzezinski \u201cbleeding badly from a face-lift.\u201d\n\nHis comments were met with a bipartisan backlash, including from Republican lawmakers crucial to his legislative agenda, and revived a broader discussion of the president\u2019s habit of making insulting remarks about women\u2019s appearances.\n\nMs. Brzezinski and Mr. Scarborough were once friendly with Mr. Trump, visiting him and his family at his Florida estate. But they are now blistering critics, a reversal that Mr. Trump took as an insulting and personal betrayal.\n\nThe controversy spilled into Friday, overshadowing the White House\u2019s plans. The hosts wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post. A meeting between the president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, a sober discussion about North Korean aggression, shared coverage on cable news with segments about the Enquirer\u2019s disreputable past and onscreen graphics including \u201cTV Hosts: White House Used Tabloid Story to Threaten Us.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/01/business/trumptweetsGIF/trumptweetsGIF-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/30/us/30mikajoe/30mikajoe-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/30/us/30mikajoe/30mikajoe-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael M.
