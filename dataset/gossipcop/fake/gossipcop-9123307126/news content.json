That\u2019s what an article in the current issue of Star Magazine says. The tabloid alleges that the \u201cStarboy\u201d singer may have slept with an Irish model while he was on tour in Dublin. But Gossip Cop is on the case and they claim that the story is nothing but the work of a \u201cBad Liar.\u201d\n\nAs Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine says that it \u201clearned that The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, invited Irish Instagram model Ava Van Rose back to his hotel the night before his performance at the Longitude Festival in Dublin on July 15.\u201d They say that they got the information from a so-called insider who told them that the model spent some time with The Weeknd.\n\nThe article then speculates about how Selena will react to the \u201cnews\u201d that Abel may have cheated on her, implying that Gomez would be emotionally gutted by the news.\n\n\u201cShe hoped Abel would prove her wrong. If Selena finds out about this [hookup with Van Rose], there\u2019s no telling what she might do!\u201d\n\nBut Gossip Cop insists that the story is based on what they call \u201cunsubstantiated rumors.\u201d They say that the story was first published in The Irish Sun and was derived from an insider in the model\u2019s circle. Even though these claims about the Weeknd are pretty explosive, the story hasn\u2019t been picked up by any of the major celebrity news publications. This is a pretty good hint that the story isn\u2019t credible. As Gossip Cop notes, the rumors about Abel and Ava were published by Radar Online, but that\u2019s expected because it\u2019s Star Magazine\u2018s sister publication.\n\nBest show ever great weekend???? #artistpass #theweeknd #goals\u2764\ufe0f #xo #amazing #lovehim #festival #irishgirl # A post shared by Model Ava van rose????

Ava claimed that she was invited to spend time with Drake by one of his bodyguards. The \u201cOne Dance\u201d rapper was allegedly so smitten with her that they were on the road together for over a month. She has pictures to prove that she has spent time with Drake\u2019s dad and some of the members of his OVO team.\n\n@therealdennisg @jenellling @champagnepapi great night with great people Drakes papi More life party #legend#party#london#glamourmodel#ovo#insta#instagood#morelife A post shared by Model Ava van rose????
