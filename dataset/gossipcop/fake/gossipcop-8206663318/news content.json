Meghan Markle, 36, and Prince Harry, 33, are set to walk down the aisle on May 19 and Meghan\u2019s already thinking about having a family! The brunette beauty wouldn\u2019t mind trying to get pregnant right after their nuptials and even has hopes it will happen on their honeymoon. \u201cBoth Meghan and Harry are feeling nervous, as most people are before their wedding, but they are both super excited to start their married life together,\u201d an insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. \u201cSince moving to the UK Meghan\u2019s life has been a total whirlwind, and although she\u2019s loved every single minute of it, she can\u2019t wait for their honeymoon, so they can have private time together and get out of the spotlight for a while. Meghan and Harry would both like to have a big family, and they plan to start trying straight away! Meghan would love to fall pregnant on their honeymoon, and has told Harry she wants at least four children.\u201d\n\nA royal wedding followed by years of Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s children growing up would be so lovely to see and since Meghan always seems to be great when she\u2019s around kids, we have a feeling she\u2019d be an awesome mother! In fact, she may be able to practice the role with some very special children on her big day. Prince William and Kate Middleon \u2018s two children Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 3, are reportedly set to be a part of Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s wedding activities. There\u2019s no official word on whether or not the newest of the clan, Prince Louis, will join but we can\u2019t wait to find out!\n\nIt won\u2019t be long until we see exactly who will show up to celebrate Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s love either. The wedding is set to take place at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle on May 19 at noon local time. The ceremony will be able to be viewed live in multiple countries around the world.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-hopes-she-gets-pregnant-on-honeymoon-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F12%2Fprince-harry-meghan-markle-pregnant-honeymoon-big-family%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3139976", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-hopes-she-gets-pregnant-on-honeymoon-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-hopes-she-gets-pregnant-on-honeymoon-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/12/prince-harry-meghan-markle-pregnant-honeymoon-big-family/", "title": "Meghan Markle Hopes She Gets Pregnant On Honeymoon \u2014 She & Prince Harry Want A Big Family", "meta_data": {"description": "Meghan Markle wants to get pregnant on her honeymooon and wants a big family", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, The Royal Wedding", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Hopes She Gets Pregnant On Honeymoon \u2014 She & Prince Harry Want A Big Family", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/12/prince-harry-meghan-markle-pregnant-honeymoon-big-family/", "description": "Meghan Markle has been dreaming about starting a family with Prince Harry for a long time and since she\u2019s been thoroughly enjoying her role as his fiancee, she\u2019s ready to become a mothe\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-hopes-she-gets-pregnant-on-honeymoon-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 350, "alt": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-12T22:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-15T21:54:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Meghan Markle Hopes She Gets Pregnant On Honeymoon \u2014 She & Prince Harry Want A Big Family"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-hopes-she-gets-pregnant-on-honeymoon-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meghan Markle Hopes She Gets Pregnant On Honeymoon \u2014 She & Prince Harry Want A Big Family", "description": "Meghan Markle wants to get pregnant on her honeymooon and wants a big family"}, "author": "Erin Silvia", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526054400.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
