At the same time, he\u2019s found time to be on the cover of Men\u2019s Health and now American Airlines\u2019 in-flight magazine American Way. Ever humble, Jason was embarrassed to find his face on the cover of the magazine on a recent flight, and his friend Mada Abdelhamid wasn\u2019t going to let him live it down.\n\nYou can read an excerpt from the extensive article below and read the full article by clicking on the link below.\n\nIt\u2019s golden hour at Hastings Point, a picturesque surfers\u2019 beach 70-odd miles south of Brisbane, and Jason Momoa is getting antsy.\n\nThe 38-year-old American actor has been preening for hours, and he\u2019s not entirely at ease with the situation. \u201cSorry to ruin your moment,\u201d he says to a nearby couple trying to have a romantic moment. \u201cI don\u2019t normally pet myself in front of a bunch of people.\u201d\n\nMomoa is on Australia\u2019s east coast to film Aquaman, the $300 million fantasy flick, due out next year, in which he plays the lead opposite Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard. Until now, his most visible role has been the brutal warrior Khal Drogo on Game of Thrones. His latest film projects, though, will potentially catapult him into a different category of fame, and he\u2019s learning that this sort of success comes with a price.\n\nThe photographer prods him to loosen up\u2014More smolder! Less frown! And despite her best efforts, Momoa will not be charmed into taking off his shirt. At one point, he mutters to nobody in particular, \u201cI\u2019m not a model, I\u2019m an actor.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/6f1b1e4a-5429-4774-a7cb-24d308fe0fb6-42293-0000155fd229b249-1.jpg?fit=200%2C300&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4855.jpg?w=1080", "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854.jpg?fit=622%2C435&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854.jpg?w=1080", "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/img_9778.jpg?fit=227%2C300&ssl=1", "https://www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4853.jpg?w=1080", "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4852.jpg?w=1080", "https://i2.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4856.jpg?w=1080", "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854-1.jpg?w=1080"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854.jpg?fit=622%2C435&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jmn Admin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.jasonmomoanews.com/2017/12/jason-momoa-adorns-the-cover-of-american-ways-november-issue/", "title": "Jason Momoa Adorns the Cover of American Way\u2019s November Issue", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jason Momoa Adorns the Cover of American Way's November Issue - Jason Momoa News", "description": "With Justice League in theaters and Aquaman on the way, Jason Momoa has been on a whirlwind promotional tour.\u00a0 At the same time, he\u2019s found time to be on the cover of Men\u2019s Health and now American Airlines\u2019 in-flight magazine American Way.Ever humble, Jason was embarrassed to find his face on the cover of the \u2026", "url": "https://www.jasonmomoanews.com/2017/12/jason-momoa-adorns-the-cover-of-american-ways-november-issue/", "site_name": "Jason Momoa News", "updated_time": "2018-06-23T17:46:56+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854.jpg?fit=622%2C435&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854.jpg?fit=622%2C435&ssl=1", "width": 622, "height": 435}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/jasonmomoanews", "tag": "jason momoa", "section": "Magazine Article", "published_time": "2017-12-05T20:53:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-23T17:46:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "With Justice League in theaters and Aquaman on the way, Jason Momoa has been on a whirlwind promotional tour.\u00a0 At the same time, he\u2019s found time to be on the cover of Men\u2019s Health and now American Airlines\u2019 in-flight magazine American Way.Ever humble, Jason was embarrassed to find his face on the cover of the \u2026", "title": "Jason Momoa Adorns the Cover of American Way's November Issue - Jason Momoa News", "site": "@jasonmomoanews", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_4854.jpg?fit=622%2C435&ssl=1", "creator": "@jasonmomoanews"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://www.jasonmomoanews.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/www.jasonmomoanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/unnamed-3.jpg?fit=270%2C270&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512507180.0, "source": "http://www.jasonmomoanews.com", "summary": ""}
