I was brought up in that life, and I think that it's very important for everybody to be in touch with their spirituality and to have a relationship with God,\" she told Teen Vogue in 2016.\n\nHer religious beliefs have hugely influenced her morals, she told The Sunday Times Style, revealing that she would never post nude.\n\n\"People look at religion as a scary thing if they don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about. But at the end of the day, church is just a building; my personal beliefs are what matters,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\n\"I\u2019m definitely not the poster child for Christianity, there are a lot of things the Bible says you\u2019re not supposed to do. I mean, you\u2019re not supposed to drink, you\u2019re not supposed to have sex before marriage...\n\n\u201cBut I could be doing so many worse things with the access I\u2019m given.\u201d\n\nHow does she know Bieber?\n\nNews of their engagement may come as a shock to fans, but Baldwin and Bieber have actually known each other for nine years.\n\nStephen Baldwin introduced the two in 2009 as seen in a short clip that went viral in 2016 after Bieber retweeted it alongside the caption \u201cHaha. Amazing\u201d.\n\nHow did their relationship start?\n\nRumours began circulating that the two were romantically involved after pictures surfaced of them attending the same Church ceremony together in 2014 with Kendall Jenner.\n\nDespite frequently being photographed together, both denied the rumours until January 2016, when Bieber posted a candid snap on Instagram of the couple kissing on New Year\u2019s Eve, taken when they were on a trip in Anguilla with Bieber\u2019s family.\n\nHowever, Bieber got back together with his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez just a few months later. The two were rumoured to be dating until April this year, when he rekindled his relationship with Baldwin.\n\n\"Justin and I were friends for a long time,\" Baldwin told The Sunday Times Style.\n\n\"I met him when I was really young and he was one of my best friends. Everybody knows that at a certain point in time that turned into something else, but that just happens when you\u2019re 18, 19.\n\n\u201cWe went through a long period of time when we weren\u2019t friends. We didn\u2019t speak for quite some time and there was a lot of weirdness that went on. We\u2019ve moved past that.\"", "images": ["http://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/09/10/gettyimages-960634926.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/09/10/gettyimages-960634926.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/hailey-baldwin-justin-bieber-engaged-who-is-she-model-stephen-a8438196.html", "title": "Who is Hailey Baldwin?
