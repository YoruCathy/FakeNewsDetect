Rumors about trouble in David and Victoria\u2019s marriage have been proliferating in the tabloids since the Royal Wedding, where the couple was photographed looking dour. Of course, there are always rumors about the Beckhams, who will (hopefully?) celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary on July 4. This time, though, social-media participants seem convinced that they are really heading for a split.\n\nThere are a few factors to consider when weighing the possibility of divorce. One is: Do you care? Another is: What have the Beckhams said about their marriage? (It\u2019s F-I-N-E, according to their publicist, who called the rumors \u201cJournalist Chinese whispers and fake news fueled by social media.\u201d) And another is: What\u2019s going on with the Beckhams\u2019 businesses?\n\nLast week, the Daily Mail reported that David left his longtime manager, who also manages Posh, for a new team led by his friend David Gardner. This, to me, would be the strongest sign of an impending split, but the Beckhams quickly denied the report. Then, Victoria gave a speech at the Forbes Women Summit in New York, where she mentioned David specifically and called him an \u201cincredible husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try really, really hard. I try hardest to be the best mother,\u201d she said in her speech, according to People. \u201cI am trying to be the best wife and the best professional. When I get home I try to put the phone down and spend time with the children and spend time with David. I have the support of an incredible husband. We really are equal with everything we do at home with the children. When I\u2019m away he\u2019s the one doing the school run and doing the cooking.\u201d\n\nSo Victoria is trying. Is David? So far, he hasn\u2019t personally said anything about the divorce rumors. I\u2019d wait to see what he does next week for their anniversary.\n\nIn other celebrity relationship news, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are doing great. Shookus\u2019s parents visited the couple in L.A. this past weekend, and they all went on a dinner date and a hike the next day. (Shookus\u2019s 5-year-old daughter was present for the hike, too.) According to an \u201ceyewitness\u201d who talked to People, Affleck was in a \u201cgreat mood\u201d at dinner, and he \u201cpicked up the check at the end of the night.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Juliano-rol/X17online.com\n\nBut Affleck and Shookus are not necessarily getting more serious, according to Entertainment Tonight. A source close to Affleck told the outlet, \u201cBen knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He\u2019s actually been told to take it slow and he\u2019s heeding that advice \u2026 Ben isn\u2019t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon, but Lindsay feels he is worth the wait.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Is Ben Affleck worth the wait?\n\nMoving more quickly is Shookus\u2019s SNL colleague Pete Davidson, who just moved into a $16 million apartment in Manhattan with his new fianc\u00e9, Ariana Grande. Grande\u2019s 25th birthday is today, and Davidson wished her a happy birthday on Instagram just after midnight.\n\nLast night, Grande posted a photo of Davidson on her Instagram story at 11:11 p.m. with the caption, \u201ci have no wish i have everything i ever wanted hi.\u201d I love it!\n\nDo you remember who Chris Martin is dating? It\u2019s Dakota Johnson. They were photographed walking a dog in Malibu on Sunday.\n\nPhoto: DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID\n\nOne small blessing from this week:\n\nMartin\u2019s ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is preparing to marry her fianc\u00e9, the television producer Brad Falchuk at the end of the summer. Here\u2019s what she had to say about wedding planning this time around:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very busy so I\u2019m actually not that involved in it.\u201d\n\nPhoto: XPOS/BACKGRID\n\nAnd here\u2019s an interesting blind item from this week, from Enty at Crazy Days and Nights:\n\n\u201cThis former A- list mostly television actress from a now defunct hit comedy is probably A-/B+ list mostly movie actress. She says that this A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know spent three weeks chatting her up and doing everything he could to hook up with her. She finally hooked up with him and within 30 minutes after, he had her out the door and has ghosted her since.\u201d\n\nI believe that \u201cA-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know\u201d has moved on with an even younger actress.\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll leave you with some incredible news: Emma Watson is back together with former Glee star Chord Overstreet. Or perhaps they never broke up? They first announced their relationship back in March, with a very obvious pap stroll in L.A.. Then, People reported at the end of May that they were over. But last week, they were pap-strolling in L.A. again, and this time, they made out for the camera! Watson must really like this guy to go along with all of this.\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week.
