The publication reveals they're now headed toward a \"$400 million divorce.\"\n\nThe magazine explains the stars \"tangled in a fight to end all fights that climaxed with Ellen ripping off her wedding ring and moving out.\u201d \"It's all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their closest friends to avoid being asked questions,\u201d confesses an insider. This source goes on to share, \"[Ellen] and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty.\"\n\nThe \"brutal blowup\" led DeGeneres to \"storm out\" and move, maintains the outlet. Since then, says another tipster, DeGeneres and de Rossi now \"spend less and less time together,\" have been \"living separate lives,\" and \"hardly say a word to each other all day.\" It's even predicted, \"If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history.\"\n\nThe tabloid similarly claimed the couple was having a \"marriage crisis\" a month ago, but fails to mention DeGeneres and de Rossi have just returned from a trip to Africa. Both documented the vacation on social media, with the actress calling her wife \"beautiful,\" and the comedienne sharing a photo of them embracing. They're clearly still together, and because of that, a mutual friend of Gossip Cop and DeGeneres couldn\u2019t believe the Enquirer even published such an obviously bogus breakup claim.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=636644460158571371&c7=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fdebunking-the-weeks-tabloid-stories-june-8-2018%252Fss-AAyootg&c8=&c9=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyqDE.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=1b6df80d31744a8d8dd444d2e97a908f&rnd=636644460158571371&rf=&tp=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fdebunking-the-weeks-tabloid-stories-june-8-2018%252Fss-AAyootg&di=395&lng=en-us&cv.product=prime&pn=gallery_classic&activityId=1b6df80d31744a8d8dd444d2e97a908f&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=entertainment-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=entertainment&pg.n=gallery_classic&pg.t=gallery&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyz3Yl.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=270&y=129", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo11.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyyuQu.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=310&y=99", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyoMuZ.img?h=373&w=624&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&x=575&y=353", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo1E.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=395&pi=&ps=&su=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Fdebunking-the-weeks-tabloid-stories-june-8-2018%252Fss-AAyootg&pageid=galleryvnext&mkt=en-us&pn=gallery_classic&pp=False&cv.product=prime&cv.partner=Gossip%2BCop&cv.publcat=Gossip%2BCop%2BMedia&st.dpt=entertainment-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636644460158571371&rf=&rid=1b6df80d31744a8d8dd444d2e97a908f&cvs=Browser&subcvs=entertainment&cv.entityId=AAyootg&cv.entitySrc=ss&provid=AAdsRm7&ar=0&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=1&pgIdx=1&pgTot=5&activityId=1b6df80d31744a8d8dd444d2e97a908f&pm=&pg.n=gallery_classic&pg.t=gallery&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&ex=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyyfPj.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=355&y=242"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180613002015im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyoMuZ.img?h=373&w=624&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&x=575&y=353", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Debunking the week's tabloid stories: June 8, 2018", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Debunking the week's tabloid stories: June 8, 2018", "cq": "passed", "description": "<p>A round-up of the week's tabloid stories that totally missed the mark.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
