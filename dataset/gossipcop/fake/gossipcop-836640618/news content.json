However, calling a woman pregnant \u2014 or assuming she is because of some kooky signs or because she's covering up her stomach \u2014 is body shaming.\n\nAlso, just because Rihanna wore an outfit that covered her midsection doesn't automatically confirm a pregnancy. No one is entitled to her body, and she can cover it up should she want to.", "images": ["https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2020/03/31/15/33/d2/poxgzzsy2o18y.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2020/04/01/11/2z/bx/po2ule9a0w1bw.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035453&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_wn=", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/crop/62/62/80/2017/11/13/18/5v/qz/po04losps0w0.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bnzfTM78T_ems.gif", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2020/03/31/12/4n/bx/poe0u0p7281bw.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2020/04/06/14/b7/j0/pokm5vfdc81d5.png", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2616872273084&noscript=1", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2020/04/06/16/10/r9/potla43lhw1bw.png", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2616872273084&event=pagevisit&noscript=1", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/170/80/2017/02/22/14/5o/zu/pot01si28sie.png", "http://trc.taboola.com/1215023/log/3/unip?en=view_content", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/150/150/80/2018/08/02/13/9t/kt/po16uracso15b.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/170/80/2020/04/01/11/2z/bx/po2ule9a0w1bw.png", "http://www.revelist.com/images/1x1.gif", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/170/80/2020/04/06/14/b7/j0/pokm5vfdc81d5.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/full/2018/01/29/11/4q/f4/poelwa33eow0.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/170/80/2020/03/31/15/33/d2/poxgzzsy2o18y.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/170/80/2020/03/31/12/4n/bx/poe0u0p7281bw.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/150/150/80/2018/06/29/14/9r/jd/po1wiryhgc15b.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2020/04/03/11/ew/3x/po3mcatzsc1bw.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=434351533770785&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2016/06/13/14/f3/0x/poijvlgw009.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/300/300/80/2017/02/22/14/5o/zu/pot01si28sie.png", "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/constrain/150/150/80/2018/07/17/11/es/id/popqm2y00g15b.png"], "top_img": "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/full/2018/01/29/11/4q/f4/poelwa33eow0.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.revelist.com/celebrity/rihanna-pregnancy-grammys/11384", "title": "Fans are speculating Rihanna is pregnant after the Grammys, and it's not OK", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "People are accusing Rihanna of being pregnant after her performance at the Grammy's, and it's still fat shaming.", "title": "Rihanna is accused of being pregnant at the Grammys | Revelist", "og": {"site_name": "Revelist.com", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Fans are speculating Rihanna is pregnant after the Grammys, and it's not OK", "description": "This is still fat shaming.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/full/2018/01/29/11/4q/f4/poelwa33eow0.png", "url": "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/full/2018/01/29/11/4q/f4/poelwa33eow0.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "url": "https://www.revelist.com/celebrity/rihanna-pregnancy-grammys/11384"}, "fb": {"pages": 194235290942369}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fans are speculating Rihanna is pregnant after the Grammys, and it's not OK", "description": "This is still fat shaming.", "image": "https://ugc.reveliststatic.com/gen/full/2018/01/29/11/4q/f4/poelwa33eow0.png", "site": "@HeyRevelist", "url": "https://www.revelist.com/celebrity/rihanna-pregnancy-grammys/11384"}, "lytics": {"post_type": "slideshow", "category": "Entertainment", "subcategories": "Celebrity", "tags": "IHeartMyBody, Celebrity, Entertainment, Rihanna,", "brand_safe": "true"}, "application-name": "", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.revelist.com/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.revelist.com/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.revelist.com/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://www.revelist.com/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.revelist.com/mstile-310x310.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.revelist.com", "summary": ""}
