Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.\n\nThis is not a celebrity marriage, it\u2019s a royal marriage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,\u201d says Katie Nicholl, author of . \u201cIt\u2019s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it\u2019s a royal marriage.\u201d Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry\u2019s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen\u2019s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.\n\nYes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn\u2019t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it\u2019s not Harry\u2019s,\u201d says Duncan Larcombe, author of .\n\nLarcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.\n\nIf Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they\u2019re not legally enforceable.\n\nAnd though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII\u2019s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. \u201cIn the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,\u201d Larcombe says, \u201cand the person who is departing the royal family, they\u2019re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they\u2019re done behind closed doors.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-attends-the-wellchild-awards-at-news-photo-1578512749.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.616xh;0,0.0295xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-906665922-1521145604.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0783xh&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-1512083268.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.390xh;0,0.0190xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-1512083268.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.390xh;0,0.0190xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Friedman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a19479777/prince-harry-meghan-markle-prenuptial-agreement/", "title": "Why Prince Harry Didn't Get a Prenup Before Marrying Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#BE3E19", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Town & Country", "title": "Why Prince Harry Won\u2019t Get a Prenup Before Marrying Meghan Markle", "description": "Royal experts weigh in.", "url": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a19479777/prince-harry-meghan-markle-prenuptial-agreement/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-1512083268.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.390xh;0,0.0190xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 526594570689062, "pages": 344794953432}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TownandCountryMagazine", "modified_time": "2019-10-22 04:50:26", "published_time": "2018-05-19 09:00:00", "section": "Heritage", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TandCmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-1512083268.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.390xh;0,0.0190xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "musQPiBADe3f4WpT4JNcg9uUChC3qnOhhPLSR4n1urM", "title": "Why Prince Harry Didn't Get a Prenup Before Marrying Meghan Markle - Meghan Markle Will Not Sign a Prenup before the Royal Wedding", "description": "Will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry get a prenup before the royal wedding?
