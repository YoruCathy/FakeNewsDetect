The other coaches also tried to persuade Stevens to go with Clarkson, and basked in Shelton\u2019s disappointment. Clearly they play up this \u201cdrama\u201d for the show \u2014 although as Shelton took his losses in stride and joked about it on Twitter, there might have been some genuine frustration on his part.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetter whip my oxygen tank back out for @kelly_clarkson after that one. She definitely wore herself out tryin to be more country than me HA!!! Give her some time she\u2019ll recover. #VoicePremiere \u2014 Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton) February 27, 2018\n\nSo why was everyone determined to gang up on Shelton? As viewers know, Shelton has won the show six times, and four of those wins were with country singers. Shelton, one of the biggest stars in modern country music, is quite a draw for aspiring Nashville artists. But it\u2019s irritating to his fellow coaches, who frequently vent they never have a shot with great country singers, who eagerly choose Shelton during the blind audition process.\n\nIt\u2019s also annoying for the other coaches who want to bring their team members to victory, because country singers have an excellent chance of making it far on the show. Ever since \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d country music fans have enthusiastically voted on reality singing competitions. \u201cThe Voice\u201d is often criticized for not being able to produce stars, but the country acts who have won \u2014 Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradbery, Craig Wayne Boyd, Sundance Head \u2014 typically fare better than winners from other genres.\n\nAt a recent country radio conference in Nashville, when asked why country contestants do so well on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d the Swon Brothers (who landed in third place in Season 4) responded simply \u201cBlake Shelton.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got his phone number, we have stayed at his house, we have hunted at his house. There\u2019s a personal connection, he goes above and beyond,\u201d Colton Swon said. \u201cHe\u2019s been like a big brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he had our back when things got a little tricky,\u201d added his brother, Zach. The Swon Brothers got a record deal after \u201cThe Voice,\u201d though were later dropped, and are now releasing music independently.\n\nShelton\u2019s Music City connections have helped other team members; he gave Craig Wayne Boyd (Season 7 winner in 2014) a song he had been saving for his own catalogue, called \u201cMy Baby\u2019s Got a Smile On Her Face.\u201d Boyd\u2019s recording became the second song in history to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard country chart. Recently, Shelton took Sundance Head (Season 11 winner in 2016) with him on tour.\n\nAD\n\nSo it\u2019s no secret that Shelton will actively support a contestant\u2019s career, which makes him an appealing choice for auditioners. The show\u2019s producers obviously realize this as they amp up the drama, such as featuring Miley Cyrus\u2019s quest last season to beat Shelton and win with a country singer. (It backfired.) And this season, the coaches are banding together to prevent Shelton from hoarding all the Nashville hopefuls.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI blocked Blake. I did what I\u2019ve been waiting for!\u201d Keys said triumphantly after Kilgore went to Clarkson\u2019s team. \u201cJust the block alone gave me pleasure and satisfaction.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OR2G3CJK4EYSBHGP3YD5QUUP3U.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b1UsoVhuxyCHhgRDxVdqmRf55tA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2LTY3SMSU3FHJB4KEHZ42CMZ4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b1UsoVhuxyCHhgRDxVdqmRf55tA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2LTY3SMSU3FHJB4KEHZ42CMZ4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/02/28/blake-shelton-had-a-rough-time-on-the-voice-premiere-this-might-explain-why/", "title": "'The Voice' premiere: Everyone ganged up on Blake Shelton.
