Good PR is everything, and NeNe\u2019s antics don\u2019t always make that easy.\n\nThoughts on this rumor? Do you think NeNe is a hothead? Does NeNe need to change her ways to keep growing her fortune?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-80x80.png", "https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/THE-REAL-HOUSEWIVES-OF-ATLANTA-Kenya-Moore.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rhoa-kandiburruss-neneleakes.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/teresa-giudice-1.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jennifer-Aydin.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tamra-braunwyn.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nene-leakes.jpg?fit=580%2C326&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sheree-300x168.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bravocon-.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/180716_3762858_Did_Vicki_Gunvalson_Set_Up_Kelly_Dodd_s_Ex_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small-1.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RHONJ-season-10-gia-giudice-frank-catania-ava-tortorici-miss-teen-usa-nj.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/nene-leakes.jpg?fit=580%2C326&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allabouttrh.com/2018/03/02/nene-leakes-turned-weight-loss-spokesperson/", "title": "Was NeNe Leakes Turned Down As A Weight-Loss Spokesperson? - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Was NeNe Leakes Turned Down As A Weight-Loss Spokesperson? - The Real Housewives | News.
