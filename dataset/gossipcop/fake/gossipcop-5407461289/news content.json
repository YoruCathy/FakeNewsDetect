This is why she didn\u2019t share any bump pictures while she was pregnant. After Stormi was born, Kylie was the proudest mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t wait to show off Stormi to her fans. She posted pictures, because she was so excited to be a mom. Unfortunately, social media is a crazy place. People have been making nasty comments.\"\n\n\u201cKylie is shocked and doesn\u2019t want her daughter\u2019s pictures to be a part of something negative. She might reconsider in the future, but for now, she won\u2019t post any more photos of Stormi\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Kylie posted the below photo, which showed only part of Stormi's head, and when a commenter called her out on cropping out her daughter, she said \"yeah I cut my baby out. I\u2019m not sharing photos of my girl right now.\"\n\n\n\nThat's when fans noticed that Kylie had gone back and deleted old photos of Stormi, too.\n\n\n\nThe decision comes amid (very crazy and somewhat rude) rumors that Kylie's baby isn't actually Travis Scott's. In May, people on Instagram started taking pictures of Stormi's face and placing them next to photos of Kylie's former bodyguard Tim Chung, commenting on how similar the two looked. Tim denied the rumor via a statement on social media.\n\nAnd Kylie did her part when she posted a photo of her and Travis from the Met Gala with the caption \"Stormi's parents.\"\n\n\n\nSo it looks like that settles that, but prepare yourself for a Stormi picture drought with an end date TBD.\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Baty", "Emma Baty Is The Associate Entertainment Editor At Cosmopolitan Who Focuses On Movies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a21288807/why-kylie-jenner-wont-share-pictures-of-stormi/", "title": "Here's Why Kylie Jenner Decided to Stop Sharing Pictures of Stormi", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Here's Why Kylie Jenner Decided to Stop Sharing Pictures of Stormi", "description": "She's looking @ you, Instagram trolls.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a21288807/why-kylie-jenner-wont-share-pictures-of-stormi/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-06-12 06:54:30", "published_time": "2018-06-12 06:54:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Why Kylie Jenner Decided to Stop Sharing Pictures of Stormi - Kylie Jenner \"Nasty\" Comments on Stormi Instagrams", "description": "Kylie Jenner decided to stop sharing pictures of Stormi's face on social media because of the \"nasty\" comments she saw on pictures.", "keywords": "kylie jenner, travis scott, stormi webster, stormi jenner, stormi webster pics, why did kylie delete stormi pictures", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-12T18:54:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-leopard-dress-1528384488.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Here's Why Kylie Jenner Decided to Stop Sharing Pictures of Stormi", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528757640.0, "source": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
