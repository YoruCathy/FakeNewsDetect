While we can\u2019t all be household names, actresses, and committed philanthropists, Markle still has a down-to-earth side that makes her marriage to Prince Harry feel just a bit like a fairytale.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that everyone, royalty or not, has a bucket list (we\u2019d kill to see Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s) and Markle is no different. We\u2019ve found a few of Markle\u2019s future plans from her now-extinct blog\u2019s archives, as well as one bucket list item she\u2019s admitted to which has us eager for what\u2019s to come from Markle and Prince Harry (page 5).\n\nHer old blog gave us some insight\n\nMeghan used to run a blog called The Tig. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images Meghan used to run a blog called The Tig. | Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images\n\nUnbeknownst to many, Markle used to run the now-defunct lifestyle blog The Tig. Markle dedicated the blog to travel and food content and referred to it as a \u201chub for all things I find exciting.\u201d While The Tig is no more, a few blog posts still exist and offer an exclusive look into Markle\u2019s personality, her ambitions, and what she wants to accomplish in the future (page 4).\n\nShe turned her New Year\u2019s resolutions into a lifestyle\n\nMarkle is very down-to-earth. | Andrew Cowie/AFP/Getty Images Markle is very down-to-earth. | Andrew Cowie/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile we didn\u2019t gain access to Markle\u2019s 2018 New Year\u2019s resolutions, she wrote a blog post in 2016 about resolutions which shared some valuable intel on the future royal. You can apply them any year, at any time, as Markle intended. The resolutions she listed (we\u2019ll go over those next) coincide with her future goals as a member of the royal family.\n\nMarkle\u2019s bucket list, of sorts, is relatable and, unsurprisingly, as down-to-earth as the former actress and philanthropist appears. The following former resolutions and future hopes are unlike any another future royal family member has publicly made and may surprise you.\n\nShe\u2019s working on her language\n\nMarkle has been wanting to brush up on her French. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Markle has been wanting to brush up on her French. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nWhile Markle made it a goal to need the disclaimer \u2018Pardon my French\u2019 less frequently, she also wanted to become fluent in the language. \u201cRun a marathon. Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing. Re-learn French,\u201d Markle wrote, claiming that these resolutions made her list every single year.\n\nThe blog post marks the year she resolved to not have a resolution, reminding herself and readers that if it takes a couple years (rather than just one) to become fluent in French or stop swearing \u2014 that\u2019s OK. \u201cI often find myself wallowing in disappointment when I set a goal I can\u2019t achieve \u2026 And at 34 years old, I\u2019m over that.\u201d\n\nHer conclusion? Leave room for the magic\n\nMarkle was looking for the magic. | Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images Markle was looking for the magic. | Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe year of the post in question \u2014 2016 \u2014 also marks the year that Markle began dating Prince Harry. So, it\u2019s only appropriate that the only thing she aimed to do in the new year was \u201c\u2026 to approach life playfully. To laugh and enjoy, to keep my standards high but my level of self-acceptance higher.\u201d\n\nMarkle also took the advice of her Suits castmate and friend, Gina Torres, who told her, \u201cMeg \u2026 Make sure you leave room for magic.\u201d Markle took it upon herself to follow this advice, encouraging herself and those reading to set goals while remaining open to change and, of course, magic.\n\nShe wants kids\n\nKids are in their future. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Kids are in their future. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nIn 2016, Best Health Canada interviewed Markle about a few of her bucket list items for the future. While she listed growing The Tig and continuing acting (both of which Markle has ceased, at least for now, as she embarks on her royal journey), the one item that caught our eye wasn\u2019t career-oriented. \u201cOther bucket list items: I want to travel more and I can\u2019t wait to start a family, but in due time,\u201d Markle said.\n\nHarry seemed to be in agreement while talking to BBC\u2019s Mishal Husain in the couple\u2019s first joint interview. \u201cNot yet no,\u201d he said about having children, \u201cBut I think eventually, one step at a time, and we\u2019ll start a family in the near future.\u201d\n\nShe has checked off meeting the royal family\n\nMarkle feels right at home with the royal family. | Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images Markle feels right at home with the royal family. | Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd with flying colors at that. Markle, who had met Queen Elizabeth II \u201ca couple of times\u201d prior to the engagement, found the Queen to be \u201can incredible woman.\u201d Markle also became the first royal fiancee to spend the holiday with the queen before marrying into the royal family.\n\nBoth Markle and Prince Harry have made clear how important family is to them. \u201cHis family has been so welcoming,\u201d Markle said of the royal family, \u201c\u2026 it\u2019s been really important to me too \u2026 The family has been great and in the past year and a half, they\u2019ve made me feel a part of, not just the institution, but of a part of the family [sic].\u201d\n\nAs well as living out her dreams\n\nMarkle is free to live out her dreams. | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images Markle is free to live out her dreams. | Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMarkle announced her departure from Suits along with her engagement to Prince Harry and plans to focus on her philanthropic efforts in the future. In their first joint interview, Markle discussed her \u201ctransition\u201d out of her career as \u201cexciting,\u201d noting that she plans to focus more energy on the causes that have been important to her.\n\n\u201cYou realize that as you have access or a voice that people are willing to listen to, [it comes with] a lot of responsibility, which I take seriously,\u201d she said. Markle has prepared for her new chapter and is excited to work \u201cas a team\u201d with her husband\u2026 something the rest of the U.S. and the U.K. alike are excited to see pan out.\n\nFollow The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-880238024-640x475.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-883515276-1-640x426.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1-640x320.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-880230268-640x442.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1-640x320.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-898523210-640x446.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-and-Prince-Harry-640x461.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Meghan-Markle-640x427.jpg?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1-640x320.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Bleznak"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/meghan-markles-bucket-list-reveals-royals-surprising-to-dos.html/", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s Bucket List Reveals the Royal\u2019s Surprising To-Dos", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/meghan-markles-bucket-list-reveals-royals-surprising-to-dos.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "The royal's old blog reveals some of her future plans and what she hopes to accomplish.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle's Bucket List Reveals the Royal's Surprising To-Dos", "description": "The royal's old blog reveals some of her future plans and what she hopes to accomplish.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/meghan-markles-bucket-list-reveals-royals-surprising-to-dos.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "updated_time": "2018-05-21T22:53:04-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1-640x320.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1-640x320.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "royal family", "section": "Health & Fitness", "published_time": "2018-05-21T22:53:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-21T22:53:04-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The royal's old blog reveals some of her future plans and what she hopes to accomplish.", "title": "Meghan Markle's Bucket List Reveals the Royal's Surprising To-Dos", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/MeghanMarkle-1-640x320.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526957580.0, "source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
