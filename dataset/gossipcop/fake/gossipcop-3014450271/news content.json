Lady Gaga could land the most brutal hit of Super Bowl 51 on Donald Trump! Gaga is not a fan of the incoming president, and HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE scoop if she\u2019ll use her halftime show performance to attack Trump!\n\nFans better not expect Lady Gaga, 30, to pull a Meryl Streep, 67, and blast Donald Trump, 70, when she headlines the Super Bowl 51 Halftime show. Instead of focusing on how much she disagrees with Trump and his administration\u2019s policies, the Mother Monster will go in a different direction.\n\n\u201cLady Gaga is looking to show a message of peace and love with her performance at the Super Bowl,\u201d a source close to Gaga EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to alienate a portion of the audience and use her time to bash Donald Trump. It is her time in the spotlight and to her he doesn\u2019t need anymore press so she isn\u2019t going to focus her performance on him.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s make it clear \u2013 Gaga does not like Donald Trump and what he stands for. After Donald defeated Hillary Clinton, 69, in the presidential election, Gaga was one of the first protestors outside of Trump Tower in New York City. \u201cI want to live in a country of kindness where love trumps hate,\u201d she told her fans. It\u2019s safe to say that Gaga would join the growing number of artists who have flat-out refused to play Trump\u2019s inauguration. No \u201cBad Romance\u201d for Donald!\n\nWhile Gaga may not give any more attention to Trump with her Super Bowl performance, she might take her time in the spotlight to address another issue. Texas Republicans are hoping to pass Senate Bill 6, which would force \u201ctransgender Texans to use public bathrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth,\u201d according to Refinery29. This is similar to North Carolina\u2019s House Bill 2, which resulted in massive protests, including the NBA moving their All-Star game.\n\nSince Gaga is a supporter of pro-LGBT issues, there was talk that she\u2019d cancel her Super Bowl performance in protest of this discrimination (since the game is being held in Houston this year.) Instead, \u201cshe plans to make a statement of equality,\u201d a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. So, while she may not have her sights set on Donald, expect Gaga to use her Super Bowl spotlight to make a stunning statement!\n\nDo you think Gaga is making the right choice by not attacking Donald during the Super Bowl, HollywoodLifers?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/lady-gaga-superbowl-performance-attack-trump-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/lady-gaga-superbowl-performance-attack-trump-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F01%2F17%2Flady-gaga-attack-donald-trump-super-bowl-halftime-show%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2419920&comment_count=5", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/lady-gaga-superbowl-performance-attack-trump-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/01/17/lady-gaga-attack-donald-trump-super-bowl-halftime-show/", "title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s Super Bowl Performance: Will She Attack Donald Trump During Halftime Show?", "meta_data": {"description": "Forget about the NFL's linebackers.
