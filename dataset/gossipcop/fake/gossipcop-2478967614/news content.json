The teenager was declared missing after the tubing accident on 10 July last year and his body was recovered from the lake a day later.\n\nOn the anniversary of the accident Craig paid tribute to his late son by posting a picture of him on his Facebook page.", "images": ["https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/mail_icon.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587110408_385679_65_19841_11.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/tv.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/star-pages.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/top_ad_two.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/right-sidebar-assets/WeeWorld_TaylorLautner_300x250.jpg", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1095186612437188609/zQCnsPPe_normal.jpg", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1240994661323411456/9CeA8lPP_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/celebritytweets.jpg", "http://static.addtoany.com/buttons/share_save_171_16.png", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1226895461941940224/hBx6tZxz_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/favicon.ico", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587123003_382244_65_19842_3.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/top_ad_one.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/rss_icon.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/left-sidebar-assets/hottips.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/wenn_logo.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587110408_11680_65_19841_7.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/right-sidebar-assets/wennsfriends.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/music.gif", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/876792863459352577/SBLRu4VV_normal.jpg", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1214745123793166336/UnKmmw_G_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/mostrecentgalleries.png", "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1228069562014457857/vrSMEN5F_normal.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/news-article-controls/allnews.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587123005_377751_65_19842_11.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587123005_384698_65_19842_7.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/movies.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/tweet_icon.png", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/files_mf/cache/th_f700d9aae93ebcb0097e9d20cfdd7e7a_1499772603_wenn21277437_65_14423_2.jpg", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/news-lit.gif", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/plugins/magic-fields/thirdparty/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/wp-content/files_mf/1587110404_375055_65_19841_3.jpg&h=65", "https://blog.wenn.com/wp-content/themes/wenn/img/header-images/photos.gif"], "top_img": "https://blog.wenn.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://blog.wenn.com/all-news/craig-morgan-suing-life-jacket-maker-over-sons-death/", "title": "Craig Morgan Suing Life Jacket Maker Over Son\u2019s Death", "meta_data": {"bitly": {"url": "http://j.mp/2u42vZi"}, "og": {"url": "http://j.mp/2u42vZi"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://blog.wenn.com", "summary": ""}
