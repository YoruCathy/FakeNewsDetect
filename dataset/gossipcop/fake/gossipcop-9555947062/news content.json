You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be.\n\n\n\nLove who you want to love. That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) April 25, 2018\n\nmy wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don't agree with everything Trump does.
