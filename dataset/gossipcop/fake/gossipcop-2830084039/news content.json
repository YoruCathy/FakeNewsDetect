Mr. Sessions, who had been expected to move quickly to roll back the civil rights expansions put in place under his Democratic predecessors, wanted to act decisively because of two pending court cases that could have upheld the protections and pushed the government into further litigation.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23trans2/23trans2-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23TRANSsub/23TRANSsub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23trans3/23trans3-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23TRANSsub/23TRANSsub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/us/23TRANSsub/23TRANSsub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy W.
