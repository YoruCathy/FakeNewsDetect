Prince William had called the Queen to suggest that his wife \u2013 who is pregnant with their third child \u2013 scale back her royal duties permanently.\n\n\u2018Kate wants her public appearances kept to a minimum and he\u2019s 100% behind her\u2019 the source told the publication, adding that \u2018the conversation was quite icy.\u2019\n\nKate is reportedly more comfortable in her role as a full time mother to George (4) and Charlotte (2) than as a working royal. The Duchess of Cambridge is currently patron to a number of charities, including The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospice and Action on Addiction.\n\nBut according to Life & Style, \u2018the 91-year-old monarch was livid that the future Queen would want to lessen her duties.\u2019\n\nThe Queen\u2019s own experiences as a mother and working royal could be the reason she disapproves of Kate and Will\u2019s decision. She was 25 with two small children (Charles and Anne) when her father died and she ascended to the throne, and went on to have two more children (Andrew and Edward) after she was crowned, regularly leaving them at home with nursery staff while she went on official tours of the Commonwealth.\n\nIn his 1994 authorised biography, Prince Charles is said to have found his parents \u2019emotionally reserved.\u2019 It was the nursery staff who \u2018taught him to play, witnessed his first steps, punished and rewarded him, helped him put his first thoughts into words\u2019 the biography claimed.\n\nThis is not the first parenting style clash between the Queen and younger generations of the royal family. She reportedly disagreed with William\u2019s mother Diana\u2018s decision to take him on tour to Australia and New Zealand when he was nine months old. Diana was said to have found the idea of being apart from William too difficult.\n\nIn a clip from her 90th birthday celebrations last year the Queen was also seen telling William to \u2018get up\u2019 when the family appeared on the balcony to wave at crowds \u2013 he was crouching down to show George the planes doing a fly over.\n\nWilliam and Kate have already adopted a more modern attitude to parenting than their parents and grandparents, sending George to a local Montessori nursery in Norfolk and then onto Thomas\u2019s in Battersea, where he recently had his first day of school.", "images": ["https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/final-image-135x135.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2016/09/logo_marie-claire.svg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/queen-1-920x518.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/queen-1.jpg", "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2016/10/Placeholder-image-MC-1-oct.svg"], "top_img": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/queen-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucy Pavia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/people/queen-prince-william-argument-546822", "title": "Why The Queen Is Apparently 'Livid' With William And Kate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Following a heated phone conversation between the Queen and Prince William, Her Majesty is said to be 'livid' with her grandson", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why The Queen Is Apparently 'Livid' With William And Kate", "description": "Following a heated phone conversation between the Queen and Prince William, Her Majesty is said to be 'livid' with her grandson", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/entertainment/people/queen-prince-william-argument-546822", "site_name": "Marie Claire", "updated_time": "2017-10-25T12:06:42+01:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/queen-1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/queen-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1125}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaireUK/", "section": "People", "published_time": "2017-10-24T15:40:24+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-25T12:06:42+01:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Following a heated phone conversation between the Queen and Prince William, Her Majesty is said to be 'livid' with her grandson", "title": "Why The Queen Is Apparently 'Livid' With William And Kate", "site": "@marieclaireuk", "image": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2017/10/queen-1.jpg", "creator": "@marieclaireuk"}, "fb": {"pages": 157136240296}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://ksassets.timeincuk.net/wp/uploads/sites/46/2016/09/cropped-Black-M-favicon-270x270.png"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIIOAkmd7OM?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1508856024.0, "source": "http://www.marieclaire.co.uk", "summary": ""}
