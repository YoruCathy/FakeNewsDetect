I wanted that moment.'\n\nOne month after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s royal wedding, the Duchess\u2019 beloved father, Thomas Markle, is finally speaking out.\n\nIn a tell-all interview with Good Morning Britain, the Mexico resident opened up about his relationship with Prince Harry, his staged photo scandal, his heart condition and his biggest regrets after missing his daughter\u2019s special day.\n\nTo start off the talk, Pierce Morgan asked Thomas, 73, how he felt when Meghan, 36, told him she was dating Harry, 33.\n\n\u201cWell of course it\u2019s \u2018wow\u2019, it comes out as a \u2018wow\u2019 but you know this is my daughter. My daughter\u2019s certainly, certainly a prize for him as well,\u201d said Thomas.\n\n\u201cYeah he\u2019s great, he\u2019s an interesting guy, he\u2019s a prince, but my daughter\u2019s been a princess since the day she was born,\u201d he sweetly added.\n\nMeghan\u2019s dad then admitted that he\u2019s yet to meet Harry in person, but the two have shared various stimulating phone conversations over the past year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been over the phone,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe have yet to see each other face to face. We\u2019ve had interesting conversations on the phone. He\u2019s a smart guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talked a few times about Donald Trump and Brexit, things like that, and he\u2019s an interesting guy,\u201d Thomas continued. \u201cI was complaining I didn\u2019t like Donald Trump, he said \u2018give Donald Trump a chance.\u2019 I sort of disagreed with that, but I still like Harry. That was his politics, I have my politics.\u201d Thomas also touched on Harry\u2019s views about Brexit, saying the Prince seemed \u201copen to the experiment.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his first phone conversation with Harry, Thomas claimed it was all very casual and friendly.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018Hello Thomas\u2019 and I said \u2018Hi Harry\u2019 and it became a conversation back and forth mostly about politics. He was asking me how I was feeling that day and I was telling him how unhappy I was with the President,\u201d Thomas explained.\n\n\u201cWe talked a little bit about how they met and how happy they were with each other, and that was pretty much it for the first conversation.\u201d\n\nThe GMB host then asked Thomas at what point he knew Meghan would end up marrying the British monarch, and did he believe it was the right choice to wed the royal after her failed first marriage?\n\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s very intelligent. She knows how to choose who she wants to be with. She\u2019s a smart girl, and she made a good pick, didn\u2019t she?\u201d joked Thomas.\n\nHe then confirmed that Harry did in fact ask for his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage during one of their phone conversations.\n\n\u201cMeghan told me first, then a few times after that Harry got on the phone with Meghan, they called me together. Harry asked for her hand over the phone. I said, \u2018you\u2019re a gentleman, promise me you\u2019ll never raise your hand against my daughter, and of course I give you my permission.\u2019\u201d\n\nThomas later explained that he \u201chad no idea\u201d how much Meghan\u2019s new royal status would impact him and his entire family, but admitted that he will eventually get used to it.\n\n\u201cHaving the press at my door and everywhere I go, yeah that kind of became an invasion a little bit,\u201d he said, adding that although his other family members are \u201csomewhat disturbed,\u201d he feels that the attention is a \u201ccompliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy daughter is now seen all over the world as a Duchess, and I\u2019m very proud of her, and I\u2019ll adjust to this. I\u2019ll get over this,\u201d stated Thomas.\n\nSpeaking to Piers Morgan about Meghan\u2019s new royal rules and guidelines, Thomas claimed he didn\u2019t know how much she\u2019d have to change her lifestyle to fit into Harry\u2019s\u2014and neither did the former actress!\n\n\u201cAt the time I didn\u2019t realize that. I\u2019m not sure she even realized that. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very complicated. They royals\u2026 they\u2019re very complicated and it\u2019s a whole different lifestyle. But I think she could always rise to that occasion. My daughter\u2019s capable of everything, and she\u2019ll certainly be a compliment to the royal family.\u201d\n\nAt one point during the interview, Thomas came clean about his staged photo scandal, saying that it was a \u201cserious mistake\u201d but he did it because he wanted to change his image.\n\nThomas said all the other photos that were being taken of him were \u201cderogatory\u201d so he \u201cthought this was a nice way of improving my look. Obviously all that went to hell. I feel bad about it, I apologized for it, and that\u2019s all I can do. I can\u2019t do much beyond that\u2014but that was a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth Harry and Meghan were very forgiving about it,\u201d Thomas explained, adding that they \u201cabsolutely\u201d still wanted him at their wedding and he was \u201cvery excited\u201d to join them.\n\n\u201cMeghan said \u2018everything is ready for you,\u2019 Harry said \u2018I\u2019ve got one of my military friends to take care of you when you\u2019re here.\u2019 It was all set up, it was fine.\u201d\n\nExplaining why he didn\u2019t end up going to the royal wedding after all, Thomas said: \u201cThe truth is that I couldn\u2019t get over the fact that that had happened. All that stuff was working on me, I\u2019ve got a bit of a heart condition. This pushed me a little further to the point where I had heart palpitations. I had to drive at two in the morning to Rosarito to a hospital, and they sent me to another little hospital, and then they sent me to a bigger hospital, Rosarito General Hospital and\u2026 a heart attack.\u201d\n\nHe said that the hospital stabilized him and after a day and a half he told the nurses he felt much better and wanted to check out because he didn\u2019t want to miss the wedding. \u201cI thought I was better, I thought I felt really good,\u201d Thomas recalled. Unfortunately, his condition worsened and he had to undergo heart surgery days later.\n\nBefore his operation, he told Meghan he would not be able to make it. \u201cMeghan cried,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cThey were disappointed but they both said, \u2018take care of yourself were really worried about you.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn the days leading up to Meghan and Harry\u2019s May 19 wedding, a friend of Thomas helped him rent an apartment. He stayed there for about three nights to rest and recover. It is also where he ended up watching his daughter\u2019s gorgeous ceremony.\n\nWhen learning Prince Charles would be the one to walk Meghan down the aisle, Thomas \u201cwas honored. I can\u2019t think of a better replacement than someone like Prince Charles. He looked very handsome and my daughter looked beautiful with him. I was jealous, I wish I had been there. I wish it had been me, but thank God he was there, and thank him for that.\u201d\n\nSeeing his daughter marry the love of her life, Thomas couldn\u2019t help but get emotional.\n\n\u201cShe was beautiful. It was incredible watching her. I cried a little bit about it. But she was so beautiful walking down that aisle and so proud and so gorgeous. I was very proud, I couldn\u2019t have seen a better moment in my life. I was very upset that it wasn\u2019t me, but the whole world was watching my daughter. I was very happy about that,\u201d Thomas added.\n\nDespite the fact that he\u2019s doing well and feels incredibly happy for his daughter, Thomas still has some deep regrets.\n\n\u201cThe unfortunate thing for me now, is that I\u2019m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history, rather than the dad walking her own the aisle, so that upsets me somewhat,\u201d he told Piers Morgan.\n\n\u201cIt was a very emotional moment\u2026 I regretted it because I really wanted to walk my daughter down the aisle. I wanted that moment. But I\u2019m thankful for everything the way it went.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of Thomas Markle\u2019s tell-all interview?
