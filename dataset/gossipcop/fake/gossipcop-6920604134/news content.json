This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.

We're not entirely sure why Jen would go back to Brad, who reportedly cheated on her with Angelina Jolie, after all these years, but each to their own.\n\nRead next The Beauty Hype: I was one of the first Beauty Directors in the UK to trial Drunk Elephant\u2019s Hair & Body range \u2013 here\u2019s what happened Hair Products The Beauty Hype: I was one of the first Beauty Directors in the UK to trial Drunk Elephant\u2019s Hair & Body range \u2013 here\u2019s what happened Luxe hair in isolation.\n\nJustin and Jen's split\n\nDespite speculation that the couple was in trouble after Brad and Angelina called it quits in September 2016, Jen and Justin stuck it out for over another year, but their relationship has sadly now come to an end.\n\nSo what were the reasons behind the split? Well, according to reports, their main disagreement was about where they should live.\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight that Justin couldn't hack living in Hollywood and that Jen wouldn't give up her privacy to live in New York.\n\n\"He much prefers being [in New York] and that's been a major issue for them for a long time. Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they're not all 'in the industry. He's friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It's an eclectic group and he doesn't have that type of network in LA.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nRead next 15 times Rachel, Monica and even Gunther wore outfits that inspired our current wardrobes Jennifer Aniston 15 times Rachel, Monica and even Gunther wore outfits that inspired our current wardrobes Yes, even our WFH looks.\n\nJen's hounded by paparazzi everywhere she goes, whereas Justin can still travel about relatively unnoticed, which of course, posed an issue for them.\n\n\"Justin can hop on his [motorcycle], walk in the neighbourhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her. He really wanted her to be comfortable [in New York]. He even negotiated with the paps to make a deal that they would only shoot her once per day and then leave her alone. He also agreed to move out of his apartment, which he loves.\"\n\nThey then apparently moved into an apartment in the West Village, but it just wasn't working. The location of a park across the road provided paps with the ideal location to snap Jen as she came and went from her home. This also irked the neighbours, adding more tension to the drama.\n\n\"...What really pissed off the neighbours was just the constant commotion outside their door all the time with the photographers. It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbours weren't happy.\"\n\nThen, it gets weird, with a tidbit known as 'the bologna incident'. Apparently, Justin came downstairs one day to find that his motorcycle had been covered in slices of bologna (Italian sausage to you and I), and Jen was convinced that the neighbours had done it. It almost seems too farfetched to be untrue, to be honest, but we'll let you make your own mind up.\n\nRead next Selena Gomez is bringing back the \u2018Rachel\u2019 cut Selena Gomez Selena Gomez is bringing back the \u2018Rachel\u2019 cut Alexa, play the Friends theme song.\n\nDespite their differences, the couple really wanted it to work. The source concluded,\n\n\"She just never really could get settled in, she wasn't happy [in New York]. They really were a great couple. And they cared a lot about each other. Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.\"\n\nHere's a look back on their relationship...\n\nTheir meeting\n\nAfter her five-year marriage ended to Brad Pitt in 2005, Jennifer Aniston became the poster girl for single women everywhere.\n\nShe dated several high profile celebrities including Vince Vaughn, Paul Sculfor, John Mayer and Bradley Cooper and finally found love again falling for Justin Theroux.\n\nRead next Ummmm, is Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet going to be in the Friends reboot?!

Nothing happened for three years although she admitted even then he had made an impression on her.\n\nShe told Popsugar: \"I thought he was very sweet and he was always very nice.\"\n\n\"But I remember thinking he was very dark. At first, you think he could be like a serial killer, but he is actually the nicest person in the world.\"\n\nSecond chance\n\nThe pair got a second shot at romance when they were filming Wanderlust in 2010 together. Justin was still dating stylist Heidi Bivens but the pair became good friends.\n\nThey were spotted together in May 2011 before they took their relationship public in June at the MTV Movie Awards afterparty.\n\nRead next Why, sixteen years since it left our screens, are we still so obsessed with Friends?
