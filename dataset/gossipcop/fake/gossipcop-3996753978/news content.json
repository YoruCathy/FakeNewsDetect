Photo: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images\n\nKim Kardashian just wants her sisters to be happy and healthy, which is why she\u2019s wishing for the end of Khlo\u00e9\u2019s relationship with her cheating boyfriend and baby daddy, Tristan Thompson. According to the Hollywood Life, Kim is \u201ccounting down the days\u201d until Khlo\u00e9 and baby True get the hell out of Cleveland and return home to Calabasas.\n\nEver since news broke that Tristan had cheated on Khlo\u00e9, just days before she gave birth to their daughter, reports about Khlo\u00e9\u2019s well-being have been contradictory: Does she feel like she\u2019s \u201cliving in hell?\u201d Is she trying to make things work? Is she lying about everything?\n\nOne person who has been explicit and steadfast in her sentiments is her sister Kim, who last month called the whole scenario \u201cfucked up.\u201d And, according to a source close to the Kardashians who spoke to Hollywood Life, Kim\u2019s feelings haven\u2019t changed.\n\n\u201cKim is counting down the days \u2019til Khloe gets her shit together and kicks Tristan to the curb,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving Kim insane that Khloe is still with Tristan because she deserves so much more. But Kim knows that she can\u2019t tell Khloe what to do \u2014 she has to make that decision alone.\u201d\n\nThe source also revealed that Kim has been trying to convince Khlo\u00e9 to go to \u201cintensive therapy\u201d to help her with her \u201cchronically low self-esteem.\u201d\n\nThe source continued, \u201cUntil she fixes that issue, she\u2019s going to continue to fall in love with men that aren\u2019t emotionally available and giving.\u201d\n\nWhich reminds us \u2026 how are things going for Kim and Kanye?", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/27/27-kim-khloe.w330.h412.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/27/27-kim-khloe.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/27/27-kim-khloe.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Arnold"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/kim-kardashian-wants-khloe-to-leave-tristan-thompson-report.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian Apparently Can\u2019t Wait Until Khlo\u00e9 Leaves Tristan Thompson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Apparently Can\u2019t Wait Until Khlo\u00e9 Leaves Tristan Thompson", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/05/kim-kardashian-wants-khloe-to-leave-tristan-thompson-report.html", "description": "She\u2019s reportedly \u201ccounting down the days.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/27/27-kim-khloe.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Wants Khlo\u00e9 to Leave Tristan Thompson: Report", "description": "She\u2019s reportedly \u201ccounting down the days.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/05/27/27-kim-khloe.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aMandolinz", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-27T16:51:46.752Z", "tag": "celebrity, culture, khloe kardashian, kim kardashian, tristan thompson, drama", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Kim Kardashian is reportedly \u201ccounting down the days\u201d until Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian leaves Tristan Thompson, who was caught cheating on Khlo\u00e9 just days before she gave birth to their daughter, True Thompson.", "sailthru.tags": "celebrity, culture, khloe kardashian, kim kardashian, tristan thompson, drama", "author": "Amanda Arnold", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527439906.752, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
