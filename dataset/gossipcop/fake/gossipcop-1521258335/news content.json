The two powerhouse vocalists rose to fame thanks to their runs on early Idol seasons, and now they're ready to share their singing competition expertise for a second time around on The Voice this fall.\n\nHudson first lead \"Team JHud\" in season 13, but left the following season along with coach Miley Cyrus, making way for the return of Alicia Keys and Clarkson's debut. The longtime friends seemed more than excited to compete not only against each other in the upcoming season, but also against fellow coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, who have reprised their roles each season since the show began. Season 14 of The Voice is currently in the home stretch, with the semifinal round scheduled to air Monday (May 14).\n\nClarkson and Hudson took over each other's Twitter accounts yesterday (May 10) to share the exciting news. Watch their giddy announcements below, and tune in to The Voice Mondays at 9 p.m. on NBC.", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Kelly-Clarkson-and-Jennifer-Hudson-on-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?5483f7d85ab28d1d2c44"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Kelly-Clarkson-and-Jennifer-Hudson-on-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8455548/kelly-clarkson-jennifer-hudson-returning-the-voice-season-15", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & Jennifer Hudson Are Returning to Coach 'The Voice' Season 15", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-05-11T10:04:45-04:00", "published_time": "2018-05-11T08:04:32-04:00"}, "description": "Season 15 of 'The Voice' will feature twice the 'American Idol' power, thanks to the just-announced returns of coaches Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson.", "og": {"description": "Season 15 of 'The Voice' will feature twice the 'American Idol' power, thanks to the just-announced returns of coaches Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Kelly-Clarkson-and-Jennifer-Hudson-on-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Kelly Clarkson & Jennifer Hudson Are Returning to 'The Voice' Season 15 | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8455548/kelly-clarkson-jennifer-hudson-returning-the-voice-season-15", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Kelly Clarkson & Jennifer Hudson Are Returning to Coach 'The Voice' Season 15", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Season 15 of 'The Voice' will feature twice the 'American Idol' power, thanks to the just-announced returns of coaches Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Kelly-Clarkson-and-Jennifer-Hudson-on-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & Jennifer Hudson Are Returning to Coach 'The Voice' Season 15", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526040272.0, "source": "http://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
