Fresh off the news that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are getting divorced\u2014which you might have heard; it was written up in a few periodicals yesterday and will possibly be covered today as well\u2014Us Weekly is reporting that notoriously private couple Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes are married. Not only did they allegedly tie the knot, they may have done so earlier this year. They\u2019re newlyweds, and have been for quite some time.\n\n\u201cMultiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly\u201d that Gosling and \u201chis love of five years, Eva Mendes, quietly tied the knot earlier this year among a small group of family and friends.\u201d Another source goes on to say that, \u201cEva and Ryan have always felt like a married couple. . . . They are infatuated with each other.\u201d\n\nAnonymous sources live for getting Shakespearean-sonnet levels of romantic when describing two people\u2019s love for one another. We assume Us cut the part where the source compared Mendes and Gosling\u2019s love to a summer\u2019s day, saying it\u2019s more lovely and more temperate.\n\nGosling and Mendes have always been extremely private about their relationship. They met on the set of 2012\u2019s The Place Beyond the Pines and have since had two daughters together. They welcomed Esmeralda Amada in September 2014 and Amada Lee in April 2016.\n\n\u201cAll of them are doing amazing. I\u2019m a lucky man; they really make me better,\u201d Gosling recently told Us Weekly at TIFF when asked about his life with Mendes and their two daughters. No one thought to ask, \u201cHey, Ryan, did you by any chance get married this year?,\u201d though, so for that, we\u2019ll have to rely on TMZ to get his tax returns. Just kidding, TMZ; please do not track down Ryan Gosling\u2019s taxes. We\u2019re content with this report from Us Weekly about the mere idea that he and Mendes might be married right now, because Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are working towards the legal dissolution of theirs.\n\nVF.com has reached out to representatives for Gosling and Mendes and will update this story when more information becomes available.", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5751a7b332e71e9407a50aa5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss02-secret-celebrity-babies-Matthew-Rhys-Keri-Russell.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57a0bc8b8c5707890d110929/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/eva-mendes.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5873a837ee23284912086608/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/donald-glover-baby.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5731dbff76585bd84561c056/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5751a76832e71e9407a50aa3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-secret-celebrity-babies-Ryan-Gosling-Eva-Mendes.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57471e4e55f979a31fa98a12/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/contributor-vf-web-lauren-levine.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5751a7b332e71e9407a50aa6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss01-secret-celebrity-babies-Ryan-Gosling-Eva-Mendes.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Le Vine", "Lauren Le Vin", "Hilary Weave", "Julie Mille"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-married", "title": "Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Did Not Get Married [Updated]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Lauren Le Vine", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Contrary to reports, Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes aren\u2019t newlyweds.", "id": "57e27be80a8ec0db67d1fdbc", "keywords": "celebrity,ryan gosling,eva mendes,vanities", "news_keywords": "celebrity,ryan gosling,eva mendes,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "57e27be80a8ec0db67d1fdbc", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Contrary to reports, Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes aren\u2019t newlyweds.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Contrary to reports, Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes aren\u2019t newlyweds.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Did Not Get Married [Updated]", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/ryan-gosling-eva-mendes-married"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Contrary to reports, Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes aren\u2019t newlyweds.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e27b551e9e7cc118c4590d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes Did Not Get Married [Updated]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
