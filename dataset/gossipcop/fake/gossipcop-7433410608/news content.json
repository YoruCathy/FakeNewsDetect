Above, Drake in 2015 in New York. Carlo Allegri/Reuters\n\nHey Slate Music Clubbers,\n\nGlad to be back in conversation with you, as always. You feel like home to me.\n\nThere\u2019s a one-story building right next door to the downtown Manhattan apartment I\u2019ve called home for more than a decade, and it\u2019s been scheduled for demolition for several years. A shiny new high rise is supposed to take its place, and it threatens to forever block my sunny views in exchange for years of construction-generated dust, ash, and noise that will make daily living something of a nightmare for me. I live in a posh neighborhood, so this may be no more than a Champagne problem. But it still feels like my home, my living sanctuary, is imperiled. Demolition started this summer: I\u2019ve been peering out of the window every day to watch construction workers sporting asbestos-protecting hazmat suits jackhammer steel beams and turn concrete into rubble. But the destruction\u2014hopefully not toxic for my health and that of my neighbors\u2014is excruciatingly slow with no definitive end date in sight. Watching things fall apart in slo-mo and get torn to shreds outside my window on a daily basis has left me in a yearlong state of prolonged dread and nerve-wracking uncertainty.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking of that impending calamity next door as a metaphor for what we\u2019ve all been writing about as a terrible year\u2014a year that could, in turn, signal an imminently catastrophic future. We\u2019ve all been reminded that things don\u2019t necessarily get better\u2014they could just as easily fall apart in light of the tectonic shift that was the U.S. election and similar referendums in Britain, Colombia, and Italy as well as burgeoning right-wing populist movements in Germany, France, and Austria (to name a few). All this socio-political upheaval unfolded in the midst of mass-mediated smoke bombs of disinformation and fake news that has left many of us sometimes unable to properly parse out the difference between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.\n\nCalamity this year tasted like toxic water in Flint, Michigan; it felt like the rumble of the deadly Italian earthquake and the swoosh of devastating Hurricane Matthew that brutalized Haiti and the Southern U.S. It was North Korea\u2019s brazen nuclear tests; it was the tumbling to earth of EgyptAir Flight 804; it was grisly suicide bombings in Belgium and Lahore, Pakistan; and it was mounting carnage in Aleppo, Syria; Turkey; Nice, France; and Berlin. It was refugees on the run; it was microcephaly-carrying mosquitos in South America; it was extreme summer ice loss at the poles signaling ecological disaster. Dread infused the police standoffs in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the water cannoning of protesters at Standing Rock. And we watched as dread turned to doom on the heels of the worst mass shooting in American history at Orlando\u2019s Pulse nightclub. After a particularly corrosive American election year, it\u2019s hard to still believe in inclusive democracy and not also feel as if the social world itself is under demolition. It\u2019s also important, and surely instructive, for all of us who live in hyperdeveloped nations to come to terms with the fact that our growing sense of impending disaster is the way many people\u2014whether they\u2019re residing in Chad and Cuba or in Palestine or in Bosnia\u2014have long been living.\n\nNaturally, pending calamity spilled into pop: Dylan\u2019s hard rain, memorably covered by a nervous Patti Smith at the Nobel Prize ceremony, seems to have fallen a long time ago, and we\u2019ve really just spent the year doing clean-up in Aisle 2. Everyone\u2019s already noted the stacking body count of iconic boomer-era musicians such as Prince, Sharon Jones, Pauline Oliveros, and Leonard Cohen, but you could feel teeming dread in James Blake\u2019s unredeemably gloomy The Colour in Anything, in Japanese Breakfast\u2019s mournful Psychopomp, in the damaged relationships of Frank Ocean\u2019s solipsistic releases Endless and Blond(e), in the creepy tenseness of Radiohead\u2019s A Moon Shaped Pool, and in Anonhi\u2019s tellingly titled Hopelessness. Bowie courageously chose to confront his own imperiled morality in swan-song Blackstar, and a dressed-down Lady Gaga (who admitted to suffering from PTSD and lingering effects of sexual abuse) mourned the death of her aunt in the acoustic title track from Joanne\u2014the album also included Trayvon Martin\u2013inspired \u201cAngel Down,\u201d with its singularly exposed opening line, \u201cI confess I am lost in the Age of the Social.\u201d\n\nThe seemingly unceasing police killings of unarmed black civilians such as Terence Crutcher were met with the profoundly symbolic refusal of quarterback Colin Kaepernick to stand during the U.S. national anthem, but you could also find a related musical defiance in the who-needs-a-record-label, gospel-jubilant wondrousness of Chance the Rapper\u2019s Coloring Book and in rapper-next-door J. Cole\u2019s wisened 4 Your Eyez Only. You could find powerful refusal in Against Me\u2019s acid takedown of the TSA\u2019s trans-unfriendly airport security body-scanners in \u201cProVision L-3,\u201d a track that inhabits the same universe as Swet Shop Boys\u2019 sharp commentary on airport racial profiling in \u201cT5.\u201d And reunited Native Tonguers A Tribe Called Quest, mourning the cataclysmic loss of member Phife Dawg, brilliantly vomited back up Donald Trump\u2013era distress on urgent \u201cWe The People\u2026.\u201d: \u201cAll you black folks, you must go/ All you Mexicans, you must go /And all you poor folks, you must go/ Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways/ so all you bad folks, you must go.\u201d To Ann\u2019s point about nobody listening to each other in our filter-bubble era, it seems that not only is civility out the door, but maybe humanity is hosting its own funeral, too. It may be musicians who can best help bring us back from the dead.\n\nJulianne notes that black women in pop had a productive year: Yup, sistas continued to lead the way by holding forth the optimistic promise of redemption from the trauma of things falling apart. As Carl and Chris note, Beyonc\u00e9 won the day in Lemonade, especially in the way she offered up therapeutic forgiveness and sorority as solutions after domestic trauma/drama caused by a cheating partner. Jamila Woods\u2019 Heavn and Solange\u2019s A Seat at the Table both illuminated the need for self-care in an exhausting culture of racial microaggressions. Laura Mvula worked through the calamity of a recent divorce in the astounding The Dreaming Room, and Algerian-born Aziza Brahim, raised in refugee camps, soothed with spiritual renewal for the exiled on her gorgeous, pastel Abbar el Hamada. Julianne, thank you for giving props to Dawn Richard: It\u2019s no surprise that her startling 2016 album is called Redemption, given that one of its key songs, \u201cLazarus,\u201d shares its title with Bowie\u2019s dirge. Both tunes are differing meditations on themes of reincarnation and the afterlife.\n\nIdentity politics themselves\u2014wildly uncool in pop not all that long ago\u2014continued their own Lazarus rise from the ashes in 2016. Intersectionality was the year\u2019s overused buzzword\u2014it\u2019s little more than a 21st-century reboot of DuBois\u2019 concept of double consciousness and multiple embodied identities. No surprise that Barry Jenkins\u2019 tender if somewhat problematic film Moonlight, with its focus on the vicissitudes of black gay existence, is the critically praised movie of the year.\n\nPop music in 2016 showed us that intersectionality, at its progressive best, helps us transcend nihilist-conservative threats that aim to rip the social fabric to shreds. Tattooed ex\u2013boy bander Zayn Malik delivered a brash solo debut that includes \u201cIntermission: Flower,\u201d an R&B prayer sung in mellifluous Urdu (and Zayn is also the title subject of a song on Swet Shop Boys\u2019 Cashmere): We\u2019ve never heard anything exactly like it on a pop album. Full-length projects by Mykki Blanco, Cakes da Killa, and Kaytranada continue to clear space for queer people of color in the pop universe. Intersectionality emerges as a potent political project in Mexican Camilo Lara\u2019s incisive Morrissey/The Smiths tribute band Mexrissey, in the deconstructionist dancehall of Equiknoxx\u2019s Bird Sound Power, and in Saul Williams\u2019 slept-on and rage-filled MartyrLoserKing, which orbits around a fictional story of a Burundi hacker. Intersectionality also powers the softer, politically infused electronics of Chilean American DJ Nicolas Jaar and Senegalese Kuwaiti musician Fatima Al Qadiri, and you hear it in the danceable cosmo-rhythms of Lisbon\u2019s DJ Marfox and Berlin\u2019s Africaine 808. In 2016, musicians claiming intersectional identities no longer have to leave parts of themselves on the editing room floor in an effort to achieve crossover success\u2014as they often had to in the prestreaming age when physical record sales mattered much more than they do now.\n\nThe reactionary pushback in 2016 against undocumented immigrants and refugees of various stripes is part of an ongoing movement to consolidate white supremacy in a moment where demographics are shifting as never before. I\u2019d also like to consider this year\u2019s ratcheted-up anti-woman and anti-trans hostility as an attempt to reconsolidate cis-male supremacy as it too dwindles in power and relevance. The global right turn to reclaiming of power for the already privileged is in some ways a populist rejection of the social and economic changes that globalization, over the past several decades, has wrought: It\u2019s a bristling rejection of the loss and blurring of identity boundaries and borders and a repudiation of the ideal of racial, ethnic, and gender pluralism. The U.S. election, as savvy critics have wisely noted, was in large part about white voters asserting their whiteness, above and beyond other aspects of their identity: One way to sum it up is to consider it a rejection of intersectionality itself. In a year dominated by reactionary white dudes from Trump to Vladimir Putin to Nigel Farage to Steve Bannon to Peter Thiel, now-convicted mass murder Dylann Roof closes out 2016 as the worst of the lot: His is the face of a unrepentant, gun-toting genocidal racist desperately hoping to roll back the social progress of the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nI hope Roof and his ilk do not win the war we\u2019re currently fighting. I love that in a year defined by looming cataclysm, the song of the summer was Drake\u2019s \u201cOne Dance.\u201d Besides being sung by biracial Canadian Drizzy and U.K. pop singer Kyla, the track was concocted by Nigerian Afrobeat rapper WizKid and South African afro-house producer DJ Maphorisa alongside Jamaican Canadian producer Nineteen85 of Dvsn and Lebanese Irish Canadian producer Noah \u201c40\u201d Shebib. In some ways, \u201cOne Dance\u201d unassumingly flies directly in the face of Roof\u2019s refusal of pluralism and intersectional identity as the future of planetary humanity.\n\nPop music by itself will never displace the essential work white people need to do to dismantle global white supremacy. It\u2019s never going to displace the work that men like me need to do to dismantle toxic masculinity. It\u2019s no substitute for the work that all of us in developed nations need to do to roll back the toxic effects of hundreds of years of violent, destructive settler colonialism. But what pop music can do is to provide a blueprint for inclusivity and wholeness that can in turn disable the inward-facing retreat to xenophobia and nationalism that imperils us all. Pop, at its best, can represent a building up of possibility to come together rather than a catastrophic demolition and tearing down. That\u2019s why we need it more than ever.\n\nWe shall overcome.\n\n\u201cWhen your heart is broken down, down, down, and your head don\u2019t reach the sky/ Take your broken wings and fly,\u201d\n\nJason\n\nMy Favorite Albums of 2016\n\n1.
