How much of it is true?Know more about their Relationship Share this\n\nNicole Kidman who is an Australian actress and film producer and Keith Urban who is a New Zealand-born Australian-American country musician got married which is the obvious thing. They got married on Christmas Eve 1990 in Telluride, Colorado.\n\nThe couple has been enjoying the married life and still going strong. They have been publicly seen and have shown their love for each other. They have two daughters together and lives happily as a family.\n\nHowever, since Nicole has starred on the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d there has been a lot of rumor going around about Keith Being jealous and upset.\n\nRumor of the Separation\n\nThere has been a rumor going on about Keith being upset with Nicole for the Sex scene in the TV series Big Little Lies (BLL). There were many sites who claimed this news to be true as well. They have been using a certain source to make them correct. Let\u2019s see how much of this rumor is true!\n\nAccording to the National Enquirer, the country singer is troubled by his wife\u2019s many racy sex scenes with Alexander Skarsgard, who plays her husband on the show.\n\nA so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine,\n\n\u201cKeith must be going nuts with jealousy watching his wife expose her naked body to another actor, and the world!\u201d\n\nAn insider adds,\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in showbiz, too, so he knows there are things you have to do sometimes, but it can\u2019t be easy for him.\u201d\n\nFake News Viral\n\nThere are many sites likewise who have confused many fans of the star by giving the false report. There have been many cases where the news are made so believable but actually, all of it is fake.\n\nFor this kind of site, there is Gossip cop which always finds the source and corrects all of these fake news. For this news as well Gossip cop has found that Keith Urban is NOT upset about Nicole Kidman\u2019s sex scenes on the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d despite a made-up tabloid report.\n\nHowever, in a trustworthy source close to the situation assures us that Urban isn\u2019t at all distressed about the show\u2019s sexually explicit content.\n\nIn fact, when Kidman was asked by E! News last month about her husband\u2019s reaction to her sex scenes, the actress responded,\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an artist, so he knows that the work is the work.\u201d\n\nAfter all this, still, those sites are feeding that fake news. They are celebrities and it\u2019s their work. It is understandable as her husband Keith is also an artist.\n\nAdditionally, Gossip Cop already busted the Enquirer for a similarly bogus report published last year when \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d was still in production. At the time, the publication falsely claimed that Urban was upset about Kidman\u2019s on-set kiss with Alexander Skarsgard, but there was no truth to the story then, and it isn\u2019t accurate now.\n\nSimilar Report\n\nWhen BLL was currently in the process there was similar news about Keith being \u201cHeartBroken\u201d over Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgard kissing on the set of a TV show, which we already know that it just false news. But despite both being professional actors in a scripted romance, the National Enquirer is trying to create real-life drama.\n\nOne of the sources tells the tabloid,\n\n\u201cKeith will be heartbroken\u2026 Though they were [kissing] on set, there\u2019s no denying the intense connection that grew between Nicole and Alexander. Given her and Keith\u2019s problems, I worry that this will put their marriage into a tailspin.\u201d\n\nThe magazine\u2019s insider goes on to claim that during some takes, Kidman and Skarsgard would keep kissing \u201cpast the director\u2019s call to \u2018cut!\u2019\u201d\n\nFirst of all, there are no \u2018problems\u2019 in Kidman and Urban\u2019s marriage. Gossip Cop has repeatedly called out the Enquirer for trying to create a non-existent rift between the two, who remain happily married month after month following these false claims.\n\nIt was again debunked by the Gossip Cop as the news was false. As they are happy and there is no situation causing marriage trouble, despite a ridiculous tabloid report.\n\nShort info on Big Little Lies\n\nBig Little Lies is a novel which is written by Liane Moriarty.
