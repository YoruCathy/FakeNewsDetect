He opens up on the topic a bit more in the New York Times interview, when asked about the song.\n\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve thought about killing myself all the time. It\u2019s always a option and [expletive],\u201d he says in the interview. \u201cLike Louis C.K. said: \u2018I flip through the manual. I weigh all the options.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just having this epiphany now, \u2019cause I didn\u2019t do it, but I did think it all the way through. But if I didn\u2019t think it all the way through, then it\u2019s actually maybe more of a chance of it happening.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ap_162777155677771.jpg?w=1024&h=769", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ap_162777155677771.jpg?w=1024&h=769", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jim Harrington", "Pop Music Writer", "Jim Harrington Is The Pop Music Critic For The Bay Area News Group.
