Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?\n\nIn the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, \u201cJen To Justin: I\u2019ll Raise Our Baby Alone!\u201d followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston\u2019s marriage is \u201con the rocks,\u201d and she is planning to be a single mom.\n\n?\u2026\u2764\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT\n\n\u201cPrivately, she has told friends that she\u2019s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she\u2019s vowed to raise the baby alone,\u201d tells the insider.\n\nBut then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn\u2019t right with this claim.\n\nBut many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.\n\nThis is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn\u2019t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.\n\nAniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one\u2019s business whether or not she has a baby.\n\nJennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people\u2019s choices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is right for her, may not be right for someone else; and, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlynn-Carter-BoxClue.com_-300x199.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/melissa-etheridge-angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-jennifer-aniston-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Jennifer-Aniston-And-Justin-Theroux-Finally-Ready-For-A-Baby-Inside-The-Reports-They-Hired-A-Surrogate.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5d6534336f24eb08dc37b826-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Aniston-John-Mayer-Still-Have-A-Nice-Friendship-More-Than-A-Decade-After-Their-Split-Claims-Insider-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/corey-feldman-and-corey-haim-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-vz.cnwimg.com--300x237.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Aniston-LATimes.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Outlander-Season-3-Episode-8-Spoilers-Claire-And-Jenny-Reunite-In-New-Photos-700x466.jpg"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Jennifer-Aniston-And-Justin-Theroux-Finally-Ready-For-A-Baby-Inside-The-Reports-They-Hired-A-Surrogate.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Lisa Legrano", "J.
