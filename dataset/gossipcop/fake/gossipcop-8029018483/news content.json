I know it's a funny thing.\"\n\nWeisz had also gushed to Redbook last year that she and the Wrestler filmmaker were committed \"until death do us part\" although no official vows had been exchanged.\n\nSomewhere along the line things changed.\n\nNotably, there have been rumors about Weisz and Daniel Craig. She and the 007 star allegedly did some serious Bond-ing while working on the film Dream House earlier this year, though neither has confirmed any romance.\n\nAs for Aronofsky and Weisz, the couple had been planning to reteam (they previously worked together on 2005's sci-fi flick The Fountain) on a biopic of Jackie Kennedy, but that project no longer is listed on either's IMDb credits.\n\nThe couple plan to share custody of Henry and continue to raise him in New York.", "images": ["http://www.eonline.com/resources/newsletter/images/newsletter_sticky_check.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1611373942516879&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010109/300.weisz.arofonsky.lc.110910.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "http://www.eonline.com/resources/customSocialBar/images/twitter.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1007010875/?value=0&label=y3zzCL2IiwgQu4iX4AM&guid=ON&script=0", "http://www.eonline.com/resources/customSocialBar/images/Facebook_hover.png", "http://www.eonline.com/resources/customSocialBar/images/email_hover.png", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010109/300.weisz.arofonsky.lc.110910.jpg?fit=around|600:315&crop=600:315;center,top&output-quality=90"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010109/300.weisz.arofonsky.lc.110910.jpg?fit=around|600:315&crop=600:315;center,top&output-quality=90", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/210234/rachel-weisz-splits-with-darren-aronofsky-does-daniel-craig-figure-in", "title": "Rachel Weisz Splits With Darren Aronofsky\u2014Does Daniel Craig Figure In?", "meta_data": {"description": "Actress and her director boyfriend end nine-year relationship amid reports linking her to costar", "google-site-verification": "jOadQCDbZTkKw5sn27yXszjIb9c3PdMPHENN92uPWy8", "msvalidate.01": "564B986CE3CECCAE84779191BEC6B755", "og": {"title": "Rachel Weisz Splits With Darren Aronofsky\u2014Does Daniel Craig Figure In?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.eonline.com/news/210234/rachel-weisz-splits-with-darren-aronofsky-does-daniel-craig-figure-in", "image": {"identifier": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010109/300.weisz.arofonsky.lc.110910.jpg?fit=around|600:315&crop=600:315;center,top&output-quality=90", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "site_name": "E!
