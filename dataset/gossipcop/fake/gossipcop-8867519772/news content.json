I thought he was ignoring me.\"\n\n\"I dont know. It was just the two of us in the hotel,\" Pattinson noted.\n\nIn The Lost City of Z, hitting theaters on April 21, Hunnam portrays British explorer Percy Fawcett, who disappeared in 1925 while on a search for a mythical city that he believed existed in the Amazon.
