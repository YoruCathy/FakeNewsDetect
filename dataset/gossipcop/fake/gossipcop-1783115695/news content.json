We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why Chris is enjoying the feud and anticipating more disses.\n\nThe rap war between Pusha T and Drake just got super ugly as the 41-year-old claimed in a new diss track that Drizzy is a deadbeat dad to a secret son with former porn star Sophie Brussaux. Chris Brown is right there with all of us hoping Drake\u2019s got a clap back track coming, but in the meantime he\u2019s pulled up some popcorn and is having a blast watching their drama. \u201cChris is on Team Pusha and believes him when he says that Drake may be ignoring his own baby. Chris is loving all the drama between Pusha and Drake. He is glad that for once, he is not in the middle of this feud,\u201d a source close to the 29-year-old singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cChris can\u2019t stop laughing at Pusha\u2019s track, from the black face pic to calling Drake a deadbeat, Chris thinks it is all hilarious. Chris feels bad for the baby and thinks Drake is being irresponsible. If the kid really is Drake\u2019s, Chris thinks he should man up quickly and take a more active role in the child\u2019s life. Chris feels if the baby is not Drake\u2019s, then he should probably let that be known pretty quickly too. Chris hopes another diss track is on the way from Drake defending himself either way,\u201d our insider continues. So far, Drake hasn\u2019t responded to Pusha\u2019s claims that he\u2019s got a secret son and is a deadbeat dad. His reps aren\u2019t commenting on the issue either.\n\nChris is a daddy to his precious daughter Royalty, who just turned four. He can\u2019t understand why if Drake is really a father to son Adonis like Pusha claims, that he isn\u2019t stepping up. \u201cChris believes that Royalty is the best thing that ever happened to him. His daughter has kept him grounded, stable, happy and motivated. He can\u2019t imagine life without her and he can\u2019t think of why Drake would turn his back on his baby too. It\u2019s a huge mistake. Chris feels if Drake denies his own baby then he is missing out on one of the most wonderful things in life, being a father,\u201d our source adds.\n\nBut, aside from being a father, why else would Chris be siding with Pusha T? Well if you recall, both he and Drake were romantically linked to Rihanna. While Drake and Rihanna\u2019s romance was never confirmed, Chris\u2019 dramatic relationship with the \u201cUmbrella\u201d singer was pretty high profile. Plus, back in 2012, Drake and Chris were allegedly involved in an altercation that turned violent at WIP nightclub in NYC. And, it was supposedly over Rihanna. Yikes! Can\u2019t we all just get along?!", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/chris-brown-drake-pusha-t-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/chris-brown-drake-pusha-t-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F30%2Fchris-brown-reacts-drake-pusha-t-feud-cant-stop-laughing%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3164168&comment_count=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/chris-brown-drake-pusha-t-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/30/chris-brown-reacts-drake-pusha-t-feud-cant-stop-laughing/", "title": "Chris Brown Loving Drake Vs.
