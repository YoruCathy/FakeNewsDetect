The weather and the hustle of the city is too much.\u201d\n\nProbably making matters worse is that the ratings are actually down 25 percent vs. last year for the show. Ryan will likely be feeling that he's party responsible for that.\n\nNetwork execs don't like when ratings are down and generally try to get rid of the problem quickly. With Kelly as a long-standing host, it would make sense to keep her around.\n\nRyan, however, is likely expendable.\n\nKelly has been known in the past to not get along with her co-hosts, and if recent reports to be believed, she is not getting along with Ryan.\n\nAnother thing probably irks Ryan is that ABC is rebooting American Idol and he's very busy with Live. Word on the street is that he has been offered over $10 million for his hosting duties.\n\nSeems like a decent salary, right?\n\nWell, Katy Perry has been confirmed as the first judge and is getting $25 million for her services. That's a huge pay gap and considering Ryan has been on the show since 2002.\n\nSo, it seems like things are not working out for Ryan right now.\n\nWhat will he do? Will he stick it out in New York, or return to his roots in Los Angeles?\n\nSound off below!", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--MrpOV8jg--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1497005230/kelly-ripa-and-ryan-seacrest.png"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--MrpOV8jg--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1497005230/kelly-ripa-and-ryan-seacrest.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/06/ryan-seacrest-miserable-as-kelly-ripas-co-host/", "title": "Ryan Seacrest: Miserable as Kelly Ripa\u2019s Co-Host!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/06/ryan-seacrest-miserable-as-kelly-ripas-co-host/", "title": "Ryan Seacrest: Miserable as Kelly Ripa\u2019s Co-Host!", "description": "Ryan Seacrest is not enjoying his time on Live with Kelly and Ryan.
