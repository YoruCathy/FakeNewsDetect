I will never be able to repay her for the blessings that she gave me.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to EW, Moore\u2019s costar from 1967\u2019s Thoroughly Modern Millie, Julie Andrews, called her a \u201cvery dear friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe bonded instantly on the film,\u201d Andrews said, \u201cand laughed our way through the production. Ever since that time, we never referred to each other again as Julie and Mary. Whenever we bumped into each other, people must have thought us nuts\u2026screaming across some shopping aisle in a supermarket or yelling to each other down the corridors of CBS\u2026\u2019Millie! Miss Dorothy!'\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a joy to work with, her talent was monumental. She was brave, kind, generous and an activist for many causes,\u201d Andrews continued. \u201cI will miss my \u2018Miss Dorothy\u2019 so much, but I\u2019m comforted to know that the joy she brought us all will be everpresent in her many films and television shows.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s friend Larry King also expressed his condolences, tweeting, \u201cMary Tyler Moore was a dear friend and a truly great person.
