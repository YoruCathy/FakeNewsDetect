Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFilm producer Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by multiple women, including Asia Argento, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie. Weinstein denies some of the allegations and says all his relationships were \u201cconsensual\u201d.\n\nterrycrews (@terrycrews) This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.)\n\nterrycrews (@terrycrews) I decided not 2 take it further becuz I didn\u2019t want 2b ostracized\u2014 par 4 the course when the predator has power n influence. (9/cont.)\n\nCrews described how, at an industry function in 2016, an unnamed male executive groped his genitals in front of his wife and \u201cgrinned like a jerk\u201d at the pair\u2019s shocked response.\n\nHe said that he was tempted to retaliate, but was worried how the incident would be reported and feared he would go to jail. \u201c\u2018240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho\u2019 would be the headline the next day,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCrews said the executive later called to apologise, but did not give a reason for his actions. Crews chose not to publicise the incident for fear of being ostracised. \u201cPar [for] the course when the predator has power [and] influence\u201d, he wrote.\n\nThe actor said his experience had helped him \u201cunderstand and empathize with those who have remained silent\u201d. \u201cBut Harvey Weinstein is not the only perpetrator,\u201d he added. Crews also expressed hope that, by making his experience public, he would \u201cdeter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless\u201d.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3277ee16417fccd5ad6d7cc3a65c7f8599414332/0_24_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c84d0664716bf9f5161567c5c2d40ce", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3277ee16417fccd5ad6d7cc3a65c7f8599414332/0_24_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0823840bcdccff7c0f4d39c2c047ddde", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Film%2CFilm+industry%2CHarvey+Weinstein%2CCulture%2CTerry+Crews%2CAsia+Argento"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3277ee16417fccd5ad6d7cc3a65c7f8599414332/0_24_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c84d0664716bf9f5161567c5c2d40ce", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gwilym Mumford"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive", "title": "Actor Terry Crews: I was sexually assaulted by Hollywood executive", "meta_data": {"description": "Brooklyn Nine-Nine star says he did not speak out after unnamed \u2018high-level\u2019 executive groped his genitals for fear of being ostracised or jailed", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Gwilym Mumford", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3277ee16417fccd5ad6d7cc3a65c7f8599414332/0_24_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=59eb7dc5d64bbe08bc390123ed29e4a6", "keywords": "Film,Film industry,Harvey Weinstein,Culture,Terry Crews,Asia Argento", "news_keywords": "Film,Film industry,Harvey Weinstein,Culture,Terry Crews,Asia Argento", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3277ee16417fccd5ad6d7cc3a65c7f8599414332/0_24_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0c84d0664716bf9f5161567c5c2d40ce", "description": "Brooklyn Nine-Nine star says he did not speak out after unnamed \u2018high-level\u2019 executive groped his genitals for fear of being ostracised or jailed", "type": "article", "title": "Actor Terry Crews: I was sexually assaulted by Hollywood executive", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwilym-mumford", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2017-10-11T13:46:25.000Z", "tag": "Film,Film industry,Harvey Weinstein,Culture,Terry Crews,Asia Argento", "modified_time": "2020-02-24T18:37:35.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2017/oct/11/actor-terry-crews-sexually-assaulted-by-hollywood-executive?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3277ee16417fccd5ad6d7cc3a65c7f8599414332/0_24_1669_1001/master/1669.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=9034c397bc6a9478d40295ce2c139e00", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507651200.0, "source": "http://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
