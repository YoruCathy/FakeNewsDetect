So much so that the frenemies have already arranged a phone to discuss how they will handle the situation.\n\nAn insider told Ok! that there has been A LOT of pressure: \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest night of the year, and they know they\u2019ll both be party-hopping.\u201d But while the plan was that they\u2019d just \u201cstake out their own territory, neither was willing to budge an inch!\u201d They finally settled on just avoiding each other completely, but after thinking that over, they weren\u2019t comfortable with that either.\n\n\u201cWhy should either of them have to tiptoe around the Academy Awards worrying about bumping into the other?\u201d said the source, adding, \u201cA face-to-face showdown is inevitable.\u201d\n\nTo add even more drama, Brad Pitt was said to be \u201cin a panic\u201d about the potential nightmare. The insider concluded, \u201cI heard he\u2019s frantically texting Jen and Angie to ask them to avoid being in the same room at all costs, since no good could possibly come from it.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think Jen and Angie should do once they inevitably encounter each other at the Oscars this weekend?
