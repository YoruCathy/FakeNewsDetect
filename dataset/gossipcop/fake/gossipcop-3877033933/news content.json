A new report claims that there is definitely trouble in paradise, and the couple are even sleeping in different beds.\n\nKim Kardashian, 35, could be preparing to divorce for a third time. After her husband, Kanye West, 38, had a number of different outbursts on social media, a new report says that Kim \u2014 and her family \u2014 have had enough and are ready to cut the cord. Yikes!\n\n\u201cKim is at a loss,\u201d a family insider shared with OK! Magazine inside their March 21 issue. Of course, the insider is talking about Kim\u2019s relationship with Kanye, and how it\u2019s allegedly falling apart at the seams due to his reckless behavior on social media and at Saturday Night Live. \u201cShe\u2019s questioning the relationship for the first time.\u201d So sad. To hear more about Kanye West, head over to iTunes and download the latest HollywoodLife podcast for free!\n\nUnfortunately, the report claims that there is more to the story than just Kanye\u2019s incessant Twitter rants. Apparently, the couple are \u201cin a rut\u201d that has caused them to lose \u201cthe spark\u201d they once shared. \u201cHe let himself go while he was working on his album and clothing line, so he\u2019s flabby and irritable. Meanwhile, she\u2019s struggling to lose the baby weight and find her confidence again too.\u201d The insider says these issues have led them to sleeping in different rooms when they are together.\n\nEver since Kanye started going off on everyone from Taylor Swift to Wiz Khalifa on social media, there seem to be a lot of concerns about the state of his relationship with Kim. Even worse? It\u2019s previously been reported that Kim\u2019s momager, Kris Jenner, is extremely concerned that he could potentially destroy the Kardashian/Jenner empire she\u2019s built. Eek.\n\nBut, the report claims that Kim hasn\u2019t completely given up hope. The mother-of-two reportedly asked her hubby to join her for a gym session or two, but Kanye hasn\u2019t been interested in the bonding experience. \u201cHe\u2019s knee-deep in work right now,\u201d the insider explained in Kanye\u2019s defense.\n\nKanye hasn\u2019t given up, either. Not only did he support Kim\u2019s recent nude Instagram despite all of the controversy surrounding it, he gushed over how she was his \u201cmuse\u201d on Twitter and also shared that he couldn\u2019t wait to get home to her and their two sweet children once he was done designing in Sweden. There\u2019s hope for these two yet!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 Are you concerned that the end of Kimye is near?
