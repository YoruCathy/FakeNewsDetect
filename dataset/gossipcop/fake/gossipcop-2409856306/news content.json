And now, amid a new report that Jolie and Pitt were arguing over whose career should take priority, comes the news that Brad has exited from Top Gear, according to Design & Trend\u2018s sources.\n\nPitt had initially been viewed as the ideal person for show\u2019s return. But when Brad abruptly changed his mind, Top Gear was left in shambles. As to why the famous actor would leave a show in the lurch?\n\nAre Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie headed for a divorce? [Photo by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for Audi]\n\nBrad, 52, and Angelina, 40, are battling over who should care for their children, with a source explaining that the two had agreed to take turns minding the kids and pursuing career ambitions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at war over who\u2019s looking after the kids since that agreement got blown out the window with her desire to turn her directing career into a success after several failures. This is tearing them apart, but Brad\u2019s got no choice.\u201d\n\nPitt is pointing to his efforts to help Angelina in her ambitions to become a director, but he feels that he has gone above and beyond by participating in her \u201cflop,\u201d By the Sea. In addition, Design & Trend cites a friend of Jolie\u2019s who describes the problems she\u2019s had in her life and how they affect her now.\n\n\u201cAngie has some serious dark demons that have never entirely let go and it is still affecting her life and marriage,\u201d revealed one friend. \u201cHer wild lifestyle when she was younger and her intense surgeries to avoid getting breast and ovarian cancer have taken a toll on her as a person and a life partner.\u201d\n\nAngelina Jolie looks frail at a reported 79 pounds.

And although Brad first liked the \u201cdark side\u201d of Jolie, he increasingly feels that she\u2019s pushing him away.\n\n\u201cIt can be really hard on him. He feels he has been more than patient with Angie, but his confidence in their happiness is wearing thin,\u201d added the friend.\n\nAdding to the problems in their marriage, Angelina is jealous that Pitt spends so much time with actress Marion Cotillard, according to an insider cited by Hollywood Life, which describes Jolie as \u201cwasting away\u201d over her husband\u2019s affair, weighing only 79 pounds.\n\nAngelina Jolie serves as special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Although no romantic affairs have taken place, Pitt has been gushing about Marion, explained the insider.\n\n\u201cThe resentment has been eating away at Angelina. She\u2019s prone to think that since she was once Brad\u2019s co-star and seduced him away from his wife, the same will happen to her.\u201d\n\nThat reference to how Jolie \u201cseduced\u201d Pitt away from his spouse refers to Jennifer Aniston. But the problem here is that rather than having Marion seduce Brad away from Angelina, it\u2019s Jolie\u2019s own jealousy and refusal to listen to him that is pushing Pitt to file for divorce, claims the insider.\n\n\u201cHe will be the one to file. He\u2019s fed up with her controlling ways, her obstinateness when it comes to listening to him about her health issues and how she needs to slow down and now her outright jealousy when it comes to other women,\u201d added the source.\n\nAs to parallels to Pitt\u2019s marriage and divorce from Jennifer Aniston, that drama began in 2004 when Brad started working on the 2005 movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith and became intimately acquainted with the woman who would become his girlfriend and then his wife, Angelina, as the Inquisitr reported.\n\nPitt and Jolie reportedly began their relationship during that film, with Brad subsequently confessing that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with Angelina on the movie set. He divorced Aniston by fall 2005, and Jolie announced her pregnancy with his child in January 2006.\n\nWill Angelina suffer the same fate as Jennifer?
