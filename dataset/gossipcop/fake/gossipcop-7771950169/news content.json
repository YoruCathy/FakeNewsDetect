Sources say that Lopez sees herself marrying A-Rod sooner rather than later, and she is starting to get impatient. Are the singer and future baseball Hall-of-Famer headed for a split if he doesn\u2019t put a ring on it?\n\nAccording to Life & Style, J. Lo thinks Rodriguez is \u201cthe one,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t want to put too much pressure on him since they have both been married before. But, that isn\u2019t keeping her from looking at rings and pointing out what she likes when they walk past an expensive jewelry store.\n\n#FeelingTheLove #GroupHug #FamilyTime A post shared by Alex Rodriguez (@arod) on May 19, 2018 at 9:53pm PDT\n\nLopez tied the knot for the first time back in 1997 when she married Ojani Noa, but they divorced just one year later. Her second marriage to Cris Judd lasted for only two years, 2001 to 2003. Then, she got married a third time back in 2004 to singer Marc Anthony. They share two children \u2013 10-year-old twins Emme and Max \u2013 but the relationship ended when they parted ways in 2014.\n\nAs for Rodriguez, he has been married just once. He wed Cynthia Scurtis in 2002, but the couple divorced in 2008. They also share two children, 14-year-old Natasha and 10-year-old Ella.\n\nBut even though they have both done the marriage thing before, it doesn\u2019t mean they are against trying it again. Sources say Rodriguez isn\u2019t opposed to getting married, and he and Lopez have talked about it.\n\n\u201cHe and Jennifer have talked at great length about tying the knot. But it\u2019s getting to the stage where J. Lo is becoming impatient. She\u2019s starting to question whether her boyfriend is all talk and no action!\u201d says an insider.\n\nLopez hasn\u2019t given her boyfriend an ultimatum, but she isn\u2019t hiding the fact that she is getting anxious about the relationship. Her new song Anillo \u2013 which means \u201cring\u201d in Spanish \u2013 seemingly made things very public. In the chorus, she repeats the line, \u201cI have it all, but where\u2019s the ring?\u201d\n\nThe singer hasn\u2019t confirmed the song is about her own life or relationship, but it is difficult not to speculate on who she is talking about. And, J. Lo\u2019s friend and World of Dance co-star Jenna Dewan believes that a ring is in the near future for Lopez and Rodriguez.\n\nDewan recently admitted that she is sure an engagement is happening soon, and she isn\u2019t the only one. Another World of Dance star, Ne-Yo, says that if you have ever seen the two of them together, you would know that an engagement is pretty much the next step. He went on to say that they are \u201cannoyingly cute,\u201d to the point that you want them to just stop touching each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsiders say that Lopez and Rodriguez\u2019s kids are also ready for them to tie the knot, and the couple is happy that all of the children get along and have accepted their new family. Jennifer Lopez believes that Alex Rodriguez is her soulmate, and she can\u2019t believe how happy she is.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jennifer-Lopez-And-Alex-Rodriguez-Headed-For-A-Split-Inside-Her-Demands-For-A-Ring.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/This-Is-The-Sign-Queen-Elizabeth-Absolutely-Approves-Of-Meghan-Markle-After-Wedding-Drama-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennier-Lopez-SevenStarsWorld.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Lopez-alex-rodriguez-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ayesha-curry-son-jlo-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jennifer-Lopez-And-Alex-Rodriguez-Headed-For-A-Split-Inside-Her-Demands-For-A-Ring.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jennifer-lopez-and-alex-rodriguez-headed-for-a-split-inside-her-demands-for-a-ring-151802/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez And Alex Rodriguez Headed For A Split?
