Why can we do that, you ask? Well, as it happens, both Witherspoon and Dern connected on Twitter recently to brainstorm some adorable and unconventional Big Little Lies Season 2 ideas \u2014 and we\u2019re living for it.\n\nOn Dec. 14, Dern posted a video from her Star Wars: The Last Jedi promotional duties where she has a cute moment with the most twee droid of them all, BB-8. Witherspoon, not missing a beat, tweeted at her, \u201cI love him! Can BB8 be in BLL2?\u201d\n\nI love him ! Can BB8 be in BLL2? \u2014 Reese Witherspoon (@RWitherspoon) December 14, 2017\n\n\n\nOf course, Dern saw an easy way to bring the worlds of Star Wars and Big Little Lies together, and she didn\u2019t hesitate to pitch her idea to Witherspoon right away. \u201cUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy!\u201d.\n\nUm\u2026yes. Easy. Renata just bought the real BB-8 for Christmas for her daughter. Knowing u would likely get your daughter the toy! \u2014 Laura Dern (@LauraDern) December 14, 2017\n\n\n\nOK, this idea is actually amazing and yes, now I will need Amabella to get a BB-8 in Big Little Lies Season 2 or else all will be for naught.\n\nOriginal story, published Sept. 18, 2017: The internet seems to think that something is brewing between Big Little Lies stars Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern, and it\u2019s not at all friendly. This is, of course, speculative and incredibly problematic to say the least, if only because the speculation is looking to pit two women against one another for no good reason. Because Dern didn\u2019t embrace Witherspoon and suddenly that\u2019s a sign of a feud? It sounds fishy, folks.\n\nSpeculation began brewing on Sunday night at the 69th Primetime Emmys when Dern skipped over Witherspoon as she received congratulations after winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie. When Dern was announced as the winner, a curious thing happened: She passed right over Witherspoon.\n\nMore: Is Big Little Lies Season 2 Actually a Good Idea?\n\nIt\u2019s traditional during an awards show, especially one like the Emmys or Oscars where big groups related to a project show up, that the winner might take a moment to get hugs and kisses from their dates or co-stars before going up onstage. Considering the established narrative of how close the women of Big Little Lies are in real life, to see Dern get announced as the winner and move right over Witherspoon to Nicole Kidman (seated in front of Witherspoon) is interesting and noteworthy, but it\u2019s not exactly damning proof that Dern loathes Witherspoon, is it?\n\nWhat did Reese Witherspoon do to Laura Dern?! #EMMY2017 pic.twitter.com/0a013ucBQ8 \u2014 Adam B.

First off, Dern\u2019s nerves may have gotten the best of her. There\u2019s a chance she just kind of quickly hugged the first people she saw before making her way to the stage so she could give her proper thanks. Second of all, there\u2019s a chance that maybe Dern and Witherspoon are cool but perhaps they just don\u2019t show their affection for one another in that way. There\u2019s also reason to believe that the cameras focused on Dern after Witherspoon acknowledge her and congratulated her.\n\nMore: One Big Little Lies Star Might Run for Congress\n\nListen, at the end of the day, there\u2019s most likely nothing here; the internet is talking about a problem that simply isn\u2019t there. There\u2019s no need to blow something entirely out of proportion \u2014 however interesting or somewhat shady it may be \u2014 when it could risk painting two women whom we otherwise love and who have not been prone to catty behavior in public before this with a broad brush.", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.sheknows.com&path=%2Fentertainment%2Farticles%2F1136144%2Fprimetime-emmys-laura-dern-reese-witherspoon%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1136144", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mi5u4xjidza8igdxglil.jpeg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/judi-dench.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Elton-John-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kenneth-Armando.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/thequarry_6-h_2020.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?quality=98&w=330#038;ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kim-kardashian-north-saint-throwback-spl-ftr.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/allie-gemmill.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sam-Heughan-Caitriona-Balfe.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Reese-Witherspoon-2013-arrest.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mi5u4xjidza8igdxglil.jpeg?w=695&h=391&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/peel-keychain-touch-tool-featured-image.jpg?quality=98&w=330"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mi5u4xjidza8igdxglil.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allie Gemmill"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1136144/primetime-emmys-laura-dern-reese-witherspoon/", "title": "Laura Dern & Reese Witherspoon Prove They\u2019re as Close as Ever & Not Feuding \u2013 SheKnows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern are far from feuding, and their latest 'Big Little Lies'-related Twitter interaction proves it.", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "author": "Allie Gemmill", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Let's put an end to those Big Little Lies feud rumors, shall we?", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1136144/primetime-emmys-laura-dern-reese-witherspoon/", "description": "Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern are far from feuding, and their latest 'Big Little Lies'-related Twitter interaction proves it.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mi5u4xjidza8igdxglil.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 575}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-18T16:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-10T00:24:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Let's put an end to those Big Little Lies feud rumors, shall we?"}, "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mi5u4xjidza8igdxglil.jpeg?w=1024", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SheKnows", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/_bigmomenergy", "title": "Let's put an end to those Big Little Lies feud rumors, shall we?", "description": "Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern are far from feuding, and their latest 'Big Little Lies'-related Twitter interaction proves it."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-sk-favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513612800.0, "source": "http://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
