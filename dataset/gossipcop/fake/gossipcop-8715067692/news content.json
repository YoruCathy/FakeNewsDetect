And, if you're looking for just the right accent piece in your home, you can bid on set decor that once graced the halls of the Cullen household.\n\nLast year, several other items (including Bella's wedding ring) were offered up for fans to bid on - but this appears to be one of the biggest prop auctions for the Twilight franchise yet.\n\nThe Twilight Saga online auction will be held from November 6 - 17.", "images": ["http://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/SYFYWire_Logo.svg", "http://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/watch--black.svg", "http://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/hamburger--black.svg", "http://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/close--black.svg", "http://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/search--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680_hero/public/wire/legacy/images/Twilight_Eclipse_poster_thumb_0.jpg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/wire/legacy/images/Twilight_Eclipse_poster_thumb_0.jpg", "http://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/loading-spinner.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/wire/legacy/images/Twilight_Eclipse_poster_thumb_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Lane"], "canonical_link": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/twilight-saga-movie-props-are-going-up-for-auction", "title": "Twilight Saga movie props are going up for auction", "meta_data": {"post_type": "syfywire_article", "fb": {"app_id": 795894437245434}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "description": "Twi-hards, you're in luck: an auction to celebrate a special anniversary in the Twilight series is offering up hundreds of items from the movie set that you can add to your own fan collection.
