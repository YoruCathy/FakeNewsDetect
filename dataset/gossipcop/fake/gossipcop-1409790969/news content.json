Get the EXCLUSIVE details here.\n\nGwen Stefani\u2018s sons Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4, who she had with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, 52, love their mom\u2019s boyfriend Blake Shelton, 41, so much that they want him as a stepdad and are coming up with ways to get him to marry their mom! \u201cGwen\u2019s kids are starting to drop subtle hints to Blake that they would love it if he would marry their mom,\u201d a source close to Gwen shared EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. \u201cThey tell Blake that they love him and always want him around. The kids put pressure on Blake and make it known to him that they wish he was their stepdad. Their bond is strong with Blake and the older boys are confused as to why mom and Blake aren\u2019t married already.\u201d Aw!\n\nWith how much time Gwen\u2019s boys and Blake spend together it\u2019s not entirely surprising that they would love him to make things official. From going on adorable fishing trips in Blake\u2019s home state of Oklahoma to spending holidays such as Easter together, Gwen and Blake\u2019s clan always look cozy and comfortable together. Seeing the happy couple married seems like it would only intensify the cuteness!\n\nWhen she\u2019s not spending time with Blake and her kids, Gwen\u2019s been preparing for her upcoming residency in Las Vegas. She\u2019s set to kick off a series of concerts at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on June 27 and a source previously told us that Blake can\u2019t wait to babysit her boys when she\u2019s off doing her thing! Although there\u2019s been speculation that Gwen and Blake are thinking about possibly getting married in the near future, there\u2019s been no official word yet. Perhaps they\u2019ll take the step at a chapel in Vegas? We\u2019ll have to wait and see!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/erin_silvia1.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gwens-kids-pressuring-blake-to-propose-backgrid-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F24%2Fgwen-stefani-kids-blake-shelton-propose%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3099511", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gwens-kids-pressuring-blake-to-propose-backgrid-ftr.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gwens-kids-pressuring-blake-to-propose-backgrid-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/24/gwen-stefani-kids-blake-shelton-propose/", "title": "Gwen Stefani\u2019s Kids Pressuring Blake Shelton To Propose To Their Mom", "meta_data": {"description": "Gwen Stefani's kids are pressuring Blake Shelton to propose to their mom.", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani\u2019s Kids Pressuring Blake Shelton To Propose To Their Mom", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/24/gwen-stefani-kids-blake-shelton-propose/", "description": "Gwen Stefani\u2019s three sons are loving their mom\u2019s beau Blake Shelton so much that they are dropping hints to try and get him to propose to his lady love and become their stepdad.
