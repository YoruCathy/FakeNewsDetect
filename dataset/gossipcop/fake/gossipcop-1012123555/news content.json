Chris allegedly checked the 66-year-old man\u2019s pulse and called 911 after the disastrous impact, but he later fled the scene by foot and was arrested at his home just five hours later.\n\nChris was charged with leaving the scene of an accident with a death (a class D felony), but he was released after posting $10,000 bond. Police also reportedly found alcohol in his truck after the crash.\n\nChris, who was set to appear on the upcoming season of Bachelor In Paradise, is scheduled to appear in court on May 2. He was also ordered to wear an ankle bracelet and hand over his passport.\n\nBefore Chris broke his silence, his rep released the following statement, \u201cChris Soules was involved in an accident Monday evening (April 24) in a rural part of Iowa near his home. He was devastated to learn that Kenneth Mosher, the other person in the accident, passed away. His thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Mosher\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, how do YOU feel about Chris Soules\u2019 statement? Do you think he\u2019s really \u201ctraumatized\u201d?
