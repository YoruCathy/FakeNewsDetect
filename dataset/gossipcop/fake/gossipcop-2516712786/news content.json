Some accuse them of self-loathing, while many in the African-American community view it as a rejection of black identity.\n\nIncreasing numbers of mixed-race births have further complicated matters, with light-skinned blacks occasionally being accused of not being \u201cblack enough.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, The New York Times recently detailed the growing popularity of glutathione treatments. The antioxidant, which is administered intravenously, can deactivate the enzyme that produces darker skin pigments.\n\nThe article noted that while these treatments have become hugely popular in Asia, \u201cit is also cropping up among certain communities in Britain and the United States,\u201d with demand \u201cslowly growing.\u201d\n\nAs someone who has studied and written about the issue of skin color and black identity for over 20 years, I believe the rise of glutathione treatments \u2013 in addition to the growing use of various bleaching creams \u2013 reveal a taboo that African-Americans are certainly aware of, but loathe to admit.\n\nThough they might criticize lighter-skinned black people, many people of color \u2013 deep down \u2013 abhor dark skin.\n\nThe power of fair skin\n\nThere are few places in the world where dark skin isn\u2019t stigmatized.\n\nMany Latin American countries have laws and policies in place to prevent discrimination relative to skin color. In many Native American communities, \u201cRed-Black Cherokees\u201d were denied acceptance into the tribe, while those with lighter skin were welcomed.\n\nBut it is in Asia where dark skin has seen the longest and most intense level of stigma. In India, dark-skinned Dalits, for thousands of years, were viewed as \u201cuntouchables.\u201d Today, they\u2019re still stigmatized. In Japan, long before the first Europeans arrived, dark skin was stigmatized. According to Japanese tradition, a woman with fair skin compensates for \u201cseven blemishes.\u201d\n\nThe United States has its own complicated history with skin color, primarily because \u201cmulatto\u201d skin \u2013 not quite black, but not quite white \u2013 often arose out of mixed-race children conceived between slaves and slave masters.\n\nIn America, these variations in complexions produced an unspoken hierarchy: Black people with lighter complexions ended up being granted some of the rights of the master class. By early 19th century, the \u201cmulatto hypothesis\u201d emerged, arguing that the \u201cwhite blood\u201d of light-skinned slaves made them smarter, more civilized and better looking.\n\nIt\u2019s probably no coincidence that light-skinned blacks emerged as leaders in the black community: To white power brokers, they were less threatening. Harvard\u2019s first black graduate was the fair-skinned W.E.B. Du Bois. Some of the most prominent black politicians \u2013 from former New Orleans Mayor Ernest Morial, to former Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, to former President Barack Obama \u2013 have lighter skin.\n\nFair skin and beauty\n\nIn 1967, Dutch sociologist Harry Hoetink coined the term \u201csomatic norm image\u201d to describe why some shades of skin are favored over others.\n\nIn America, some trace the emergence of light skin as the \u201csomatic norm image\u201d for all modern-day races to the 1930s advertising campaign of Breck Shampoo.\n\nTo market its product, the company created the \u201cBreck Girl.\u201d In advertisements, her fair, alabaster skin was touted as the perfect ideal of feminine beauty. Few considered the devastating affects a glamorized image of light skin might have on the self-esteem of dark-skinned Americans \u2013 in particular, women.\n\nIn a 2008 study, researchers at the University of Georgia called skin color distinction \u201ca well-kept secret\u201d in black communities. \u201cThe hue of one\u2019s skin,\u201d they wrote, \u201ctends to have a psychological effect on the self-esteem of African-Americans.\u201d\n\nYet they also noted that existing research on the relationship between skin color and self-esteem didn\u2019t even exist. Fear of being perceived as a race traitor continues to make the topic taboo in the United States \u2013 in a way which exceeds that in places like India or Japan.\n\nTo obtain a fairer complexion, many apply bleaching creams. Some of the most popular are Olay, Natural White, Ambi Fade Cream and Clean & Clear Fairness Cream.\n\nWhile these creams can work, they can be dangerous: Some contain cancer-causing ingredients. Despite the potential danger, skin bleaching cream sales have grown. By 2024, it\u2019s projected that global profits will reach $31.2 billion.\n\nIn the U.S., sales are difficult to assess; African-Americans are reluctant to admit that they bleach. For this reason, American companies will often market their creams by using abstract language, claiming that the creams will \u201cfade,\u201d \u201ceven the tone\u201d or \u201csmooth out the texture\u201d of dark skin. In this way, black people who buy the creams can avoid confronting the real reasons they feel compelled to purchase the product, while skirting accusations of self-hate.\n\nThe harmful effects of the \u2018bleaching syndrome\u2019\n\nAfter studying skin color for years, I coined the term \u201cbleaching syndrome\u201d to describe this phenomenon.\n\nI published my first paper on the topic in 1994. Put simply, it argues that African-Americans, Latinos and every other oppressed population will internalize the somatic norm image at the expense of their native characteristics. So even though dark skin is a feature of African-Americans, light skin continues to be the ideal because it\u2019s the one preferred by the dominant group: whites.\n\nThe bleaching syndrome has three components. The first is psychological: This involves self-rejection of dark skin and other native characteristics.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s sociological, in that it influences group behavior (hence the phenomenon of black celebrities bleaching their skin).\n\nThe final aspect is physiological. The physiological is not limited to just bleaching the skin. It can also mean altering hair texture and eye color to mimic the dominant group. The rapper Lil\u2019 Kim, in addition to lightening her skin, has also changed her eye color and altered her facial features. The fact that so few in mainstream culture can even acknowledge the existence of the bleaching syndrome is a testament to how taboo the topic is.\n\nThe solution to the bleaching syndrome is political. The disdain for dark skin today is similar to disdain for kinky hair in the 1960s. African-Americans\u2019 dislike of their natural hair was so ingrained that the first black millionaire, Madam C.J. Walker, was able to accumulate her fortune by selling hair-straightening products to black folks.\n\n\u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d \u2013 a slogan popularized at the tail end of the 1960s \u2013 was a political statement that sought to upend the negative associations many Americans, including many African-Americans, felt toward all things black. In response, the Afro became a popular hairstyle, and black entertainers, from Sammy Davis Jr. to Lou Rawls, proudly grew out their hair, refusing to apply hair straightening products.\n\n\u201cBack to Black\u201d \u2013 a nod to the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d campaign \u2013 is a political statement that could address the impulse many feel to bleach their dark skin. It has the potential to reverse the disdain for such skin and hence those so characterized. Even black celebrities who possess fair skin could help glamorize dark skin by repeating the slogan and paying tribute to the numerous dark-skinned beauties whose attractiveness goes seldom acknowledged: Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Gabrielle Union and Janelle Monae.\n\nThese dark-skinned black women would qualify as beautiful by any standards \u2013 regardless of skin color.", "images": ["https://cdn.theconversation.com/static/tc/author/width170_default-19ec5bd0b0425d75df0ad1707d18c36b.jpg", "https://jobs.theconversation.com/uploads/job/logo/33343283/logo-1431665524.jpg", "https://jobs.theconversation.com/uploads/job/logo/32965579/LogoFNU.png", "https://jobs.theconversation.com/uploads/job/logo/32956307/UWA-Full-Hor-CMYK_png_for_digital_and_print_use_2015Jun1.png", "https://images.theconversation.com/files/204336/original/file-20180131-157458-u4o37o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=11%2C245%2C2584%2C1292&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "https://cdn.theconversation.com/static/tc/@theconversation/ui/dist/logos/logo-en-5109a385bbe693ae7b6b3503e13f5355.svg", "https://images.theconversation.com/institutions/1349/logos/logo-1453252008.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=170&h=170", "https://images.theconversation.com/files/204336/original/file-20180131-157458-u4o37o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=496&fit=clip", "https://jobs.theconversation.com/uploads/job/logo/33371964/CISS_CMYK_FA-border_white.jpg", "https://jobs.theconversation.com/uploads/job/logo/33413661/3_monash.jpg", "https://images.theconversation.com/files/204339/original/file-20180131-157458-1r7sj5m.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip"], "top_img": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/204336/original/file-20180131-157458-u4o37o.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=11%2C245%2C2584%2C1292&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ronald Hall"], "canonical_link": "https://theconversation.com/black-americas-bleaching-syndrome-82200", "title": "Black America\u2019s \u2018bleaching syndrome\u2019", "meta_data": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "DoIFt9siN7uJw4N6E9hjzzlWzKLziLXsz9gj6CDwMpwGJCFpQb8laPRYErQ7AYhp+yFb58XwxrStk7wRQ6SmGA==", "theme-color": "#d8352a", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#d8352a", "fb": {"app_id": 127105130696839, "pages": "755360694556328,176084152419221,1333694686656387,247088762827023,227563794508206,898911580155104,1082364248512412,497975283875673,148546898646992,1453112561595308"}, "current-region": "au", "description": "The longing for lighter skin remains a taboo topic in African-American communities.", "pubdate": 20180202, "commissioning-region": "us", "searchtype": "analysis", "original-source": "https://theconversation.com/black-americas-bleaching-syndrome-82200", "news_keywords": "African Americans, Beauty, Black history, Psychology, Race, Self-esteem, Skin, Skin bleaching, Skin colour, Sociology, W.E.B.
