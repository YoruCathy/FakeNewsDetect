He only wishes the best for her\u2026 However, Brad hasn\u2019t reached out to Jen, and has no plans to do so at this point,\u2019 the source reasoned to Us Weekly.\n\nAnd Jen\u2019s team denied rumours that Brad is being \u2018a shoulder to cry on,\u2019 calling them \u2018another fabrication,\u2019 so for now, rumours have been put to bed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRight?\n\nBrad and Jen are kind of buried history anyway. They were an item between 2000 and 2005 but Brad has spoken out harshly about their relationship in the past; he once controversially called that time of his life \u2018pathetic\u2019 in an interview with Parade magazine.\n\n\u2018It became very clear to me that I was so intent on trying to find a movie about an interesting life, but I wasn\u2019t living an interesting life myself.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think my marriage [to Aniston] had something to do with it: trying to pretend the marriage was something that it wasn\u2019t,\u2019 he said in 2011.\n\nJennifer and Justin Therou called time on their marriage this February. They had been married for two years and together since 2011.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
