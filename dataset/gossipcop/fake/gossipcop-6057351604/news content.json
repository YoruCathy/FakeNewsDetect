When the actress took the part of a worker at a secret government facility on Homecoming, an upcoming political thriller on Amazon, she knew just who she wanted as her co-star: her old pal Dermot Mulroney.\n\nShe lobbied for him to join the show, and on March 8, it was officially announced that Dermot, 54 \u2014 who starred with Julia in My Best Friend\u2019s Wedding and August: Osage County \u2014 would play her character\u2019s boyfriend.\n\nJulia and Dermot.\n\nShe was thrilled. Her husband? Furious. \u201cJulia\u2019s reunion with Dermot hasn\u2019t gone down well with Danny,\u201d an insider tells Life & Style. \u201cEven though Julia\u2019s reminded him that Dermot is happily married with children, Danny\u2019s jealous.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just one of many issues causing problems in Julia and Danny\u2019s marriage. The cameraman and cinematographer \u201cis at the end of his rope,\u201d the insider tells Life & Style. \u201cJulia and Danny are constantly quarreling. Their 15-year marriage is on the rocks, and they could even split.\u201d\n\nJulia and Danny have been drifting apart for years. \u201cHer controlling ways, their different approaches to parenting, and his desire to have his own career, and be the man of the house have all contributed to arguments,\u201d says the insider. But recently, things have gotten worse. \u201cThey have been living separate lives,\u201d the insider notes\n\nJulia, Danny, and their three kids in August 2015.\n\nInstead of focusing on repairing his marriage to Julia, 50, Danny, 49, \u201chas been devoting his time to the kids [twins Hazel and Finn, 13, and son Henry, 10], friends, and jobs away from his wife.\u201d When he\u2019s home, the insider says, he often stays across the street from their beachfront compound, in a house they bought in 2016 that was originally meant for guests or nannies. The rift is only continuing to grow. \u201cJulia is a super-protective parent, which has caused friction with Danny, who believes in being more relaxed,\u201d explains the insider.\n\nBut when it comes to other men, he\u2019s anything but. When Julia called hunky survivalist Bear Grylls \u201ca man\u2019s man\u201d after they completed a charity trek across Africa together in 2017, \u201cthat really got under Danny\u2019s skin,\u201d says the insider. Danny was also seething after his wife turned into what he called a fawning \u201csports groupie,\u201d the insider says, when they spent time with British and Spanish soccer stars at meet-and-greets in 2016 and 2017.\n\nDanny\u2019s insecurity extends to his career, too: He hates being seen as Mr. Julia Roberts. \u201cFor a long time, Danny viewed Julia\u2019s success as his own failure. It triggered a fear that he was not good enough, and the fact that Julia controls everything at home made it worse,\u201d explains the insider. \u201cFeeling insecure and competitive with your partner is no way to live.\u201d\n\nThough they love each other, friends fear they can\u2019t go on like this much longer. \u201cJulia and Danny\u2019s marriage is hanging by a thread,\u201d says the insider. \u201cUnless they can come to terms with their issues, they\u2019re headed for divorce.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/screen-shot-2017-11-02-at-11-56-26-am.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/john-tesh-wife-connie-sellecca03.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sunny-hostin-abby-huntsman-the-view.jpg?crop=51px%2C67px%2C3168px%2C1795px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/julia-roberts-fam.jpg?w=1180&h=1557&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/art-carney-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/julia-roberts-danny-moderjpg.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/julia-roberts-danny-moderjpg.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_9056173pz.jpg?crop=0px%2C264px%2C2423px%2C1374px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/julia-roberts.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-Harry-bothered-by-Prince-William-title.jpg?crop=452px%2C0px%2C3583px%2C3582px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/julia-roberts.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_9241936v.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C5347px%2C3028px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-William-gets-new-title.jpg?crop=476px%2C0px%2C2875px%2C2875px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/julia-dermot-mulroney.jpg?w=1180&h=541&crop=1", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10543684k.jpg?crop=518px%2C193px%2C2424px%2C2424px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/martin-lawrence-kids.jpg?crop=741px%2C0px%2C2204px%2C2204px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1221376cw.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2336px%2C1323px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_9728195bk.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C4000px%2C2265px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richard-boone-have-gun-will-travel-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C964px%2C546px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amber-Laign-and-Robin-Roberts.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lucy-podcast-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/julia-roberts-danny-moderjpg.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Closer Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/julia-robert-danny-moder-divorce-156686/", "title": "Will Julia Roberts and Danny Moder Divorce?
