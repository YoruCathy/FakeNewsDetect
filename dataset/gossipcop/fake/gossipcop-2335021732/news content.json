Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian once modeled for Famous Stars and Straps, the clothing line of Moakler's ex-husband, rock drummer Travis Barker. But according to Shanna, Kim wanted more from Barker than modeling work.\n\n\n\n\"She was sending him text messages and e-mails, and this was when Travis and I were working on (staying together),\" Moakler told Page Six. \"When it happened, I asked her, 'What are these e-mails?' She had no answers for me. She was blatantly disrespectful.\"\n\n\n\nMoakler says she wouldn't even have gone to the party if she had known Kardashian was going to be there.\n\n\n\n\"I was going to leave, but I'm a human being. I get upset. I wasn't drunk, and I confronted her. She ruined my marriage and my family. If I get passionate about it, they call me crazy,\" Moakler relates.\n\n\n\nShe says that Kardashian boyfriend Reggie Bush tried to calm them and that \"I told him, 'Your girl's a whore.' I told him Kim sent Travis messages to meet up secretly.\"\n\n\n\nKardashian retaliated on Monday by strolling around in a T-shirt from Barker's line in front of the paparazzi. \"It was in the poorest of taste,\" said Moakler.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally published as Kim Kardashian soaked in catfight", "images":
