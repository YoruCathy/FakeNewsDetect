Robbie\u2019s brother Cameron teased that he was \u201con holiday,\u201d and another photo surfaced of him with four women believed to be friends of his sister.\n\nThe picture was captioned, \u201cThe calm before the Summer storm.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ackerley\u2019s brother James posted an image on Instagram with the location tagged as Harvest Newrybar, a popular wedding venue in Byron Bay, on Sunday.\n\nRobbie herself shared a romantic black-and-white photo kissing her beau two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cThis guy,\u201d she captioned the pic.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BOLDh53BcWa/?hl=en&taken-by=jfcackerley\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BOK5ix9j_pI/?taken-by=tsjatsjaw&hl=en\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BNkKX8yjI2k/?taken-by=margotrobbie&hl=en\n\nThe Australian actress and the British assistant director first met in 2013 on the set of the World War II drama Suite Francaise. The pair were spotted on several PDA-packed dates later in June 2014.\n\nIn the May issue of Vogue, Robbie described Ackerley as \u201cthe best-looking guy in London,\u201d and gushed about how she fell for her beau.\n\n\u201cI was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit. And then this crept up on me,\u201d she told the publication.\n\n\u201cWe were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, \u2018Oh, he would never love me back. Don\u2019t make it weird, Margot. Don\u2019t be stupid and tell him that you like him,\u2019\u201d she continued, adding, \u201cAnd then it happened, and I was like, \u2018Of course we\u2019re together.
