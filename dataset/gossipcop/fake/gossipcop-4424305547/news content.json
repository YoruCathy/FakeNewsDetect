First came the woking of Kendall Jenner, a Pepsi advert that began as a sort of soda spiritual, but ended up showing us that we had the answers to this little problem all along. Now comes news of a would-be landmark documentary focusing on the relationship between African-American communities and the police. \u201cYou have to find out what\u2019s the real struggle,\u201d Audience Network boss Chris Long declared this week when he announced the project, \u201cand that\u2019s part of getting the story to be authentic.\u201d The other part is that it\u2019s going to be made by Vince Vaughn.\n\nI know! AT LAST. If you are one of those people who felt the issue was being held back by the lack of hilariously overpromoted white actors attempting to give it the full 360, the news could not come soon enough. Vince\u2019s Wild West Picture Show Productions has been working on the project for a year, according to Long, with the only sadness that the Swingers star will not direct, although he is apparently going to be very hands-on as a producer. As Long puts it: \u201cI said to him, \u2018Listen, [if I were you] I would embed. Hoop Dreams was a five-year embedment.\u201d Why do I get the feeling that Hoop Dreams is his only other documentary reference point with This Sort of Race Stuff?\n\nHaving assessed what we might call \u201cchurn\u201d in Vince\u2019s IMDb entry, Lost in Showbiz judges that he certainly has the flexibility in his schedule for a five-year embed \u2013 but over to him. \u201cThe concept is really to humanise people on both sides,\u201d Vince explained to a Hollywood Radio & Television Society event this week. Luckily, he seems to have contacts in both camps, albeit in the suspiciously vague sort of way one gets with actors. \u201cI\u2019ve had friends who\u2019ve grown up in that environment, I\u2019ve also had friends who are police officers, and there\u2019s a lot of fear on both sides.\u201d Hmm. I suspect we are moving toward a pointed corrective that ALL lives matter.\n\nEither way, with that kind of Rolodex, Vince is uniquely placed to bring this anguished story of our times to \u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I honestly haven\u2019t the will to finish the sentence. Perhaps later.\n\nIn the meantime, it feels right to point out that the documentary could serve as an unofficial companion piece to Vince\u2019s other current project: a recently announced buddy-cop movie about police brutality in which he co-stars with Mr Mel Gibson. Set your sights on adventure! Time was when movies about necessarily violent cops who don\u2019t play by the rules were standard, uncomplicated fare, but the concept has rather fallen out of vogue of late. Who can possibly say why.\n\nStill, Dragged Across Concrete sees dear old Mel bumped out of the volatile younger cop role that he once made his own. He will instead play the old-timer to Vaughn\u2019s rookie, with the plot centring on two officers whose brutal tactics are filmed by a civilian, with the video becoming a cause celebre. I wonder whether the victim will be black, or if Hollywood will cleave to its rich tradition of pussying out of 90% of the major debates of any given age. Either way, it will be great to see Mel back on patrol, in an exploration of law enforcement that critics will call his finest since the performance beside the Malibu roadside, when he called the lady cop \u201csugar tits\u201d and explained that the Jews were responsible for all the wars in the world.\n\nActor-wise, it is undoubtedly an intriguing partnership. Vince is famously a libertarian; he endorsed both Ron and Rand Paul, considering his relationship with Ron Paul a serious friendship. He believes there aren\u2019t nearly enough guns in the US, previously declaring: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the right to bear arms because of burglars; we have the right to bear arms to resist the supreme power of a corrupt and abusive government.\u201d There should be guns in all schools, Vince has also explained, reasoning \u2013 is that the word? \u2013 that \u201cbanning guns is like banning forks in an attempt to stop people getting fat\u201d. You can see what might have drawn him to Mel; after all, there really is no more nuanced study of the possibilities of armed law enforcement in an era of small government than Mad Max.\n\nFor his part, Mel seems to be forming quite the creative association with Vince. At a time when other directors seem less keen to bite, he gave him a role in Hacksaw Ridge, and the pair were seen sitting next to each other at the Golden Globes, where they both stared stonily through Meryl Streep\u2019s speech about Trump\u2019s bullying. If anyone has the artistic courage to invigorate the buddy-cop genre in the era of Black Lives Matter, it is surely this double act, and we must look forward to the announcement that shooting has begun.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Celebrity%2CLife+and+style%2CFilm%2CCulture%2CMel+Gibson%2CVince+Vaughn", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2018/01/10/Marina_Hyde,_L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6476202195914952e48ef41aadb116ff", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05430d1588d1dcafd3a66f22b2e7e49af8fcb94e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=79e82f6a3d3b4fee3fa17d7a06a57d34", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05430d1588d1dcafd3a66f22b2e7e49af8fcb94e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41a02ed2a97cd9fe50594236ffb94af6"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05430d1588d1dcafd3a66f22b2e7e49af8fcb94e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=41a02ed2a97cd9fe50594236ffb94af6", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/apr/27/vince-vaughn-and-mel-gibson-the-hollywood-cops-out-to-prove-all-lives-matter", "title": "Vince Vaughn and Mel Gibson: the Hollywood cops out to prove all lives matter", "meta_data": {"description": "Together at last!
