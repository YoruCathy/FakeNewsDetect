{"url": "www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a8254309/celebrity-feuds-2016/", "text": "1. Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift\n\nIn February, Kanye premiered \u201cFamous\u201d during his New York Fashion Week show at Madison Square Garden. The song raised even the most stubborn of eyebrows because of the lyric, \u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that bitch famous.\u201d Taylor\u2019s squad defended her.\n\nI'm so sad right now & disappointed right now. I stand by my sister. Always. \u2014 Jaime King (@Jaime_King) February 12, 2016\n\nHer brother Austin threw out his Yeezy Boosts.\n\n\n\nKanye later explained in a series of tweets that the idea initially came from Taylor, that they had an \u201chour long convo\u201d about the lyric, and that the song got Kim\u2019s blessing.\n\nAt the Grammys later that month, Taylor delivered a speech likely meant for Kanye.\n\nAs the first woman to win Album of the Year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to all the young women out there \u2014 there are going to be people along the way who are going to try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.\"\n\nAnd to think, Taylor and her \u201cfriend\u201d Kanye\u2019s united front at the VMAs, #yeezy2020, and Kanye\u2019s flower delivery happened just last year!\n\n\n\nWINNER: Neither. (See next entry).\n\n2. Kim Kardashian vs. Taylor Swift\n\nIn June, Kim revealed in a stunning GQ interview that Taylor actually knew about the \u201cFamous\u201d lyrics before the song was released. \u201cWhat rapper would call a girl that he was rapping a line about to get approval?\u201d Kim said at the time. \u201c[Taylor] totally gave the okay.\u201d In the interview, Kim teases the recording of the conversation between Kanye and Taylor for the first time, revealing that a videographer who was hired to record every important Kanye moment (for a future documentary) was there for the phone call.\n\nOn a warm Sunday in July, Kim delivered her promise and posted several videos of Kanye talking to Taylor on the phone via Snapchat. Twitter reacted by throwing a #KimExposedTaylorTaylorParty.\n\nTaylor responded with a note on Instagram, noting that she \u201cwould very much like to be excluded from this narrative.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September, Kim told Wonderland magazine that she\u2019s actually a Swiftie and that \u201cthere was no shade\u201d in leaking the phone call. She also told Billboard that she\u2019s \u201cso over\u201d talking about Taylor and their feud: \u201cI just wanted to protect my husband. I saw him getting a lot of shit \u2026 It wasn\u2019t even about a look or anything, or to have this feud \u2014 it was like, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the truth.\u2019 Done. Let\u2019s all move on. I feel like I don\u2019t want to talk about her anymore.\u201d\n\nWINNER: Kim, by a landslide.\n\n3. Chrissy Teigen vs. Mom Shamers\n\nChrissy delivered multiple clapbacks on Twitter in 2016. For one reason or another, haters thought it was a good idea to call the model out for everything, from her dinner date days after giving birth to Luna to how she should properly hold her daughter.\n\nFunny there's no dad-shaming. When both of us go out to dinner, shame both of us so Chrissy doesn't have to take it all. We'll split it. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) May 11, 2016\n\nIn October, Chrissy made her Twitter account private: \u201cIt\u2019s not haters or trolls or generally mean people,\u201d she wrote at the time. \u201cI just feel like I am absorbing bad shit 24/7. My body and mind cannot handle it anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nWINNER: Chrissy.\n\n\n\n4. Chrissy Teigen and John Legend vs. Piers Morgan\n\nShortly after Muhammad Ali\u2019s death in June, Piers Morgan declared on Twitter that the boxing legend was more racist than Donald Trump. John wrote back, \u201cYou could test us by announcing your retirement\u201d while Chrissy added, \u201cFrom what? Trolling isn\u2019t a job (I\u2019ve tried).\u201d\n\n.@piersmorgan you could test us by announcing your retirement. \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) June 5, 2016\n\nMaybe I should take up a proper job, like modelling? > RT @chrissyteigen: @johnlegend from what? trolling isn't a job (I've tried) \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) June 6, 2016\n\nThe exchange continued, with Piers criticizing Chrissy\u2019s job as a model and Chrissy tweeting that modeling \u201ckeeps me nice and not-racist.\u201d Piers later tweeted at the couple promoting his column \u201cabout Ali & racism,\u201d to which Chrissy wrote, \u201cSorry can\u2019t read, just a model doing modeling. Troll recognize troll. I can\u2019t tweet him anymore. He has fans somehow and they \u2026 they aren\u2019t quite \u2018all there,\u2019 as they say.\u201d\n\n\n\nScreenshot via Daily Express\n\nWINNER: Chrissy and John. (They\u2019re winners every day, TBH).\n\n5. Calvin Harris vs. Taylor Swift\n\nFollowing the demise of Tayvin and the birth of Hiddleswift, Calvin\u2019s social media activity suggested that he was anything but stoked for the new couple. In June, Calvin unfollowed Taylor on Twitter, blocked Swifties, and deleted his breakup tweet, which originally said, \u201cThe only truth here is that a relationship came to an end & what remains is a huge amount of love and respect.\u201d He also tweeted and deleted, \u201cOh boy it\u2019s about to go down,\u201d and blocked Taylor\u2019s brother Austin.\n\nHe blocked Taylor Swift's brother and also deleted all his photos with Taylor Swift. He tweeted this & deleted it. pic.twitter.com/Kl59NMJZFo \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) June 15, 2016\n\nEvidence of the former couple\u2019s relationship also began disappearing on their respective social media accounts, including those beautiful vacation photos.\n\n\n\ntaylor deleted these iconic pics that will forever live in my heart pic.twitter.com/smEFgPPmf7 \u2014 katia (@londonboyys) June 15, 2016\n\nIn July, TMZ reported that Tayvin broke up over songwriting credits for \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d It would later be confirmed that Taylor penned the song under the name \u201cNils Sjoberg.\u201d Calvin wrote \u2014 and deleted, naturally \u2014 several tweets, including one that read, \u201cI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry. I won\u2019t allow it,\" referencing Taylor's long rumored feud with Katy Perry.\n\n\n\nScreenshot | Twitter\n\nThings cooled down in the fall, when Calvin told British GQ that Taylor \u201crespected\u201d his feelings when they were together and that he\u2019s \u201cnot good at being a celebrity.\u201d During New York Fashion Week, Taylor shared an Instagram video of her BFF Gigi Hadid walking the Tommy Hilfiger show. \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d played and Taylor sang along. According to eagle-eyed fans, Calvin liked Taylor\u2019s video, even though he wasn\u2019t following her at the time.\n\nIn October, Taylor performed \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d for the first time at the Formula 1 Grand Prix Weekend in Austin. The show was her only show of 2016.\n\nCalvin thanked Taylor (and Rihanna) in November after the track became the second song released this year to be certified 2x platinum in the U.K.\n\nWINNER: It's a draw. If they\u2019re cool, we\u2019re cool.\n\n\n\n6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift\n\nIn 2016 alone, the long rumored riff between Katy and Taylor had everything, from a perfume named \u201cMad Love\u201d (which was possibly a wink to \u201cBad Blood\u201d) to a Hillary Clinton GIF. In September, Katy told a fan that she would collaborate with Taylor \u201cif she says sorry.\u201d\n\nif she says sorry, sure! \u2014 KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 10, 2016\n\nIn October, Katy spent part of her 32nd birthday voting for Hillary and seeing Kanye West in Los Angeles. Then Katy did this during Kanye\u2019s famous lines in \u201cFamous.\u201d\n\nWINNER: Neither, because let\u2019s face it, this feud is never going to end.\n\n7. Kanye West vs. Jay Z\n\nDuring a \"Saint Pablo\" show in October, Kanye told the crowd that there will \u201cnever be a Watch the Throne 2\u201d and mentioned something about \u201cTidal/Apple bullshit.\u201d He also said he and Drake were the only ones who were supposed to appear on Drake\u2019s \u201cPop Style,\u201d but Jay Z joined as a \u201csurprise.\u201d Kanye went on to say that the Carters have not visited Kim since her Paris robbery. \u201cYou wanna know how I\u2019m feeling? Come by the house. Bring the kids by the house, like we brothers. Let\u2019s sit down \u2026 I can\u2019t take this shit, bro. Our kids ain\u2019t never even played together,\u201d Kanye said, referring to Blue Ivy, North, and Saint.\n\n\"Don't call me, after the robbery, and say 'how you feelin?' You wanna know how I'm feelin? Come by the house,\" - Kanye #SaintPabloTour pic.twitter.com/G6wkIzbY0n \u2014 McKenna (@MoeMunyMoeProbs) October 20, 2016\n\nAt the Nov. 19 show in Sacramento, Kanye delivered a 15-minute speech and covered everything from the VMAs to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, I was hurt 'cause I heard you said you wouldn\u2019t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \u2018Hotline Bling.\u2019\u201d\n\nKanye West CALLS OUT Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z at his concert https://t.co/OCl1QD33fw \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) November 20, 2016\n\nHe continued, \u201cNow, don\u2019t go trying to diss Beyonc\u00e9. She is great. Taylor Swift is great. We are all great people. We are all equal. But sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forgetting who we are just to win. Fuck winning.\u201d Two days later, Kanye canceled the remaining 21 \"Saint Pablo\" shows and checked himself into an L.A. hospital for exhaustion. He was released Nov. 30.\n\nKanye\u2019s comments tie in nicely with the long reported Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 feud, which added a new (rumored) chapter in late October. Page Six reported at the time that Beyonc\u00e9 has \u201cnever genuinely liked Kim\u201d and has never been a fan of Kanye appearing on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. \u201c[She] always gives Kanye a lot of grief whenever he\u2019s done anything for the show,\u201d according to a source.\n\n\n\nWINNER: Kanye, for being ~so real~ especially after what happened to Kim. He just wanted to know why his friend wasn't there for him and his family.\n\n8. Kanye West vs. Wiz Khalifa\n\nKanye nearly broke Twitter when he lashed out against Wiz in January, back when Kanye\u2019s album The Life of Pablo was still using its working title Waves. Wiz reportedly was not happy with Kanye using the same title as rapper Max B\u2019s work. He also tweeted (and then deleted) something about \"KK,\" which Kanye misunderstood as \"Kim Kardashian\" (see Kanye's 16th thought).\n\nScreenshot | Twitter\n\nScreenshot | Twitter\n\nNo one had time to read all of Kanye's tweets, which were mostly deleted that same day. But if you must know, Kanye accused Wiz of stealing \u201cyour whole shit from Cudi\u201d (referring to Kid Cudi), used a crying Kimoji, alluded to Wiz\u2019s \u201ccool pants,\u201d and went through a list of other Kanye thoughts. Kanye also referenced Amber Rose, writing \u201cyou let a stripper trap you.\u201d Other interesting tweets include: \u201cYou own waves???? I own your child,\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have a child if it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\nWiz followed up with some more tweets, including one that confirmed \"KK\" was Khalifa Kush, his very own brand of weed.\n\n\n\nKK is weed fool. Reason's why your not wavy. Go bacc to Swish. https://t.co/7OT4xiQa5V \u2014 Wiz Khalifa (@wizkhalifa) January 27, 2016\n\nI been smashed the idea of that album even existing. I got joints to roll @kanyewest \u2014 Wiz Khalifa (@wizkhalifa) January 27, 2016\n\nKanye later explained why he took down most of the tweets. #PositiveEnergy forever.\n\nHe also issued an apology on Twitter and reminded the world why it\u2019s always a bad idea to include kids in a feud. He followed that up with confirmation that he and Wiz are cool again.\n\n\n\nWINNER: Wiz, even though he kind of started the whole thing.\n\n\n\n9. Kanye West vs. Amber Rose\n\nDuring Kanye and Wiz\u2019s online feud, Amber chimed in and silenced the masses with one epic tweet.\n\nAwww @kanyewest are u mad I'm not around to play in ur asshole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch\u261d \u2014 Amber Rose (@DaRealAmberRose) January 27, 2016\n\nTwo days later, Kanye tried to explain himself, claiming that he \u201cnever let them play with my ass\u201d and that he stays away \u201cfrom that area all together.\u201d\n\nIn June, Kanye shocked the world again and released a very naked music video for \u201cFamous,\u201d starring wax models of Taylor Swift, Donald Trump, George W. Bush, Kim, and Amber Rose. Amber later said on her talk show that while she\u2019s on Kanye\u2019s side when it comes to the \u201cFamous\u201d feud with Taylor, she\u2019d still very much like Kanye to \u201cstay the fuck out of the news \u2026 so I don\u2019t need to talk about your ass anymore.\u201d\n\nWINNER: Amber, for the best tweet of 2016.\n\n10. Mariah Carey vs. Jennifer Lopez\n\nMariah revived her (rumored) decade-long \u201cI Don\u2019t Know Her\u201d feud with J.Lo this year when Mimi told TMZ that she \u201cstill\u201d doesn\u2019t know her. A few days later, J.Lo told Wendy Williams, \u201cShe does say that. She\u2019s forgetful, I guess! We\u2019ve met many times. I don\u2019t know \u2026 I don\u2019t know her that well.\u201d\n\nIn July, Mariah added more fire to her feud, telling Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens, \u201cI don\u2019t know her. What am I supposed to say? I\u2019m not going to put on a thing like we\u2019re all Hollywood and let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re best friends.\u201d\n\nWINNER: Mariah, otherwise she won\u2019t know me/you either.\n\n11. Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz vs. The Kardashians\n\nKim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian have always supported each other, while Chlo\u00eb has never shied away from saying (or tweeting) what\u2019s on her mind. In March, Kim shared an old nude selfie of herself from a 2010 W magazine shoot. Black bars were included, along with the caption, \u201cnothing to wear LOL.\u201d Chlo\u00eb was quick to respond to the naked photo and criticized Kim for setting a bad example for young women. (She was outnumbered, unfortunately, by those who publicly supported Kim, including Ariel Winter, Emily Ratajkowski, Demi Lovato, and Bella Thorne).\n\n@KimKardashian I truly hope you realize how important setting goals are for young women, teaching them we have so much more to offer than- \u2014 Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz (@ChloeGMoretz) March 7, 2016\n\n@KimKardashian - just our bodies. \u2014 Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz (@ChloeGMoretz) March 7, 2016\n\nAround midnight, Kim welcomed Chlo\u00eb to Twitter in the only way Kim, the queen of social media, could:\n\nlet's all welcome @ChloeGMoretz to twitter, since no one knows who she is. your nylon cover is cute boo \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 8, 2016\n\nIn July, just when the #KimExposedTaylorParty was just getting started, Chlo\u00eb found herself in a Twitter war with Khlo\u00e9 and urged everyone to \u201cget their heads out of a hole.\u201d\n\nEveryone in this industry needs to get their heads out of a hole and look around to realize what's ACTUALLY happening in the REAL world \u2014 Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz (@ChloeGMoretz) July 18, 2016\n\nStop wasting your voice on something so petulant and unimportant \u2014 Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz (@ChloeGMoretz) July 18, 2016\n\nKhlo\u00e9 responded by posting two photos that appear to show Chlo\u00eb with her \u201ca hole.\u201d Chlo\u00eb was not here for that.\n\nfact check: first photo is me filming my movie Neighbors 2, the second photo is some girl who was wrongfully photographed \u2014 Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz (@ChloeGMoretz) July 18, 2016\n\nKhlo\u00e9 was not here for Chlo\u00eb\u2019s response, so it was back to Twitter the next morning. At the time, Khlo\u00e9 advised Chlo\u00eb to \u201crefrain from commenting on my family and OUR business (and I will do the same).\u201d\n\nRefrain from commenting on my family and OUR business (and I will do the same) \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) July 18, 2016\n\nIn September, Chlo\u00eb reflected on her feud with the Kardashians in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, saying she gave her attention \u201cto people that didn\u2019t deserve my attention.\u201d She also cited learning from Hillary Clinton that \u201cbeing the most opinionated and loud person in the room is not always the most impactful.\u201d\n\nWINNER: The Kardashians. P.S. Chlo\u00eb shouldn\u2019t include Hillary in this mess. P.P.S.:\n\n12. Kelly Ripa vs. Michael Strahan\n\nLive With Michael and Kelly abruptly became Live With Kelly after Michael Strahan\u2019s surprise announcement in April that he was leaving the show for Good Morning America.\n\nKelly Ripa, who Page Six said saw the move as the \u201cultimate betrayal,\u201d subsequently called in sick for two consecutive days and left the show to find last-minute replacements. Kelly\u2019s camp later confirmed that her leave of absence was actually a \u201cpre-scheduled vacation\u201d with her family to Turks and Caicos. From what Kelly said in her first show back to the weeks leading to Michael\u2019s exit, the co-hosts\u2019 final days together were anything but smooth.\n\n\n\nThe network is still on the hunt for an official replacement, though Live With Kelly has included a star-studded lineup of guest hosts in recent months, including Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Megyn Kelly, Alec Baldwin, and Kelly\u2019s husband Mark Consuelos.\n\nWINNER: Neither. But the real loser here is ABC for not handling the announcement properly. Kelly and Michael deserved better.\n\n13. Justin Bieber vs. Selena Gomez\n\nThe couple formerly known as Jelena spoke about each other in various magazines this year. Justin told GQ that Selena inspired a lot of songs on Purpose and that their current relationship is \u201ccordial.\u201d Speaking to W magazine, Selena said she is \u201cso exhausted \u2026 I honestly am so done. I care about his health and well-being. But I can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d Things got salty in August when Justin shared multiple photos of then-girlfriend Sofia Richie, which led to him lashing out at fans and threats to make his account private.\n\nScreenshot | Instagram\n\nSelena got into the conversation and left a comment on Justin\u2019s account, writing, \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol \u2013 it should be special between you two only. Don\u2019t be mad at your fans. They love you and supported you before any one ever did.\u201d Twitter then briefly threw a #SelenaEndedJustinParty before Selena followed up by posting photos of her own fans and liked posts that dissed Justin. She later apologized, writing on Snapchat, \u201cWhat I said was selfish and pointless.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether or not Justin saw that before or after he deleted his Instagram account. @justinbieber remains in \u201cuser not found\u201d land.\n\nIn late August, Selena announced she was taking time off because of Lupus-related exhaustion, including anxiety, panic attacks, and depression. \"I want to be proactive and focus on maintaining my health and happiness and have decided that the best way forward is to take some time off,\" she said at the time.\n\nWINNER: Justin, even though Selena turned it around by owning her mistake and dealing with her health. That, in many ways, makes her the ultimate winner.\n\n14. Dwayne Johnson vs. Vin Diesel\n\nAfter wrapping his scenes on Fast and Furious 8 in August, Dwayne Johnson got real on Instagram and lashed out at his male co-stars for behaving like \u201cchicken shit\u201d and \u201ccandy asses.\u201d\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t name anyone, all signs pointed to Vin Diesel, who shared a cryptic Instagram video days later. \u201cHonestly, give me a second, and I will tell you everything,\u201d he said.\n\nPage Six reported at the time that the two had been \u201cbutting heads\u201d through production on Fast 8 and that Dwayne \u201clost his patience\u201d with Vin because of his reputation for being difficult on set. \u201cHe shows up late, keeps people waiting, holds up production, and is disrespectful to people on the set.\u201d\n\n\n\nWINNER: The Fast and the Furious franchise, because now I want to see what The Rock\u2019s anger and Vin\u2019s tardiness looks like on the big screen.\n\n15. Azealia Banks vs. Russell Crowe\n\nIn perhaps the most bizarre entertainment story of 2016, Russell Crowe and Azealia Banks both found themselves at the same Hollywood dinner party in October. Things did not go smoothly, when it was reported that the actor kicked Azealia out after she made threats. Azealia, who was a guest of RZA\u2019s, told a different story, claiming that Russell called her the N-word, choked her, and spit on her. Fellow dinner guests stand by Russell\u2019s side, saying that Azealia criticized his taste in \u201cboring white men\u201d music and threatened to stab party guests in the throat.\n\nAfter promising to have the \"receipts\" on Facebook, Azealia later told Us Weekly that she was no longer pressing charges because \"I just want to put my fucking music out.\"\n\nWINNER: Neither, because it's still unclear what happened at that mysterious dinner party.\n\nFollow Peggy on Twitter.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peggy Truong", "Entertainment Writer", "Peggy Is Cosmopolitan.Com S Entertainment Writer", "Specializing In Leonardo Dicaprio", "This Is Us", "The Royals."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a8254309/celebrity-feuds-2016/", "title": "15 Spectacular Celebrity Feuds of 2016", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "15 Spectacular Celebrity Feuds of 2016", "description": "So many Twitter parties, so little time.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a8254309/celebrity-feuds-2016/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-03-16 06:04:53", "published_time": "2016-12-02 03:00:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Celebrity Feuds of 2016 - 16 Biggest Celeb Feuds of the Year", "description": "From Kim Kardashian's feud with Taylor Swift to Taylor's ongoing riff with Kanye West, here's a look back at 2016's most important celebrity feuds.", "keywords": "celebrity feuds, kanye west, kim kardashian, taylor swift, celeb feuds, celeb feuds 2016, twitter war 2016, kim kardashian taylor swift feud, taylor swift feud", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs,celebrity feuds", "sailthru.date": "2016-12-02T15:00:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/celeb-feuds-4-1480626832.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "15 Spectacular Celebrity Feuds of 2016", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1480618800.0, "source": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
