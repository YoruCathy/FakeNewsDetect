See their cutest kissing pics EVER, here!\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton\u2018s lives basically consist of constant, mushy PDA, so it seems crazy to say that they upped the ante in new pics. But they managed to do the impossible! Gwen shared a sweet and intimate moment with her boyfriend on Instagram, which appears to have happened in the greenroom at her Las Vegas residency show. In the pics, which you can see below, Gwen and Blake are kissing tenderly, and she shows the whole moment, from their adoring gaze, to her leaning in for the kiss, and their warm embrace. They look so, so in love.\n\nBlake has been by Gwen\u2019s side since the first night of her Gwen Stefani: I\u2019m Just a Girl show at Planet Hollywood\u2019s Zappos Theater. Gwen shared a peek at her dressing room on her Instagram story that showed a beautiful vase of flowers from Blake, along with a sweet note. It read: \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard on this show. Congrats on opening night. I love you, Blake.\u201d Aww! Gwen drew a heart around the note on Instagram and captioned it, \u201cFrom my best friend.\u201d\n\nTheir love story is so inspiring and beautiful, considering that they both thought it was just going to be a fling. After all, they got together shortly after both getting divorced \u2014 from Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale, respectively. \u201cWe were both coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives and we\u2019re kind of clinging to each other to get through this,\u201d Blake reently said on Sunday TODAY. \u201cBut now here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it\u2019s going to the next level.\u201d\n\nWe assume Gwen\u2019s going to post more adorable PDA pics as Blake continues to support her during her residency. It\u2019s going to be hard to top this batch, though!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gwen_blake-new-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/samantha_wilson.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F29%2Fgwen-stefani-blake-shelton-kissing-las-vegas-show-pics%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3225808", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gwen_blake-new-ftr.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gwen_blake-new-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Wilson", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Political News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/29/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-kissing-las-vegas-show-pics/", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Kiss On The Lips In Their Most PDA-Filled Pics Ever", "meta_data": {"description": "Gwen Stefani posted her cutest PDA pic with Blake Shelton ever!", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Kiss On The Lips In Their Most PDA-Filled Pics Ever", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/29/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-kissing-las-vegas-show-pics/", "description": "Another day, another adorable Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton PDA session!
