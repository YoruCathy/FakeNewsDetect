(June 17th, to those of you who aren't paying attention; don't worry, dad has probably lost track too.) Following a box-office run where it made just over its budget with a $33 million gross, Death Wish 2018 is coming home digitally on 4K Ultra HD May 22nd, and then Blu-ray/DVD/VOD June 5th. It's all in good time to pay tribute to your dad by letting him imagine he'd be an action hero on your behalf, if circumstances ever arose.\n\nThe Blu-ray will include a commentary track by director Eli Roth and producer Roger Birnbaum, a grindhouse-style trailer, a featurette focusing on Roth's direction, extended scenes featuring deejays Mancow and Sway, and deleted scenes with optional Roth/Birnbaum commentary. I'm pleased to premiere one of those scenes right here. It takes place shortly after Paul Kersey (Willis) has had an uncomfortable run-in at a school sporting event for his daughter:\n\nYou can see why it didn't quite make the final cut--it feels like it's over-telling you Paul is a pacifist rather than showing you, and frankly nobody is going into this movie with any doubts about how things end up. As an audience member, you're waiting for him to get pushed over the line and do what Bruce Willis does, and it's a waste of time to take too long establishing the line itself.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what else got deleted, though--perhaps there was an earlier cut with more ambiguity, one that played against Roth's natural instincts for grindhouse exploitation fare. Really, though, if you want something less gung-ho, watch the Charles Bronson version. The remake is unapologetic righteous fury, and will be best enjoyed if you know that going in.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180517173814im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Flukethompson%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FDeathWish.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180517173814im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/144x144/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F02%2Flythompson_avatar_1455125568-400x400.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180517173814im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Flukethompson%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FDeathWish.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Luke Y.
