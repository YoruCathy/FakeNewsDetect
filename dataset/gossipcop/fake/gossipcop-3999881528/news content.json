That\u2019s the claim in one of this week\u2019s new tabloids, which contends that the Duchess of Cambridge had a security guard\u2019s wife make the special delivery. Gossip Cop can correct this bogus report. We\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201cfalse.\u201d\n\n\u201cCraving Kate\u2019s Decree: \u2018My Kingdom For A Pickle!\u2019\u201d blares a headline in the latest issue of Star. In the accompanying story, the publication quotes a so-called \u201cpalace insider\u201d as saying, \u201cWill was thrilled when Kate said she was hungry and asked for a pickle sliced thinly on well-done toast.\u201d Further purports the magazine\u2019s seemingly made-up tipster, \u201cAn SOS was dispatched to the kitchen, but staffers found themselves in an actual pickle; they didn\u2019t have a single one.\u201d Gossip Cop, however, is assured the story is 100 percent manufactured.\n\nA royal source close to the situation tells us the entirety of Star\u2019s latest tale is simply \u201cfalse.\u201d Tellingly, not a single British outlet reported the story, proving that Middleton did not have a jar of pickles delivered to Kensington Palace to fulfil her pregnancy craving. Additionally, establishing that the report never happened, the quotes provided by the magazine appear to be completely bogus. The article leaves a sour taste in our mouth.\n\nUnfortunately, given the outlet\u2019s track record, we\u2019re not remotely surprised by the magazine\u2019s latest piece of royal fiction. Last month, Gossip Cop corrected the often disproven magazine when it falsely alleged that Meghan Markle made Middleton a \u201cmiracle\u201d soup to help cure her morning sickness. And prior to her third pregnancy announcement, we called out the tabloid for wrongly claiming in a baseless cover story that Middleton\u2019s third baby had been confirmed by the palace. Much like those untrue tales, this latest one is equally inaccurate.\n\nSource: gossipcop com\n\nTags: Catherine Duchess of Cambridge, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Royals, British Royals, Kate Middleton, Kate Duchess, Outlet Track Record, Magazine, Pregnancy Craving, Health, Pregnancy", "images": ["http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kensington-Palace-Photo-C-GETTY-IMAGES-0493.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kate-middleton-news-prince-william-latest-royal-1268794-218x150.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kate-Middleton-Queen-royal-family-body-language-2417264-218x150.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kensington-Palace-Photo-C-GETTY-IMAGES-0495.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/cropped-cropped-Diana-Legacy-Header-Logo-Image.png", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kensington-Palace-Photo-C-GETTY-IMAGES-0389.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-harry-heartbreak-meghan-markle-2398711-1-100x70.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kate-Middleton-Prince-William-1268918-218x150.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/The-Pregnant-Duchess-was-spotted-with-Prince-William-at-West-Ham-stadium-Photo-C-GETTY.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2398042-218x150.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/26966006-8201421-Their_recent_photo_featured_Camilla_s_beloved_dogs_also_pictured-m-22_1586384320772-100x70.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2415970-100x70.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-louis-birthday-prince-louis-age-kate-middleton-duchess-of-cambridge-children-2416090-218x150.jpg", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/followusoninstagram.png", "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2415970-218x150.jpg"], "top_img": "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kensington-Palace-Photo-C-GETTY-IMAGES-0389.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://dianalegacy.com/kate-middleton-had-pickles-delivered-to-kensington-palace-to-satisfy-pregnancy-craving/", "title": "Kate Middleton Had Pickles Delivered To Kensington Palace To Satisfy Pregnancy Craving?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "http://dianalegacy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kensington-Palace-Photo-C-GETTY-IMAGES-0389.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 1273}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Middleton Had Pickles Delivered To Kensington Palace To Satisfy Pregnancy Craving? - Dianalegacy Latest Update News Images Videos of British Royal Family", "description": "Kate Middleton Had Pickles Delivered To Kensington Palace To Satisfy Pregnancy Craving?
