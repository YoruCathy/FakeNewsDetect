(Move over, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson!) With Kanye\u2019s behavior growing more erratic by the second, no one can blame the mother-of-three for wanting a divorce.\n\nAccording to Life & Style, Kim believes Kanye is too focused on his career right now, and she\u2019s \u201cdone with her husband always putting himself first.\u201d When the rapper announced he\u2019ll be dropping two new albums in June, it was the final straw.\n\nTrouble is, Kim and Kanye have kids in the mix \u2014 North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, three months \u2014 who make the situation all the more complicated. \u201cKim is pissed that [Kanye will] be off traveling the world promoting his music while she\u2019s left at home feeling like a single mom with three small kids,\u201d the source explained. \u201cShe accuses Kanye of being selfish.\u201d Kanye definitely doesn\u2019t see things that way. In fact, he \u201cdisagrees and blames \u2018selfish\u2019 Kim for their issues,\u201d noted the source. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe Kim is always there for him.\u201d\n\nDespite the 40-year-old\u2019s reservations about his wife\u2019s support, Kim has been on Team Kanye since the beginning \u2014 making his claims all the more outlandish. Even after her sisters Kylie, Khlo\u00e9, and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye on Twitter for his Trump-loving rant, she defended him.\n\nIn fact, Kim didn\u2019t just risk family, but friends too! John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen both unfollowed Kanye in the wake of his \u201cMAGA\u201d tweets, Pedestrian reports, as did Harry Styles, Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Teyana Taylor, and Travis Scott.\n\nWhile the KKW Beauty mogul was willing to put up with Kanye\u2019s antics then, she\u2019s had enough. With two young children and an infant at home, it\u2019s just gotten out of hand. \u201cKim is tired of covering for him and putting out fires that he keeps creating,\u201d added the insider. \u201cShe can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardashian-single-mom-teaser.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardashian-baby-daughter-chicago-videos.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kanye-west-crips.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardashian-kanye-west.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardashian-single-mom-teaser.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kim-kardashian-single-mom-teaser.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Copelton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/kim-kardashian-single-mom-kanye-west-159328/", "title": "Kim Kardashian \"Feels like a Single Mom\" Amid Kanye West's Breakdown", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "The Kardashian baby daddy drama continues, except this time, the spotlight is on Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.
