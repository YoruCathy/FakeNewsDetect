Vanity Fair did not elaborate on the cause of the nerve damage.\n\nBell's Palsy: The facial paralysis that's affected A-listers like Angelina Jolie and George Clooney\n\nJolie, who underwent a hysterectomy in 2015 and a double mastectomy in 2013 after learning she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, also said she has been dealing with more gray hair and drier skin. \"I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s menopause or if it\u2019s just been the year I\u2019ve had,\" she said.\n\nThe year in question is when \"things got bad,\" as Jolie terms it to Vanity Fair, with Brad Pitt, saying trouble began in the summer of 2016 when her upcoming film First They Killed My Father was in postproduction.\n\n\"Things became \u2018difficult,'\" she told the magazine.\n\nShe is adamant, however, that the A-list couple's jet-set lifestyle with their six children was not \"in any way a negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not the problem,\" she said. \"That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children...They\u2019re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I\u2019m very proud of them.\"\n\nJolie praised her children Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9 and Knox, 9, for being \"very brave\" during the divorce.\n\nDivorce negotiations are still ongoing between the couple. As a family, Jolie says, she and the children are still recovering.\n\n\"We\u2019re all just healing from the events that led to the filing...They\u2019re not healing from divorce. They\u2019re healing from some...from life, from things in life,\" she explained somewhat cryptically.\n\nBut the actress-director stays stoic in front of her children, Jolie said. \u201cI do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it\u2019s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything\u2019s going to be all right even when you\u2019re not sure it is.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5522528331001_5522502615001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7be4fa79eb7262a2c588b13982cbbd815d15c3/c=0-232-2391-1583/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366727314258294-AFP-AFP-MO9AQ.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7be4fa79eb7262a2c588b13982cbbd815d15c3/c=0-232-2391-1583/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366727314258294-AFP-AFP-MO9AQ.jpg?width=2391&height=1351&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7be4fa79eb7262a2c588b13982cbbd815d15c3/c=0-232-2391-1583/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366727314258294-AFP-AFP-MO9AQ.jpg?width=2391&height=1351&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/07/26/angelina-jolie-reveals-bells-palsy-diagnosis-breaks-silence-divorce-brad-pitt/513179001/", "title": "Angelina Jolie reveals Bell's Palsy diagnosis, breaks silence on divorce from Brad Pitt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Angelina Jolie reveals Bell's Palsy diagnosis, breaks silence on divorce from Brad Pitt", "description": "Jolie opened up to 'Vanity Fair' about her health issues and divorce from Brad Pitt.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/07/26/angelina-jolie-reveals-bells-palsy-diagnosis-breaks-silence-divorce-brad-pitt/513179001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7be4fa79eb7262a2c588b13982cbbd815d15c3/c=0-232-2391-1583/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366727314258294-AFP-AFP-MO9AQ.jpg?width=2391&height=1351&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2391, "height": 1351}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sara M Moniuszko", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Jolie opened up to 'Vanity Fair' about her health issues and divorce from Brad Pitt.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca7be4fa79eb7262a2c588b13982cbbd815d15c3/c=0-232-2391-1583/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366727314258294-AFP-AFP-MO9AQ.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Angelina Jolie reveals Bell's Palsy diagnosis, breaks silence on divorce from Brad Pitt", "description": "Jolie opened up to 'Vanity Fair' about her health issues and divorce from Brad Pitt."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500998400.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
