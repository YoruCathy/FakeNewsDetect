She knows he\u2019ll record the conversation and sell it. She has high anxiety wondering if this will go on forever.\u201d\n\nDespite her public woes, the 37-year-old has received support from her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\u201cWhat may surprise some is just how supportive Her Majesty has been during the problems Meghan has faced with her family,\u201d claimed a Buckingham Palace insider. \u201cMeghan is in a tough place, and the queen knows it\u2019s completely out of Meghan\u2019s hands. She has only sympathy for what\u2019s been a difficult and distressing situation for her.\u201d\n\nThe palace insider added the 92-year-old monarch has great admiration for the American actress, who became the newest member of the House of Windsor when she married Prince Harry in May.\n\n\u201cWhile Meghan and the queen come from two very different backgrounds and generations, there\u2019s a warmth between the two that\u2019s genuine and loving,\u201d said the source.\n\nHarry, 33, was determined to make sure Elizabeth and Markle had a close bond.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to make sure every family member knew that the queen supported the relationship and how important it would be for Meghan, who\u2019s from a very different background, to feel welcomed and supported,\u201d said another source.\n\nThe insider added it was Harry who requested a sit-down with his grandmother when he knew his romance with Markle was getting serious.\n\n\u201cThe queen became fond of Meghan at their first meeting,\u201d said the insider. \u201cNot just because she\u2019s the charming woman who brought happiness into her grandson\u2019s life, but also because she quickly demonstrated that she\u2019s intelligent, polite and keen to learn.\u201d\n\nJust days before Meghan walked down the aisle in front of millions to marry Harry, she announced her father wouldn\u2019t attend the royal wedding following his heart surgery.\n\n\u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,\u201d she said in a statement released by Kensington Palace. \u201cI have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\nKensington Palace then announced Meghan would be walked down the aisle by Prince Charles, Harry\u2019s father.\n\nMarkle\u2019s surgery followed days of press surrounding his health and speculation on whether or not he\u2019d attend the royal wedding.\n\nHe also stirred headlines when it was revealed he staged paparazzi photos that showed him preparing for the big day.\n\nBack in January, Grant, 53, told Fox News she and her family are new to the spotlight and it can be difficult to cope with the worldwide interest in their personal lives.\n\n\u201cAs much as I love and respect Meg, she\u2019s got security and a publicist and can be protected from all that,\u201d said Grant. \u201cShe and Harry can tell the media to stop. The rest of the family doesn\u2019t have that luxury. I love her, [but] she may not want me saying anything.\n\n\u201cI refuse to be a victim of the media. I\u2019m not going to let them disparage me, embarrass me personally and professionally and not defend myself\u2026 I can only hope she would respect and understand that\u2026 In fact, if I were Meg, I would probably put something out there so that there was some sort of protective mechanism in place where the family couldn\u2019t be tortured as much.\"", "images":
