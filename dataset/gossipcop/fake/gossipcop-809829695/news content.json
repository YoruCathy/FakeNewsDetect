Do names typically follow the normal accent rules, or does it vary?For example, Lopez vs. L\u00f3pez... is there one right way to write this name? Could someone's last name legitimately be Lopez, with no accent? Or is it safe to assume that the proper form will always be L\u00f3pez?\u00a1Muchas gracias a todos!", "images": ["https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/data/avatars/m/81/81690.jpg?1431197438", "https://forum.wordreference.com/WR_fbicon_200x200.png", "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/WR/WR52x32.png", "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/data/avatars/m/239/239878.jpg?1431380508", "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/data/avatars/m/5/5972.jpg?1431489634", "https://cdn77f.wordreference.com/data/avatars/m/50/50822.jpg?1431197407", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://forum.wordreference.com/WR_fbicon_200x200.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/lopez-l%C3%B3pez-accent-on-peoples-names.2507590/", "title": "Lopez /L\u00f3pez (accent on people's names)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Hi all,\n\nNew to the forums -- whoo!  :)  \nI'm wondering about how to know when a written name in Spanish should have an accent -- or if there is a way to...", "og": {"description": "Hi all,\n\nNew to the forums -- whoo!  :)  \nI'm wondering about how to know when a written name in Spanish should have an accent -- or if there is a way to know.
