One of the things that conveys is: These are black celebrities and there\u2019s a white spectator on screen going, \u2018Oh my God, look at what these black people are doing to each other.\u2019 As an audience, we should want to understand how this movie can run into these racist ideas \u2014 and we have to be attentive to the fact that this might allow people to dismiss the idea that domestic violence is in fact a larger societal problem because, \u2018Oh well, it\u2019s a black musician, he took drugs \u2014 what do we expect anyway?\u2019\u201d", "images":
