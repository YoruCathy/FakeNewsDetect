He\u2019s been on the show rundown for a week. Then yesterday, or maybe even as late as last night, Kelly threw a s\u2013t fit and told him he couldn\u2019t do \u2018GMA,\u2019 so he pulled his appearance,\u201d a source told us.\n\nSeacrest, 42, was supposed to appear on the show to promote ABC\u2019s new \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d season with judges Lionel Richie, Katy Perry and Luke Bryan.\n\nSeacrest immediately pulled the plug in order to not upset Ripa \u2014 who famously had a meltdown, stormed off and took a week off when Strahan, 45, quit her show without giving her advance warning in 2016 \u2014 another source added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that Ryan wants to stay on her good side. She\u2019s an executive producer on the show, so she has a lot of pull. It\u2019s fair to say she has a lot of influence over him. He joined her show. It sounds like she still feels threatened,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still bad blood with Kelly and Strahan, and she doesn\u2019t want history to repeat itself and Ryan to be lured to \u2018GMA\u2019 too,\u201d the first source said.\n\nBut ABC brass didn\u2019t bat an eye over Ripa\u2019s tantrum given that they\u2019re indebted to her after the way they handled the Strahan situation when he fled to \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\n\u201cKelly isn\u2019t going to be reprimanded for this, as diva-like as it is, because it\u2019s not worth upsetting her for a three-minute hit with Ryan on \u2018GMA.\u2019 They had the three judges, and the big star Katy Perry, anyway,\u201d the source said.\n\nSeacrest\u2019s rep claimed the abrupt cancellation was due to his schedule on \u201cLive!\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan had wanted to appear on \u2018GMA\u2019 with the new \u2018Idol\u2019 judges \u2026 but with the constant shifting of various schedules, we determined yesterday, along with \u2018GMA,\u2019 as well as ABC/Freemantle producers and publicity teams, that his schedule was too tight given his morning commitments with \u2019Live\u2019 and his radio show, along with \u2018Idol\u2019 production commitments \u2026 To suggest any other reason for him not participating is completely false or a misunderstanding of the facts,\u201d his spokesperson said.\n\nAnother insider added, \u201cHow much prep does he really need for \u2018Live!\u2019? It was really odd and confusing. It\u2019s pretty obvious that she\u2019s difficult to work with.\u201d\n\nA rep for Ripa insisted, \u201cThis story is absolutely not true,\u201d but declined to comment further.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kelly.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kelly.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/04/kelly-ripa-demands-ryan-seacrest-cancel-gma-appearance/", "title": "Kelly Ripa demands Ryan Seacrest cancel \u2018GMA\u2019 appearance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
