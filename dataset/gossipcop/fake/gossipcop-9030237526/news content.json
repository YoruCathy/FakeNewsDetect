Again.\n\nThis time, Kim is facing backlash for \"triggering\" language she used in a video posted to her Instagram stories, in which she and younger sisters Kendall Jenner and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian can be heard discussing Kim's famous physique.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re eating,\u201d Jenner told her sis. \u201cLike you look so skinny.\" Kim replied, \u201cOh my god the compliments!\u201d adding that she's \"down to 119 pounds.\"\n\n\"I will say when I take out my hair extensions I am less,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cYour hair extensions, your a\u2013, your tits, everything, they\u2019re heavy, cause she\u2019s f\u2014\u2014 voluptuous,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cBut she\u2019s anorexic here [gestures to waist], her arms are like pin thin, they\u2019re like my pinky.\u201d\n\nThe video, recorded backstage at a City Hope charity poker event over the weekend, quickly picked up steam on social media, where fans called out the sisters for praising thinness. Others, including the band Best Coast, rebuked Kim for an irresponsible use of her platform, which reaches 114 million followers on Instagram alone.\n\nKim Kardashian being obsessed with her sisters telling her she\u2019s so skinny she looks anorexic on her Instagram story makes me want to throw my phone into outer space \u2014 Best Coast (@BestCoast) July 29, 2018\n\nSomeone just messaged me & said to check out Kim Kardashian\u2019s insta stories, I did & can\u2019t get over what I\u2019ve seen. Kim K has clearly lost weight & her sisters are saying she looks anorexic to which Kim replied \u201cthank you\u201d THANK YOU!!!! Are you serious? \ud83e\udd2c Absolutely gobsmacked! \u2014 Zo\u00eb \ud83d\udc3b (@MammafulZo) July 30, 2018\n\n.@KimKardashian:\n\n\n\nWhen I was told I looked anorexic, I WAS anorexic.\n\n\n\nI hated myself. I hated my body.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately and inexplicably, there are people who look up to and admire you. Please do better for them. \u2014 Katie Sirles (@mister_quint) July 30, 2018\n\nAccording to ANRED, an organization which raises awareness about anorexia nervosa and related eating disorders, more than 8 million people in the United States suffer from an eating disorder, so fan comments are not baseless. The praise of anorexia is considered a trigger to many who are battling the disease, according to the National Eating Disorders Association.\n\nThat being said, Kardashian has, on multiple occasions, championed the body positivity movement, and said she wants to use her very public, very image-based influence for good. \u201cI am empowered by my body,\u201d she wrote in 2016. \u201cI am empowered by showing the world my flaws and not being afraid of what anyone is going to say about me. And I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world.\u201d\n\nPerhaps next time she'll reconsider her choice of words.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F07%2Fgettyimages-988446248.jpg%3Fitok%3DLV0GHKp1", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F07%2Fgettyimages-988446248.jpg%3Fitok%3DLV0GHKp1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-anorexic-comments-backlash", "title": "Why Fans Are Upset About Kim Kardashian's Comments On Her Own Body", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celebrity,News,latest,Kim Kardashian West", "news_keywords": "Celebrity,News,latest,Kim Kardashian West", "description": "Kim Kardashian's fans are calling her out for her \"triggering\" language about her thin physique.", "og": {"title": "Why Fans Are Upset About Kim Kardashian's Comments On Her Own Body", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-anorexic-comments-backlash", "description": "\"I'm down to 119 pounds.\"", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F07%2Fgettyimages-988446248.jpg%3Fitok%3DLV0GHKp1"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-anorexic-comments-backlash", "description": "Kim Kardashian's fans are calling her out for her \"triggering\" language about her thin physique.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F07%2Fgettyimages-988446248.jpg%3Fitok%3DLV0GHKp1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kim-kardashian-anorexic-comments-backlash", "title": "Why Fans Are Upset About Kim Kardashian's Comments On Her Own Body", "description": "\"I'm down to 119 pounds.\"", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2018%2F07%2Fgettyimages-988446248.jpg%3Fitok%3DLV0GHKp1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
