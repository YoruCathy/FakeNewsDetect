They started dating several months later. The pair previously split for a brief period in May 2012 before getting back together the following month.\n\nGaga excitedly confirmed her engagement to Kinney via Instagram in February 2015, sharing a close-up photo of her stunning heart-shape diamond ring. \u201cHe gave me his heart on Valentine\u2019s Day, and I said YES!\u201d she captioned the shot.\n\nThe American Horror Story: Hotel actress, who is rumored to return for the hit FX series\u2019 forthcoming sixth season, also gushed about her longtime beau in a November 2013 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s my best friend,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres. \u201cAnd having your lover be your best friend, I mean, it\u2019s the best thing ever. It\u2019s the best thing I can say about it.\u201d\n\nOf course, the feeling was mutual. In January, Kinney opened up about the first time his love met his mom, Pamela Heisler. \u201cShe was the sweetest thing that ever was,\u201d the hunk told Entertainment Tonight at the time. \u201cShe was a sweetheart. I loved her from the moment I met her.\u201d\n\nGaga previously dated Nebraska native musician L\u00fcc Carl from 2005 to 2010. He was the inspiration behind several of her early songs, including \u201cBoys Boys Boys,\u201d \u201cJudas\u201d and, ironically, \u201cYo\u00fc and I.\u201d\n\nThis would have been the first marriage for both.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/515536988_taylor-kinney-lady-gaga-split-zoom-2c7e653b-00aa-4d91-bfba-3f7fc24860a2.jpg?crop=131px%2C1px%2C1869px%2C981px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/515536988_taylor-kinney-lady-gaga-split-zoom-c644194f-46a1-49e9-ba2e-e174e420a532.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/515536988_taylor-kinney-lady-gaga-split-zoom-2c7e653b-00aa-4d91-bfba-3f7fc24860a2.jpg?crop=131px%2C1px%2C1869px%2C981px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lady-gaga-taylor-kinney-split-after-five-years-together-report-w429811/", "title": "Lady Gaga, Taylor Kinney Split After Five Years Together", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney have split after five years together, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lady Gaga, Taylor Kinney Split After Five Years Together", "description": "Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney have split after five years together, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lady-gaga-taylor-kinney-split-after-five-years-together-report-w429811/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-09T00:06:44+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/515536988_taylor-kinney-lady-gaga-split-zoom-2c7e653b-00aa-4d91-bfba-3f7fc24860a2.jpg?crop=131px%2C1px%2C1869px%2C981px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/515536988_taylor-kinney-lady-gaga-split-zoom-2c7e653b-00aa-4d91-bfba-3f7fc24860a2.jpg?crop=131px%2C1px%2C1869px%2C981px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2016-07-19T16:11:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-09T00:06:44+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lady Gaga and Taylor Kinney have split after five years together, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details", "title": "Lady Gaga, Taylor Kinney Split After Five Years Together", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/515536988_taylor-kinney-lady-gaga-split-zoom-2c7e653b-00aa-4d91-bfba-3f7fc24860a2.jpg?crop=131px%2C1px%2C1869px%2C981px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1468944660.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
