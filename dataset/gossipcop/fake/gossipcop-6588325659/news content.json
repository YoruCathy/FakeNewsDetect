That said, the insider adds, \u201cHe just felt more comfortable [in the guest house] than in the main house with Jen.\u201d\n\nBut eventually, Aniston and Theroux, who wed at their Bel Air abode in 2015, parted ways for good. \u201cIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,\u201d the former couple told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. \u201cThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nThey added, \u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, distance played a role in the pair\u2019s decision to separate. \u201cJen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,\u201d a source told Us after the split news broke. \u201cNew York City wasn\u2019t ever going to be home for Jen.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Jen Heger.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-and-jennifer-aniston-guest-house.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-and-jennifer-aniston-guest-house.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-and-jennifer-aniston-guest-house.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-theroux-stayed-in-guest-house-before-jennifer-aniston-split/", "title": "Justin Theroux Stayed in Guest House Before Jennifer Aniston Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Justin Theroux stayed in the guest house of his mansion with Jennifer Aniston during the final months of their marriage, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Theroux Stayed in Guest House Before Jennifer Aniston Split", "description": "Justin Theroux stayed in the guest house of his mansion with Jennifer Aniston during the final months of their marriage, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-theroux-stayed-in-guest-house-before-jennifer-aniston-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-and-jennifer-aniston-guest-house.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-and-jennifer-aniston-guest-house.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Exclusive", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-19T17:48:16+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Justin Theroux stayed in the guest house of his mansion with Jennifer Aniston during the final months of their marriage, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "title": "Justin Theroux Stayed in Guest House Before Jennifer Aniston Split", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-theroux-and-jennifer-aniston-guest-house.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519062496.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
