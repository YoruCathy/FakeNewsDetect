Liam Hemsworth is reportedly celebrating Christmas along with Miley Cyrus in Nashville, Tennessee \u2014 the hometown of the Hannah Montana actress. An unnamed source told Us Weekly that the couple would be staying in the \u201cLand Down Under\u201d for a while to spend quality time with Liam\u2019s family.\n\nBecause of this, some fans cannot help but speculate that the pair might secretly get married in Australia. Last year, wedding rumors also sparked after Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus attended a New Year\u2019s Eve party together with their blended families.
