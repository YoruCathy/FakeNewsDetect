We\u2019ve got the EXCLUSIVE details.\n\nBlake Shelton, 41, and girlfriend Gwen Stefani, 48, have never been happier, and the icing on the cake would be if they tied the knot. They already live together and spend all of their time with each other so they\u2019re practically married anyway. \u201cTiming is everything for Gwen and Blake, and they both know they will probably marry each other, it\u2019s only a matter of when. They talk about it all the time and they way they live together it\u2019s like they are already married. With their busy schedules, Gwen has even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just eloping on a beach, or in the country somewhere when the romantic mood is right, which is fine by Blake,\u201d a source close to Gwen tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cGwen is happy with Blake and her boys right now and she knows marrying Blake is inevitable. She loves him and couldn\u2019t imagine living without him,\u201d our insider adds. The adorable family unit just got back from spending spring break at Blake\u2019s Oklahoma ranch, and Gwen loved sharing their adventures on her social media. She showed off her three sons playing on ATVs, roasting marshmallows at Blake\u2019s outdoor fire pit and having a great time playing in his lake.\n\nThey made it back to LA and dressed up to go to church on Easter Sunday, with Blake adorably carrying Gwen\u2019s youngest son Apollo, 4, out of the service looking every bit the perfect step-dad, even though he and Gwen aren\u2019t married yet. Her boys absolutely adore the country singer. As we previously told you EXCLUSIVELY, \u201cThe kids say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 to Blake and hug and kiss him whenever they part ways. Even though it\u2019s not official, Blake really is like a father to those kids,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cGwen loves how good Blake is with her boys, their relationship is special and it really means a lot to her. Blake and the boys really do have a special bond and they couldn\u2019t imagine not being in each other\u2019s lives.\u201d", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F06%2Fblake-shelton-gwen-stefani-eloping-marriage-skip-engagement%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3069308", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake-gwen-may-elope-skip-engagement-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake-gwen-may-elope-skip-engagement-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/blake-gwen-may-elope-skip-engagement-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Amelia Edelman", "Jason Pham", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/06/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-eloping-marriage-skip-engagement/", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton May Skip Engagement & Just Elope, Says Source: Marriage Is \u2018Inevitable\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Blake Shelton &amp; Gwen Stefani might just skip an engagement and run off and elope when they're ready to wed.", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton May Skip Engagement & Just Elope, Says Source: Marriage Is \u2018Inevitable\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/06/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-eloping-marriage-skip-engagement/", "description": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are the picture of happiness, and might just skip out on an engagement to run off and tie the knot.
