{"url": "ew.com/article/2008/10/01/i-read-it-so-yo-2/", "text": "Image zoom\n\nHell to the No! type Music\n\nTo quote an old editor here, upon his describing some truly awful work of art: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have watched that with your eyes.\u201d Well, PopWatchers, that\u2019s how I felt about reading Lynne Spears\u2019 new book, Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World.\n\nThis book\u2019s subtitle implies that it is a tell-all, and it\u2019s anything but: Anyone who\u2019s conversant with Wikipedia can learn as much or more about the beleaguered pop star, true or no. In Through the Storm, Lynne tells us a good deal about her non-famous relatives \u2014 her beloved sister Sandra, her British mother Lillian, and Lynne\u2019s husband/Britney\u2019s father, Jamie (described by Lynne as an alcoholic who drags a would-be happy Southern family down the road to dysfunction). But for the most part, the book serves as Lynne\u2019s defense brief \u2014 how it was Britney who chose this life for herself, and how Lynne was only trying to be a supportive mom and do the right thing.\n\nAfter the jump, photographic proof that I not only read every word of the book \u2014 all 30 chapters of it \u2014 underlining choice graphs and carefully annotated important passages (NB: \u201cbarf,\u201d pictured, pg 193). To make it even easier on you, I\u2019ve painstakingly pulled quotes that illustrate what the chapter is about (or just strike me as, y\u2019know, ridiculous). I\u2019m running it in two parts, so come back tomorrow to see how it all turns out. Though chances are you know this already.\n\naddCredit(\u201cAnnotated copy of Through the Storm: Brandon Keim\u201d)\n\nIntroduction: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for parenting advice, you\u2019veopened the wrong book.\u201d \u2014 Um, I\u2019m not looking for parenting advice, but Iclosed the book anyway. When I dropped it while convulsing withlaughter, that is.\n\n1. From Here to There: \u201cI wanted to be in denial, but I couldn\u2019tdeny the video footage unfolding in front of me. It was Britney, andshe was shaving off her beautiful hair. All I could think of was, How could this be? She used tobe the happiest girl in the world. \u2014 Itals hers, tho I\u2019m not sure why. And, hey, thanks for the spoiler, Lynne!\n\n2. Kentwood: [where Britney was raised, and where the Spears clanstill lives]. \u201cThere were moccasins and rattlesnakes galore, but do youthink my parents ever told us to wear shoes? Huck Finn had nothing onus.\u201d \u2014 But you, Lynne, have everything on Mark Twain.\n\n3. Good-Looking Southern Man: [Lynne meets and marries Jamie Spears]\u201dI had agreed to go see Elton John in concert with [Jamie] in NewOrleans. Of course, Elton John was and is my favorite singer\u2026\u201d \u2014 Um,wrong answer, Lynne. Go read some Dr. Spock, and come back when you\u2019ve learned who your favorite singer is.\n\n4. Close Call: I\u2019ll just summarize this one for you, because it\u2019s kind of horrifying, and materializes out of nowhere: En route tothe ER with her brother after a farming incident, Lynne accidentallyhits and kills a young boy on his bike. She devotes two short graphs toit, then moves on to how she is still protecting her own son, Bryan, tothis day. Like he was the one who died. It\u2019s just \u2014 bizarre. Moving on\u2026\n\n5. Wrecking Balls: \u201cLittle did I know that two wrecking balls wereon their way to crash through my perfect life; a tragedy that wouldinstantly alter me for the rest of my life\u2026\u201d \u2013\u2013 Nice metaphor! ThoughI think I prefer, from the introduction, \u201c\u2026the story of a simple Southern woman whose familygot caught in a tornado called fame\u2026\u201d It\u2019s more swishy.\n\n6. Sweet and Bitter: \u201cBritney Jean Spears was born on December 2,1981, after twenty-one hours of labor (but who\u2019s counting?). \u2014 Hey,that\u2019s the time I spent on this book! (Joking, people, joking. Though I do feel as if I\u2019ve given birth to eight different neurotic disorders.)\n\n7. Witnessing a Miracle: Nothing really to quote here, so in summary, Bryan gets sick and has to be airlifted to a hospital in New Orleans. He survives. Mama is happy. End of scene.\n\n8. Friendships: \u201cIn a small town, people know all your business \u2013as if the whole world doesn\u2019t know my business anyway!\u201d \u2014 Which is whyyou\u2019ve written this book, of course.\n\n9. The Other Woman: \u201cIt was just that kind of social drinking thatended up pulling Jamie and all of us beneath that undertow ofalcoholism again.\u201d \u2014 More metaphors, this time water-related. But where\u2019s \u201ccareer on therocks,\u201d \u201cwashed up,\u201d etc?\n\n10. Britney Starts Singing: [Lynne writes a poem to a young Britney]\u201dSometimes when I see / The sparkle in her eye / It makes me sad / Iwant to cry / Cruel world turn away / Spare my Little Star / Let herwit and charming beauty / Go very far.\u201d \u2013 Now, if only Britney put this to a Timbaland beat and opened it with, \u2018It\u2019s my moms, bitch!,\u2019 she\u2019d have another hit single.\n\n11. Here Comes Jamie Lynn: \u201cNine months earlier, we got the shock ofour lives when I found out I was expecting our third child\u2026.Jamie\u2019svasectomy underscored this notion considerably. Turns out he never wentfor that all-important follow-up appointment!\u201d \u2014 I never thought Iwould say this while reading a celebrity memoir, but T.M.I., yo.\n\n12. Teaching: \u201cTeaching was perfect for me. One of the great regretsof my life is quitting in 2000 to go on tour with Britney.\u201d \u2014 cf chapter 3, Dr. Spock.\n\n13. Why Did I Say Yes? [to Britney\u2019s career]: \u201cMaybe this would be agood time to mention that I have never been a manager for either of thegirls, although I was paid for a time to work on Britney\u2019s fan club andweb site.\u201d Well, they do say that motherhood is the toughest job of all.\n\n14. Mama: This chapter is kind of sad, so I\u2019ll keep the snark at bay:Lynne\u2019s mother/Britney\u2019s grandmother dies while Mama Spears, Brit andJamie Lynn are in New York as Brit does the audition circuit. But we dolearn that Lynn Harliss, Justin Timberlake\u2019s mom, lends them money tofly home for the funeral. Lynne says of Justin, \u201c\u2026to me, he will always be that cute, sweet kid from our Mickey Mouse Club days.\u201d\n\n15. Mouseketeer Days: \u201cIn the end, I would not put a cage around that bird.\u201d Obviously someone\u2019s been catching up on her Maya Angelou.\n\nWe\u2019re halfway though, class! Check back tomorrow for the second halfof the syllabus, including lots of Sam Lufti material, and tidbits from Jamie Lynn\u2019s Turn, \u201cMama, I\u2019mPregnant,\u201d and A Mother\u2019s Heart\u2026\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO ENJOY\n\nThe things you\u2019re determined never to watch, read, or hear\n\nA review of Britney\u2019s new single, \u201cWomanizer\u201d", "images":
