That's when she clued everyone watching into the fact that she's actually a pro at doing voices, and her fake baby voice is one that her boyfriend and her friends would rather her not do.\n\nWhy? you ask. Well, because her baby voice isn't cute and cuddly like in an episode of Peppa Pig. No, it's straightup terrifying. Like straight out of Chucky.\n\nCheck it out below and get ready to criiiiiiinge.\n\nAt least in Ariel's case, her fake voice skills pay off\u2026 literally. She gets paid big bucks to use them in movies, so more power to her!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/2048x1024/landscape-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg?resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/2048x1024/landscape-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Noelle Devoe", "Entertainment Editor", "When I'M Not Holed Up In My Room Going On A Completely Unproductive Netflix Binge Or Tumblr Stalking Timoth\u00e9e Chalomet", "I'M Searching For Awesome Celeb News Stories That Seventeen Readers Will Love"], "canonical_link": "https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/movies-tv/news/a46484/ariel-winters-fake-baby-voice-will-make-you-instantly-uncomfortable/", "title": "Ariel Winter's Fake Baby Voice Will Make You Instantly Uncomfortable", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Seventeen", "title": "Ariel Winter's Fake Baby Voice Will Make You Instantly Uncomfortable", "description": "It's the scary movie kind of baby voice.", "url": "https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/movies-tv/news/a46484/ariel-winters-fake-baby-voice-will-make-you-instantly-uncomfortable/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/2048x1024/landscape-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 112965278727107, "pages": 8028997215}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/seventeen", "modified_time": "2017-07-15 09:04:36", "published_time": "2017-04-17 06:54:25", "section": "Movies & TV", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seventeen", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/2048x1024/landscape-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "uQMdsrh02fvs6lNVGcB04v0iEtK1MpGMQ3UF-Fy0RVI", "title": "Ariel Winter's Fake Baby Voice Will Make You Instantly Uncomfortable", "description": "It's the scary movie kind of baby voice.", "keywords": "Ariel Winter,Weird Talent", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/3200x3200/square-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebs & Entertainment,celebrity,movies-tv,Weird Talent,ariel winter", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-17T18:54:25Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/2048x1024/landscape-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/sev.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/3200x3200/square-1492450347-gettyimages-663590682.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Ariel Winter's Fake Baby Voice Will Make You Instantly Uncomfortable", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492383265.0, "source": "http://www.seventeen.com", "summary": ""}
