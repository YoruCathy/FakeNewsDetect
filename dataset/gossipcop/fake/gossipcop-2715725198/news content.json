Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley\u2019s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know where to get started on this \u2018Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold\u2019 controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,\u201d she wrote on Wednesday. \u201cThat Versace dress was fabulous, you think I\u2019m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.\u201d\n\nShe continued to call the discussions \u201csexist,\u201d saying they were \u201ccreating silly distractions from real issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet a grip people,\u201d she finished. \u201cEverything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d\n\nLawrence has since shifted the focus away from her bare limbs and to the crush she shares with most of the Oscar movie-watching planet, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both \u201chot\u201d and \u201ctalented.\u201d\n\n\u201cTimoth\u00e9e, I\u2019m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?\u201d she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. \u201c[I\u2019m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I\u2019m going to swing right in there as soon as he\u2019s, like, 30.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd9221d14714f6de43f70/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd88ae8fd2b3a999c5b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a85de867d9068584d650e15/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Chris-Fischer-Amy-Schumer-Wedding.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd7c907581c4e97c58e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd7c907581c4e97c58d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a282a7b2d48cc419d393d2e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jennifer-Lawrence-Oprah-Interview.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a6607ea47fd88021e400ba6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Razzies-Forgotten-Movies.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood", "Erika Harwoo", "Yohana Dest", "Hilary Weave", "Kenzie Bryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-calls-out-sexist-debate-over-her-versace-dress", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out \u201cSexist\u201d Debate Over Her Versace Dress", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d", "id": "5a8dd8819028ff3af11a186f", "keywords": "fashion,jennifer lawrence,versace,vanities", "news_keywords": "fashion,jennifer lawrence,versace,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a8dd8819028ff3af11a186f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out \u201cSexist\u201d Debate Over Her Versace Dress", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/02/jennifer-lawrence-calls-out-sexist-debate-over-her-versace-dress"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "\u201cIf I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd91a9028ff3af11a1871/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Calls Out \u201cSexist\u201d Debate Over Her Versace Dress"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
