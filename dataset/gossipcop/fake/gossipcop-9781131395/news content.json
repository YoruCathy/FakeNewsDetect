Having appeared as a regular on the television soap opera Another World at age 10, her breakthrough came in the Walt Disney Pictures film The Parent Trap (1998). The film's success led to appearances in the television films Life-Size (2000) and Get a Clue (2002), and the big-screen productions Freaky Friday (2003) and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004).\n\nLohan's early work won her childhood stardom, while the sleeper hit Mean Girls (2004) affirmed her status as a teen idol. After starring in Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), Lohan quickly became the subject of intense media coverage due to a series of personal struggles and legal troubles, as well as a number of stints in rehabilitation facilities due to substance abuse. This period saw her lose several roles and had significantly impacted her career and public image negatively. Thereafter, she appeared in films, including A Prairie Home Companion (2006), Just My Luck (2006), Bobby (2006), and Chapter 27 (2007). In the 2010s, she appeared in few films, among the most notable being Machete (2010), Liz & Dick (2012), and The Canyons (2013). Lohan then appeared on a series of television shows including the docu-series Lindsay (2014), the British series Sick Note (2018), the MTV reality show Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club (2019), and The Masked Singer Australia (2019-present). She also made her stage debut in the London West End production of Speed-the-Plow (2014\u201315).\n\nLohan rose to prominence in the music industry under Casablanca Records, releasing two studio albums, the platinum-certified Speak (2004) and gold-certified A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005). Lohan dabbled in fashion, beginning a line of her own titled 6126 and briefly serving as artistic advisor for Emmanuel Ungaro in 2009. Since 2016, she has developed a series of nightclubs and resorts in Greece.\n\nEarly life\n\nLindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, in The Bronx borough of New York City,[4][6] and grew up in Merrick and Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, New York.[7] She is the eldest child of Dina,[8] and Michael Lohan.[9] Her father, a former Wall Street trader, has been in trouble with the law on several occasions,[10][11] while her mother is a former singer and dancer.[12] Lohan has three younger siblings, all of whom have been models or actors: Michael Jr., who appeared with Lohan in The Parent Trap, Aliana, known as \"Ali\", and Dakota \"Cody\" Lohan. Lohan is of Irish and Italian heritage, and she was raised as a Catholic.[13][dead link] Her maternal antecedents were \"well known Irish Catholic stalwarts\" and her great-grandfather, John L. Sullivan, was a co-founder of the Pro-life Party on Long Island.[14] Lohan attended Cold Spring Harbor High School and Sanford H. Calhoun High School, where she did well in science and mathematics, until grade 11, when she started homeschooling.[13][dead link][15] Lohan is a natural redhead.[16]\n\nLohan's parents married in 1985, separated when Lindsay was three, and later reunited.[10][17] They separated again in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2007.[18][19]\n\nCareer\n\n1989\u201399: Career beginnings\n\nLohan in 2002\n\nLohan began her career as a child model with Ford Models at the age of three.[20][21] She modeled for Calvin Klein Kids and Abercrombie, and appeared in over 60 television commercials for brands like Pizza Hut and Wendy's, as well as a Jell-O spot with Bill Cosby.[20][21] By the age of 10, when Lohan played Alexandra \"Alli\" Fowler in the television soap opera Another World, Soap Opera Magazine said she was already considered a show-business veteran.[20][21][22]\n\nLohan remained in her role on Another World for a year, before leaving to star in Disney's 1998 family comedy The Parent Trap, a remake of the 1961 movie. She played dual roles of twins, separated in infancy, who try to reunite their long-divorced parents, played by Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson.[13][20] The film earned $92 million worldwide, and received largely positive reviews.[23][24] Lohan received unanimous acclaim for her debut performance. Critic Kenneth Turan called Lohan \"the soul of this film as much as Hayley Mills was of the original,\" going on to say that \"she is more adept than her predecessor at creating two distinct personalities.\"[25] The film won Lohan a Young Artist Award for best performance in a feature film as well as a three-film contract with Disney.[20][21][26] At the age of 14, Lohan played Bette Midler's daughter in the pilot episode of the short-lived series Bette, but she resigned her role when the production moved from New York to Los Angeles.[13][27]\n\n2000\u201303: Success with Disney films\n\nContinued work with Disney\n\nLohan starred in two made-for-TV movies: Life-Size alongside Tyra Banks in 2000, and Get a Clue in 2002.[20][21] In 2003, Lohan starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis in the 2003 remake of Disney's family comedy Freaky Friday, playing a mother and daughter who switch bodies and have to take on each other's roles. At Lohan's initiative, her character was rewritten and changed from a Goth style to be more mainstream.[28] Her performance was once again met with significant praise. Critic Roger Ebert wrote that Lohan \"has that Jodie Foster sort of seriousness and intent focus beneath her teenage persona.\"[29] Freaky Friday earned Lohan the award for Breakthrough Performance at the 2004 MTV Movie Awards and, as of 2015 , it remained her most commercially successful film, earning $160 million worldwide as well as an 87 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.[30][31][32]\n\nMusic beginnings\n\nEmilio Estefan and his wife, Gloria Estefan, signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in September 2002.[33] Lohan landed the role as the daughter in Disney's remake, Freaky Friday, also that month, which required her to learn how to play the guitar and to sing. Lohan recorded a song for the film, \"Ultimate\", which was released to Radio Disney to help promote the film. The song peaked at number 18 on Radio Disney's Top 30. Lohan announced that the song was separate from her singing career since many teen idols such as Hilary Duff and Raven-Symon\u00e9 were expanding their careers from acting to singing. In 2003, Lohan recorded four songs that were released for the soundtrack to Lohan's film, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, including a Radio Disney hit, \"Drama Queen (That Girl)\".\n\nShe had begun working with Diane Warren and Randy Jackson, who were going to help write and produce her album. Diane Warren wrote the song \"I Decide\" for Lohan, which was originally going to be on her album.[34] When Lohan decided not to collaborate with Warren and Jackson, \"I Decide\" was instead released on the soundtrack to the film The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and on to Radio Disney.\n\n2004\u201306: Status as teen idol and music releases\n\nDebut album\n\nLohan began writing the tracks on her album in April 2004. \"I write a lot of lyrics and I'm involved in the producing process, because it's like, if I'm singing it, I want it to be something that I can relate to,\" Lohan said. \"I'm just trying to feel it out and see where it goes. I'm playing guitar and I also love to dance, so [the music will be] somewhere along the lines of hip-hop and rock.\"[35]\n\nLohan's debut album, Speak, was released in the United States on December 7, 2004. The album was the first high-seller from Casablanca Records in several years, selling 1,000,000 units in the United States. The album received mostly negative reviews, with critics commenting that Lohan \"isn't a bad singer, but not an extraordinary singer either.\"[36] In the United States, the album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, selling 261,762 copies in its first week.[37] In Germany the album debuted at number 53 and took four weeks to complete its chart run. The first two singles from Speak, \"Rumors\" and \"Over\", were both successes, with \"Over\" topping the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, where it stayed for three weeks. The song also did well internationally in countries such as Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. \"Rumors\" peaked at number six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and also did well in Australia and Germany, where it reached number 14. The music video for \"Rumors\" was nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. Both songs received heavy airplay on MTV's Total Request Live. The final single, \"First\", was released to help promote Lohan's film, Herbie: Fully Loaded. The song earned small success in Australia and Germany. Lohan promoted the album by performing the songs in a number of live appearances. A tour of Taiwan was planned, but later scrapped.[38]\n\nBox-office success\n\nLohan attending a fashion show in 2006.\n\nIn 2004, Lohan had lead roles in two major motion pictures. The first film, Disney's teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, earned a domestic box office total of $29 million, with Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo commenting that it was \"well above expectations as it was strictly for young girls\".[39] But the film did not meet with critical acclaim.[40] Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \"though still a promising star, Lohan will have to do a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions.\"[41] Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. Based in part on the non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes, the film stars Lohan as a previously homeschooled 16-year-old learning to navigate the social cliques of a public high school. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129 million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, \"cementing her status as the new teen movie queen\".[39][42][43] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \"Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy.\"[44] David Rooney from Variety said that \"Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing.\"[45] Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star.[46] Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.[47]\n\nWith Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly. Vanity Fair described how she became a household name. Paparazzi began following her and her love life and partying became frequent targets of gossip sites and the tabloid media.[48][49] Following the film, which was scripted by former \"Not Ready for Prime Time Actress\" Tina Fey and featured several other veterans of Saturday Night Live's \"Not Ready for Prime Time Company\", Lohan hosted the show three times between 2004 and 2006.[20] In 2004, when Lohan was 17, she became the youngest host of the MTV Movie Awards and in 2006 she hosted the 2006 World Music Awards.[50][51]\n\nLohan returned to Disney in 2005, starring in the comedy Herbie: Fully Loaded, the fifth film in the series with the anthropomorphic car Herbie. Fully Loaded earned $144 million worldwide, but it received mixed reviews.[52][53] Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Lohan \"a genuine star who ... seems completely at home on the screen\", while James Berardinelli wrote that \"as bright a starlet as she may be, Lohan ends up playing second fiddle to the car.\"[54][55] In 2005, Lohan became the first person to have a My Scene celebrity doll released by Mattel. She also voiced herself in the animated direct-to-DVD film My Scene Goes Hollywood: The Movie, based on the series of dolls.[56]\n\nSecond album\n\nLohan's second album, A Little More Personal (Raw), was released in December 2005. It peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was eventually certified Gold.[57][58] Lohan co-wrote most of the songs on the album, which received a mixed critical response.[59][60] Slant Magazine called it \"contrived ... for all the so-called weighty subject matter, there's not much meat on these bones.\"[60] Lohan herself directed the music video for the album's only single, \"Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)\", which features her sister Aliana Lohan.[61] The video is a dramatization of the pain Lohan said her family suffered at the hands of her father.[61] It was her first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 57.[62]\n\n2006\u201308: Interruptions and mature film roles\n\nEarly troubles\n\nLohan's next widely released film, the romantic comedy Just My Luck, opened in May 2006 and, according to Variety, earned her over $7 million.[63] The opening weekend box office takings of $5.7 million \"broke lead actress Lindsay Lohan's winning streak\" according to Brandon Gray.[64] The film received poor reviews and earned Lohan her first Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Actress.[65][66] Following Just My Luck, Lohan focused on smaller roles in more mature, independent movies.[67] Robert Altman's ensemble comedy A Prairie Home Companion, based on humorist Garrison Keillor's works, in which Lohan co-stars with Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, had a limited release in June 2006. Peter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone that \"Lohan rises to the occasion, delivering a rock-the-house version of 'Frankie and Johnny.'\"[68] Co-star Streep said of Lohan's acting: \"She's in command of the art form\" and \"completely, visibly living in front of the camera.\"[69] The Emilio Estevez ensemble drama Bobby, about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination, was released in theaters in November 2006. Lohan received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Sharon Stone.[70][71] As part of the Bobby ensemble cast, Lohan was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award.[72]\n\nMature roles and legal problems\n\nLohan's next appearance was in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman, played by Jared Leto, on the day he murders Lennon. Filming finished in early 2006, but the film was not released until March 2008 due to difficulties in finding a distributor.[73][74][75] In May 2007, the drama Georgia Rule was released. In the film, Lohan portrays an out-of-control teenager whose mother (Felicity Huffman) brings her to the house of her own estranged mother (Jane Fonda). Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \"Lohan hits a true note of spiteful princess narcissism.\"[76] During filming in 2006, Lohan was hospitalized, her representative saying \"she was overheated and dehydrated\".[77] In a letter that was made public, studio executive James G. Robinson called Lohan \"irresponsible and unprofessional\". He mentioned \"various late arrivals and absences from the set\" and said that \"we are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'\"[78] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things,[79][80][81][82] which she ultimately lost.[83] In early January 2007, production on the film I Know Who Killed Me was put on hold when Lohan underwent appendix surgery.[84][85][86] While Lohan was in rehab, she continued shooting the film, returning to the facility at night.[87][88] Shortly thereafter, Lohan withdrew from a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, her publicist stating that Lohan needed to \"focus on getting better\".[89][90] Lohan was replaced in The Edge of Love in April 2007, shortly before filming was to begin, with the director citing \"insurance reasons\" and Lohan later explaining that she \"was going through a really bad time then.\"[91][92][93]\n\nIn the wake of her second DUI arrest[clarification needed], Lohan withdrew from a scheduled appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in which she had been due to promote I Know Who Killed Me, a low-budget psychological horror-thriller in which she stars as a stripper with a dual personality.[94] The film premiered in July 2007 to what Entertainment Weekly called \"an abysmal $3.5 million.\"[95] It earned Lohan dual Golden Raspberry awards for Worst Actress, with Lohan coming first and second, tying with herself.[96] Hollywood executives and industry insiders commented that it would be difficult for Lohan to find employment until she could prove that she was sober and reliable, citing possible issues with securing insurance.[97][98][99]\n\n2008\u201311: Continued delays\n\nLohan (center) at the Cynthia Rowley fashion show in 2011\n\nIndependent films\n\nIn May 2008, Lohan made her first screen appearance since I Know Who Killed Me, on ABC's television series Ugly Betty.[100] She guest starred in four episodes as Kimmie Keegan, an old schoolmate of the protagonist Betty Suarez.[101] In the comedy Labor Pains, Lohan plays a woman who pretends to be pregnant. During the shoot, Lohan's manager worked with the paparazzi to encourage the media to show her work, as opposed to partying.[102] It was originally planned for a theatrical release, but instead appeared as a TV movie on the ABC Family cable channel in July 2009, \"a setback for the star\" according to Variety.[103] The premiere received 2.1 million viewers, \"better-than-average\" for the channel according to E! Online.[104] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times wrote that \"this is not a triumphant return of a prodigal child star. ... [Labor Pains] never shakes free of the heavy baggage Ms. Lohan brings to the role.\"[105] Lohan was a guest judge on US TV style contest Project Runway sixth-season premiere episode, which aired in August 2009.[106]\n\nLohan narrated and presented the British television documentary Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, about human trafficking in India. It was filmed during a week in India in December 2009, and transmitted on BBC Three in April 2010.[107][108] The BBC was criticized for having hired Lohan, and while reviewers called the documentary compelling, they also found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting.[109][110][111] Lohan said: \"I hope my presence in India will bring awareness to the really important issues raised in making this film.\"[112] In April 2010, Lohan was let go from the film The Other Side where she had been set to star, with the director saying she was \"not bankable\".[49][113][114]\n\nUnfinished third studio album\n\nFollowing a switch to Universal Motown, Lohan began working on a third album, tentatively titled Spirit in the Dark, in late 2007.[1][115][116] In May 2008, the single \"Bossy\" was released onto digital outlets, and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.[117][118] The song was meant to serve as the lead single from the album. Later that year, Lohan said that work on the album had stalled and that she wanted to avoid the stress of working on movies and music at the same time.[119]\n\nIn June 2010, Lohan was the subject of a fashion shoot in the photographer docu-series Double Exposure on Bravo.[120] Robert Rodriguez's action exploitation film Machete opened in September 2010. In the film, Lohan's character takes drugs, is naked in much of her appearance, and later dons a nun's habit while toting a machine gun. Its critical reviews were mixed. The Washington Post described her character as \"a campier, trampier version of herself \u2013 or at least her tabloid image.\"[121] Premiere.com said she was \"terrible\" while Variety called it \"her best work in some time\".[122][123] Because of her rehabilitation and legal engagements, Lohan did not participate in promotion of the movie.[124][125][126] Lohan filmed a sketch where she is dressed as Marilyn Monroe for Inappropriate Comedy in 2010.

Reviews for the film were generally poor, but several critics praised Lohan's performance. The New Yorker said she was \"overwrought and unfocused\" while Variety called her \"very affecting\" and Salon described her as \"almost incandescent\".[150][151][152] The same month Lohan filled in for Chelsea Handler as host of the cable talk show Chelsea Lately.
