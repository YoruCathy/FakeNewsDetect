It will put her into the worst place ever.\"\n\nDaisy was perhaps one of the most pampered pets in Hollywood, report People.\n\nGallery: Jessica Simpson\n\n\n\nSimpson fed Daisy steak, not dog food, and referred to herself as \"Daisy's Mommy.\" When leaving the house, Simpson left on the air-conditioning for her dog; and when Daisy was sick, Simpson refused visitors so that they wouldn't wake Daisy. She threw Daisy birthday parties, and when she talked about having a \"girls' night in\" with a video, she was talking about herself and Daisy.\n\n\"Jessica has a very small inner circle,\" the friend said. \"But she always had Daisy. Daisy gave her unconditional love.\"\n\nAnd, unlike some of the men in her life, the friend added, \"Daisy never betrayed her. Daisy was always there for her. This is serious. Jessica\u2019s heart is broken.\"\n\nWhenever she was out at night, Simpson called home and had \"someone put Daisy on the phone so she could say goodnight.\"\n\n\"Daisy ran the household,\" the friend said. \"If Daisy didn\u2019t like you, you were gone. Sometimes if her regular hair and makeup people weren\u2019t available and Jessica had a sit-in, if Daisy didn\u2019t like them, they wouldn\u2019t be back. Daisy ran the roost.\"\n\nWhen Simpson was having relationship problems, \"she would cry herself to sleep at night, using Daisy as a pillow.\"", "images": ["https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/t3-resources/prod/publications/smedia/MHR/dailytelegraph_scrim.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?esi=true&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_channel=desktop&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_mr&td_section=news", "https://identityssl.newscdn.com.au/legacy/img/anon.png", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e6858c8e27c6e1facae6366ac948c696", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/91cf0d1f2b1670a784541ffef04bc7e9", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/?maxRelated=5&query=categories.value:%2522/section/dailytelegraph.com.au/collection/popular-content/all/24hours/%2522+AND+origin:omniture+AND+domains:dailytelegraph.com.au&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_contentlist/index&td_contentlistTitle=Most%2520viewed&td_device=desktop&td_eventKey=event67&td_isSubscriber=false", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/29ac8cbe8de849f8e8b2ec1af4e66099", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/d04ea30b62712cd866fec74dc43fee11", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?path=components.footer.footer&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&t_product=DailyTelegraph&w_isArticle=true", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?path=components.header.header&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&t_product=DailyTelegraph&w_device=desktop&w_hideLeaderboard=false&w_section=news", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/22222718733463e1ad452a89051874a4", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/27a7981e9f7772c50c578d0efa15efb8", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?ns_affiliate=DailyTelegraph&ns_border_color=&ns_email_addr=nl.thetelegraph%2540e.thetelegraph.com.au&ns_header=latest+news+sent+to+your+inbox&ns_logo=dailytelegraph&ns_permission=DT_LATESTNEWS&ns_standalone=1&path=widgets.static-templates.newsletter-signup.newsletter-signup&t_domain=www.dailytelegraph.com.au&t_product=DailyTelegraph"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e6858c8e27c6e1facae6366ac948c696", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/friends-fears-for-jessica-simpson/news-story/12e019ca6511a4e42a56c803d5cff4bb", "title": "Friends fears for Jessica Simpson", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "referrer": "origin", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/dailytelegraph/ms-icon-70x70.png", "msapplication-square144x144logo": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/dailytelegraph/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/dailytelegraph/ms-icon-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/dailytelegraph/ms-icon-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-tangram-ui/src/elements/tge-favicons/processed/dailytelegraph/ms-icon-144x144.png", "robots": "noarchive", "description": "JESSICA Simpsons friend are worried that she will spiral into depression following the death of her beloved pooch.
