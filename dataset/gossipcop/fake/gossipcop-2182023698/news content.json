I just love you that\u2019s why I buy them. because you love them!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cLip Sync Battle\u201d commentator tweeted then that she was going to purchase a unicorn charger so Legend might avoid taking it:\n\n@johnlegend take this one u thief \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 8, 2018\n\nAs one Twitter user put it, the two are facing a \u201cpower struggle.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like the two of you are facing a bit of a... power struggle.\n\n\n\nI'll show myself out. \u2014 Jon S. (@SleepiestNinja) February 8, 2018\n\nBut clearly, the charger-stealing scenario hit a nerve with people in relationships.\n\n\u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d star Ruby Rose tweeted at her girlfriend, Jessica Veronica of The Veronicas, and called her out for doing the same thing as Legend:\n\n@Jessicaveronica lol .. You. You are why I need 50000 chargers on my rider. \u2014 Ruby Rose (@RubyRose) February 8, 2018\n\nMany others shared their power struggles:\n\nThis is marriage summed up in one tweet. \u2014 Katie\ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffc (@katiemylady__) February 8, 2018\n\nI\u2019m married to the same kind of person. Who knew so many men loved chargers this way. Nothing makes my day like frantically looking for a charger when I\u2019m on 2%. And he has them all. Every single one for one phone. \u2014 lynnethedreamer (@lynne816) February 8, 2018\n\npretty sure this is a universal husband/ wife struggle. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Pamela Phillips (@pameladphillips) February 8, 2018\n\nThis battle over wall chargers is so relatable lol https://t.co/gq17fYoPES \u2014 KristinLasVegas (@KristinLasVegas) February 8, 2018\n\nTeigen has never shied away from calling out Legend on social media. When the musician posted a beautiful \u2015 but low-quality \u2015 photo on Instagram for his wife\u2019s birthday, Teigen simply commented \u201cHow about a hi-res,\u201d a reference to the blurriness of the picture.\n\nThey also use outlets like Twitter to help each other, like the time Teigen seemingly couldn\u2019t find one of the couple\u2019s toilets (yes, really). Luckily, Legend knew what happened and tweeted an explanation.\n\nAnd despite all the charger-stealing and blurry pictures, Teigen told Us Weekly in a 2016 interview why she won\u2019t ever leave Legend.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who else could put up with all the s**t we are constantly dealing with,\u201d she said. \u201cKids, friends and work are hard, but John is the easiest part of everything.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c7e591e0000dc007ab1fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c93061e000038007ab21b.png?cache=lrdr9tps3b&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5df70b30240000840a5a35d7.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c93061e000038007ab21b.png?cache=lrdr9tps3b&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-phone-chargers_n_5a7c63e9e4b044b3821a25b5", "title": "Chrissy Teigen's Complaint About John Legend 'Is Marriage Summed Up In One Tweet'", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "So relatable.", "keywords": "Twitter,Chrissy Teigen,john legend", "og": {"title": "Chrissy Teigen's Complaint About John Legend 'Is Marriage Summed Up In One Tweet'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c93061e000038007ab21b.png?cache=lrdr9tps3b&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c93061e000038007ab21b.png?cache=lrdr9tps3b&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-phone-chargers_n_5a7c63e9e4b044b3821a25b5", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "So relatable."}, "article": {"tag": "Twitter,Chrissy Teigen,john legend", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-08 14:28:37 -0500", "modified_time": "2018-02-08 14:28:37 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Chrissy Teigen's Complaint About John Legend 'Is Marriage Summed Up In One Tweet'", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a7c93061e000038007ab21b.png?cache=lrdr9tps3b&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "So relatable.", "creator": "ledbettercarly"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a7c63e9e4b044b3821a25b5", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518118117.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
