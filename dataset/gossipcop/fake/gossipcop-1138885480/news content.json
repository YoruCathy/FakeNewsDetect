It's Paris, it's a beautiful city, it's very romantic.\"\n\nCruise, 42, was in Paris to promote the French release of the Steven Spielberg film \"War of the Worlds\" next month.\n\nHe and 26-year-old Holmes went public with their romantic relationship in April. The two have faced repeated rumors of marriage. The relationship started after Cruise split from actress Penelope Cruz, and Holmes and actor Chris Klein called off their long-standing engagement.", "images": ["http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/article/images/font_resize_small.gif", "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/images/twp-50x50.jpg", "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/article/images/font_resize_large.gif", "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/article/images/font_resize_medium.gif"], "top_img": "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/images/twp-50x50.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/17/AR2005061700138.html", "title": "Actor Tom Cruise Proposes to Girlfriend Katie Holmes at Eiffel Tower", "meta_data": {"description": "PARIS (AP)\u00a0- Actor Tom Cruise said he and girlfriend Katie Holmes are engaged, after he popped the question early Friday morning atop the Eiffel Tower.", "DC.date.issued": "2005-06-17", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Actor Tom Cruise Proposes to Girlfriend Katie Holmes at Eiffel Tower", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/17/AR2005061700138.html", "image": "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/images/twp-50x50.jpg"}, "canonical_url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/17/AR2005061700138.html", "profile_description": "PARIS (AP)\u00a0- Actor Tom Cruise said he and girlfriend Katie Holmes are engaged, after he popped the question early Friday morning atop the Eiffel Tower.", "profile_picture": "http://media3.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/images/twp-50x50.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1118937600.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
