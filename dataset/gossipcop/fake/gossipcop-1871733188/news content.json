Then he said it again. I said something like, \u2018Relax Al, this isn\u2019t SNL\u2026we don\u2019t need to rehearse the kiss.\u2019 He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nTweeden continued: \u201cHe repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said \u2018OK\u2019 so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn\u2019t be so nice about it the next time.\u201d\n\nThe sportscaster said she felt \u201cdisgusted and violated\u201d and when she performed the skit with Franken on stage, she turned her head so he couldn\u2019t kiss her on the lips again.\n\nTweeden wrote that on the way home from the tour later that year, she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she was sleeping.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Tweeden wrote. \u201cHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\nFranken released a statement shortly after the accusations broke.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThere\u2019s more I want to say, but the first and most important thing \u2014 and if it\u2019s the only thing you care to hear, that\u2019s fine \u2014 is: I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect women,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t respect men who don\u2019t. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.\u201d\n\nFranken also added, \u201cWhile I don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women\u2019s experiences. I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/leeann-tweeden-al-franken.jpg?w=300", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/leeann-tweeden-al-franken.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/leeann-tweeden-al-franken.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/al-franken-accused-of-groping-radio-host-leeann-tweeden/", "title": "Al Franken Accused of Groping Radio Host Leeann Tweeden", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Radio personality Leeann Tweeden claimed Minnesota Senator Al Franken groped her without consent on Thursday, November 16 \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Al Franken Accused of Groping Radio Host While She Slept", "description": "Radio personality Leeann Tweeden claimed Minnesota Senator Al Franken groped her without consent on Thursday, November 16 \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/al-franken-accused-of-groping-radio-host-leeann-tweeden/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:16:52+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/leeann-tweeden-al-franken.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/leeann-tweeden-al-franken.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-16T20:31:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:16:52+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Radio personality Leeann Tweeden claimed Minnesota Senator Al Franken groped her without consent on Thursday, November 16 \u2014 get the details", "title": "Al Franken Accused of Groping Radio Host While She Slept", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/leeann-tweeden-al-franken.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510864301.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
