Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, however, isn\u2019t your average couple moving in together, so when they do \u2014 they do it big. The couple \u2014 who\u2019ve been hot and heavy for a year now, are taking their relationship to the next level by purchasing a penthouse together.\n\nWhile the couple have been basically living together at Jennifer\u2019s house in Los Angeles, they have now gone in on something as a real committed unit. It\u2019s being reported that J.Lo and A.Rod have been thinking of moving in together for a few months now. Jennifer put up her previous penthouse ( $27 million!) on the market in October. So what\u2019s up with the new place? Here are some deets:\n\nThe penthouse is located at 432 Park Avenue \u2014 also known as the tallest residential building in Manhattan. It cost the couple a whopping $15.32 million (why does it sound like a step down from her previous place?). The penthouse is stacked with three bedrooms, four and half bathrooms, and a library, Curbed reports.\n\nHere\u2019s some more details, according to Variety: \u201cA private elevator landing and a 21-plus-foot entrance gallery lead to a nearly 30-foot square combination living and dining room with 12.5-foot ceilings, solid oak floorboards laid at a herringbone pattern and four, ten-foot square single pane windows with staggering open views to the north and east across the city and the entirety of Central Park.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the cons that have been reported about this building. Some drawbacks to living in the tallest residential building: \u201cI\u2019ve been up in that building, and it sways quite a bit. You can feel it,\u201d New York real estate agent Dolly Lenz tells realtor.com. Some have also said it looks like a trashcan because that was the \u201cinspiration\u201d behind its design. Other reports say, because mostly business-types own places there, that no one is ever in the building.\n\nWell, who gives a damn!? Check out this amazing pictures of the place.", "images": ["https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/jloarod.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=805628919563253&ev=PageView\r\n&noscript=1", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/somacro/facebook.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21175322&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/hl_logo_b64fa010c5d3dfd30743481faf80f810.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2141896119462672&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-1.44.55-PM-300x300.png", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/hl_logo_b64fa010c5d3dfd30743481faf80f810-500x68.png", "http://trc.taboola.com/1157996/log/3/unip?en=view_content", "http://trc.taboola.com/1157996/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/somacro/twitter.png", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/somacro/pinterest.png"], "top_img": "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/jloarod.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hiplatina.com/jennifer-lope-alex-rodriguez-together-penthouse/", "title": "J.Lo and A.Rod Just Bought Their Own Penthouse Together and It\u2019s Insane", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/hiplatina/assets/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "You know it's serious when a couple moves in together, but this new purchase by the hot couple is next level.
