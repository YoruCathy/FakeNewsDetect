She was drunk.\"\n\n\"Then she threatened to expose Ellen as controlling and manipulating,\" added the insider.\n\nThe talk show host allegedly \"flew into a rage\" after finding out about the tapes and checked de Rossi's email account to make sure she hadn't sent out the video to anyone.\n\nDespite their troubles sources tell the magazine the two are \"on their way to repairing their marriage.\"\n\n\"It won't be easy,\" said the insider. \"Portia will always be battling these demons. But they love each other.\"\n\nThe tabloid also claims that de Rossi, 41, entered a rehabilitation center for a 30-day treatment in May. DeGeneres reportedly visited her wife everyday during her stay.\n\nRumors that the couple has been dealing with marital problems had been going around for a while now. Two weeks ago Ok Magazine reported that Rossi and DeGeneres were at odds because the Ally McBeal actress \"resented Ellen's friendship with Sofia [Vergara].\"", "images": ["http://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1291587136758/2020/upi/809790ea4a25950f73b24cc353303048/v1.2/What-to-stream-this-weekend-One-World-concert-blackAF.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7001586709693/2020/upi/910b76f9459951c98b2009c338cc216c/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-April-17-Redman-Jennifer-Garner.jpg", "http://www.upi.com/upi/dw/img/clear.gif", "http://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1081587134333/2020/i/15871364564029/v1.2/Willie-Nelson-to-host-Come-and-Toke-It-variety-show-on-420.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3821587148655/2020/i/15871489794813/v1.2/Party-of-Five-reboot-canceled-after-one-season.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2701587136566/2020/upi/2cfbe4be71b4453faaf0634591592efd/v1.2/Outlander-star-Sam-Heughan-at-a-loss-after-6-years-of-constant-bullying.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2921587144058/2020/i/15871446536126/v1.2/GOT7-shares-monograph-teaser-for-Dye-EP.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/related/8771586963363/1/v1.2/5d7203b760278a013f4805605ebe353d/upi/Moments-from-John-Legends-career.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3381587141242/2020/i/15871427773474/v1.2/Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-keeping-in-touch-with-family-online-amid-pandemic.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6081587121002/2020/upi/59b3e6887b291a5cd730bf5c6ea4bdb3/v1.5/Sam-Smith-Demi-Lovato-compete-in-the-Olympics-in-Im-Ready-video.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5741587127889/2020/upi/07e7496c3237d26e0e9c3fa479aebc1e/v1.5/Swedens-Princess-Sofia-becomes-medical-assistant-amid-COVID-19-pandemic.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/4381405372425/2014/1/3c82e9c42d0551b85137ce03e9562da0/Portia-de-Rossi-reportedly-recorded-fights-with-wife-Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg", "http://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4381405372425/2014/1/3c82e9c42d0551b85137ce03e9562da0/v1.5/Portia-de-Rossi-reportedly-recorded-fights-with-wife-Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8611587139164/2020/i/15871401995432/v1.2/Phoebe-Waller-Bridge-Fleabag-Live-is-darker-weirder-than-TV-show.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/4511587035518/2020/i/15870358022070/v1.5/AEW-Dynamite-Jon-Moxley-defends-AEW-World-Championship.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/5971587143074/2020/i/15871439064058/v1.2/Bob-Saget-to-launch-Here-for-You-podcast-Monday.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9251587151957/2020/upi/a81b2a37776b8ab83b430e2a977dd642/v1.2/Taylor-Swift-cancels-2020-performances.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2121587133719/2020/upi/f970a8b9ba3d09003adae4fab98d40f9/v1.2/Fiona-Apple-releases-new-album-Fetch-the-Bolt-Cutters.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9811587132590/2020/upi/74483ccc1159416248ff58300d87af11/v1.5/Pink-Floyd-to-stream-full-concert-every-Friday.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4381405372425/2014/1/3c82e9c42d0551b85137ce03e9562da0/v1.5/Portia-de-Rossi-reportedly-recorded-fights-with-wife-Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Veronica Linares"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2014/07/14/Portia-de-Rossi-reportedly-recorded-fights-with-wife-Ellen-DeGeneres/4381405372425/", "title": "Portia de Rossi reportedly recorded fights with wife Ellen DeGeneres", "meta_data": {"description": "Portia de Rossi and Ellen DeGeneres' marriage drama continues with new reports claiming de Rossi threatened to release tapes of her fights with DeGeneres.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Portia de Rossi, Ellen DeGeneres", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Portia de Rossi, Ellen DeGeneres", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Portia de Rossi and Ellen DeGeneres' marriage drama continues with new reports claiming de Rossi threatened to release tapes of her fights with DeGeneres.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2014/07/14/Portia-de-Rossi-reportedly-recorded-fights-with-wife-Ellen-DeGeneres/4381405372425/", "title": "Portia de Rossi reportedly recorded fights with wife Ellen DeGeneres", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/4381405372425/2014/4/db754c1e6bde55bb4457cd9c04295167/v1.5/Portia-de-Rossi-reportedly-recorded-fights-with-wife-Ellen-DeGeneres.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1405267200.0, "source": "http://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
