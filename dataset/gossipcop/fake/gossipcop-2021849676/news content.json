If this report about Carrie\u2019s alleged pregnancy is true, she and her husband Mike must be doubly excited.\n\nCould it be? Carrie Underwood, 35, and her husband Mike Fisher, 38, are reportedly expecting twin girls, according to In Touch. And if being three months along isn\u2019t the best news to get Carrie\u2019s mind off of her scary new scar and back to better things, we don\u2019t know what is. She already has one adorable kid in her brood \u2014 Isaiah Michael, who she gave birth to in 2015 \u2014 but \u201cthey\u2019ve been trying for a baby for the past few months,\u201d sources close to the couple told the mag. \u201cShe and Mike are beyond thrilled that their little family is going from three to five in one big jump.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Mike has retired from the NHL makes this report even more exciting! Instead of being on the road with his team, he\u2019d be right at home with his growing fam. In fact, he and Carrie are allegedly already showing off their teamwork, working together to come up with some adorable baby names for the girls. Their main inspiration? The Bible, according to In Touch\u2018s source. \u201cA front-runner is Rachel,\u201d the insider said. \u201cAnd they also love Faith as a name, so maybe those will be the two winners!\u201d Too cute! But baby books aren\u2019t all that they\u2019re flipping through right now. Mike and Carrie reportedly also want the girls\u2019 nursery to be full of fairy tales. \u201cCarrie is a storyteller at heart and she\u2019ll want the twins to be real readers, so their room will be stocked with classic kids\u2019 books.\u201d Can\u2019t you just picture it?\n\nIf this report is true, we are so excited for Carrie to welcome two newborns to her family. She\u2019s had a rough year and this is just the kind of news that could turn the whole thing around. After falling in Nashville and getting \u2014 count \u2019em \u2014 40 stitches, Carrie has been feeling insecure about the scar on her face. She has been slaying red carpets ever since, but maybe all she needs is a beautiful baby bump to get her confidence back up.\n\nBut since Life & Style said the couple was expecting a pair of twin girls six months ago, we\u2019ll be waiting on Carrie\u2019s confirmation before we get too excited. HollywoodLife reached out to Carrie Underwood\u2019s rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/riley_cardoza.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/carrie-underwood-expecting-twins-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/carrie-underwood-expecting-twins-ftr1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F08%2F01%2Fcarrie-underwood-expecting-twins-daughters-pregnant-mike-fisher%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3260275", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/carrie-underwood-expecting-twins-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Riley Cardoza", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/08/01/carrie-underwood-expecting-twins-daughters-pregnant-mike-fisher/", "title": "Carrie Underwood Expecting Twin Girls After Accident Left Her With Scarred Face, Claims New Report", "meta_data": {"description": "What's better than having a baby on board?
