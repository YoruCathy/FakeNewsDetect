In fact, R-Patz even sent K-Stew some flowers to congratulate her on her upcoming \u2018SNL\u2019 performance! Read on for details.\n\nLooks like Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are finally back in a good place once again. As K-Stew prepares to make her big SNL hosting appearance tonight, R-Patz is showing his support for his ex-girlfriend, in a super sweet way. And when it comes to her possibly name checking the Brit during the show, he\u2019s totally not phased!\n\n\u201cRob isn\u2019t worried about Kristen\u2019s SNL performance,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe knows that if she does make reference to him it will be in a light-hearted way, and there won\u2019t be any malice involved. They\u2019re in a pretty good place these days and talk quite often. Rob even sent Kristen a bunch of flowers with a really sweet supportive note, telling her to \u2018break a leg\u2019, he\u2019s super excited for her and how well her career is going right now.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as HollywoodLife.com previously reported, K-Stew is terrified she will mess up on the big night, but vows to just roll with it if things go wrong. \u201cFor six years I\u2019ve been being a total wuss about it. At some point you have to just bite the bullet, you know, and just fail,\u201d she admitted during a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon. On a lighter note she said \u201cit\u2019s been really really fun\u201d rehearsing for the show, so at least she\u2019s having a total blast getting ready for the big night.\n\nThe starlet was asked by E! News back in 2010 why she hadn\u2019t hosted the show, as she was at the height of her Twilight popularity back then. She said she hadn\u2019t been asked and that, \u201cI would love to say yes for sure, but that is really, really scary. I am so critical of myself and then also of people who are on the show. It\u2019s like, \u2018Nope, you\u2019re not funny \u2014 next!\u2019\u201d It may have taken all these years, but she\u2019s finally up for the challenge and we can\u2019t wait to watch!\n\nHollywoodLifers, will you be tuning in to watch Kristen Stewart hosting SNL tonight?
