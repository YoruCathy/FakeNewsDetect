I don\u2019t think mine\u2019s particularly exceptional apart from that we\u2019re both in the public eye.\n\n\u2018But I never thought I would get married. It was not an ambition of mine. It was the opposite.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Brit added: \u2018I couldn\u2019t relate to romantic comedies \u2014 marriage seems to be the whole point of them. Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment.\u2019\n\nThe pair, who are notoriously private about their romance, had been pals years before they worked as an on-screen couple on psychological thriller Dream House in 2010. They began dating the same year and went on to tie the knot in New York in 2011.\n\nRachel Weisz: My marriage to Daniel Craig isn\u2019t particularly exceptional (Picture: Evening Standard Magazine)\n\nShe also touched on the sexual misconduct scandal that has been shaking up Hollywood as she spoke of her friend Sophie Dix, who has accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment.\n\n\u2018My friend Sophie Dix has been talking about this since the 1990s,\u2019 she said. \u2018She would tell anyone who would listen to her story, for the last 20 years. And no-one seemed to care.\u2019\n\nWhen asked why it took two decades for the media to pick up on the allegations against Weinstein, she said of the movie mogul, who denies non-consensual sex: \u2018I think his power was on the wane\u2026\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about economics, (not) turning over the big bucks any more. That\u2019s not an optimistic thing to say, but this is all about power and money.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe full interview appears in this week\u2019s issue of ES Magazine, available on 25 January.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
