I asked my assistant today, \u2018Did I win the Emmy for that? I don\u2019t remember that.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI usually remember things by the food or what I was wearing. Quincy [Jones] sent me a picture and there we are, 1963, at my first Grammys and I don\u2019t know where it was. At a hotel? A theater? I get things like that mixed up.\u201d\n\nStreisand admitted that she didn\u2019t realize the PaleyFest tribute would be on stage at the Dolby. \u201cI thought tonight was going to be at Beverly Hills at the Television Academy,\u201d she said to big laughs. \u201cI really thought that it was a dinner and we\u2019d be sitting around tables and it was a chat. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the Dolby Theatre.\u201d\n\nPrepared or not, Streisand had no trouble reminiscing about her many television projects, which have earned her five primetime Emmys.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of Friday night\u2019s almost hour-long chat with Murphy.\n\nShe was 21 when she appeared on Judy Garland\u2019s variety show. She recalled the 41-year-old Wizard of Oz\u2019s hands to be cold and shaking. \u201cI adored her,\u201d Streisand said. \u201cI loved her. She was so wonderful to me. But it was interesting to observe, that drinking to try to ease the tension of fear\u2026I know what she feels now because she was a legend. It gets harder as you get older.\u201d\n\nStreisand was struck with a paralyzing case of stage fright after she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs during her famous Central Park concert in 1968. She didn\u2019t perform publicly for another almost 30 years unless it was for a political cause or a charity fundraiser. Listening to a self-help tape called Excellence helped her overcome the fear of performing.\n\n\u201cEven today, I don\u2019t really like to talk before I go on,\u201d she said. \u201cI get very quiet. I also got a little pill called Inderoll. 10 milligrams. It did take away my pounding heart because when you have a pounding heart you can\u2019t sing. It effects your vocals.\"\n\nAs for calming her nerves with a glass of wine, Streisand said she doesn\u2019t drink. \u201cI liked rum-and-coke sometimes when I was a teenager,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that little buzz like beer. I like beer but I was never into wines.\u201d\n\nStreisand\u2019s longtime disdain for the press hasn\u2019t subsided. She doesn\u2019t understand why the press is surprised when she asks for photo approvals. \u201cYeah, I want f---ing photo approval,\u201d she said.\n\nShe makes no apologies for being a control-freak. \u201cI would say anybody talented\u2026wants to control their work,\u201d Streisand explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not controlling life. It\u2019s not controlling your life. It\u2019s controlling your work.\u201d\n\nStreisand also says she never experienced a #MeToo moment. \u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those pretty girls with those nice little noses,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re in a strange time now with men and women and the pendulum is swinging this way and that way and it\u2019s going to have to come to the center.\u201d\n\nMost of Streisand\u2019s television watching these days is CNN and MSNBC. However, she enjoys watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire? while she\u2019s exercising. The latest season of Homeland has left her \u201cdisappointed\u201d and Murphy\u2019s American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace too \u201cscary.\u201d \u201cI like the parts with Penelope Cruz and Edgar Ramirez,\u201d she said.\n\nShe has seen parts of the upcoming remake of A Star is Born directed by and starring Bradley Copper opposite Lady Gaga. \u201cIt\u2019s very very good,\u201d Streisand said.\n\nThere was no mention of rumors that Streisand would guest star on Murphy\u2019s upcoming political drama on Netflix with Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Platt. However, when Streisand said she doesn\u2019t like doing more than four takes when she\u2019s acting, Murphy said with a smile, \u201cNoted.\u201d When she talked about still wanting to star as Mama Rose in a Gypsy remake, Ryan offered, \u201cI have a really good Netflix deal, Barbra.\u201d\n\nThe evening ended with The Paley Center for Media president and CEO Maureen J. Reidy presenting the Icon award to Streisand. Anyone hoping to get a quick photo or word with Streisand was out of luck. As soon as she began to walk off stage, seven burly security guards appeared on stage to thwart any overzealous fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Hollywood Reporter.", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Barbra-Streisand-2018-golden-globes-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/billboard-logo-b-20-billboard-1548-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?c596412deda54d9a807d"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Barbra-Streisand-2018-golden-globes-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Malkin"], "canonical_link": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8249682/barbra-streisand-talks-metoo-a-star-is-born-remake-with-lady-gaga", "title": "Barbra Streisand Talks #MeToo, 'A Star Is Born' Remake With Lady Gaga", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-03-17T11:30:43-04:00", "published_time": "2018-03-17T11:30:43-04:00"}, "description": "During her chat with Ryan Murphy Friday (March 16) for the opening night of PaleyFest in Los Angeles, the actress teased that the new film, which she's seen parts of, is \"very, very good.\"", "og": {"description": "During her chat with Ryan Murphy Friday (March 16) for the opening night of PaleyFest in Los Angeles, the actress teased that the new film, which she's seen parts of, is \"very, very good.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Barbra-Streisand-2018-golden-globes-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Barbra Streisand Talks #MeToo, 'A Star Is Born' Remake With Lady Gaga | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8249682/barbra-streisand-talks-metoo-a-star-is-born-remake-with-lady-gaga", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Barbra Streisand Talks #MeToo, 'A Star Is Born' Remake With Lady Gaga", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "During her chat with Ryan Murphy Friday (March 16) for the opening night of PaleyFest in Los Angeles, the actress teased that the new film, which she's seen parts of, is \"very, very good.\"", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Barbra-Streisand-2018-golden-globes-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Barbra Streisand Talks #MeToo, 'A Star Is Born' Remake With Lady Gaga", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521300643.0, "source": "http://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
