The couple have three children together\u2014Aimee, 32, Kelly, 31, and Jack, 30. Conflicting, salacious reports immediately began to emerge about the Osbourne\u2019s split. One said that Ozzy had gone missing after his wife threw him out of their home. Another alleged he\u2019d had an affair with a celebrity hairdresser. There were also concerns that Ozzy had relapsed, which happened the last time the couple split in 2013. On that occasion, the Black Sabbath singer apologized on his Facebook page for what he called his \u201cinsane behavior\u201d while drinking and using drugs for the previous year and a half.\n\nThis time, the couple decided to nip the rumors in the bud before they had a chance to spiral out of control even more. Ozzy told E! News on Monday that the split has nothing to do with a relapse. \u201cI have been sober for three and a quarter years, I have not touched drugs or alcohol in that time. Any reports that I am not sober are completely inaccurate.\u201d A source also told E! that, \u201c[T]he pair mutually agreed that Ozzy would move out of the house temporarily.\u201d\n\nContrary to what other outlets alleged, Ozzy had not gone missing. He was photographed on Monday morning in Los Angeles. He was also spotted on Tuesday with his daughter Aimee, who\u2019s rarely seen in public.\n\nSharon Osbourne didn\u2019t attend Monday\u2019s taping of The Talk, but her co-host Julie Chen addressed her absence. \u201cThere were many tabloid headlines this past weekend about her and Ozzy. Rumors and speculation that they have split up after nearly 34 years of marriage. Sharon understandably took today off. We are sending all of our love to her and her family, and we ask that you do the same.\u201d\n\nOsbourne not only resumed her duties at The Talk on Tuesday, she discussed what was happening in her personal life. She came onto the set holding hands with the other hosts as the audience chanted \u201cSharon! Sharon!\u201d When she sat down, Sharon Osbourne sipped from a tall glass of lemonade as opposed to a mug of coffee, because Beyonc\u00e9 has turned lemonade sipping into the universal symbol of a woman scorned.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been avoiding looking at any pictures or reading anything. I know what\u2019s going on,\u201d Osbourne said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to read about it and see about it because it\u2019s like putting salt in a wound. So I don\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\nShe thanked everyone who for sending her messages of support before confirming that she had thrown her husband out of their home over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Osbourne said. However, \u201cHe\u2019s back, and I\u2019m out of the house . . . I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going, who I\u2019m going with. And I just need time to think. And really think about myself, about what do I really want for . . . Because I\u2019m 63 years of age, and I can\u2019t keep living like this.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Sharon Osbourne isn\u2019t sure if she and Ozzy are headed for a reconciliation or divorce. \u201cAt this point, I cannot answer that because I don\u2019t know what I want . . . I love Ozzy dearly, you know. He\u2019s given me an unbelievable life,\u201d she dished. \u201dHe\u2019s given me three gorgeous children . . . You know, I love him,\u201d she said on The Talk.\n\nNo matter what, she appears to have the support of her children. Yesterday, Kelly Osbourne shared an Instagram photo of herself holding a lemon over her eye and sticking out her tongue with a motivational caption.", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573333906107999878ec37f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573334216107999878ec37fc/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57471e4e55f979a31fa98a12/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/contributor-vf-web-lauren-levine.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cc0061fde9250a6c410738/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573333906107999878ec37f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Le Vine", "Lauren Le Vin", "Eric Spitznage", "Vanity Fai"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/05/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-split-after-33-years-of-marriage", "title": "Sharon Ozzy Osbourne Split After 33 Years of Marriage", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Lauren Le Vine", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne have split after 33 years of marriage.", "id": "573330e076585bd84561c925", "keywords": "style,sharon osbourne,ozzy osbourne,kelly osbourne,jack osbourne,aimee osbourne", "news_keywords": "style,sharon osbourne,ozzy osbourne,kelly osbourne,jack osbourne,aimee osbourne", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "573330e076585bd84561c925", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne have split after 33 years of marriage.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573333906107999878ec37f8/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573333906107999878ec37f8/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The couple had a tumultuous weekend, to say the least.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573333906107999878ec37f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne Open Up About Splitting After 33 Years of Marriage", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/05/sharon-ozzy-osbourne-split-after-33-years-of-marriage"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The couple had a tumultuous weekend, to say the least.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/573333906107999878ec37f8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-sharon-ozzy-osbourne.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Sharon & Ozzy Osbourne Open Up About Splitting After 33 Years of Marriage"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
