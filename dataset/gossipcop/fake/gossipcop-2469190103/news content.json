It creates an \u2018us versus them\u2019 mentality [and tells] members that \u2018wogs\u2019 at law enforcement won\u2019t protect them.\u201d\n\nTony Ortega, editor of \u201cThe Underground Bunker,\u201d told Fox News Scientologists are \u201cnot allowed to file a lawsuit against another Scientologist or report another Scientologist to the authorities.\u201d\n\nOrtega said this has directly impacted the women accusing Masterson of rape.\n\n\u201cFor example, one of Masterson\u2019s accusers \u2026 went to the church in 2003 to report the incident,\u201d Ortega claimed.\n\nCiting inside knowledge of the church, he alleged Scientology leaders asked the accuser to undergo \u201cintensive counseling from May to December 2003, going back into her past lives to find out what evil thing she did then to cause this now.\n\n\"That is how Scientology handled sexual assault,\u201d he added.\n\nOrtega, a journalist who has dedicated his time to investigating the Church of Scientology, claimed members of the church are threatened with being ostracized from the tight-knit community if they go to authorities with sexual assault allegations.\n\nShelton said he saw similar practices during his time as a member of the church.\n\nShelton said Scientologists use an \u201cinternal justice system\u201d that utilizes fear mongering to stop alleged sexual assault victims from going to the police. Shelton also said the interview sessions with alleged victims within the church are routinely filmed.\n\nOrtega said one of Masterson\u2019s accusers was \u201cbrutally interrogated\u201d by a senior member of the organization.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Danny was being interrogated [by a senior member],\u201d Ortega claimed. \u201c\u2026 It would have been videotaped. They are manic about keeping records. To my knowledge, none of this was given to the LAPD.\u201d\n\nOrtega said when the alleged victim took her case to the LAPD to claim the \u201cThat \u201870s Show\u201d star attacked her, the church stepped in once again.\n\n\u201cA little more than a year after the assault, the church bombarded the LAPD with affidavit after affidavit from church members defending Masterson. The church rallied around him.\u201d\n\nShelton predicts the church will stand by Masterson, even as his public image begins to crumble. The actor denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cThey will keep lying, lying and lying,\u201d Shelton said of the church. \u201cThey\u2019ll cover up and double down.\u201d\n\nMasterson was fired by Netflix earlier this week, ending his run on the streaming service\u2019s series \u201cThe Ranch.\u201d\n\nHe has denied the claims against him, saying in part, \"Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one.\"\n\nIn a statement to the media, the Church of Scientology denied it was involved in stifling the claims of Masterson\u2019s accusers.\n\n\u201cThe church adamantly denies that it ever ignores any allegations of criminal behavior, especially at the expense of alleged victims. What is being stated is utterly untrue. This has nothing to do with religion. This story is being manipulated to push a bigoted agenda. The church follows all laws and cooperates with law enforcement. Any statement or implication to the contrary is false.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mafia-Hit-Man.jpg?ve=1&tl=1",
