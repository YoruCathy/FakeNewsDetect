But instead it\u2019s made things worse,\u201d the insider continued.\n\nThe fact that the hip-hop star had been away throughout most of November and December while he was on tour for 4:44 hasn\u2019t help matters either. The source went on, \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 was at home with three children [including twins Sir and Rumi, 6 months] while he was out touring, and she was living in constant fear that he would cheat again.\u201d\n\nNot even their kids have kept their family intact. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay had a short honeymoon phase where they came together for their twins. But that didn\u2019t last. Beyonc\u00e9 can\u2019t seem to get past his cheating,\u201d the insider concluded.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-3.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-5.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-main.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-7.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Untitled-1-88.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-main.jpg?fit=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-2.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-1.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/BeyonceGettyImages-862604114.jpg?resize=365%2C365&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-4.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/beyonce-jayz-cheat-again-main.jpg?fit=800%2C400&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["December"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/beyonce-fears-jay-z-will-cheat-despite-him-coming-clean/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Is Afraid Jay Z Will Cheat Again", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Despite admitting that their marriage was \u201cvery rough\u201d after Jay Z cheated on Beyonc\u00e9, it seemed like things were on the up and up.
