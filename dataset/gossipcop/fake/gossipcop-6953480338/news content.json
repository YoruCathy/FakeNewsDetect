Osborne served as the face of TCM since its launch in 1994; the longtime industry columnist also authored many books on the history of the Oscars, including 1965\u2019s Academy Awards Illustrated and The Official History of the Academy Awards.\n\n\n\nLongtime friend Liza Minnelli said in a statement to Deadline:\n\n\u201cIt was evident to anybody who watched Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies that his knowledge about Hollywood and film was second to none. He was an indispensable guide to viewers who tuned in everyday to hear his thoughts.
