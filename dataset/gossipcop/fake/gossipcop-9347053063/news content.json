The agreement also may only put off the custody hearing for a few weeks, the source added.\n\nStill, there appears to be a temporary truce in play. Was this a matter of Jolie \u201cwaving the white flag,\u201d as Us Weekly put it?\n\nAnother Page Six report earlier this week said that Jolie\u2019s decision to escalate her fight against Pitt was losing her friends in Hollywood \u2014 according to some of those friends. And she was already upset that she had lost Amal and George Clooney as close friends after she filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016.\n\nMoreover, with the Clooneys taking Pitt\u2019s side in the breakup, Jolie also was developing an \u201cinsane\u201d jealousy over Amal Clooney, an international human rights attorney and mother of 1-year-old twins.\n\nJolie believes \u201cAmal has stolen her identity\u201d as the world\u2019s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six. The source added: \u201cAngelina hates all the attention that Amal is getting \u2014 she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s smart, she\u2019s stylish, she has a beautiful family and she\u2019s doing important human rights work.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s humanitarian reputation began to take a hit in June when details spilled out about how a Los Angeles County judge said she risked losing custody if she continued to interfere in Pitt\u2019s relationship with their three sons and three daughters, Maddox, 17, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and 10-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.\n\nSaying it was important for the children\u2019s welfare to have strong bonds with both parents, the judge set up a detailed summer visitation schedule and prohibited Jolie from barring Pitt\u2019s phone and and text access to them.\n\nFamily law experts say the judge\u2019s admonition was unusual in that courts generally trust parents to make the best decisions for their children. \u201cBut when a parent is proving they\u2019re not acting in that way, the court will start imposing sanctions,\u201d Christopher Melcher, a Los Angeles-based family law attorney, told this organization in an interview in June.\n\nMelcher, who is not associated with the Jolie-Pitt case, added it\u2019s pretty \u201crare\u201d for a judge to tell a parent he or she could lose custody if a certain behavior doesn\u2019t change.\n\n\u201cI imagine there were some pretty serious warning signs before the judge made this ruling,\u201d he said.\n\nA source told Page Six that \u201cAngelina lives in such a bubble\u201d in not being able to \u201cunderstand why she herself has become so unpopular in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d was based in London this summer, where she was filming \u201cMaleficent 2.\u201d The children spent much of their summer in London with Jolie, People reported. However, the judge\u2019s visitation schedule allowed Pitt to spend time with the children there and then to have them stay with him in Los Angeles for about a week, where he is based and where he has been shooting Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nIn the past few weeks, Jolie and the children have been back in Los Angeles, where they have been spotted shopping at Whole Foods or going to a movie.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AngelinaKidsPaxGoldenGlobes1.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/britain-royal-wedding1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AngelinaKidsPaxGoldenGlobes1.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
