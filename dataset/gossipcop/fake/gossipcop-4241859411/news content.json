This will always be a subject of dispute between us,\u201d Caitlyn laments. \u201cShe insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn, which obviously means in her mind that she did not know enough.\u201d\n\nWhile Kris appeared to be shocked by the transition, the former Olympian says that on a number of occasions, she dressed as a woman in front of Kris, 61.\n\nCaitlyn also claims she had 36B-cup breasts, due to hormone therapy, when she met Kris in 1990.\n\nAs the years progressed, Caitlyn would steal makeup and clothing from her wife and daughters.\n\n\u201cI have bought makeup how-to books,\u201d Caitlyn adds. \u201cI keep the books, along with my meagre collection of clothing, in a small closet with a lock in the back of my closet. Kris and I have negotiated this, since she is terrified, as I am, of the kids finding something.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly reports that Caitlyn\u2019s stepdaughters, Kourtney, Kim and Khloe are barely speaking to her since excerpts of the book began to leak.\n\nSo far the book reveals Caitlyn\u2019s claims that the late Robert Kardashian confessed to him that he knew OJ Simpson was guilty of murder, that she has started sex reassignment surgery and also that she will never have another female lover and is open to exploring sex with a man once surgery is complete.\n\nThis article
