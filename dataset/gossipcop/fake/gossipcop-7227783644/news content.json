Hot Pockets!\"\n\nSadly, most brides aren't big on punking their guests. Go figure.\n\nCarino, 48, is an agent at CAA, and despite counting Justin Bieber and Harry Styles among his A-list clients, he maintains a relatively low-profile and seems to enjoy the civilian life.\n\nWhich is good, because while there are occasional exceptions (Jay and Bey, Posh and Becks), there's generally only room for one superstar as big as Gaga in a marriage.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--ITmf1nQY--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1499966138/lady-gaga-and-christian-corino.jpg"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--ITmf1nQY--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1499966138/lady-gaga-and-christian-corino.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/02/lady-gaga-and-christian-carino-wedding-plans-revealed/", "title": "Lady Gaga & Christian Carino: Wedding Plans Revealed?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/02/lady-gaga-and-christian-carino-wedding-plans-revealed/", "title": "Lady Gaga & Christian Carino: Wedding Plans Revealed?!", "description": "Lady Gaga and Christian Carino are reportedly engaged.
