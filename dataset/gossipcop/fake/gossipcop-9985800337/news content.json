According to a new report, a source close to the reality star says it\u2019s a \u2018real possibility\u2019!\n\nWill Caitlyn Jenner and her rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins start a family? A source claimed to Radar Online that a baby might be in the cards in the near future. \u201cJenner\u2019s always wanted to be a mother, and now, that\u2019s a real possibility,\u201d Radar Online\u2019s source revealed. \u201cSophia loves children and has been giving Cait little hints that she\u2019s interested in a baby. Cait\u2019s considering it.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Sophia] has always wanted to be a mother and raise a little girl and have the opportunity to do fun, girly things like get her hair and nails done with her and take her shopping for her prom dress,\u201d the source went on to say. \u201cCait\u2019s made it clear to Sophia she doesn\u2019t want the baby to have anything to do with television or reality TV. Fame has destroyed Cait\u2019s relationship with her grown children and she\u2019s not letting that happen again if she and Sophia adopt.\u201d We reached out to Caitlyn\u2019s rep who has denied Radar Online\u2018s report and called it a \u201ccomplete fabrication\u201d.\n\nRecently, Caitlyn was shaded by her ex Linda Thompson for missing Brody Jenner\u2018s wedding. Along with posting a Nihi Sumba Resort, Linda wrote in the caption, \u201cThis is the beautiful location where @brodyjenner & @kaitlynn got married! Yes, it\u2019s on the other side of the world\u2026 But I would\u2019ve gone to the moon and back to share in the joy of my darling son & his beautiful bride getting married! That\u2019s what parents do!\u201d Be sure to check out all the recent pics of Caitlyn and Sophia in our gallery above!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/caitlyn-jenner-and-sophia-hutchinsftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F14%2Fis-caitlyn-jenner-adopting-baby-rumored-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3183639", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/caitlyn-jenner-and-sophia-hutchinsftr.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tim_mcgovern.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/caitlyn-jenner-and-sophia-hutchinsftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Mcgovern", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/14/is-caitlyn-jenner-adopting-baby-rumored-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins/", "title": "Is Caitlyn Jenner, 68, Planning To Adopt?
