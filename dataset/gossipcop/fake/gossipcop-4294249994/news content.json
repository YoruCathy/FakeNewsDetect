For the 100th time, I never \u2018mocked\u2019 a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him \u2018groveling\u2019 when he totally changed a 16-year-old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!\u201d\n\nStreep is one of the most lauded actresses of all-time, with 30 Golden Globes nominations and 19 Oscar nominations, and is one of only six people ever to win three or more acting honors at the Academy Awards. She\u2019s also not the first person the president-elect has called \u201cover-rated\u201d on Twitter since 2012. Ahead, a complete list \u2014 including Streep, President Barack Obama, Jon Stewart, and the cast of Hamilton.\n\n1.
