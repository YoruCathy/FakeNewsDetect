quickly.\n\nThe reality TV queen has apparently taken on the diet plan before doing a naked photo shoot.\n\nApparently, the mum-of-two is keen on showing off her new slimmer figure after dropping all of the baby weight she gained before giving birth to her son Saint West.\n\nInstead of going the regular route of a balanced diet and exercise, Kim is said to be \u2018obsessed\u2019 with achieving her goal weight by any means necessary.\n\nThe 36-year-old is thought to been motivated to change her shape after unedited photos appeared of her bum while she was on holiday in Mexico last April.\n\nAccording to Heat magazine, she has never been more motivated to reach her goal size.\n\n\u2018After those pictures of her bikini body came out, she wanted to crawl under a rock,\u2019 a source told the publication.\n\n\u2018Kim\u2019s obsessed with dropping more weight and won\u2019t eat more than 700 calories a day.\u2019\n\nThe reality star supposedly lives off of a meagre diet of egg whites and blueberries for breakfast, green vegetables for lunch and dinners consisting of sashimi (raw fish) and brocolli.\n\nIt\u2019s not just an insane diet that has changed her appearance however, as Kim is said to have undergone surgery to transform her body in recent months.\n\n\u2018Surgery is always her answer and she has recently undergone a number of figure-sculpting ops, including a boob lift, lipo, upper-arm \u201cfat freezing\u201d, knee tightening and a butt boost,\u2019 the source claims.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she is said to be considering getting Botox, fillers and laser treatments which could end up costing her around $500,000.\n\nKim showed off her new figure at a Balmain opening in LA last week, wearing a long skirt and a tiny crop top, which further accentuated her shrinking frame.", "images": ["https://cdn1.evoke.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/rexfeatures_9773969e-324x235.jpg",
