Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFriends\u201d star, 49, and Theroux, 46, a screenwriter and actor lauded for his performance in HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d were engaged in August of 2012. They married in August 2015 in an intimate but star-studded in the garden of their $21 million minimalist estate in Bel-Air. Jimmy Kimmel officiated, according to Harpers Bazaar.\n\nAniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. As she and Pitt were breaking up, Pitt\u2019s romance with Angelina Jolie became public.\n\nThe announcement that Aniston and Theroux are done comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 49th birthday Sunday in Malibu with girlfriends, including Courtney Cox. Theroux, meanwhile, was across the country for New York fashion week, Us Weekly reported.\n\nSources recently told People that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.\n\n\u201cJustin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,\u201d a source People. \u201cWhen he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it\u2019s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.\u201d\n\nBut Aniston told a story of marital bliss in a conversation with actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, published in September in Harper\u2019s Bazaar. The two shared happy memories of Aniston\u2019s wedding to Theroux. Sedaris, who is a good friend of Theroux\u2019, served as his \u201cbest man.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about that wedding was perfect,\u201d Sedaris said. \u201cEveryone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy.\u201d\n\nAniston said it was \u201cfun\u201d to revisit a video of the wedding Theroux had just given her.\n\nBut the actress, who has a passion for interior design, also talked about the challenges of working together on updating their Bel-Air mansion, which is featured on the March cover of Architectural Digest.\n\n\u201cThey say building houses can make or break a couple,\u201d Aniston said. \u201cI was so used to doing it on my own, and there were moments when I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t say no so fast.\u2019 I have this dialogue with my interior designer where I\u2019ll go: \u2018No. Hate it. Move. Next.\u2019 That can sound a little abrupt, so I had to retool my attitude a bit. It wasn\u2019t very hard because he loved whatever I brought to him.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/leftovers_11.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/leftovers_11.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
