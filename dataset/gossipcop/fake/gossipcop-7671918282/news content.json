News reports that the pair was seen dining at LA hot spot Craig's earlier this week.\n\n\"It was definitely more than just a friendly outing because the girls were seated close to their men.,\" says one witness.\n\nWhile Blake and Kendall were with another couple, onlookers say there was no mistaking the chemistry between them.\n\n\"You could tell Blake was more into Kendall by the way he was staring and smiling at her. He looked very into her,\" the source adds.\n\nWell, it sounds like Kendall might want to enjoy being the center of Blake's attention while she can.\n\nTip-off is right around the corner, and she's apparently persona non-grata at the games.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--vPt4DVGa--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1504176302/kendall-jenner-sizzles.jpg"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--vPt4DVGa--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1504176302/kendall-jenner-sizzles.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/kendall-jenner-banned-from-clippers-games-due-to-blake-griffin-r/", "title": "Kendall Jenner: Banned From Clippers Games Due to Blake Griffin Relationship?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/kendall-jenner-banned-from-clippers-games-due-to-blake-griffin-r/", "title": "Kendall Jenner: Banned From Clippers Games Due to Blake Griffin Relationship?", "description": "Kendall Jenner is dating from Blake Griffin.
