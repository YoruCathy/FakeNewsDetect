All those claims were lies and underscore how the outlet will print anything and everything. As for its current assertion that Pitt is ready to date again, Gossip Cop is told no one in his inner circle has told the untrustworthy site that information.\n\nIt\u2019s simply speculation. Yes, Pitt will date again and it will snow in the winter. All of these occurrences will eventually happen, but HollywoodLies has no insight into it whatsoever. Just two days ago, Gossip Cop nailed HollywoodLife for making up a fake news story about Pitt storming off a movie set because of the stress of his divorce from Jolie. The actor\u2019s rep told Gossip Cop the tale was \u201ctotally false.\u201d Similarly, the latest article about Pitt being \u201cready\u201d to date is also made-up.", "images": ["http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f", "http://www.iheart.com/v8.16.1/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d?ops=contain(740,0)", "https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Brad-Pitt-Dating-.jpg", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Lewittes"], "canonical_link": "//www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-16-sorry-brad-pitt-isnt-ready-to-date-after-angelina-jolie-split/", "title": "Sorry, Brad Pitt Isn't Ready To Date After Angelina Jolie Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "The actor's rep told Gossip Copy the tale was 'totally false' | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d", "description": "The actor's rep told Gossip Copy the tale was 'totally false' | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-16-sorry-brad-pitt-isnt-ready-to-date-after-angelina-jolie-split/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Sorry, Brad Pitt Isn't Ready To Date After Angelina Jolie Split | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d"}, "description": "The actor's rep told Gossip Copy the tale was 'totally false' | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-16-sorry-brad-pitt-isnt-ready-to-date-after-angelina-jolie-split/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Sorry, Brad Pitt Isn't Ready To Date After Angelina Jolie Split | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Sorry, Brad Pitt Isn't Ready To Date After Angelina Jolie Split, sorry,, brad, pitt, isn't, ready, to, date, after, angelina, jolie, split", "parsely-author": "Michael Lewittes", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59bd349b6e392a4b85ece82d", "parsely-link": "http://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-16-sorry-brad-pitt-isnt-ready-to-date-after-angelina-jolie-split/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-16T15:20:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "entertainment-news-national-gossip-celeb-etc", "parsely-title": "Sorry, Brad Pitt Isn't Ready To Date After Angelina Jolie Split", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505491200.0, "source": "http://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
