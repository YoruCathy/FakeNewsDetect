One of this week\u2019s new tabloids claims the former \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d co-stars have become more than friends in the wake of the actor\u2019s split from Anna Faris, but Gossip Cop looked into the situation and we can exclusively set the record straight.\n\nAccording to an article in the latest issue of the National Enquirer, sparks flew between Pratt and Poehler when they recently reconnected at a party for Aubrey Plaza\u2019s new movie Ingrid Goes West. \u201cChris and Amy were friends while filming the show, but something clicked when they saw each other at this party,\u201d a so-called \u201cspy\u201d tells the magazine. \u201cEveryone around them noticed the flirting, and how much fun they seemed to be having laughing at each other\u2019s jokes.\u201d\n\nThe outlet\u2019s questionable insider continues, \u201cThey\u2019ve been getting to know each other in a whole new way. Amy and Chris both have young kids, and exactly the same sense of humor. They\u2019re a perfect match!\u201d But Gossip Cop looked into the alleged relationship, and we\u2019re assured Pratt and Poehler aren\u2019t a couple. A rep for the actor tells us it\u2019s not true, while the actress\u2019s spokesperson dismissed the rumor as \u201cridiculous.\u201d The pair have been friends for years, but there\u2019s simply nothing romantic between the two.\n\nUnfortunately, we\u2019ve had to debunk several phony stories surrounding the actor\u2019s relationship status following his August split from Faris. Gossip Cop recently called out the Enquirer\u2019s sister publication, Star, for falsely claiming Pratt\u2019s friends were pushing him to date Jennifer Lawrence. We also busted the Enquirer\u2019s other sister outlet, OK!, after it made up a story about Faris\u2019 \u201cstruggles to move on\u201d following her separation. The supposed details in that article were all fabricated, and didn\u2019t come from anyone close to the actress. This latest report about Pratt and Poehler\u2019s nonexistent romance is similarly bogus.\n\nRelated slideshow -- Brad Pitt's alleged apology to Jennifer Aniston and more tabloid tales debunked:
