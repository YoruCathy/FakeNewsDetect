NBC has defeated its ABC rival \u201cGood Morning America\u201d every week since Mr. Lauer was removed, something it had not done for four consecutive weeks in more than five years.\n\nThe \u201cToday\u201d lead has narrowed \u2014 the program averaged around 4.4 million viewers the week before Christmas, about 54,000 viewers more than \u201cG.M.A.\u201d \u2014 and there is some uncertainty whether the lead is sustainable. Further, all three morning shows experienced rating drops last year.\n\nA surprise boon from an emergency host isn\u2019t new at NBC. When Brian Williams was suspended for six months in 2015 from his evening newscast after he was caught embellishing stories about a Middle East reporting assignment, Lester Holt replaced him and the show\u2019s viewership figures were strong. Mr. Holt became the permanent replacement later that year.\n\nLikewise, the departures of Charlie Rose from \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and Mr. O\u2019Reilly from Fox News after public allegations of sexual misconduct have done little to disrupt either network. Fox News is still No. 1 among cable news networks in prime time, and the ratings for \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d have held steady while Gayle King and Norah O\u2019Donnell continue in Mr. Rose\u2019s absence. (CBS has not yet hired a replacement.)\n\nMs. Kotb cut her teeth as a local reporter and anchor, including a six-year stint for the CBS affiliate in New Orleans. She joined NBC in 1998 as a correspondent for \u201cDateline.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/business/30-Rutenberg-sub2/30-Rutenberg-sub2-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/world/03Today/merlin_130695032_9202f8df-6660-470a-8f0d-0660ca3ba186-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/world/03Today/03Today-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/world/03Today/03Today-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Koblin", "Prashant S.
