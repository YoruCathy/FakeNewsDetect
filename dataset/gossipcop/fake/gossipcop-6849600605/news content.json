Celebs like Steph & Ayesha Curry, the Kardashians & more shared their Christmas cards on social media for us all to enjoy! See all of the festive family photos!\n\nSeeing as how Hanukkah ends tonight, Dec. 20, and Christmas is five days away, you\u2019ve likely already opened your mailbox to find cards with \u201cHappy Holidays\u201d written across a photo of the family who sent it. But even if you haven\u2019t received a pic of your cousins in Santa hats and ugly sweaters, there are plenty of famous families who want to wish you a Happy New Year. From the British royal family to America\u2019s equivalent (i.e. the Kardashians), there are plenty of celebrities who have taken to social media to share their festive family photos with the world.\n\nSteph, 29, and Ayesha Curry, 28, used announcement design website SimplytoImpress to make their adorable family photo, which the cookbook author shared with her Instagram followers. \u201cExcited to show everyone our 2017 holiday card. Tried SimplytoImpress.com this year and so impressed with how they turned out! They have so many beautiful designs, and it was so easy. Can\u2019t wait to send our cards to all our family and friends. Happy Holidays,\u201d Ayesha captioned the cute pic of her, Steph, their children, Riley and Ryan, and their two dogs.\n\nOther celebrities took a different approach to their card designs. While we typically think of red, green, silver, and gold as the quintessential Christmas colors, Prince William, 35, and Kate Middleton, 35, opted for a much different color scheme for their family photo this year. William and Kate, along with their two adorable children, Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, wore matching baby blue outfits for their seasonal card. Kensington Palace released the adorable image on Dec. 18, and while many thought the matching outfits could be a sign that Kate is pregnant with another son, the picture was taken earlier this year \u2014 possibly before the Duchess of Cambridge even began her pregnancy.\n\nThe Royal family aren\u2019t the only ones to have people looking for baby clues. The Kardashians have slowly been releasing their 2017 Christmas card by releasing a snippet of the image every day leading up to Dec. 25. Kylie Jenner, 20, still hasn\u2019t confirmed her pregnancy, making it even more frustrating that she has yet to show up in any of the shots. But even more odd than Kylie\u2019s absence from the pics is that her sister Khloe Kardashian, 33, does show up but without a baby bump! Seeing as she also hasn\u2019t confirmed that she\u2019s expecting, fans don\u2019t know how to handle her flat tummy in these images of her.\n\nFrom Kevin Hart, 38, to Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi, 30, there are plenty of celebrities who\u2019ve gotten into the spirit of the season by sharing their cards on social media! Click through the gallery above to see all of the festive photos!\n\nHollywoodLifers, which celeb\u2019s holiday card is your favorite?
