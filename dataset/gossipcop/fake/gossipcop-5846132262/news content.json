Justin Theroux also has a role in the 10-episode series, which is based on a 2014 Norwegian show.\n\nHill\u2019s weight has gone up and down dramatically over the past few years. The comedic actor became a household name in 2007 when he starred in Superbad as an overweight high school student. In 2011, he famously lost 40 pounds before appearing in Moneyball with Brad Pitt.\n\nThe Oscar nominee then had to gain 40 pounds for 2015\u2019s War Dogs, only to subsequently slim down with the help of 21 Jump Street costar Channing Tatum.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get in better shape, so I called Channing Tatum and said, \u2018Hey, if I ate less and go to a trainer, will I get in better shape?'\u201d Hill told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show in 2016. \u201cAnd [Tatum] said, \u2018Yes, you dumb motherf\u2013ker, of course, you will. It\u2019s the simplest thing in the entire world.\u201d\n\nHill has credited eating clean, including a Japanese food diet, and not drinking beer as the reason for his weight loss. He also kept a food journal (which he accidentally emailed to Drake) while working with a nutritionist.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-movie-maniac-af82a6c3-7d96-48dc-af55-7ac6816eb77d.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C1193px%2C626px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/emma-stone-jonah-hill-weight-loss-netflix-series-maniac-281e2d5f-3f77-4adc-9fe0-52dcc00846cb.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-movie-maniac-af82a6c3-7d96-48dc-af55-7ac6816eb77d.jpg?crop=0px%2C108px%2C1193px%2C670px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-netflix-series-maniac-1-c10ac5ef-d396-4c59-8bbd-6b88566f87d1.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-movie-maniac-af82a6c3-7d96-48dc-af55-7ac6816eb77d.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C1193px%2C626px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slimmed-downjonah-hill-is-unrecognizable-while-filming-with-emma-stone-w499696/", "title": "Slimmed Down Jonah Hill is Unrecognizable While Filming With Emma Stone", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jonah Hill, who has lost a lot of weight this year, was almost unrecognizable while filming a scene with Emma Stone for Netflix\u2019s \u2018Maniac\u2019 \u2014 see pics", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Skinny\u00a0Jonah Hill Is Almost Unrecognizable While Shooting New Series", "description": "Jonah Hill, who has lost a lot of weight this year, was almost unrecognizable while filming a scene with Emma Stone for Netflix\u2019s \u2018Maniac\u2019 \u2014 see pics", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/slimmed-downjonah-hill-is-unrecognizable-while-filming-with-emma-stone-w499696/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:37:59+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-movie-maniac-af82a6c3-7d96-48dc-af55-7ac6816eb77d.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C1193px%2C626px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-movie-maniac-af82a6c3-7d96-48dc-af55-7ac6816eb77d.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C1193px%2C626px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-26T18:51:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:37:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jonah Hill, who has lost a lot of weight this year, was almost unrecognizable while filming a scene with Emma Stone for Netflix\u2019s \u2018Maniac\u2019 \u2014 see pics", "title": "Skinny\u00a0Jonah Hill Is Almost Unrecognizable While Shooting New Series", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jonah-hill-weight-loss-movie-maniac-af82a6c3-7d96-48dc-af55-7ac6816eb77d.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C1193px%2C626px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503773460.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
