She married the sexiest bachelor alive, and she intends to protect him from any potential honey trap.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the Oscar-winning actor wants to cheat, he will find a way to do it, Amal and her unattractive nannies can not stop him.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/George-and-Amal-Clooney-TheKnotNews.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1bbc0f239e26307a0d93b94f48156aab?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5da8286b584674e0067f8b2976f0b45f?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Barack-Obama-Michelle-Obama-New-York-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/george-and-amal-clooney-divorce-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DylanFisher-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/brad-and-jen-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Amal-Clooney-George-Clooney-Ugly-Nannies.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Amal-Clooney-George-Clooney-Ugly-Nannies.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dylan Fisher", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/amal-clooney-wants-to-hire-ugly-nannies-for-twins-so-george-can-avoid-cheating-24561/", "title": "Amal Clooney Wants To Hire Ugly Nannies For Twins \u2013 So George Can Avoid Cheating", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Dylan Fisher", "news_keywords": "amal clooney, george clooney,", "keywords": "celebrity news, amal clooney, george clooney,", "description": "Amal Clooney is pregnant with twins who are due in June and with the help of husband, George, they are actively looking for nannies - not any nannies", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Amal Clooney Wants To Hire Ugly Nannies For Twins \u2013 So George Can Avoid Cheating", "description": "Amal Clooney is pregnant with twins who are due in June and with the help of husband, George, they are actively looking for nannies - not any nannies", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/amal-clooney-wants-to-hire-ugly-nannies-for-twins-so-george-can-avoid-cheating-24561/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Amal-Clooney-George-Clooney-Ugly-Nannies.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-10", "modified_time": "2017-03-10", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/dylanfisher/", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "george clooney"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489075200.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
