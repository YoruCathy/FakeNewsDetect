On April 15, a year after Kanye West deleted his Twitter account, he returned with a vengeance. Over the next days and weeks, his posts grew increasingly bizarre. \u201cThe psychological zombie effect,\u201d read one. \u201cI\u2019m super chaaaaaarged. Bout to take this whole thing to mars,\u201d read another. After he called himself the \u201cfuture president,\u201d bragged about having \u201cdragon energy,\u201d and announced he\u2019d fired his manager because \u201cI can\u2019t be managed,\u201d speculation spread across the Internet that the rapper, who spent eight days in a psych ward in 2016, was having another breakdown. Wife Kim Kardashian was swift to fight back, tweeting that the media is \u201cso quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive.\u201d\n\nBut Kanye\u2019s problems are more serious than anyone knows, insiders say, and they\u2019ve led to the disintegration of his marriage after nearly four years. \u201cKim is in talks with lawyers about getting a divorce,\u201d a source exclusively tells Life & Style. \u201cKanye\u2019s acting more unpredictable than ever. Things have gotten so bad that Kim and Kanye sleep in separate rooms.\u201d\n\nWhen she needs even more time apart from her husband, Kim, 37, flees their home and takes the kids \u2014 North, 4, Saint, 2, and 3-month-old Chicago \u2014 to stay at mom Kris Jenner\u2019s house. There\u2019s been no escaping his social media meltdown, though. In fact, roughly an hour after he professed his love for President Donald Trump online on April 25, Kanye, 40, admitted in another tweet that \u201cmy wife just called me\u201d and told him to clarify that he doesn\u2019t agree with everything Trump does. But Kanye doesn\u2019t listen to Kim most of the time. She called him out on her own Twitter account the same day for posting photos inside their home when they\u2019d agreed not to. Though she later insisted she was joking, \u201cThey fight constantly \u2014 blow-out fights,\u201d says an insider. \u201cKanye needs professional help. He\u2019s delusional and paranoid. He thinks he\u2019s a savior. He talks to himself, and he talks to people who aren\u2019t actually in the room because he thinks he\u2019s being watched.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s endured his behavior before, but now \u2014 with two young children and an infant at home \u2014 it\u2019s become too much. \u201cKim is tired of covering for him and putting out fires that he keeps creating,\u201d the insider says. \u201cShe can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\nShe initially didn\u2019t want to give up on the marriage. Instead, she tried to stage an intervention for her husband, the insider says, but Kanye wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cHe either got wind of it or just assumed it was coming because he told Kim, \u2018Don\u2019t even think about trying to do an intervention on me,\u2019\u201d reveals the insider. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want help \u2014 he thinks he\u2019s fine. He says he doesn\u2019t have any mental problems or issues with anything like addiction.\u201d\n\nMaking matters worse, Kanye also announced he\u2019s dropping two new albums in June. \u201cKim is pissed that he\u2019ll be off traveling the world promoting his music while she\u2019s left at home feeling like a single mom with three small kids,\u201d says the source. \u201cShe accuses Kanye of being selfish and has told pals that she\u2019s done with her husband always putting himself first.\u201d Kanye, naturally, sees things differently. Stubborn Kanye \u201cdisagrees and blames \u2018selfish\u2019 Kim for their issues,\u201d notes the source. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe Kim is always there for him.\u201d\n\nShe certainly was by his side in November 2016. On Nov. 21, Kanye was hand-cuffed to a gurney and admitted to LA\u2019s UCLA Medical Center following four days of \u201ccrying fits, violence, sleep deprivation, and drug use\u201d that were caught on videotape, according to a second insider. Kim, who had just landed in NYC when word of the breakdown reached her, immediately flew home to be by the designer\u2019s side during his ensuing eight-day stay in the hospital. Hot 97 radio host Ebro Darden recently claimed Kanye told him being \u201caddicted to opioids\u201d led to the hospitalization \u2014 but that\u2019s not what Kim and Kanye said at the time. Kim actually blamed the trauma of her own robbery at gunpoint in Paris a month earlier for Kanye\u2019s psychological snap. When Kanye later filed suit against insurance company Lloyd\u2019s (to get them to pay the $10.8M and fees he claimed they owed for 23 concerts that were canceled due to what he said was a \u201cdebilitating medical condition\u201d), Lloyd\u2019s alleged his breakdown was brought on by drug abuse. An attorney for the company claimed Kanye was seen on video saying he popped two Percocets at a time and \u201cstated words to the effect that \u2018this is all about getting off of drugs, bad drugs.\u2019\u201d But Kim said in sworn testimony that her husband only took one Percocet at a time and had a valid prescription. As for the liquid and traditional marijuana the rapper used? His lawyers pointed out that it had been legalized in California. The case was finally dismissed in February 2018 with both parties saying the matter had been \u201camicably\u201d resolved.\n\nKanye kept a low profile for months after he left UCLA. But now his bizarre behavior has Kim experiencing de\u0301ja\u0300 vu. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid for Kanye, herself, and her family. That\u2019s the main reason Kim wants a divorce,\u201d says the insider. \u201cShe\u2019s tired of the confrontations. She wants a clean break.\u201d\n\nOne thing she doesn\u2019t have to worry about: protecting her $175 million fortune. \u201cShe\u2019s relieved to have a prenup in place,\u201d says the source. Kanye, who announced on Twitter in 2016 that he had $53 million in personal debt, \u201cis known for spending money like water, and his finances have been up and down for years. With him acting up right now, she\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll make irrational decisions and splash out millions on anything and everything. She\u2019s spent years building her brand and is determined to protect her assets no matter what it takes.\u201d\n\nSmart move. \u201cHe really has no respect for the dollar,\u201d rapper pal GLC, who grew up with Kanye in Chicago, tells Life & Style. \u201cI remember him spending outrageously. He might have a couple tens of thousands of dollars to his name but when it was time to be on the road and make appearances, he\u2019d spend it on clothes.\u201d\n\nNo one\u2019s as protective of the Kardashian fortune as Kris, 62. But surprisingly, she\u2019s taking her son-in-law\u2019s side, both publicly and privately. On April 24, after reports surfaced that Kanye was hard to deal with and fighting with Kris and Kim, the momager tweeted, \u201cLies, Lies, Lies\u201d and \u201cNope\u2026not true!\u201d She\u2019s just trying to cover for Kanye, says the insider. But even behind closed doors, she isn\u2019t throwing him under the bus. \u201cKris is trying to persuade Kim to work things out with Kanye,\u201d says the source. \u201cShe sees them as the ultimate power couple and wants to keep it that way. Despite Kanye\u2019s faults, Kris likes him and thinks he\u2019s a great dad. She\u2019s trying to talk Kim out of filing for divorce.\u201d\n\nIt will be an uphill battle for Kris. \u201cKim has tried over and over again to work things out with Kanye, and has come to the conclusion that a leopard doesn\u2019t change its spots,\u201d says the source. \u201cShe\u2019s finally reached her breaking point,\u201d adds the insider. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to work this out.\u201d\n\nLove the Kardashian kids?
