The \u2018Wolves\u2019 singer looked upset in an Instagram story that said she needed \u2018alone time.\u2019 Is she sad about how things are going with Justin Bieber?\n\nSelena Gomez, 25, has been living her best life lately. From being named Billboard\u2018s Woman of the Year to her blonde makeover to her sweet reunion with Justin Bieber, 23, she\u2019s proven that she\u2019s doing things on her own terms \u2014 and it\u2019s working. But even the \u201cWolves\u201d singer needs a break sometimes. She recently posted a video on her Instagram story that shows herself frowning. \u201cI need some alone time,\u201d she captioned the short clip. Is she alright?\n\nThere are a million reasons why the \u201cWolves\u201d singer would need some space. Maybe her busy schedule tired her out (over the past couple of weeks she attended Billboard\u2018s Women In Music event, spoke at the Lupus Research Alliance Annual Gala, and performed at the 2017 American Music Awards). Or, possibly, something\u2019s going on in her personal life that she wants to distance herself from momentarily. Could she be sad about how things are going with Justin?\n\nWhile there\u2019s nothing beyond this video that would suggest she\u2019s having issues with the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer, her whirlwind romance with him might be happening so fast that the 13 Reasons Why producer could feel she needs to take some time for herself. Considering how their romance was rekindled very shortly after her breakup with The Weeknd, 27, it\u2019s understandable if she\u2019s feeling like she hasn\u2019t had time to catch her breath. From sweet date night hugs to an ice rink kiss, the on-again couple have barely had any time apart since rekindling their romance in October (minus their separate Thanksgiving celebrations). So even if it doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re having any issues, it could be time to put a pause on the hang outs to focus a bit on themselves. You can watch Selena\u2019s video and decipher it for yourself, below.\n\nBut before we start panicking that Jelena is falling off track, keep in mind that wanting space isn\u2019t totally out of the ordinary for the \u201cBad Liar\u201d singer. She recently opened up about how she enjoys bouts of solitary. \u201cI like feeling removed, and I wanted a place where I could be alone,\u201d she told Billboard about her secluded Calabasas home. We can\u2019t say for sure why Selena wants to by herself right now, but we hope she gets the alone time she needs. No matter what the reason, everyone\u2019s entitled to taking some time to re-energize, including Selena.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think Selena\u2019s latest Instagram Story means?", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2F04%2Fselena-gomez-sad-justin-bieber-alone-time-video%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2897479&comment_count=4", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/selena-gomez-alone-time-justin-bieber-ftr.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/selena-gomez-alone-time-justin-bieber-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/04/selena-gomez-sad-justin-bieber-alone-time-video/", "title": "Selena Gomez Admits To Wanting \u2018Alone Time\u2019: Is She Having Issues With Justin Bieber?", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez admitted that she needs 'alone time' in an Instagram video where she looks pretty sad.
