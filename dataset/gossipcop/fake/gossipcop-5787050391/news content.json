Whenever Jenner and West get together, the political talk has only made the troubled rapper more determined about his forthcoming run to win the presidential election in 2020.\n\n\u201cCaitlyn Jenner is just the latest reality TV star with political ambitions. But according to an insider, it\u2019s not Jenner herself who will be campaigning for office. Instead, a source told Radar, she\u2019s got her sights set on helping Kanye West make America great again,\u201d the outlet notes.\n\n\u201cJenner shocked the world when she attended President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington DC last week, with not a single family member by her side. West has spoken out in support of the President and even met with him in DC. Jenner now sees him as her ticket into the world of politics.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\u2019s political views are what has reportedly seen her relationship with the Kardashians crumble in recent months. The family had already been distant toward Jenner prior to her publicly admitting to being a Trump supporter, but her decision to be so passionate about wanting the 70-year-old in the White House made the likes of Kim and Khloe Kardashian back away from their stepfather.\n\n[Image by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images]\n\nNobody in the Kardashian household supported Caitlyn\u2019s move to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration, last week, The Hollywood Gossip alleges.\n\nThings have been very rocky between the Kardashians and Caitlyn, so much that the only person that the reality star still has a close relationship with is Kanye West.\n\nIt\u2019s further stressed that Kim isn\u2019t happy about Jenner\u2019s influence on her husband of two years. The 36-year-old doesn\u2019t like the supposed fact that Caitlyn is so determined into getting Kanye thinking he will become the next president of the United States.\n\nWhile Kim is aware that West has wanted to give his presidential campaign a try, Kanye has refrained himself from talking about it until Caitlyn Jenner started bringing it up again \u2014 to the point where the \u201cStronger\u201d superstar is constantly talking about politics and his plans to win the election in 2020.\n\n\u201cCaitlyn and Kanye have bonded a lot over President Trump\u2026 Of course, Kim does not want Kanye to run for President! She does not want the humiliation of him ever running for any office.\u201d\n\nWhat do you make of this? Is Caitlyn Jenner trying too hard to convince Kanye West he stands a chance of winning the election in 2020?\n\n[Featured Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/caitlyn-jenner-glamour-red-carpet.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2146221c3bb32c670d1053a99949feba?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/caitlyn-jenner-mel-gibson-movie-premiere.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/caitlyn-jenner-kanye-west-president-election.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maurice Cassidy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3927558/caitlyn-jenner-pushing-kanye-west-for-presidency-campaign-amid-kardashian-backlash-over-trump-support/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Pushing Kanye West For Presidency Campaign Amid Kardashian Backlash Over Trump Support", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
