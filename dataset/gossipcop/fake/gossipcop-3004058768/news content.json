The youngest Kardashian is a natural in front of the cameras, but it's \u201ctorture\u201d for Scott.\n\n\u201cHe was whispering to me the whole time,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cHe just doesn't like taking the photos.\u201d\n\nJenner and Scott are new parents to daughter Stormi Webster, who was born February 1. Despite their official status as a family, the pair is usually apart in the spotlight: Where Jenner goes, Scott rarely follows. Jenner said it was a way for the two to preserve their relationship and Scott's comfort level.\n\n\u201cI know he doesn't like the attention,\" she said. \"That's why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won't come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don't want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don't ever see us together, that's okay with me, because we just do our thing.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cKardashian Curse\u201d was a topic of conversation for the pair. The curse is said to surround the celebrity attention that follows the Kardashian name, making even the half-sister\u2019s best relationships unsuitable for the spotlight.\n\n\u201cThat's exactly what it is,\u201d said Jenner. \u201cThey come and can't handle it.\u201d\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images for Huffington Post\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nAs for Scott\u2019s take on the \u201cKardashian Curse\u201d? The idea doesn\u2019t make him nervous. \u201cMan, hell nah. Nervous for what? I'm on my own island. So hey, come over there to Astroworld. I'm not into all the other shit. I don't get involved. I'm over here. Kylie is different.\u201d\n\nTo Jenner, the \u201ccurse\u201d extends past the Kardashian's love interests to anyone who hasn\u2019t fielded criticism the way the family has.\n\n\u201cIt's everyone around us that aren't used to it. And we're just like, \u2018Oh, that'll go away in a day.\u2019 I know these stories aren't going to matter, so don't even let them affect you, you know? I think you're correct.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBut it's not just men\u2014it's friends, it's people who come and just don't know how to handle it. It's the negative. There's a lot of people who love us, but there's also a huge handful of people who don't like us.\u201d\n\nJenner is a leading force in the makeup industry, selling more than $630 million in products in three years, according to Forbes.\n\nScott is a rapper best known for his 2015 album Rodeo and 2017 single Butterfly Effect, which has more than 365 million streams on Spotify.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/11/trailer-large-image_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/0717berlinpride.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/17/gettyimages-963419126.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/07/17/gettyimages-958396666.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/gettyimages-1000209438.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/07/11/what-kylie-jenners-net-worth.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/07/11/screen-shot-2018-07-11-11.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/07/16/paris-hilton.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/gettyimages-473872282.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/gettyimages-631160090.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/02/21/worlds-highest-paid-actors_29.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/screen-shot-2018-07-17-11_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/leah-remini.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/samuel-l.-jackson-calls-trumps-resignation-after-putin-meeting.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/16/image-00_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/15/queen-elizabeth-ii-slideshow-cover.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/09/25-most-powerful-passports-world.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/22/image-00_2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/17/walter-carr-ofc-mark-knighten-1.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/07/17/gettyimages-963419126.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180717172225/https://www.newsweek.com/travis-scott-isnt-nervous-about-kardashian-curse-he-doesnt-spotlight-1028075", "title": "Where Is Travis Scott?
