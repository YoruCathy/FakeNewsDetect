Eastwood didn't, at least not in the Carmel Pine Cone).\n\nSome other nuggets:\n\nEastwood didn't tell anyone in the Romney campaign what he planned to say before the speech, because he didn't know\n\nEastwood got to the convention center about 15-20 minutes before he went on\n\nEastwood didn't think of the \"empty chair\" routine until a few minutes before show time\n\nEastwood said he had three points he wanted to make:\n\nThat not everybody in Hollywood is on the left,\n\nthat Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and\n\nthat the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who\u2019s not doing a good job.\n\nRead more at the Carmel Pine Cone >", "images": ["https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.businessinsider.com/clint-eastwood-president-obama-hoax-2012-9?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/50401ecaeab8ea206d000002?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Henry Blodget"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/clint-eastwood-president-obama-hoax-2012-9", "title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "date": "2012-09-07", "news_keywords": "Democratic National Convention, Clint Eastwood, Henry Blodget", "author": "Henry Blodget", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Politics", "og": {"title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/clint-eastwood-president-obama-hoax-2012-9", "image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "sailthru.date": "2012-09-07", "sailthru.tags": "Democratic National Convention, Clint Eastwood, Henry Blodget", "sailthru.author": "Henry Blodget", "sailthru.verticals": "politics, clusterstock, sai, thewire", "sailthru.image.full": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PoliticsInsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "variant", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "504a18d2ecad04ab17000005", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1346947200.0, "source": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
