He was a homebody for many months, but in the last month or two, he\u2019s been going out more,\u2019 they said. \u2018He enjoys going out to eat with close friends.\u2019\n\nSounds like a blast.\n\nThe publication added: \u2018He is in no way ready to get serious with anyone. He invites his dates over to his house and never takes women out in public. While it\u2019s been a year and a half [after their split], it still feels too soon to him.\u2019\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston at the premiere of Rock Star in LA in 2001 (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\nIt comes following this reported secret rendezvouz with Jen that reportedly also had Brad\u2019s mother quite excited.\n\nIt was reported last week that the pair had enjoyed a \u2018secret meeting\u2019 which was \u2018very relaxed and low-key\u2019 for a nice catch up.\n\nA source claimed it \u2018seemed just like old times, but better,\u2019 according to US magazine Star.\n\nAn insider has now said his mum is all for the reunion, as she was always a big fan of Jen\u2019s.\n\n\u2018Brad\u2018s mom Jane has always had a soft spot for Jennifer, even after the divorce they kept in touch for years,\u2019 they told HollywoodLife.com. \u2018She hated the way things ended between Brad and Jen so it\u2019s a big relief that they\u2018ve mended fences. She\u2018s so happy that they\u2018re back in touch.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
