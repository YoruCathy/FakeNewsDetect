On Thursday night, he released a surprise six-song EP, My Dear Melancholy, overflowing with all the Very Serious melodrama we haven\u2019t heard since his mixtape days. Abel has had his heart shattered and he now requests your shoulder to cry on. Sad boy! But there\u2019s just one question: Who hurt him? Oh, who are we kidding, you know it\u2019s Selena Gomez. It can only be Selena Gomez. Here\u2019s everything we learned about their relationship from his new EP \u2014 like, uh, that time he nearly gave her his kidney. Drama!\n\n\u201cCall Out My Name\u201d\n\nNo other song on the Weeknd\u2019s new project is more explicit about his regrets over Selena Gomez (he doesn\u2019t actually say her name) than the ironically titled \u201cCall Out My Name.\u201d He ominously begins, \u201cWe found each other / I helped you out of a broken place / You gave me comfort / But falling for you was my mistake.\u201d Selena famously was with Justin Bieber before the Weeknd \u2014 a broken place, indeed. But that\u2019s not the line that should raise eyebrows about whom this song is intended for. It gets worse: \u201cI put you on top / I claimed you so proud and openly / And when times were rough / I made sure I held you close to me.\u201d You\u2019ll recall that the Weekend and Selena Gomez made their official public debut as a couple at the Met Gala (see photo above), after also snuggling up at Coachella on Instagram. As for those \u201crough times\u201d he\u2019s alluding to, he lays it all bare later in the song:\n\n\u201cI said I didn\u2019t feel nothing, baby, but I lied / I almost cut a piece of myself for your life / Guess I was just another pit stop / \u2018Til you made up your mind / You just wasted my time / You\u2019re on top\u201d\n\nOof. There are moments on this song when you could think its about his previous ex-girlfriend, Bella Hadid, but not after reading that. Gomez had to undergo a kidney transplant last summer (when the two were still together) as a result of complications from lupus, which could\u2019ve proved fatal had her best friend, Francia Raisa, not donated her kidney. It now appears that Raisa was not Selena\u2019s only donor candidate \u2014 it could\u2019ve been the Weeknd!* It also appears he is shading her lightning-fast rebound back to Bieber, hard. Yikes!\n\nUpdate, April 2: A source now tells Entertainment Tonight that the Weeknd is exaggerating, and was never asked to be a donor. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lyric and he knew it would strum up attention and that people would interpret it exactly as they have, but he was never actually going to donate his kidney to Selena,\u201d the source says. \u201cSure, he was her boyfriend at the time, so it perhaps crossed his mind to get tested to see if he was a match \u2014 which is incredibly rare \u2014 but it never got anywhere close to actually happening. Selena would never, ever have asked him. She wouldn\u2019t have even wanted him to even entertain the idea! It was difficult enough for her to allow a lifelong friend to do it, but a new boyfriend? No way.\u201d\n\nThe source also discredits the EP as nothing more than the tales of a scorned lover: \u201cTo be honest, they were never as intense as he\u2019s making it seem. The Weeknd was always much more concerned with his career than his relationship. Selena leaned on friends and family during the surgery more than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry Me\u201d\n\nMuch of this song is about the Weeknd getting in the middle of a relationship already in progress, which could be interpreted two ways: Either he (1) moved in on Selena when she was still with Biebs (unlikely), or (2) he got into a relationship with her pretty much aware her heart wasn\u2019t all in it (aw). But how do we know he\u2019s even talking about Selena here, anyway? We don\u2019t! But this second reference to her transplant is telling: \u201cThe way I kissed your scars / The way I fixed your heart / Don\u2019t you mess with me, babe.\u201d (Gomez has been candid about the literal, physical scars left from the surgery.)\n\n\u201cWasted Times\u201d\n\nThis song appears to mostly be about how much he misses Bella Hadid, a hole in his heart apparently slashed open even larger by Gomez. Ahem: \u201cWasted times I spent with someone else / She wasn\u2019t even half of you.\u201d This track also has a lot of big talk about his penis, but we\u2019ll spare you the details.\n\n\u201cI Was Never There\u201d\n\nNo one really knows why the Weeknd and Selena called it off (*cough* Bieber *cough*), but if we were to take this song at face value, the breakup wasn\u2019t pretty. He begins the song talking about suicidal thoughts and then comes right up to the edge of his breaking point, blaming her: \u201cWhen no one knows what love is / And I know it ain\u2019t you for sure / You\u2019d rather something toxic / So, I poison myself again, again / \u2018Til I feel nothing.\u201d Again, \u201ctoxic\u201d and Bieber are practically synonymous for Abel.\n\n\u201cHurt You\u201d\n\nHow quickly sorrow can manifest as pettiness. \u201cHurt You\u201d is, essentially, a humblebrag about how the Weeknd has no interest in ever getting back together with Selena (\u201cand now I know relationships my enemy\u201d). He could however emotionally remove himself enough to still smash (\u201cGirl, I\u2019ll come to put myself between your lips, not between your heart\u201d). Is it mature? Not quite. Will it win you the breakup? Can\u2019t hurt! But there\u2019s a tragic reason that this song is almost certainly about Selena, based off this revealing line:\n\n\u201cAll the nights we slept alone, dryin\u2019 your eyes (\u2019cause of me, baby) / And all the nights you thought about takin\u2019 your life (\u2019cause of me, baby) / If it\u2019s love you want again, don\u2019t waste your time (don\u2019t you waste).\u201d\n\nGomez has been open about seeking treatment for mental illness.\n\n\u201cPrivilege\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t devote a 21-minute EP to an ex without eventually arriving at the breakup ballad. He begins, \u201cEnjoy your privileged life / \u2018Cause I\u2019m not gonna hold you through the night / We said our last goodbyes / So, let\u2019s just try to end it with a smile.\u201d Progress! Which, of course, doesn\u2019t last, as we inevitably get the Weeknd saying he doesn\u2019t want to hear a thing about Selena suffering now that she\u2019s moved on and that you can find him coping with the breakup with pills and alcohol from now on (\u201cI\u2019ll be back to my old ways\u201d). While he\u2019s at it, he\u2019d also like to set the record straight about their relationship: \u201cThey said our love is just a game, I don\u2019t care what they say.\u201d In other words, it wasn\u2019t just a publicity stunt, love is real, but it\u2019s also a big fat lie.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/30/30-selena-gomez-weeknd.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/30/30-selena-gomez-weeknd.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/30/30-selena-gomez-weeknd.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dee Lockett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/what-we-know-about-the-weeknd-and-selena-from-his-new-ep.html", "title": "What We Know About The Weeknd and Selena from His New EP", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Everything We Know About the Weeknd and Selena Gomez From His New Album", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/what-we-know-about-the-weeknd-and-selena-from-his-new-ep.html", "description": "He almost gave her a kidney!", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/30/30-selena-gomez-weeknd.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "What We Know About the Weeknd and Selena From His New EP", "description": "He almost gave her a kidney!", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/30/30-selena-gomez-weeknd.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-30T11:03:48.596-04:00", "tag": "breaking up is hard to do, selena gomez, the weeknd, kidney transplant, music, way too close reads", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "The Weeknd says he almost gave Selena Gomez his kidney, and everything else we learned from his new EP.", "sailthru.tags": "breaking up is hard to do, selena gomez, the weeknd, kidney transplant, music, way too close reads", "author": "Dee Lockett", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522422228.596, "source": "http://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
