The couple, who split in September 2016, share children Maddox, 16; Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.\n\nThe documents make it sound as though Jolie, 42, has not cooperated in allowing Pitt, 54, to spend time with the children this summer or in letting him have easy and unmonitored cell phone and text message contact with them.\n\nMelcher said the ruling from the retired Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, who likely was retained by both parties to resolve the case, is \u201cconsistent with a finding of parent alienation.\u201d\n\nWhile Melcher said he hasn\u2019t seen the relevant documents, he said that the quotes from them make it sound as though the finding came after extensive evaluation, which estimated that the children weren\u2019t \u201cestranged\u201d from Pitt because of harmful things he has done but were \u201calienated\u201d from him because of actions of Jolie.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge has said that the children could be harmed by \u201cnot having a relationship with their father.\u201d If things don\u2019t change, the judge added, there would be consequences for Jolie.\n\n\u201cIf the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with (Jolie) and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to (Pitt),\u201d the ruling said.\n\nDavid Glass, another family law attorney, agreed that the judge\u2019s ruling is unusual but must have seemed necessary. In an interview with People magazine, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a rare case where the court will find that someone alienated the kids. It takes a lot to move the court past estrangement into alienation, but once it\u2019s determined that one parent is alienating the kids, the court has no choice but to jump in and make pretty strong orders right away.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Jolie slammed news about the judge\u2019s ruling, calling it a \u201cmisleading leak that is not in the best interests of the children.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement to Vanity Fair.\n\nWith regard to the spokesperson\u2019s contention that the documents are \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201csealed,\u201d Melcher said that California law makes many family law proceedings public, even if the parties involved have chosen to have their case resolved outside the courtroom.\n\nFollowing the couple\u2019s nasty, high-profile split, Pitt was investigated by multiple agencies after Jolie alleged that he had a drinking problem and was abusive to their children. Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, shortly after Pitt got into some kind of altercation with their oldest son, Maddox, on a private plane returning from Europe. The allegations triggered multiple investigations, including by the FBI, that ultimately exonerated Pitt.\n\nIn May 2017, Pitt revealed in an interview with GQ that he had come to terms with his daily habit of relying on substances, mostly pot or alcohol, to \u201crun from his feelings.\u201d Pitt wouldn\u2019t describe what he had gone through in the wake of his breakup as a mid-life crisis. But he acknowledged to GQ that the divorce had left him in the middle of \u201can unraveled life, figuring out how to mend it back together.\u201d\n\nIn the year since, the couple have continued to finalize their custody arrangements and divorce. Recently, there have been reports that the globe-trotting Jolie has come to resent Pitt for \u201cessentially forcing her to settle down in Los Angeles with the kids,\u201d Us Weekly reported in May.\n\nLast year, Jolie purchased Cecile B. DeMille\u2019s lavish former estate in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. Her $25 million home is \u201cjust down the street\u201d from Pitt\u2019s estate in the same neighborhood, reports say. That proximity has allowed the children to visit their father \u201ca few times a week\u201d \u2014 when everyone is in in town.\n\nTensions seemed to grow in the past few weeks as the estranged couple tried to finalize their summer plans. Jolie reportedly hoped to have the children with her in London, where she\u2019s filming the sequel to her blockbuster film \u201cMaleficent.\u201d Pitt, meanwhile, had reportedly arranged his work schedule so he could be based in Los Angeles and spend time with his children there.\n\nThe judge\u2019s ruling sought to work out a summer schedule, with the children dividing their time between London and Los Angeles. TMZ reported that Pitt currently is in London. According to the judge\u2019s order, he is allowed to spend an increasing amount of time with his children each day in London through July 17. After that, the children return to Los Angeles, where they will be in their father\u2019s custody. While the children are in Pitt\u2019s care, Jolie is only allowed to call them one time per day and at a time agreed upon by both parents, according to the documents.\n\nMeanwhile, the judge ruled that Pitt can have increased access to his children via phone and text, the Blast reported. He ordered Jolie to provide Pitt with the cell phone number of each child, and to allow him to call whenever he wants. The court also bars her from reading the children\u2019s text messages with Pitt or from giving out a number to a phone that she secretly monitors.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bradpitt_27.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/angelina_5.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jolieknox.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/maddox31.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jolieknoxpitt1.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/angelina_5.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
