Caitlyn Jenner made the final step towards becoming a woman by undergoing gender reassignment surgery and she did it with super secrecy.\u201cCaitlyn was very private and reclusive after her reassignment surgery. It was something that she had been thinking about for a long time and she wanted her body to heal after the surgery given the risks of complications,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nThe 67-year-old even kept the news of the procedure from her own family members! \u201cFor her it was the final stage to becoming a woman and she did not really discuss it with her immediate family. Caitlyn had fully talked about the procedure with her doctors and her other transgender friends, so, she fully knew what was involved and was totally prepared,\u201d our insider adds.\n\nThe former reality star reveals in her upcoming memoir that, \u201cYou want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.\u201d While she doesn\u2019t go into in-depth detail, the former Olympian says that having a penis had \u201cno special gifts or use for me\u2026I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time.\u201d\n\nShe had the surgery in Jan. 2017 and decided to share the news \u201cso all of you can stop staring,\u201d and says that she feels \u201cnot only wonderful but liberated. The stunning star revealed her new identity as \u201cCaitlyn\u201d in June 2015, appearing on the cover of Vanity Fair in a white corset. Then, in Oct. 2016, she legally changed her name to \u201cCaitlyn Marie,\u201d as well as her gender to female. Now her transformation is complete!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you surprised that Caitlyn decided to reveal her surgery to the world?", "images": ["https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F04%2F14%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-surgery-gender-reassignment-healing-process%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2549910&comment_count=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/caitlin-jenner-reassignment-surgery-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/caitlin-jenner-reassignment-surgery-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/caitlin-jenner-reassignment-surgery-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/04/14/caitlyn-jenner-surgery-gender-reassignment-healing-process/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Reassignment Surgery: Inside Her \u2018Reclusive\u2019 Healing Process", "meta_data": {"description": "Caitlyn Jenner dropped a major bombshell when she revealed that she underwent gender reassignment surgery.
