Photos by Getty Images\n\nSign up for our COVID-19 newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest coronavirus news throughout New York City\n\nThe Ben Affleck-Matt Damon bromance is being put to the test thanks to Chris Hemsworth.\n\nThe \u201cAvengers\u201d and \u201cThor\u201d star has been trading barbs with Batfleck on social media over which superhero actor is truly Damon\u2019s best friend. While there usually wouldn\u2019t be any questions about the subject considering the Boston-bred stars\u2019 long-standing friendship, Damon has been spending a lot of time with Hemsworth in recent months, especially since \u201cThe Martian\u201d star made a cameo in last year\u2019s \u201cThor: Ragnarok.\u201d\n\nOf course, gossip publications have noticed the budding new friendship as well, taking things a bit further by insinuating that Hemsworth is replacing Affleck as Damon\u2019s BFF. Even though Damon has defended the \u201cJustice League\u201d actor\u2019s odd back tattoo, that didn\u2019t stop Affleck from taking to Twitter over the weekend to declare that Hemsworth can have Damon if he wants.\n\n\u201cHey @chrishemsworth, you can have him! I\u2019m Team @JimmyKimmel anyways,\u201d Affleck tweeted, referencing Damon\u2019s faux feud with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nChris Hemsworth puts Ben Affleck Matt Damon bromance to the test\n\nHemsworth responded with the obligatory \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d joke and said that Damon is probably just a bigger fan of Marvel movies than DC. The \u201cThor\u201d star also tagged Kimmel in his tweet, so you know the comic had to weigh in on the bromance situation too.\n\nSorry mate not my fault! He\u2019s just a big @Marvel fan, not @DCComics.\n\nHow do you like them apples ?. @jimmykimmel the ball is in your court. Choose wisely\u2026 https://t.co/SWe7yrHRWW \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 21, 2018\n\nWow. Another big win for #TeamBatman! Sorry Matt, I\u2019m sure this is a Thor thubject. #Iwilltakeeveryoneyoulove \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) April 21, 2018\n\nHemsworth wasn\u2019t happy with Kimmel siding with Batfleck, so he threatened to pull out of his appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d this week during all the \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d promotional festivities. Luke Hemsworth tried to slide into the spot, but the older Hemsworth brother told him that Kimmel would only break his heart.\n\nHey @jimmykimmel sounds like you\u2019ve chosen your side. Guess I\u2019m not coming on your show this week. Good luck finding another Avenger named Chris. https://t.co/I01PB03QGw \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 21, 2018\n\nNot coming on my show will be another thing you and Matt have in common! @BenAffleck https://t.co/WVceazwYHW \u2014 Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) April 22, 2018\n\nFans don\u2019t need to worry too much, though, as it sounds like the \u201cThor\u201d actor is changing his tune and will show up this week.\n\nYou know what, @jimmykimmel \u2026 I\u2019m coming on your show now just to upset you. https://t.co/17EZAlIFQj \u2014 Chris Hemsworth (@chrishemsworth) April 22, 2018", "images": ["https://www.caribbeanlifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/marie-driven-publicity-guru-2020-04-17-nk-cl01-561x700.jpg", "https://www.brooklynpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/salad-short-525x700.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/metro-logo-square-192x192.png", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/mystic_pizza.1-700x394.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tom-papa-boston-700x394.jpg", "https://podcasts.schnepsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AM-RUsh-1-800x800.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/metro-logo-black.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-b9L3JGn1-4d-_.gif", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportBusinessNews/tagreuters.com2020binary_LYNXMPEG3G04K-BASEIMAGE-192x192.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportBusinessNews/tagreuters.com2020binary_LYNXMPEG3G0YB-BASEIMAGE-192x192.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/is-matt-damon-in-oceans-8-cameo-700x394.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportScienceNews/tagreuters.com2020binary_LYNXMPEG3G1E9-BASEIMAGE-192x192.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportBusinessNews/tagreuters.com2020binary_LYNXMPEG3G1EJ-BASEIMAGE-192x192.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/Reuters_Direct_Media/USOnlineReportWorldNews/tagreuters.com2020binary_LYNXMPEG3G1DV-BASEIMAGE-192x192.jpg", "https://www.gaycitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mbarara-RISE-COVID-700x525.jpg", "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/family-guy-matt-damon-700x394.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://www.metro.us/is-chris-hemsworth-breaking-up-the-ben-affleck-matt-damon-friendship/", "title": "Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "baheKNA2RfCj_KzL8_7nXIYnwDgvId9hm8sA0G_QHaY", "theme-color": "#16a2ea", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel also joined the bromance battle royale.", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship? - Metro US", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel also joined the bromance battle royale.", "url": "https://www.metro.us/is-chris-hemsworth-breaking-up-the-ben-affleck-matt-damon-friendship/", "site_name": "Metro US", "updated_time": "2020-02-25T12:22:46-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg", "width": 873, "height": 496, "alt": "Chris Hemsworth Matt Damon Ben Affleck Jimmy Kimmel", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"tag": "Matt Damon", "section": "Celebrities"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is Chris Hemsworth breaking up the Ben Affleck-Matt Damon friendship? - Metro US", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel also joined the bromance battle royale.", "image": "https://www.metro.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/chris-hemsworth-matt-damon-ben-affleck-jimmy-kimmel.jpg"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.39", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://www.metro.us"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.metro.us", "summary": ""}
