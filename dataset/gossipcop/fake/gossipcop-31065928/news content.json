Tom Hanks plays Ben Bradlee, The Post\u2019s executive editor, who believes the information should be printed \u2014 for the sake of the public and The Post\u2019s reputation.\n\nHere are answers to your potential questions, along with links to our stories about the film and the people it portrays.", "images": ["https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/14/Style/Images/SAstreep1217C.JPG", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/15/Others/Images/2017-12-14/wplthepostdiscussionkt.001.JPG", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/washingtonpost_black_32.png", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/20/Obituaries/Images/mobile-BradleeHP-2975.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/entertainment/the-post-movie/img/the-post-movie-promo.jpg", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-12-14/AP/Washington_D.C._Premiere_of__The_Post__35469-9263f.jpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/07/Weekend/Images/wk-thepost1110-2.jpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2011/02/18/Others/Galleries/Graham_SS_20110218T143352/rough_edits11.jpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/17/Interactivity/Images/crop_freeFilm_Review_The_Post_35303-1b385.jpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/20/Others/Images/2017-12-06/sa_Hannah_001.JPG", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/12/promo-jmovies.jpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/12/06/Style/Images/bestofmoviecollage2.jpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rw/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/09/05/Style/Images/quinnmemoir0906_03.JPG"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/entertainment/the-post-movie/img/the-post-movie-promo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zachary Pincus-Roth", "Amy Nicholson", "Margaret Sullivan", "Emily Heil", "Stephanie Merry", "Lizzie Hart", "Ann Hornaday", "Sally Quinn", "Robert G.
