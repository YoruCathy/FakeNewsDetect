USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.\n\n\n\n'They\u2019ve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions\u2026 They don\u2019t want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.\n\n\n\nThe pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.\n\nPitt and Jolie share six children Getty\n\n'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.\n\n\n\n'He\u2019s sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he\u2019s come out a better person, and he\u2019s grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'\n\n\n\nIn fact, the shock split may have been Angie\u2019s plan to get Brad to shape up.\n\n\n\nCourt documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.\n\n\n\n'Brad and Ange clearly don\u2019t want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.\n\n\n\n'When they\u2019re ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'\n\n\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!\n\n\n\n'It\u2019ll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.\n\n\n\n'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23070/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23070/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/brad-and-ange-back-together", "title": "Brad and Ange back together", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "They shocked the world when they announced their shock split in September 2016 \u2013 but after seventeen months apart, are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ready to give love a second chance?", "news_keywords": "Agelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Brad Pitt back together, Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie kids, celebrity news, celeb news, latest celebrity news, celebrity gossip, celeb gossip, latest celebrity gossip, celeb goss, brad pitt and angelina jolie back together", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/brad-and-ange-back-together", "title": "Brad and Ange back together", "description": "They shocked the world when they announced their shock split in September 2016 \u2013 but after seventeen months apart, are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ready to give love a second chance?", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23070/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1000}}, "twitter": {"title": "Brad and Ange back together", "description": "They shocked the world when they announced their shock split in September 2016 \u2013 but after seventeen months apart, are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie ready to give love a second chance?", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23070/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/brad-and-ange-back-together"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518733164.681, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
