Instead, it was reported that Ryan was left heartbroken when Julianne ended their relationship because she wasn\u2019t ready for marriage and that the couple\u2019s age difference (Ryan is 14 years older) also played a factor in their split.\n\nAlthough Ryan Seacrest seems to have moved on, it still has to be awkward to be forced to talk about the wedding of an ex, and to have to do it on live television. But thanks to shady co-host, Kelly Ripa, Ryan had to do just that.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s Live! show, the co-hosts were supposed to discuss the weddings of both Julianne Hough and fellow Dancing With the Stars alum Peta Murgatroyd to Maksim Chmerkovskiy, who also married this weekend. Instead of letting Ryan talk about the wedding of Peta and Maksim, shady Kelly Ripa handed Ryan the picture of Julianne Hough\u2019s wedding, forcing him to comment on Julianne\u2019s wedding details.\n\nOf course, Ryan Seacrest is a pro, so he congratulated the couple before adding that Julianne looked \u201cstunning\u201d in her wedding gown. Although he stumbled a bit when looking at a picture of the couple who married on a lake in Idaho, saying, \u201cI know this family. I\u2019ve been on this lake.\u201d Many viewers felt it was awkward for Ryan to announce that in the past he had been with Julianne Hough at the same lake where she chose to get married, but he was probably just caught off-guard at having to comment on her wedding at all.\n\nRyan recovered from the faux pas by saying to the happy couple, \u201cCongratulations. I wish them the best.\u201d But, Kelly Ripa was not about to let Ryan off the hook. She then bluntly asked him if it was weird for him to talk about his ex. Ryan assured her that it wasn\u2019t, but the whole exchange was filled with tension.\n\nThe fact that Kelly Ripa forced Ryan to talk about Julianne\u2019s wedding proves once again how difficult she is to work with. Now viewers are wondering how long Ryan will choose to stay at Live!\n\nPhoto by Rich Fury/Getty Images", "images":
