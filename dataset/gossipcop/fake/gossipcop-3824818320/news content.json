He wrote, \u201cNFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.\u201d Following some players locking arms, while other knelt during the National Anthem, the president again tweeted, \u201cGreat solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!\u201d\n\nNow celebrities are reacting. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted, \u201cAs a football fan, I am proud of the NFL players today. Nothing is more American than the right to peacefully protest.\u201d Brooklyn Decker asked, \u201cHow did 1 person get us to a place where if you stand during the anthem you support white supremacy & if you kneel you are unpatriotic?\u201d And George Lopez wrote, \u201cStanding in Unity, locked arms and standing proud (its suppose to be #takingaknee).\u201d\n\nIn a long instagram post, Elisabeth Hasselbeck offered, \u201cNotes on today, the @NFL and our #NationalAnthem -We have a leader that used bombastic hurtful language and that is not helpful. ( and in fact it is hurtful.) -We have a flag that represents our freedoms- which ironically includes protesting the very flag which permits that freedom. -Standing or kneeling is up to the heart of each citizen. Everyone\u2019s reasons are different. That is what makes this country free.\u201d She added that personally \u201cI stand for the flag and the national anthem because somewhere, each day a member of our military (regardless of gender, race, religion) IS STANDING for my freedom. For me: I stand because standing and placing my hand on my heart is the least I can do for those who stand each day for our liberty. \u2013 I kneel on both knees because I am praying for this country, its leaders and our children.\u201d\n\nGeorge Takei questioned, \u201cDonald says taking the knee disrespects those who fought for freedoms we enjoy, yet he wants to deny players\u2019 1st amendment right to do it??\u201d Alyssa Milano simply wrote, \u201c#TakeTheKnee.\u201d \u201cProtests are supposed to upset and challenge people. That\u2019s the whole f**king point,\u201d tweeted Andy Richter.\n\nIn response to Trump tweeting that the NFL\u2019s ratings are down this season, Chelsea Handler responded, \u201cI\u2019m watching my first day of Sunday football today, because of you, so I would assume many more are doing the same. Racist.\u201d Meanwhile, Zendaya limited her commenting to one word, \u201cSolidarity.\u201d Gossip Cop will update as more celebrities react to NFL players taking a knee or locking arms during the National Anthem.", "images": ["http://www.iheart.com/v8.16.1/aclogo.7c8e56771c2208dff83e6123e794ef10.png", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Lewittes"], "canonical_link": "//www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-25-celebrities-react-nfl-players-kneel-lock-arms-during-national-anthem/", "title": "Celebrities React: NFL Players Kneel, Lock Arms During National Anthem", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#C6002B", "description": "Some football players took a knee, while others, including Tom Brady, locked arms with teammates in a show of unity. | iHeartRadio", "fb": {"app_id": 121897277851831, "pages": 55354819171}, "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==", "description": "Some football players took a knee, while others, including Tom Brady, locked arms with teammates in a show of unity. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-25-celebrities-react-nfl-players-kneel-lock-arms-during-national-anthem/", "site_name": "iHeartRadio", "title": "Celebrities React: NFL Players Kneel, Lock Arms During National Anthem | iHeartRadio"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==", "twitter": {"image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==", "src": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw=="}, "description": "Some football players took a knee, while others, including Tom Brady, locked arms with teammates in a show of unity. | iHeartRadio", "url": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-25-celebrities-react-nfl-players-kneel-lock-arms-during-national-anthem/", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "iHeartRadio", "ipad": "iHeartRadio", "googleplay": "iHeartRadio"}, "id": {"iphone": 290638154, "ipad": 290638154, "googleplay": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}}, "creator": "@iHeartRadio", "site": "@iHeartRadio", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "iheart.com", "title": "Celebrities React: NFL Players Kneel, Lock Arms During National Anthem | iHeartRadio"}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "package": "com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller"}, "ios": {"app_name": "iHeartRadio", "app_store_id": 290638154}}, "keywords": "Celebrities React: NFL Players Kneel, Lock Arms During National Anthem, celebrities, react:, nfl, players, kneel,, lock, arms, during, national, anthem", "parsely-author": "Michael Lewittes", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yNC81OWM3ZTdmY2I5MGFmYjU0ZDMyZjk3ZjUvNTljN2U3ZmIwYzJhZmY2YjZjOTE2YzU2XzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==", "parsely-link": "http://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-25-celebrities-react-nfl-players-kneel-lock-arms-during-national-anthem/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-25T14:34:00.000Z", "parsely-section": "ent-news-urban-ac", "parsely-title": "Celebrities React: NFL Players Kneel, Lock Arms During National Anthem", "parsely-type": "post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506268800.0, "source": "http://www.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
