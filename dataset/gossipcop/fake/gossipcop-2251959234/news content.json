So therefore ain\u2019t no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!\u201d Andy Cohen replied \u201cHAHAHAHHA AMEN,\u201d while Chrissy Teigen laughed over the \u201cU bum\u201d line. Cohen also pointed out, \u201cHOUSEWIVES PLAYBOOK: rescind invitations liberally! (See: Bethenny re LuAnn, Mexico; Bethenny & Ramona, Mexico.)\u201d Seth Meyers also quipped about Trump, \u201cSomebody\u2019s got their laid back weekend vibe working!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not a great honor while your stench is there,\u201d slammed John Legend. Don Cheadle sarcastically replied to Trump, \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s crushed.\u201d Jeffrey Wright praised, \u201cWell done @StephenCurry30.\u201d Joked Trevor Noah, \u201c\u2018You\u2019re not breaking up with me, I\u2019m breaking up with you!'\u201d George Takei said to he president, \u201cAnd just when you thought he couldn\u2019t get any more petty\u2026\u201d Ava DuVernay also wrote to him, \u201cMan, nobody with any sense or self-respect considers it an honor to be within a 10 mile radius of you. It is known.\u201d Karrueche Tran exclaimed, \u201cHE WAS NEVER GOING IDIOT! PUERTO RICO IS WITHOUT POWER!! PUERTO RICO IS A PART OF THE US. YOU DO KNOW THAT RIGHT?!!\u201d\n\nJesse Tyler Ferguson noted, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor when the president is honorable.\u201d And Jemele Hill, who earned Trump\u2019s ire on Twitter earlier this month for calling the president a white supremacist, tweeting with a laughing emoji, \u201cHey @StephenCurry30, welcome to the club bro.\u201d Meanwhile, Curry\u2019s wife, Ayesha, shared an eye-roll emoji in response to the president\u2019s tweet, and wrote, \"Okay\u2026 Donate to earthquake relief here!!!\u201d She included a link to UNICEF. The tweet against Curry came as stars were already ripping Trump for saying NFL players who kneel during the National Anthem should be fired.", "images": ["https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e39ee71aaf1044ab2f9717f?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yMy81OWM2NmIxODllZmE4OTU4OWZhNjU4ZDUvNTljNjZiMTgxYzQxNDkwNzc5ODBiYjdhXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOS8yMy81OWM2NmIxODllZmE4OTU4OWZhNjU4ZDUvNTljNjZiMTgxYzQxNDkwNzc5ODBiYjdhXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-23-celebrities-react-trump-withdraws-steph-curry-white-house-invitation/", "title": "Celebrities React: Trump Withdraws Steph Curry White House Invitation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "LeBron James tweeted a message at Trump that has many talking.
