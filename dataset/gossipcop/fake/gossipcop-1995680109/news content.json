{"url": "www.celebitchy.com/580547/star_jennifer_aniston_feels_humiliated_by_justins_new_thing_with_emma_stone/", "text": "Star Magazine\u2019s latest cover story is all about Justin Theroux, Jennifer Aniston and Emma Stone, aka The New Uncool Bermuda Triangle. Personally, I believe Emma and Justin are a thing, in spite of their vague denials. They\u2019re just spending too much time together for it to be a \u201cjust friends\u201d situation. What I\u2019m not sure of? Whether Jennifer Aniston really cares. I already shared my concern that it feels like Jen is under-reacting to her split, possibly because\u2026 she and Justin might not even really be married? I don\u2019t know. And she\u2019s definitely not acting depressed about this split at all. So do you think Jennifer is sitting in Bel Air, yelling at the pool (not the ocean) about Justin and Emma? Star would have you believe she\u2019s super-concerned.\n\nJen has had enough: \u201cJen is left wondering whether Justin was staying true to her during the last months of their marriage. She wants some answers,\u201d says an insider. Jen was aghast when she saw the photos of Emma & Justin in France: \u201cJen can see there are sparks there. She\u2019s telling friends that this was a very tacky maneuver, since she and Justin are going through a divorce. He could have waited a few more months before flaunting a famous new girlfriend \u2013 who, by the way, used to be a friend of Jen\u2019s. Not anymore!\u201d Jen is Forever Haunted by Brangelina: \u201cThis has brought back unpleasant memories of Brad and Angelina, and Jen wants a clear sense of the timeline between Justin and Emma,\u201d says the source, who adds that Jen is especially suspicious of Justin\u2019s attempts to keep his rendezvous hush-hush \u2013 like when he and Emma donned low-slung baseball caps for an early-May sushi date in NYC. \u201cThis cloak-and-dagger stuff isn\u2019t really fooling anybody, and certainly not Jen. Justin assured Jen that he and Emma were just friends, but she no longer believes him.\u201d Jen just doesn\u2019t want to be publicly humiliated: The source insists that \u201cit was clear Justin wasn\u2019t happy in the marriage, he likes the New York hipster scene, while she loves her California sunshine. She accepts that they tried and it didn\u2019t work out \u2013 but she isn\u2019t willing to accept another bout of humiliation from a husband. She doesn\u2019t want Justin back but she does want him to be straight with her. It\u2019s a huge betrayal.\u201d\n\n[From Star Magazine, print edition]\n\nWhat I agree with: the Emma-Justin stuff (whatever IT is) is tacky and their little \u201cwe\u2019re not really together y\u2019all!\u201d games aren\u2019t fooling anyone. What I don\u2019t believe: that Jen is suddenly really upset about all of this. What I kept thinking about as this source went on and on about Jen Forever Betrayed is\u2026 yeah, but Justin did the same to Heidi Bivens WITH Jennifer. He humiliated Heidi, he set up his relationship with Jennifer months before he really broke it off with Heidi, and Heidi had every right to feel betrayed. But I guess the tabloids love this familiar narrative: Jennifer dumped again for a younger woman, Jennifer betrayed, Jennifer humiliated. I think it\u2019s more like \u201cJennifer is just living her life with her dogs and her girlfriends,\u201d but whatever.", "images":
