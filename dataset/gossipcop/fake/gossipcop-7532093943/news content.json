Photo: Eric Ryan/Getty Images\n\nAs Brad Pitt was not available for an interview about his new luxury furniture line with Frank Pollaro, the Times talked to a bunch of design experts for their thoughts instead. Their observations ranged from \u201cswanky\u201d to \u201cstifled\u201d; one critic noted, \u201cI was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.\u201d Here are our favorite gems (and yes, the Chanel No. 5 ad was referenced):\n\n1. \u201cThe shiny metal surprised me specifically; the mod Trumpian swankiness, in general.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cThese pieces are too nice; I do not hear Mr. Pitt\u2019s voice unleashed with full authority.\u201d\n\n3. \u201cMr. Pitt, you are a great actor. Stay that person, with all of his confidence and drive and risk-taking, when designing. These first pieces are audition monologues; you already have the part.\u201d\n\n4. \u201c[A piece I would want in my home is] possibly the oval table \u2014 in the guest room of a second home, if I owned a second home.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cI\u2019m not convinced after seeing three table designs (and a bathtub that reminds me of an ashtray) that Brad Pitt should quit his day job to be in the furniture or product design game. Unless that means I can be an actor for a day and get paid $7 million to star in a Chanel No. 5 perfume ad.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2012/11/01/01-brad-pitt-145020159.w330.h412.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2012/11/01/01-brad-pitt-145020159.o.jpg/a_146x97.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2012/11/01/01-brad-pitt-145020159.o.jpg/a_146x97.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2012/11/pitt-now-moonlighting-in-the-furniture-business.html", "title": "Brad Pitt Now Moonlighting in the Furniture Business", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Brad Pitt Now Moonlighting in the Furniture Business", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2012/11/pitt-now-moonlighting-in-the-furniture-business.html", "description": "<span>I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.</span>", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2012/11/01/01-brad-pitt-145020159.o.jpg/a_146x97.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Brad Pitt Now Moonlighting in the Furniture Business", "description": "<span>I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.</span>", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2012/11/01/01-brad-pitt-145020159.o.jpg/a_146x97.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "description": "<span>I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.</span>", "article": {"tag": "brad pitt, slash jobs, chanel no. 5, fame, furniture, frank pollaro", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "sailthru.tags": "brad pitt, slash jobs, chanel no. 5, fame, furniture, frank pollaro", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1352404380.0, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
