Friends are worried the 25-year-old is on a downward spiral and actually \u201cis a mess,\u201d a source tells OK! Magazine.\n\nEven prior to her breakup, Selena\u2019s been very open about struggles she faces, including depression and anxiety, and goes to therapy on a regular basis to work on her battles.\n\nAnd the split, which of course happened in front of the world, didn\u2019t help matters. Says the insider, \u201cShe went from being on top of the world to dealing with nonstop relationship drama. She feels so demoralized and alone.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, because her mother Mandy doesn\u2019t particularly like Justin, Selena reportedly chose to end things because she could not take the burden of having her mom at odds with her.\n\nUnfortunately, that choice backfired. The source added, \u201cSelena now feels a lot of resentment toward Mandy about the decision she made, and they\u2019re barely speaking. So she\u2019s essentially lost the two main influences in her life, which could be a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Selena\u2019s spiral?
