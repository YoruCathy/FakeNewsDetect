With that, unfortunately, comes having every aspect of her life analyzed. Her relationship status and dating life are part of that, and when a recent report surfaced that alleged Jackson was dating three women at once, the daughter of the pop icon Michael Jackson took it upon herself to set the record straight.\n\nAfter Gossip Cop published a report refuting that Jackson was dating three women at the same time\u2014Cara Delevingne, Ashley Benson, and Caroline D'Amore, according to The National Enquirer\u2014Jackson's rep also denied it all, saying, \"No idea how or why they come up with this stuff. Definitely not true.\u201d Jackson later hopped on Twitter to echo that statement, tweeting, \"I\u2019ve never met miss benzo. Caroline is one of my bestest friends who is **straight** and **married**, and also the mother of my godchild. Cara and I were never officially exclusive, you guys made that up.\"\n\nThe report, which said \u201cthings could get quite nasty if Paris doesn\u2019t choose one of these girls to date exclusively,\u201d is the kind of fan-fiction that has become an annoying reality for celebrities who don't adhere to heteronormative sexuality. Delevingne, who has spoken out about not wanting to be \"pigeonholed\" before, has also dealt with overzealous tabloid coverage of her love life.\n\nJust last month, after Delevingne was seen holding hands with Benson as they walked around New York City wearing matching backpacks, some speculated that the pair were an item. Fueling that rumor, or trolling it, or both, Benson later shared the photo on her Instagram, writing, \"Cute cute cute.\"\n\nAs for D\u2019Amore, it's somewhat of a mystery how she became entangled in this rumor. The DJ has been married to her husband, Bobby Alt, since 2012, and the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, Isabella Viking Alt, back in 2015. As Jackson noted, she's the godmother of their child. The women have flaunted their friendship on social media for quite some time now, with D'Amore recently thanking Jackson on Instagram for her friendship, writing, \"Words don\u2019t do this friendship justice but you know how much I love you. Thank you for supporting me as always @parisjackson.\" So take it all with a big grain of salt.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/21/5b2c11270008757085e61679_paris-jackson-on-dating-and-relationship-status.jpg?crop=0px,303px,4441px,2220px&w=790px", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=3223313014351882&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/21/5b2c11270008757085e61679_paris-jackson-on-dating-and-relationship-status.jpg?crop=0px,303px,4441px,2220px&w=790px", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-ashley-benson-caroline-damore-rumors/", "title": "Paris Jackson Clarifies Her Dating and Relationship Status With Cara Delevingne, Ashley Benson, and Caroline D\u2019Amore", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "When a recent report surfaced that alleged Paris Jackson was dating three women at once, she took it upon herself to set the record straight.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Paris Jackson Clarifies Her Dating Status With Cara Delevingne, Ashley Benson, and Caroline D'Amore", "description": "When a recent report surfaced that alleged Paris Jackson was dating three women at once, she took it upon herself to set the record straight.", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-ashley-benson-caroline-damore-rumors/", "site_name": "W Magazine | Women's Fashion & Celebrity News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/21/5b2c11270008757085e61679_paris-jackson-on-dating-and-relationship-status.jpg?crop=0px,303px,4441px,2220px&w=790px", "secure_url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/21/5b2c11270008757085e61679_paris-jackson-on-dating-and-relationship-status.jpg?crop=0px,303px,4441px,2220px&w=790px", "width": 4443, "height": 2957}}, "fb": {"app_id": 450372832509980}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "When a recent report surfaced that alleged Paris Jackson was dating three women at once, she took it upon herself to set the record straight.", "title": "Paris Jackson Clarifies Her Dating Status With Cara Delevingne, Ashley Benson, and Caroline D'Amore", "image": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/21/5b2c11270008757085e61679_paris-jackson-on-dating-and-relationship-status.jpg?crop=0px,303px,4441px,2220px&w=790px&mbid=social_retweet"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
