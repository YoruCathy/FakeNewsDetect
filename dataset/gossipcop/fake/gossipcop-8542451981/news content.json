{"url": "www.vogue.com/article/jenna-dewan-channing-tatum-divorce-interview", "text": "Since announcing their separation after almost nine years of marriage in April, dancer and World of Dance judge Jenna Dewan and actor Channing Tatum have remained relatively mum on details of their divorce. But in a new cover story for Women\u2019s Health, Dewan opened up on life post-Tatum, where she talked finding personal growth in a time of intense scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI feel I\u2019ve been on a wave of growth,\u201d Dewan told the magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s always challenging to go through a big change and have the whole world have an opinion about it. . . It\u2019s okay for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that\u2019s maybe what shocked everyone so much\u2014that it can be a positive thing. That was ultimately what happened with us.\u201d\n\nDewan said the mutual separation was a positive decision, and that it felt right for the family as a whole. (She and Tatum have a five-year-old daughter, Everly). \u201cIt\u2019s been a journey, and it\u2019s been a transformation of myself\u2014my needs and wants as a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cI think everyone wants to hold on to what\u2019s in front of them, but when you open your mind, saying, \u2018I want what\u2019s best for myself and my daughter,\u2019 you have to be okay with however that looks.\u201d\n\nThe couple had been together since 2006, when they met on the set of the dance flick Step Up. They later went on to tie the knot in 2009, and welcomed their daughter in 2013.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Dewan also spoke about her experiences as a mother\u2014and the mom-shaming that can sometimes come with it. (She recently faced criticism for posting so-called \u201ctoo-sexy\u201d photos on Instagram.) \u201cApparently, when you become a mother, you\u2019re supposed to leave your sexuality at the door, and I never understood that,\u201d she said of the experience. \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing sexier than becoming a mother. You give life. It\u2019s everything. And you don\u2019t change who you are inside just because you have a kid.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa38640da3e78ef75dd/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-871164664.jpg", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa5dc0cb25aaf1758cf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-871164664%25203.jpg", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa5dc0cb25aaf1758cf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-871164664%25203.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Allaire", "Christian Allair"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/jenna-dewan-channing-tatum-divorce-interview", "title": "Jenna Dewan Says Her Divorce From Channing Tatum Was \u201ca Positive Thing\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christian Allaire", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The dancer and World of Dance judge opened up about how her relationship with Channing Tatum has taken a \"new form.\"", "id": "5b5a193fdddda35c3961f7e1", "keywords": "living,channing tatum", "news_keywords": "living,channing tatum", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b5a193fdddda35c3961f7e1", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The dancer and World of Dance judge opened up about how her relationship with Channing Tatum has taken a \\\"new form.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa0dddda35c3961f7e3/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-871164664%202.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa0dddda35c3961f7e3/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-871164664%202.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The dancer and World of Dance judge opened up about how her relationship with Channing Tatum has taken a \"new form.\"", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa5dc0cb25aaf1758cf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-871164664%25203.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Jenna Dewan Says Her Divorce From Channing Tatum Was \u201ca Positive Thing\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/jenna-dewan-channing-tatum-divorce-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "The dancer and World of Dance judge opened up about how her relationship with Channing Tatum has taken a \"new form.\"", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b5a1fa5dc0cb25aaf1758cf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-871164664%25203.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Jenna Dewan Says Her Divorce From Channing Tatum Was \u201ca Positive Thing\u201d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
