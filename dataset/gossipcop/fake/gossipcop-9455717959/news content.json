We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she\u2019s wishing she was having ex Tyga\u2019s child instead of Travis Scott\u2019s.\n\nUh oh! As Kylie Jenner\u2018s due date approaches, her baby daddy Travis Scott, 25, is still pretty much absent from her life. Unlike her ex Tyga, 28, who was always there catering to the reality star\u2019s every whim. Now she wondering if she picked the wrong guy to have a baby with. \u201cKylie is dealing with major regrets over her pregnancy as her due date quickly approaches. She is second guessing the biggest decision in her life, having a baby with Travis. As her relationship with her baby daddy is so rocky and uncertain, Kylie is starting to think he she made the wrong decision by deciding to have a baby with someone who is no longer present much in her life,\u201d a source close to the cosmetics queen tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cShe has been having trouble sleeping late at night, worrying about her decisions. Kylie can\u2019t help but wonder how things would be different if her baby was Tyga\u2019s. She misses her ex Tyga, who was always caring and present, and she is beginning to think it should have been Tyga\u2019s baby, not Travis'\u201d our insider continues.\n\nThe 20-year-old\u2019s nearly three year relationship with Tyga had just ended for good a month before she started dating Travis back in April of 2017. She got pregnant after they were together for only a few months, which isn\u2019t exactly a solid foundation. At two months most couples haven\u2019t even said their \u201cI love you\u2019s\u201d yet, let alone find out they\u2019re becoming parents together. With Tyga, she knew she had a guy who loved her deeply and was always there for her, even if they did fight a lot. Plus he showed that he\u2019s already a great dad with his son King Cairo, 4. Who knows if Travis will make a wonderful father or not, but so far he hasn\u2019t exactly been the most supportive partner to someone he\u2019s going to share a child with.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Tyga would have made a better baby daddy for Kylie? Or do you think Travis will come through as a decent parent?", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F29%2Fkylie-jenner-regrets-pregnancy-travis-scott-wishes-tyga-baby%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2970232&comment_count=17", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-jenner-has-major-regrets-over-pregnancy-with-travis-scott-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-jenner-has-major-regrets-over-pregnancy-with-travis-scott-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/29/kylie-jenner-regrets-pregnancy-travis-scott-wishes-tyga-baby/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Has Major Regrets Over Pregnancy With Travis Scott \u2014 It Should Have Been Tyga\u2019s Baby", "meta_data": {"description": "Kylie Jenner is wishing her loving and supportive ex Tyga was the father of her baby instead of absentee daddy-to-be Travis Scott.", "news_keywords": "Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott, Tyga", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Has Major Regrets Over Pregnancy With Travis Scott \u2014 It Should Have Been Tyga\u2019s Baby", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/29/kylie-jenner-regrets-pregnancy-travis-scott-wishes-tyga-baby/", "description": "Kylie Jenner is having a case of baby daddy regret.
