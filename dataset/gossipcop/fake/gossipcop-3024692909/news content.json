Has this lengthy breakup process resulted in Pitt\u2019s own children locking him out of their lives?\n\n\u201cThis was a request to extend the temporary judge,\u201d an insider explains. \u201cThey both have both have kept the focus on their family. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but they are both committed to resolving it privately.\u201d\n\nIt all began when Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged incident on a plane between Pitt and their oldest son Maddox. The FBI and Children\u2019s Protective Services investigated claims of child abuse against the 53-year-old actor, but both later cleared him.\n\nShiloh Jolie-Pitt\u2019s Family Vacation Didn\u2019t End Well https://t.co/T9SDegLYiS \u2014 THE NEWS JUNKIE DAIL (@marciaalane1) January 30, 2018\n\nDespite recent reports, Jolie\u2019s decision to leave Pitt had nothing to do with their six kids\u2019 education. Some have claimed that the former couple had constant fights about how to raise their kids and where to send them to school, but those rumors have not been confirmed.\n\nJolie recently reflected on working with Pitt during her directorial debut in 2015\u2019s By the Sea, and she said that because they met while working together \u2013 referring to 2005\u2019s Mr. & Mrs. Smith \u2013 she knew they would work together well.\n\nThe Maleficent star said that in some ways the experience was good for their communication, and they learned some things, but there was a heaviness during shooting that had nothing to do with the film.\n\nShe added that she was glad that the two decided to explore something together, and even though it didn\u2019t solve things, they communicated something that they needed to each other.\n\nOh no!

During their recent trip to Paris, Jolie and her six kids visited the famous bridge overlooking the River Seine, and her 11-year-old daughter Shiloh fastened a lock marked with the first initial of everyone in the family, except her dad, and then threw the key into the water.\n\nThe French tradition \u2013 where Parisians and tourists write their names and date on a lock before throwing the key in the water \u2013 is a symbol that they are all \u201clocked in love forever.\u201d\n\nSince Shiloh didn\u2019t include her dad\u2019s initial it seems that she may have been disowning her dad, says a source close to the family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Kerby Alvy, the author of Parenting Errors, says that it\u2019s a mistake for Angelina Jolie not to include Pitt (the non-custodial parent) in family events because it sends a negative message to the kids that Brad Pitt is no longer part of the family.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Angelina-Jolie-Eternals-Comic-Con-700x466.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolie-Still-Working-Out-Divorce-As-Shiloh-Ignores-Him-In-Paris.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tyler-baltierra-1-700x466.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ab84a371143a7c6df6a80d27ea6e5266?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Angelina-Jolie-Wanted-700x466.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Brad-Pitt-SheKnows.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8a21d2b85e6cd7b79042628aa1476a8e?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolie-Still-Working-Out-Divorce-As-Shiloh-Ignores-Him-In-Paris.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-still-working-out-divorce-as-shiloh-ignores-him-in-paris-114263/", "title": "Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Still Working Out Divorce As Shiloh Ignores Him In Paris", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie, brad pitt,", "keywords": "celebrity news, angelina jolie, brad pitt,", "description": "More than a year and a half after their split, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are still working out the details of their divorce, and the couple has", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Still Working Out Divorce As Shiloh Ignores Him In Paris", "description": "More than a year and a half after their split, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are still working out the details of their divorce, and the couple has", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-still-working-out-divorce-as-shiloh-ignores-him-in-paris-114263/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolie-Still-Working-Out-Divorce-As-Shiloh-Ignores-Him-In-Paris.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip -
