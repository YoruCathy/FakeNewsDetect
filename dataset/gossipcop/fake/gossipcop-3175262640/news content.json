Is the Story true? Find out what Gossip Cop has to say about it! Share this\n\nThe latest news over the social media is Janet Jackson Inspiring Gwen Stefani To Have Another Baby! But is the news really true or is it just another wrong information? Let\u2019s Find out!\n\nJanet Jackson inspiration of new Baby for Gwen Stefani\n\nRecently Janet Jackson has shown the world that having a baby later in life is possible, and her experience has served as a hope to many people. Among those feeling inspired is Gwen Stefani.\n\nHollywoodLife.com reported recently that the 47-year-old singer is considering becoming a mother again after knowing that Janet gave birth at 50 years old. Though her three sons, Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3, do keep her plenty busy, the star would love to make her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, a dad. The inside source said:\n\n\u201cGwen would love to have another child with Blake. He\u2019s not pressuring her at all, but she knows it\u2019s something he would love too.\u201d\n\nThe source continued:\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility. It\u2019s made her start to see it as something she and Blake really could make happen.\u201d\n\nBut the story is not true. It was found to be the False report despite a new claim. Gossip Cop has found the truth!\n\nThe truth of the Story\n\nAccording to Gossip Cop, the news is just a rumor and it is a False Report. Also about the Hollywoodlife, Gossip Cop has found the truth and here it is.\n\nHollywoodLife, which has been caught on numerous occasions for concocting untrue articles, is at it again. This time around the often discredited site stated that Jackson, as a \u201clate-in-life mom, has \u201cinspired\u201d Stefani to have one more child with Shelton. The webloid first regurgitates such readily available information as Jackson was 50 when she gave birth to her baby boy Eissa, and that Stefani is currently 47 years old.\n\nIt then follows that up with a seemingly made-up quote that alleges that Stefani \u201cisn\u2019t focused on it obsessively, but seeing Janet Jackson have a healthy baby at 50 has inspired her to open her mind more to the possibility.\u201d\n\nWell, this is \u201cmore than a possibility\u201d: The site either relied on a yet another unreliable \u201cinsider\u201d or simply made up this fake news story on its own. Just a few days ago, the webloid alleged that Stefani and Shelton fight constantly over him wanting alone time. It was a big lie and was busted by Gossip Cop.\n\nAs Gossip Cop accurately reported, Stefani and Shelton did not split up.\n\nA number of equally untrustworthy sites that picked up its fabricated claim, Gossip Cop can stop this fake news story in its tracks.\n\nWhether she one day decides and is able to have a fourth child, it will have nothing to do Jackson. Plenty of other regular women, as well as those in the entertainment industry, have had kids later in life.\n\nShort Bio on Janet Jackson and Gwen Stefani:\n\nJanet Jackson is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actress.
