You take the good with the bad,\u201d the Black Sabbath vocalist, 68, told Rolling Stone in a profile published on Thursday, September 14. \u201cYou take the good with the bad. When I was a crazy f\u2013ker, I\u2019m lucky she didn\u2019t walk out. Now I\u2019m coming on five years clean and sober, and I\u2019ve realized what a f\u2013king idiot I was. I mean, I\u2019m still nuts, but in control of it a bit more.\u201d\n\nOzzy then backtracked on his earlier joke. \u201cWhen I said, \u2018Don\u2019t get caught by your missus,\u2019 I\u2019m not proud of all that s\u2013t,\u201d he explained. \u201cI upset my wife and I upset my family and I made a lot of shock and shame. I love my wife, and it made me realize what a f\u2013king idiot I\u2019ve been.\u201d\n\nThe Osbournes, who married in July 1982, briefly split earlier this year on the heels of the rocker\u2019s affair with hairstylist Michelle Pugh. They later reconciled and renewed their vows in May ahead of their 35th wedding anniversary. In a recent interview with The Telegraph, Sharon, 64, claimed that her husband cheated with six women, including \u201csome f\u2013king Russian teenager\u201d and their family\u2019s chef.\n\nOzzy told Rolling Stone that despite the bumps in the road, he and the Talk panelist still love each other. \u201cThere\u2019s no other woman I really want to spend the rest of my life with,\u201d he admitted. \u201cYou make a mistake and you learn by it. She\u2019s made a few mistakes, and so have I. You know when you hear these people go, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve been married 35 years and we\u2019ve never had a row.\u2019 I go, \u2018You must have been living in a different f\u2013king country.\u2019 Sometimes I\u2019ve looked at my wife and I\u2019ve just been angry as f\u2013k, and vice versa. Other times, I go, \u2018F\u2013k, I love you.'\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/458699696_ozzy-osbourne-sharon-osbourne-zoom-17f47a84-09c7-4df3-85a0-ceaccf48a1be.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/458699696_ozzy-osbourne-sharon-osbourne-zoom-2c18ebd7-0b4a-41ff-b584-d0d18c846782.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/458699696_ozzy-osbourne-sharon-osbourne-zoom-2c18ebd7-0b4a-41ff-b584-d0d18c846782.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ozzy-osbourne-opens-up-about-cheating-on-sharon-osbourne-w503444/", "title": "Ozzy Osbourne Opens Up About Cheating on Sharon Osbourne", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Ozzy Osbourne expressed regret over cheating on his wife, Sharon Osbourne, with a string of women in a new interview \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ozzy Osbourne: I Was a 'F--king Idiot' for Cheating on Sharon", "description": "Ozzy Osbourne expressed regret over cheating on his wife, Sharon Osbourne, with a string of women in a new interview \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ozzy-osbourne-opens-up-about-cheating-on-sharon-osbourne-w503444/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:32:40+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/458699696_ozzy-osbourne-sharon-osbourne-zoom-2c18ebd7-0b4a-41ff-b584-d0d18c846782.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/458699696_ozzy-osbourne-sharon-osbourne-zoom-2c18ebd7-0b4a-41ff-b584-d0d18c846782.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-09-15T17:07:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:32:40+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ozzy Osbourne expressed regret over cheating on his wife, Sharon Osbourne, with a string of women in a new interview \u2014 read more", "title": "Ozzy Osbourne: I Was a 'F--king Idiot' for Cheating on Sharon", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/458699696_ozzy-osbourne-sharon-osbourne-zoom-2c18ebd7-0b4a-41ff-b584-d0d18c846782.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505495220.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
