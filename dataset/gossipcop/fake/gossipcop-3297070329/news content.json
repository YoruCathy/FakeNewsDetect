The court said that the kids \u201care safe with their father\u201d and that it is \u201ccritical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship\u201d with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.\n\nJolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists \u201cto explain the summer schedule,\u201d the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband\u2019s custodial time.\n\nThe Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple\u2019s next court hearing on August 13.\n\nIn addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with \u201ceach of the minor children\u2019s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,\u201d according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.\n\nJolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, \u201cThis [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward. Brad will be wherever he needs to be for the kids.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Jolie responded to the release of the custody agreement in a statement to Us on Wednesday, June 13: \u201cThis misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children. From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It\u2019s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-agreement.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1585px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-agreement.jpg?w=238", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-agreement.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1585px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-reach-summer-custody-agreement/", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Reach Summer Custody Agreement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for summer 2018, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Reach Summer Custody Agreement", "description": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for summer 2018, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-reach-summer-custody-agreement/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-09-27T15:54:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-agreement.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1585px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-agreement.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1585px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-12T19:46:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-27T15:54:21+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for summer 2018, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly \u2014 details", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Reach Summer Custody Agreement", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-custody-agreement.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1585px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528832777.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
