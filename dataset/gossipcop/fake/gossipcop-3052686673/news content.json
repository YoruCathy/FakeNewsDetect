I think you have to take care of yourself and treat yourself well and have treats along the way and vacations and this and that. But I really think that working really hard for a long time is important. It\u2019s important for your mind, body and spirit.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Wants to Help Kylie\u2019s Business Continue to Thrive\n\nAnd when it comes to striking the delicate balance between parenting and managing, Jenner has a very specific approach: \u201cI\u2019m always Mom first,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED: Kylie Jenner Made $420 Million in First 18 Months of Her Kylie Cosmetics Business, Kris Jenner Says\n\n\u201cI love my kids more than anything, and it gives me such joy to see that they\u2019re following the path they love,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all really smart kids with amazing work ethics. That makes my job heaven because I don\u2019t have to babysit anybody. They\u2019re telling me, \u2018Let\u2019s do more. Faster.

Patrick MacLeod for WWD\n\nHowever, there are challenges to being the CEO of your children, she admitted.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like a juggle and every day you work for a different company,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut that\u2019s the exciting part. It\u2019s difficult but it\u2019s exciting because there\u2019s always something going on. Every day it\u2019s some big corporate fabulous thing that we\u2019re doing, or working on our individual beauty lines and clothing lines. I sometimes feel like a bit of a fireman because I\u2019m always putting out fires. So it\u2019s kind of got a double-edge sword. But it\u2019s exciting. And I love it. It\u2019s very satisfying.\u201d\n\nPlus, she\u2019s noticed her children approach business differently, from Kylie\u2019s cosmetics company to Khlo\u00e9\u2019s Good American denim label to Kim\u2019s beauty label to Kendall\u2019s modeling career to Kourtney\u2019s partnerships to Rob\u2019s sock line and beyond.\n\nImage zoom Jenner with her family in February 2016. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\n\u201cEverybody definitely has their own business style and they have their own way of doing things,\u201d she said. \u201cMy job to navigate is really letting them be who they truly are and letting them find their pace and find what works for them. And they\u2019re all really smart kids who seem to have a great sense of direction into how to market whatever they\u2019re doing to their fans and their followers. And I think we\u2019re learning from each other all the time, which is really great.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Jenner works tirelessly to make every wish come true for her children\u2014but what about her? \u201cI\u2019m up for anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI love to work. I\u2019m driven to do things and I get great satisfaction doing amazing things for my kids. I think I\u2019d love one day to do a clothing line \u2026 the possibilities are endless. I think we can do anything we set our minds to.\u201d\n\nFor more of our exclusive interview with Kris Jenner, pick up the new issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2Fkardashian-family.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner-wwd-summit.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=645&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner2-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=645&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner2-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sharon Kanter"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kris-jenner-retire-family-empire/", "title": "Kris Jenner Says She Has No Plans to Retire", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kendall Jenner,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,Kris Jenner,Kylie Jenner,Rollout,Style News", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kendall Jenner,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,Kris Jenner,Kylie Jenner,Rollout,Style News", "description": "\u201cBeing busy and working hard is instrumental in a long, healthy life,\u201d the world-famous momager, 61, tells PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "Kris Jenner Says She Has No Plans to Retire - But Insists Family Comes Ahead of Billion-Dollar Empire", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/kris-jenner-retire-family-empire/", "description": "Kris Jenner has made a career out of turning each of her children into superstars and entrepreneurs (as well as herself!) and she has no&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=645&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner2-2000.jpg", "width": 1231, "height": 645}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/style/kris-jenner-retire-family-empire/", "description": "\u201cBeing busy and working hard is instrumental in a long, healthy life,\u201d the world-famous momager, 61, tells PEOPLE", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner2-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/style/kris-jenner-retire-family-empire/", "title": "Kris Jenner Says She Has No Plans to Retire - But Insists Family Comes Ahead of Billion-Dollar Empire", "description": "\u201cBeing busy and working hard is instrumental in a long, healthy life,\u201d the world-famous momager, 61, tells PEOPLE", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1231&h=645&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F11%2Fkris-jenner2-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://people.com", "summary": ""}
