Ever since she started dating Scott Disick last year, the 19-year-old has seemingly morphed into his longtime ex Kourtney Kardashian, 38. Sofia wears similar clothes. She dyed her blond hair dark brown. She\u2019s been spotted out with Scott\u2019s kids. Did we mention she dyed her hair dark brown?! Don\u2019t think for a second that this is all a coincident!\n\n\u201cSofia wants to be Kourtney 2.0,\u201d an insider tells In Touch exclusively. \u201cShe\u2019s determined to hold on to Scott. What better way to do that than to become the woman he\u2019ll never stop loving?\u201d That may sound totally weird, but Scott, 34, is actually into it, according to the source. She\u2019s willing to stop at nothing to make this happen, including dressing like the reality star. \u201cIt\u2019s like she raided Kourt\u2019s closet!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, there\u2019s one person who finds it completely immature and laughable: Kourtney,\u201d continued the insider. How could you blame her? However, it sounds like Kourtney is taking the high road and not causing any drama over it. \u201cShe likes Sofia \u2014 she really has nothing against her \u2014 but she does think of her as a kid, a teenager, which she is.\u201d\n\nOne thing Kourtney isn\u2019t okay with is the fact that her baby daddy\u2019s teen girlfriend is trying to play mommy to her three kids. \u201c[Kourtney] doesn\u2019t love that Sofia is spending time with her kids,\u201d says an insider. Let\u2019s hope Sofia gives the mom enough space to avoid some major drama!\n\nFor more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/scott-disick-ewis-hamilton.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kourtney-sofia.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kourtney-sofia-b-suit.jpg?w=1180&h=750&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kourtney-sofia.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/scott-disick-kourtney-kardashian-sofia.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gigi-and-kendall.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/teen-mom-og-maci-doesnt-think-ryan-is-sober.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kourtney-sofia.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/sofia-richie-copying-kourtney-kardashian-154335/", "title": "Sofia Richie Is Copying Kourtney Kardashian's Whole Life (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Model Sofia Richie is keeping up with the Kardashians... at least one of them.
