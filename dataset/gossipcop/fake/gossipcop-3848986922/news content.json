We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why she\u2019s \u2018crushed\u2019 by the reports!\n\nBrad Pitt, 54, may have finally moved on from Angelina Jolie, 42. The Oscar-winning actor has been reportedly spending a lot of time with renowned architect Neri Oxman, and word has it Jennifer Aniston, 49, is NOT happy about it. \u201cJen is crushed after hearing the rumors that Brad has been talking to a beautiful, Angelina Jolie lookalike, MIT professor. Jen had her hopes up of a possible reconciliation with Brad since she and her ex started talking again. When they both became recently single, Jen thought the timing couldn\u2019t be better, and she might have her fairytale, happy ending with Brad after all. Jen never stopped loving him,\u201d a source close to Jen tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nAs we previously told you, Jennifer and Brad started speaking following her separation from her husband Justin Theroux, 46. A source explained to Star magazine that Jen and Brad \u201chave been secretly getting together for late-night hookups, and it\u2019s all because of George [Clooney].\u201d So, you can understand why she\u2019s so taken aback by the news! And TBH, so are we. We were SO here for a Brad and Jennifer reunion. Even Brad\u2019s mom Jane Pitt was hoping the two would rekindle things. \u201cBrad\u2019s mom Jane has always had a soft spot for Jennifer, even after their divorce they kept in touch for years,\u201d a source explained to HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. Aww!\n\nHowever, before we lose hope completely, Page Six claims things between Brad and Neri are strictly friendly. \u201cThis is best described as a professional friendship,\u201d a source told the outlet. Phew! There\u2019s hope after all. Nevertheless, we certainly wouldn\u2019t mind seeing Brad and Jen together again. But most importantly, we want them to be happy.", "images": ["https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/0ecfb7e275332c72a5d7c98a0963061b?s=64&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F05%2Fjennifer-aniston-sad-brad-pitt-girlfriend-rumors%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3068048", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/brad_jennifer-ftr.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/brad_jennifer-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/brad_jennifer-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett", "Amelia Edelman", "Jason Pham", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/05/jennifer-aniston-sad-brad-pitt-girlfriend-rumors/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston \u2018Crushed\u2019 Over Brad Pitt GF Rumors: She Was Hoping To Rekindle Their Romance", "meta_data": {"description": "Jennifer Aniston is sad over Brad Pitt's girlfriend rumors.
