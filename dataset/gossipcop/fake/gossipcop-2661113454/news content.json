That's the whole point, isn't it?\n\nStill, it's not that she hasn't tried before.\n\nRemember the reality star's single, \"Jam (Turn It Up),\" from 2011? Most people probably don't. The song gained practically no traction.\n\nIn 2012 Kardashian was quoted as saying that she would never try to launch a singing career. \"No, I'd never (make another single), that was just for fun, and for charity,\" she said at the time.\n\nProceeds from her single, which failed to make the charts, reportedly went to fund St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140617180904-entt1-kim-kardashian-06172014-story-top.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/3.0/global/misc/advertisement.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140526105501-mxp-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-wedding-00001124-story-body.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140529123005-kardashians-hamptons-southampton-kourtney-khloe-kim-kanye-00002804-story-body.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.e/img/3.0/mosaic/bttn_close.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/images/1.gif"], "top_img": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140617180904-entt1-kim-kardashian-06172014-story-top.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/18/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/kim-kardashian-music/index.html", "title": "Is Kim Kardashian pursuing a music career?", "meta_data": {"robots": "index,follow", "googlebot": "noarchive", "viewport": "width=1024", "medium": "news", "title": "Is Kim Kardashian pursuing a music career? - CNN.com", "og": {"description": "A British tabloid is reporting that Kim Kardashian may be pursuing a music career again.", "title": "Is Kim Kardashian pursuing a music career?", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/18/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/kim-kardashian-music/index.html", "site_name": "CNN", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140617180904-entt1-kim-kardashian-06172014-story-top.jpg"}, "author": "Lisa Respers France, CNN", "section": "showbiz", "source": "CNN", "subsection": "celebrity news gossip", "pubdate": "2014-06-18T16:52:58Z", "lastmod": "2014-06-18T18:24:31Z", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/18/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/kim-kardashian-music/index.html"}, "fb": {"page_id": 129343697106537, "app_id": 80401312489}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@CNN", "id": 759251}, "creator": {"identifier": "@cnnshowbiz", "id": 110458336}, "description": "A British tabloid is reporting that Kim Kardashian may be pursuing a music career again.", "title": "Is Kim Kardashian pursuing a music career?", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/18/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/kim-kardashian-music/index.html", "image": {"src": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140617180904-entt1-kim-kardashian-06172014-left-tease.jpg"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1403020800.0, "source": "http://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
