But even after they tied the knot in 2008, the couple has largely kept quiet about their romance.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it's always been smooth sailing for the \"Crazy in Love\" couple.\n\nIn an interview with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet, Jay-Z opened up about his infidelity, which Beyonc\u00e9 alluded to in her acclaimed visual album Lemonade.\n\n\"You shut down all emotions,\" the rapper told Baquet. \"So even with women, you gonna shut down emotionally, so you can't connect... In my case, like it's, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity.\"\n\nJay-Z went on to reveal the couple used their craft \"like a therapy session,\" making music together in order to heal. The sessions ultimately resulted in reconciliation, along with Lemonade and Jay-Z's album 4:44.\n\nHere's a look back on the relationship of Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9:", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5a1f1e453dbef48d0e8b8e15?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f35fdf914c354018b6e64?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f39833dbef4cf008b90f4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f1e273dbef4b5748b8928?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3738f914c35a018b6e2f?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f1e273dbef4b5748b8928?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3378f914c356018b6e89?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-jay-z-marriage-2017-11?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f37ee3dbef4cc1d8b8e5b?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f370ef914c356018b6ea3?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3b2af914c360018b6f0e?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3d033dbef426008b910d?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a2037153dbef4e3058b91cc?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5a2036743dbef484008b938c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3dd13dbef484008b91d0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f33353dbef4a7748b89e9?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3885f914c357018b6e4c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f3a07f914c356018b6eb5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5a1f384ff914c351018b6dd0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a1f1e453dbef48d0e8b8e15?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["\u00c1ine Cain"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/beyonce-jay-z-marriage-2017-11", "title": "Inside the marriage of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, who sport matching ring finger tattoos, weathered a cheating scandal, and are worth over $1 billion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Inside the marriage of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, who sport matching ring finger tattoos, weathered a cheating scandal, and are worth over $1 billion", "date": "2018-03-02", "news_keywords": "Beyonce, Jay Z, Marriage, Relationship, Features, Arts & Culture, \u00c1ine Cain", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z have been married for nine years.
