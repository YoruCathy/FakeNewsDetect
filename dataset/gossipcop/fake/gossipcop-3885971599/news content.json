County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Philip Brooks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrooks described a chain reaction involving four cars:\n\nA woman driving northbound in a Toyota Prius slowed down or stopped for reasons that were unclear. An elderly woman driving a Lexus sedan rear-ended the Prius.\n\nJenner, who was driving a black Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicle that was hauling a trailer carrying an off-road vehicle, then rear-ended the Lexus.\n\nThe impact propelled the Lexus into oncoming traffic, where a Hummer traveling southbound slammed into the Lexus. The driver of the Lexus, whom authorities declined to identify, died at the scene. Both the front and rear ends of the Lexus were severely damaged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the crash, a swelling crowd of onlookers and paparazzi led rescuers to call in reinforcements to manage the scene.\n\n\u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nSeveral guests at the nearby Malibu Beach RV Park walked down to the crash site and watched as authorities pulled the victim\u2019s body from the mangled remains of the Lexus.\n\nPhotos on the celebrity gossip website TMZ showed Jenner, in sunglasses and a baseball cap, surveying the wreckage. Three photos showed the moment of impact when he rear-ended the Lexus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenner passed a field sobriety test and took a blood-alcohol test, Brooks said. The results were not immediately available. Investigators plan to examine his mobile phone records to see whether he was using the phone when the crash occurred.\n\nJenner spokesman Alan Nierob declined to explain what happened.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t have any details relating to this accident other than confirming [that] my client was uninjured,\u201d Nierob said in an email.\n\nFive people, including three children, were injured in the wreck, but none was seriously hurt, said Lt. Jennifer Seetoo, watch commander of the Malibu/Lost Hills Sheriff\u2019s Station in Agoura.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy nightfall, the highway was still closed to traffic just west of Pepperdine University and wasn\u2019t expected to reopen until at least 9 p.m.\n\nAt 6:30 p.m., a motorist plowed through the road closure on Pacific Coast Highway and crashed into two of the four vehicles involved in the earlier collision, said sheriff\u2019s Cmdr. Mike Parker. The driver was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving.\n\nTimes staff writers Christie D\u2019Zurilla and Amanda Covarrubias contributed to this report.\n\nFrom the archives, stories about celebrity and paparazzi:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid Lazarus: Bieber has a point on paparazzi\n\nCalabasas wrestles with the Bieber effect\n\nEditorial: You have a problem with the paparazzi?", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49047b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F70%2F1b%2F32700fd43cfe697dd7d065266f8b%2Fimg-572cfc54-turbine-la-bio-richard-winton", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ab5ef4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1365x1365+342+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fea%2F5e%2F764a3e4634ddf61f2f4532e023c8%2Fimg-5bda4f49-turbine-la-bio-michael-finnegan", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b26c436/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1125x1125+438+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2Fa8%2Ff875efbbaf23269d3c880061bfc8%2Fimg-58acf270-turbine-la-bio-kate-linthicum"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2816d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F78%2F7c3e41e74e4b986d23923ee121b2%2Flat-logo-dark-full.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Finnegan Is A Los Angeles Times Politics Writer Covering The Presidential Campaign.
