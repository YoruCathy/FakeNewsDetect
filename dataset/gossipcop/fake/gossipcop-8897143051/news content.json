The film sees Pattinson play Samuel Alabaster, more greenhorn than pioneer, as he sets off on an adventure with the love of his life, Penelope, played by Mia Wasikowska.\n\nPattinson said he had a \u201cgreat time\u201d playing vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight franchise and he wouldn\u2019t rule out more big-budget franchises. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a bad experience on any film I\u2019ve done, maybe one. The only reason I\u2019m a little cautious about big franchise films is that you can\u2019t make them R rated. If you have a big budget, there\u2019s more people on you to do it a [specific] way or you\u2019re fired. If you keep a budget contained, if people think they can get their money back, you can experiment more.\u201d\n\nHe added that he believed that there will be a \u201cresurgence\u201d of mid-budget movies that will allow actors to experiment more. \u201cPeople were scared when the streaming services came out, but, to me, it seems there\u2019s a second wave. There\u2019s a bunch of new studios, mid-budget filmmaking is coming back and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nPattison said he was attracted to Damsel as he was rarely offered roles in comedies. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many western comedies. In terms of the comedies, it\u2019s tough to find one that has an interesting character, you\u2019re usually playing for laughs. There\u2019s such a stable of comedy actors and I\u2019m not seen as a comedy actor so it will always go to a bunch of people before me. I found it so strange and felt like abstract version of a comedy and it appealed to me in the same way as a drama. It was really fun to play, it has an odd tone, so it was fun to try and figure out how to fit into it.\u201d\n\nDamsel starts off as a classic western, a horseback odyssey with plenty of shootouts. However, on his way looking for love, there\u2019s a twist: Penelope, it seems, is not a damsel in distress. Wasikowska called it \u201cvery clever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were led to believe one thing about this character and that gets flipped on its head,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Zellners, who also directed 2008\u2019s Goliath and 2014\u2019s Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, said that they were big fans of the western genre but didn\u2019t want to make another sepia-toned film. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fans of westerns since we were kids [but we were] bored of the clich\u00e9s and tropes. The female characters are usually pretty boring or a prize to be obtained by the hero and those elements were tiresome and not interesting so we wanted to make Penelope a complex human\u2026 and then amp it up for comedic purposes,\u201d said Nathan Zellner. Damsel is being by Great Point Media and ICM in Berlin.\n\nWasikowska and Pattinson were asked about the #MeToo campaign, which has been a prominent feature of the festival. Wasikowska said she thought it was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent much of the last year in Australia so I\u2019ve been watching from afar,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Respect Rally in Sundance was the first thing I was able to be a part of. I think it\u2019s going to [lead to] really significant change.\u201d Pattinson added that being \u201cbullied into silence\u201d was one of the most awful things and that it was \u201camazing when any kind of dam breaks.\u201d\n\nPattinson can next be seen in Claire Denis\u2019 English-language debut High Life, alongside Juliette Binoche and Mia Goth. The sci-fi film, which is being sold by Wild Bunch and CAA at Berlin, follows a father and daughter struggling to survive in deep space.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/damsel-sundance.jpg?w=952", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2018%2F02%2Frobert-pattinson-dishes-on-western-comedy-damsel-as-he-says-he-would-absolutely-return-to-franchise-land-1202291371%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202291371&comment_count=2", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/damsel-sundance.jpg?w=952", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter White"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/02/robert-pattinson-dishes-on-western-comedy-damsel-as-he-says-he-would-absolutely-return-to-franchise-land-1202291371/", "title": "Robert Pattinson Dishes on Western Comedy \u2018Damsel\u2019 As He Says He Would \u201cDefinitely\u201d Return To Franchise-Land", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Robert Pattinson has said that he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d return to the land of the big tentpole franchise but added that he believed independent cinema was going through a \u201csecond wave\u201d.", "news_keywords": "Berlin Film Festival, Damsel, EFM, Robert Pattinson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Robert Pattinson Dishes on Western Comedy \u2018Damsel\u2019 As He Says He Would \u201cDefinitely\u201d Return To Franchise-Land", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/02/robert-pattinson-dishes-on-western-comedy-damsel-as-he-says-he-would-absolutely-return-to-franchise-land-1202291371/", "description": "Robert Pattinson has said that he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d return to the land of the big tentpole franchise but added that he believes independent cinema is going through a \u201csecond wave.\u201d The Twilight st\u2026", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/damsel-sundance.jpg?w=952", "width": 952, "height": 536}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-16T14:10:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-16T14:26:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Deadline", "text": {"title": "Robert Pattinson Dishes on Western Comedy \u2018Damsel\u2019 As He Says He Would \u201cDefinitely\u201d Return To Franchise-Land"}, "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/damsel-sundance.jpg?w=952", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@peterzwhite", "title": "Robert Pattinson Dishes on Western Comedy \u2018Damsel\u2019 As He Says He Would \u201cDefinitely\u201d Return To Franchise-Land", "description": "Robert Pattinson has said that he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d return to the land of the big tentpole franchise but added that he believed independent cinema was going through a \u201csecond wave\u201d."}, "author": "Peter White", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202291371, "title": "Robert Pattinson Dishes on Western Comedy 'Damsel' As He Says He Would \"Definitely\" Return To Franchise-Land", "published_at": "2018-02-16 06:10:23", "image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/damsel-sundance.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1", "comment_count": 2, "tags": "Robert Pattinson", "topics": "International", "body": "Robert Pattinson has said that he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d return to the land of the big tentpole franchise but added that he believes independent cinema is going through a \u201csecond wave.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Twilight star was in Berlin to promote Damsel, the western comedy from Kid-Thing directors David and Nathan Zellner, which is playing in competition at the festival.
