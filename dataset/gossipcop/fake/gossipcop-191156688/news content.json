Hint: a major duet may be coming our way!\n\n\u201cSeeing each other at the event was great, and they first gushed over fashion and their dresses. They both were jealous of how good the other looked. It was a total love-fest for the girls, who don\u2019t get to see each other all that often. Demi was concerned about Selena\u2019s health and Selena assured her she was doing great,\u201d our source adds. Furthermore, \u201cthey both complimented each other\u2019s new music and reaffirmed that they are not only friends, but also big fans of each other\u2019s music too. That also brought up the possibility of a collaboration. Selena and Demi both dropped names of major music producers they loved working with and vowed to make time in the near future to put something out together.\u201d OMG! We\u2019re dead.\n\nAnd guess what? Music and fashion weren\u2019t all Selena and Demi, 25, talked about \u2014 they also discussed BOYS, because, well\u2026 duh! \u201cDemi asked about [ The Weeknd ] and Selena gushed over how sweet he treats her, especially when they are all alone. They both seemed genuinely happy for each other, where they are in life, and are equally excited about their futures.\u201d We wonder if they also talked about Selena\u2019s recent reunion with Justin Bieber . Hmm\u2026.\n\nHollywoodLifers, were you excited to see Demi and Selena back together again? Would you like them to make a song together?
