Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a \u201chush-hush annulment.\u201d\n\nSubscribe To Our Newsletters \u2014 And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox\n\nThe smell test: For the love of Liverpool \u2014 this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It\u2019s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she\u2019s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn\u2019t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we\u2019re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what\u2019s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even \u201chush-hush annulments\u201d are a matter of public record. The Enquirer\u2019s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service) probably \u201cscrubbed the records\u201d to conceal Markle\u2019s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.\n\nThe rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie\n\nWhere you heard it: Vanity Fair\n\nThe report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple\u2019s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It\u2019s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard is that they\u2019re seriously worried about the sex scene,\u201d the movie\u2019s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his \u201cwife\u2019s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.\u201d\n\nThe smell test: What really reeks here is Huda\u2019s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife\u2019s connection, you can be sure he won\u2019t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude \u2014 it\u2019s called protecting your source.) Is the palace \u201cseriously worried\u201d about this movie? It\u2019s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it\u2019s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they\u2019d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan\u2019s premarital sex-fest wasn\u2019t coming soon to a TV near you, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal \u2014 a 1 being Kate Middleton\u2019s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles\u2019s tampon ambitions \u2014 this is a 2.\n\nThe rumour: Meghan\u2019s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah\n\nWhere you heard it: The Mirror\n\nThe report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle\u2019s mom visited Winfrey\u2019s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O\u2019s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed \u201cUS TV source,\u201d who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: \u201cIt\u2019s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,\u201d quoth The Mirror\u2019s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.\n\nRumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton \u2018Hate Each Other\u2019s Guts.\u2019 Is That Really The Case?\n\nThe smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a \u201ctell-all\u201d if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a \u201ctell-none\u201d approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it\u2019s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.\n\nThe rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring\n\nWhere you heard it: E! News\n\nThe report: This will-he-or-won\u2019t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap \u201cdoes want to wear a wedding band.\u201d Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen\u2019s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.\n\nThe smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that\u2019s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan\u2019s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.", "images": ["https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/themes/chatelaine.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-feud.jpeg", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-prince-harry-relationship-timeline-2.jpg", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/close.png", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/info.png", "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Meghan-Markle-secret-first-husband.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.chatelaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Meghan-Markle-secret-first-husband.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courtney Shea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chatelaine.com/living/entertainment/meghan-markle-secret-first-husband/", "title": "Did Meghan Markle Have A Secret First Husband?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Did Meghan Markle Have A Secret First Husband?\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.chatelaine.com\\/living\\/entertainment\\/meghan-markle-secret-first-husband\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2018-05-09 16:41:13\",\"mod_date\":\"2018-05-15 09:48:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"508988\",\"author_id\":\"1\",\"author_name\":\"Chatelaine Staff\",\"author_display_name\":\"Chatelaine\",\"tags\":[\"Editor&#039;s Picks\",\"Royals\"],\"categories\":[\"Entertainment\",\"Facebook Instant Articles\"],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/www.chatelaine.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2018\\/05\\/Meghan-Markle-secret-first-husband.jpg\",\"image_alt\":\"Did Meghan Markle have a secret first husband?\"}", "description": "Is there any truth in the latest batch of royal wedding rumours?
