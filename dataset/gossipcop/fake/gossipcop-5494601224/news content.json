After posing for a meet-and-greet photo with Swift, Mueller was confronted by the singer\u2019s bodyguard, who claimed he had reached under her dress and grabbed her butt.\n\nThe DJ was subsequently escorted out of the arena, leading to his being fired. Following the alleged incident, he filed a lawsuit against Swift, seeking up to $3 million in damages, claiming he was falsely accused and that Swift should have contacted police rather than his bosses. Swift did not go to the police, despite Mueller\u2019s request, because she wanted to keep the alleged incident \u201cdiscreet and quiet and confidential,\u201d her attorney Douglas Baldridge argued in court, the AP reports.\n\nJudge William Martinez ruled on Friday that Swift could not be held liable because Mueller failed to prove that she personally set out to have him fired. His similar allegations against Swift\u2019s mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell, will go to jurors for a verdict, with closing statements set for Monday, August 14.\n\nThe Grammy winner\u2019s case against Mueller for assault and battery is still going forward. A BuzzFeed reporter tweeted on Friday that the \u201cBad Blood\u201d singer hugged her lawyer and her brother, Austin Swift, in the courtroom after the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\nSwift, who is countersuing the DJ for $1, took the stand on Thursday, August 10, to detail the incident. \u201cIt was a definite grab \u2014 a very long grab. He stayed latched on to my bare ass cheek as I moved away from him. I was visibly uncomfortable,\u201d Swift, 27, said, per an Us Weekly reporter in the courtroom. \u201cAfter this happened it was like a light switched off my personality.\u201d\n\nMueller\u2019s attorney noted that the singer could have taken a break following the alleged incident. \u201cAnd your client could have taken a normal photo with me,\u201d Swift replied. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ruin the experience for fans in line.\u201d\n\nThe DJ, however, claims that he did not touch her butt, but rather placed his hand higher on her body. \u201cI felt what seemed to be a rib cage or ribs,\u201d he said during a testimony on Thursday.\n\nSwift\u2019s former bodyguard, Greg Dent, took the stand on Friday, August 11. \u201cHis hand went under her skirt. I did not see his hand touch her physically. I saw his hand under her skirt,\u201d Dent said during his testimony. \u201cShe reacted, pushed her skirt down and moved over. So in my opinion, I knew he touched her.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s countersuit against the DJ will also go before a jury next week with closing arguments set to begin on Monday morning.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-zoom-2ef4b98a-73f2-4ff2-aea2-014f8136fab1.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-zoom-19b7ac24-bca6-49d9-a17e-dcde1155caf4.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-zoom-19b7ac24-bca6-49d9-a17e-dcde1155caf4.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Becca Blond"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/judge-dismisses-dj-david-muellers-case-against-taylor-swift-w497404/", "title": "Judge Dismisses DJ David Mueller\u2019s Case Against Taylor Swift", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "A judge threw out DJ David Mueller's case against Taylor Swift on Friday, August 11, saying he can't prove the singer got him fired \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Judge Dismisses DJ David Mueller's Case Against Taylor Swift", "description": "A judge threw out DJ David Mueller's case against Taylor Swift on Friday, August 11, saying he can't prove the singer got him fired \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/judge-dismisses-dj-david-muellers-case-against-taylor-swift-w497404/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:42:35+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-zoom-19b7ac24-bca6-49d9-a17e-dcde1155caf4.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-zoom-19b7ac24-bca6-49d9-a17e-dcde1155caf4.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-12T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:42:35+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A judge threw out DJ David Mueller's case against Taylor Swift on Friday, August 11, saying he can't prove the singer got him fired \u2014 get the details", "title": "Judge Dismisses DJ David Mueller's Case Against Taylor Swift", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/taylor-swift-zoom-19b7ac24-bca6-49d9-a17e-dcde1155caf4.jpg?crop=0px%2C116px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502496000.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
