How funny were they together.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile another added: \u2018Hell yessss!! I still live for this programme and will forever be one of my faves! A comeback would be EPIC.\u2019\n\nSomeone else replied: \u2018IS THAT EVEN A QUESTION!! OF COURSE.\u2019\n\nHilton starred in the reality show from 2003 to 2005 alongside her best bud Nicole Richie. However following a very public fall out, the final season saw Richie replaced by Kimberly Stewart.\n\nHowever it looks like their differences have been put aside as the two were photographed together at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards on Sunday.\n\nParis has also revealed that Richie will be invited to her wedding (Picture: Fox)\n\nParis took to Twitter to share a snap of their reunion with the caption: \u2018Love you @ NicoleRichie No one could make me laugh like you do. # SimpleLifeReunion # SanaSa.\u2019\n\nShe has also confirmed that Richie will be invited to her wedding along with all of her other gals.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the bride-to-be said: \u2018All my girls will be invited. Right now, we\u2019re just picking out the dress and the location.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s so much to plan so I just can\u2019t wait. It\u2019s a really exciting time for everyone.\u2019\n\nParis and her soon to be hubby Chris will be sparing no expense when it comes to their big day and the DJ wishes to wear a dress that looks like something pulled straight out of a Disney film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe said: \u2018It\u2019s a lot of planning to do. Right now, we are just trying to figure out a date and a location and my dress. I definitely want it to be very magical. I love Disney princess vibes.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
