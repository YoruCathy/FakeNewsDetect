We [Italy] should not have to deal with these people on our own.\n\n\u2018Europe [the EU] does nothing to help us. Now they make us \u2013 me, my family and other Italian families \u2013 pay for them.\u2019\n\nHousewife Federica, 55, said: \u2018A small number of immigrants is not a problem but now they are so many.\n\n\u2018You see them arriving at that the San Giovanni station.

There are simply too many of them.\u2019\n\nHe celebrated his marriage to Amal Clooney at the \u00a37.5 million Italian home in the picturesque village of Laglio where he keeps an impressive wine cellar and tours the lake on a motor launch.\n\nScenes for Clooney\u2019s heist-movie Oceans Twelve were shot at his Villa Oleandra and actors Emily Blunt and John Krasinski were married in the grounds.\n\nCo-star Brad Pitt and his wife Angelina Jolie are frequent house guests. Matt Bellamy, frontman of the band Muse, who has his own villa along the shore, often pops in.\n\nHowever those who work and live in the area fear the area is being permanently damaged.\n\nSimona, 27, who works in a shop, said: \u2018We don\u2019t need any more immigrants here. They are already all over the town. I really hope the situation will not get any worse. Already they sleep in the park. We don\u2019t want people all over the streets.\n\n\u2018This will only ruin the tourist trade. No one will want to come here.\u2019\n\nRomance: Clooney and his wife celebrated their first year of marriage in Lake Como earlier this week as locals voiced concerns about the number of migrants coming to the area\n\nHoliday home: George Clooney bought his Lake Como property (pictured) for \u00a37.5million in 2002 and spends four months a year here, getting a private jet and catching a boat, which is moored at the bottom of his garden\n\nBelgian ex-pat Nico said: \u2018This is a complex issue. Europe has to work together to solve this problem. Italy cannot take on the responsibility on its own.\u2019\n\nItalian newspapers have suggested Como could become a small \u2018Ventimiglia\u2019 \u2013 the frontier town with France where hundreds of migrants set up a camp and fought pitched battles with police last year after Paris closed the border.\n\nThe lake-side town, just a few miles from the main Italy-Switzerland border, is already home to hundreds of migrants from Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with more arriving every day.\n\nPlans to set up a purpose-built migrant camp on the outskirts of Como had to be scrapped following bad-tempered protests from locals.\n\nInstead immigrants, who have registered a claim for asylum in Italy, are housed in up to 100 hostels throughout the town. They also receive a Euro 75-a-month subsistence allowance while the demand is processed.\n\nOthers \u2013 recent arrivals to the town and those whose asylum applications have been turned down \u2013 sleep in makeshift camps and under bridges.\n\nAlready the winding cobbled streets of Como\u2019s old town are overrun by young Asian men hawking umbrellas, flowers and other goods. Africans sleep in the parks and North Africans chatter on their mobile phones.\n\nSome have praised the Swiss for holding back the tide of migrants.\n\nEllen and Klaus from Dortmund, Germany, said: \u2018Good. I\u2019m pleased to hear that the Switzerland has closed the border. This will help Germany. We [Germany] cannot save the world on our own. Already we have taken in so many thousands of refugees.\n\n\u2018We have had a lot of problems. I don\u2019t know if you know what happened in Cologne on New Years Eve. It only takes a few to cause problems but this was serious.\n\n\u2018No one minds someone who learns the language and gets a job but it\u2019s the others.\n\n\u2018Really other [EU] countries should also help.\u2019\n\nOthers have called for European countries to act together to solve the migrant crisis.\n\nStudent Miriam 24 said: \u2018Europe has turned nasty after the Brexit vote. Every country is looking for itself now, that is what I think.\n\nComplex problem: Belgian expat Nico (pictured with his daughter) told MailOnline: 'Italy cannot take on the responsibility on its own.\u2019\n\nUnhappy: Ellen and Klaus from Dortmund, Germany, (left) say it is time Switzerland closed its borders while Arab Israeli Maher says everyone should be allowed to go where they want\n\n\u2018But people here in Lombardy [region of Como] are open-minded. I don\u2019t know if the town will become like Ventimiglia. But we have to work together to solve this problem with refugees.\u2019\n\nTourist Arab Israeli Maher said: \u2018I think everyone should be able to travel wherever they want to go. Europe is meant to be a place where you can travel without borders. This should not be just for people from Europe but for everyone from whatever country.\u2019\n\nWe don\u2019t need any more immigrants here. They are already all over the town. I really hope the situation will not get any worse. Already they sleep in the park.

I just want to start a new life.\u2019\n\nOssas, 39, from Nigeria, said: \u2018We want a new life in Italy but we have to move on because Italy often does not accept us as refugees.\n\n\u2018We have all claimed asylum here in Italy but 90 per cent of claims are refused.\n\n\u2018If we are refused we are given seven days to leave the hostel and we no longer receive any money.\n\n\u2018So we have to sleep in the streets and try to find something to eat. That is why we try to go to other countries.\u2019\n\nOthers explained reasons why they risked had their lives to cross the Mediterranean a seek a new life in Europe.\n\nDumbuya, 23, a teacher from Mali, said: \u2018I am from the north of the country where there is war. I had to leave my country because of the war.\n\n\u2018First I went to Libya and worked there but I was kidnapped by the Islamists and held as a prisoner. I escaped and made my way to the coast.\n\n\u2018I had to come to Europe to save my life.\n\n\u2018I have not seen my family for four years. I just want to start a new life.\u2019\n\nLorry driver Lucky Obera, 29, fled his home in Nigeria after receiving death threats.\n\nHe said: \u2018I had a crash in my lorry and killed a man. Then his family tried to kill me. I had to escape.\n\nSuperstars: Celebrities such as Madonna, Brad Pitt and his wife Angelina Jolie are frequently seen in Lake Como as is Matt Bellamy, frontman of the band Muse, who has his own villa along the shore that he shared with former wife Kate Hudson\n\nHigh society: Franklin Roosevelt Jnr, son of the late US president, and wife Ethel (nee du Pont) enjoyed their honeymoon at Lake Como and Banking heir James Rothchild proposed to hotel heiress Nicky Hilton on a boat on the lake in the shadow of the Swiss mountains\n\nLuxury: Como\u2019s grand Villa d\u2019Este hotel charges up to \u00a32,000-a-night. Previous guests include the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, US President JFK with Marilyn Monroe and more recently although separately Madonna and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nIdris, 23, from Senegal, fled when Islamist rebels tried to force him to become a fighter.\n\nHe said: \u2018The rebels came to my village and said I had to join them in their fight. I ran away. I made my way to Libya and got on a boat.\n\n\u2018It was a small rubber boat with a capacity for 80 people. But the smugglers made 150 get on boat.\n\n\u2018The journey was terrible. We were in the sea for four days. It was hell. Some 30 people died on the journey.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/17/18/27329034-0-image-a-10_1587145310401.jpg",
