Lauer has not publicly commented on the firing. NBC did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe news of Lauer's firing comes on the heels of several other high-profile sexual misconduct scandals involving rich and powerful men, including the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and Lauer's fellow TV hosts Charlie Rose and Bill O'Reilly. Another thing Lauer shares with O'Reilly: Before they were fired, the two were among the highest-paid hosts on TV, with O'Reilly reportedly making $18.5 million per year and Lauer pulling in $25 million annually.\n\nBill O'Reilly's net worth has been estimated at $85 million, compared to Matt Lauer's net worth estimation of $60 million. But there are reasons to believe Matt Lauer's net worth is much higher. In 2012, he signed a new contract with NBC that paid him a reported $25 million per year, up from $17 million annually prior. So Lauer's gross career worth easily tops $100 million, and are perhaps even over $200 million.\n\nLauer has enjoyed a wealthy lifestyle over the years. He and his wife Annette Lauer have bought and sold multiple homes in the ritzy Hamptons over the years, including the 2016 purchase of the actor Richard Gere's 12-bedroom waterfront house in North Haven for $33 million. Nearby, Matt and Annette also own a 40-acre, world-class horse-training facility, Bright Side Farm, where they keep their horses and board the horses of wealthy clients in oversized stalls.\n\nHow much money does Matt Lauer make?\n\nMatt Lauer's first job was at a clothing store in Greenwich, Conn., where he earned a whopping $2.50 an hour. Lauer has since gone on to command a salary among the highest on TV.\n\nIn 2001 Katie Couric, Lauer's then-co-host of Today, \"set new pay standards for the television news,\" according to the New York Times, when she received a contract paying a reported $15 million to $16 million per year. At the time, Lauer was earning perhaps $4 million per year. By 2002 Lauer's salary was up to an estimated $8 million.\n\nMatt Lauer and Katie Couric hosting the Today show in 2005.

Roughly five years later, Lauer's new Today contract paid him $25 million per year, and his annual earnings have been estimated as high as $28 million. In 2016, Forbes named Lauer as the fifth-highest-paid TV host, and late that year he signed a new contract that would have paid him $20 million per year into 2018 had he not been fired.\n\nMatt Lauer's homes and horse farm\n\nDuring the normal work week, Lauer reportedly lives in a co-op apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side, where the disgraced Ponzi scheme swindler Bernie Madoff also used to live. The Lauers bought the apartment in 2004 for $5.9 million. When Madoff's penthouse apartment in the same building sold in 2014, the buyer paid $14.5 million.\n\nMatt and Annette Lauer have also owned multiple swanky properties in the Hamptons, on the eastern end of Long Island. In late 2016, the Lauers sold a three-bedroom cottage in Southampton for $3.5 million. They'd purchased the 1,800-foot Cape Cod cottage in 2009 for $2.1 million.\n\nAnother Hamptons home owned by the Lauers\u2014a 25-acre estate in Sag Harbor\u2014is currently listed for sale with an asking price of $14.9 million, after being listed as high as $18 million in the past.\n\nMatt Lauer's 25-acre Hamptons estate listed for $14.9 million. Susan Breitenbach\n\nThe reason the Lauers are selling their 8,000-square-foot home in Sag Harbor appears to be because in 2016 they purchased Strongheart. That's the name of the 6.3-acre waterfront North Haven estate once owned by the actor Richard Gere. The Lauers paid $33 million for the property, which includes a 12-bedroom, 12-bathroom, 12,000-square foot mansion, a separate tea house poised on the edge of a private pond, a basketball court, a 60-foot pool, and 300 feet of sandy beach on the bay.\n\nThe North Haven estate previously owned by Richard Gere.
