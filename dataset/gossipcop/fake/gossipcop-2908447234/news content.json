HollywoodLife.com has learned EXCLUSIVELY that Blake is totally terrified that Miranda may never stop singing about him!\n\n\u201cBlake [Shelton] is genuinely happy for all of Miranda [Lambert]\u2018s success,\u201d an insider told HollywoodLife.com of how the 40-year-old \u201cCame Here to Forget\u201d singer feels about his 33-year-old ex-wife. \u201cBlake is not surprised at all that Miranda wrote so many hit songs about her heartbreak because their marriage was full of passion, drinking and love. All the things that make for a great country song.\u201d\n\n[interaction id=\u201d58e2d17e91ffef776d19a634\u2033]\n\n\u201cBlake is relieved to have moved on from the most challenging time in his life, but he worries that Miranda has enough material to write several more albums about their time together,\u201d the source continued. \u201cBlake is hoping that Miranda finds new inspiration for her music and that she doesn\u2019t spend the rest of her life singing about him.\u201d\n\nThough Blake might be irritated by the idea that Miranda could be singing about him for years to come, he has definitely got too many good things going on in his life to be too concerned about it. The country music crooner has been happily involved with fellow Voice coach Gwen Stefani, 47, since the fall of 2015 and is only growing closer with her and her family by the day.\n\nIn fact Gwen\u2019s little boys \u2014 Kingston, 10, Zuma, 8, and Apollo, 3\u2013 idolize Blake so much that they recently drew temporary versions of the singer\u2019s tattoo on their own arms so they could be more like him!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about Miranda\u2019s songs about Blake? Does she need to stop using their relationship as material?
