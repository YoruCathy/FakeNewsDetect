And it seems Kanye isn\u2019t making things any easier for the reality star. In fact, a new report from InTouch Weekly claims the couple has been fighting constantly in the weeks leading up to their daughter\u2019s arrival, and it\u2019s driving Kim nuts. Their main source of tension? The mag claims Kim wants to film their child\u2019s birth for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, while Kanye is totally against it. Click here to see adorable pics of the Kardashian kids.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at loggerheads about the birth being filmed for Keeping Up With The Kardashians,\u201d an insider for the publication told the mag. \u201cKanye\u2019s made it clear that cameras are banned from the delivery room.\u201d On top of that, Kanye reportedly doesn\u2019t even want Kris Jenner, 62, to be there either \u2014 apparently he wants to keep things super private and intimate! Kim, on the other hand, is not having any of it. \u201cKim\u2019s insisting that Kris be by her side, and is trying to convince Kanye that filming it will increase their popularity and the show\u2019s ratings,\u201d the source added.\n\nAs of yet though, the two apparently have not come to an agreement. Instead they\u2019ve \u201cbeen arguing nonstop,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt\u2019s driving Kim crazy.\u201d As a reminder, Kim and Kanye did NOT film the births of North West, 4, or Saint West, 2, for the show, so we can\u2019t imagine this new baby\u2019s grand entrance will be any different. Something that is different though, is the fact that the family had to use a surrogate this time around, as doctors advised Kim not to give birth for a third time. And while Kim\u2019s said in the past that she and her surrogate get along, InTouch\u2018s report also claims the tide has shifted, and now the surrogate doesn\u2019t even want Kim in the delivery room when she gives birth!\n\n\u201cThere will be major tension between them in the delivery room,\u201d a second source told the publication. \u201cThe surrogate doesn\u2019t even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice. Everyone is fearful a fight could break out between them!\u201d Yikes! Now THAT would be interesting to catch on tape for KUWTK!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Kim and Kanye\u2019s baby\u2019s birth will end up being filmed for TV?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kimye-arguing-over-filming-baby-birth-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/10543593o.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-netflix.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kimye-arguing-over-filming-baby-birth-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/disney-family-singalong-gaston.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2F07%2Fkanye-west-kim-kardashian-fighting-filming-birth-3rd-baby-tv%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2902721&comment_count=3", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/adeline.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kimye-arguing-over-filming-baby-birth-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Bonnie Azoulay", "Jason Pham", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Jon Blistein", "Zack Sharf", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/07/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-fighting-filming-birth-3rd-baby-tv/", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Reportedly Fighting Over Filming Birth Of Baby #3 For \u2018KUWTK\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "With a baby on the way, Kim Kardashian &amp; Kanye West have reportedly been fighting like crazy -- especially since Kim insists the birth be filmed for TV!", "news_keywords": "Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Reportedly Fighting Over Filming Birth Of Baby #3 For \u2018KUWTK\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/07/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-fighting-filming-birth-3rd-baby-tv/", "description": "With a baby on the way, Kim Kardashian & Kanye West have reportedly been fighting more than ever \u2014 especially because Kim insists the birth be filmed for TV!", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kimye-arguing-over-filming-baby-birth-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-07T22:12:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T22:17:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Reportedly Fighting Over Filming Birth Of Baby #3 For \u2018KUWTK\u2019"}, "image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kimye-arguing-over-filming-baby-birth-ftr.jpg?w=620", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Reportedly Fighting Over Filming Birth Of Baby #3 For \u2018KUWTK\u2019", "description": "With a baby on the way, Kim Kardashian & Kanye West have reportedly been fighting like crazy -- especially since Kim insists the birth be filmed for TV!"}, "author": "Kathleen Harper", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512576000.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
