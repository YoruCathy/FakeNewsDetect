USA! USA!\u201d from the audience, Trump\u2019s comments about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton also elicited boos from the crowd, which was highlighted by users on social media.\n\nFormer Chief Official White House Photographer Pete Souza made his own comparison between Obama and Trump via Instagram.\n\nCurrent Scout leaders and former Scouts, as well as parents, also used Twitter to voice their criticism of the nature of Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nIn a statement, the Boy Scouts of America said that it is \u201cwholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy. The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.\u201d\n\nGet our Politics Newsletter.
