She\u2019s always been the source of so much scandal and negativity in the royal family \u2013 and she is happy to see Meghan cop a bit of it now.\n\n\u2018Germaine\u2019s big interview was perfect timing, and Camilla couldn\u2019t be happier with all the drama and headlines it\u2019s caused so close to the royal wedding.\u2019\n\nThe 70-year-old duchess was recently sent home early from Australia by her husband Prince Charles, and this latest muckraking move is said to be Camilla\u2019s way of a counterblow.\n\n\u2018Camilla was also very miffed that she was sent home by Charles so swiftly, and so Germaine speaking out against Meghan gave her a good deal of comfort,\u2019 says the source.\n\n\u2018She felt humiliated when Charles sent her packing on their Australian tour and wanted to inflict her own dose of payback on the royals.\n\n\u2018Maybe Charles \u2013 and indeed anyone else \u2013 will think again before crossing her.\u2019\n\nThis is not the first time Camilla\u2019s cattiness has been exposed.\n\nLast year insiders told New Idea that Meghan and Harry were forced to postpone their engagement announcement due to Camilla\u2019s troublemaking.\n\nAccording to the insider, Camilla insisted at least 14 key palace staff were made to resign, which threw all the wedding preparations into disarray.\n\nThe scandal led Harry to tell Camilla to back off in a heated exchange between him and his stepmother.\n\n\u2018Harry is simply not going to put up with Camilla treating his bride or his relationship with anything other than respect,\u2019 says the palace insider.\n\n\u2018All Harry wants to do is get on with married life with Meghan, but all these obstacles keep on popping up and he feels Camilla is to blame.\u2019\n\n\u2018The place is in turmoil and the mood is getting steadily worse,\u2019 a source told The Sun.Palace sources told New Idea that all fingers of blame are being pointed at Camilla, who \u2018uses the staff 24/7\u2019 and doesn\u2019t care about throwing Wills, Kate and, of course, Harry and Meghan\u2019s plans to the side.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/26159/duchess-of-cornwall-pre.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/26159/duchess-of-cornwall-pre.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
