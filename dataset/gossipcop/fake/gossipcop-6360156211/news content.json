But now a tabloid has claimed that the Wests \u201cbarely made it this year\u201d and that Kim Kardashian said that herself. While the story could sound credible to some because of the drama that Kim and Kanye have been involved in this year, celebrity rumor watchdog, Gossip Cop, says that the story is untrue.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reports, OK! Magazine recently reported that Kim confessed that her and her husband\u2019s relationship almost didn\u2019t survive this year. They based their reporting on a tweet that Kim posted to celebrate Kanye\u2019s Birthday.\n\n\u201cKim Kardashian Wishes Kanye A Happy Birthday \u2014 Says They Barely Made It This Year,\u201d one headline for the article declared. Another headline read, \u201cMarital Problems? Kim Kardashian Wishes Kanye A Happy Birthday \u2014 Hints They Barely Made It Through The Year.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not what Kim tweeted at all. Here\u2019s what she said:\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday babe @kanyewest!!!!! It\u2019s been a wild year but we\u2019re here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams. You inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you.\u201d\n\nHappy Birthday babe @kanyewest !!!!! It\u2019s been a wild year but we\u2019re here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams. You inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you ???? pic.twitter.com/lflFE6ePdQ \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 8, 2018\n\nAs you can see, Kim never mentions that they barely made it this year. In fact, the message is pretty positive, which isn\u2019t surprising since it was sent on her husband\u2019s birthday. Kim does say that it\u2019s been \u201ca wild year,\u201d but it\u2019s a stretch to say that she really meant that their marriage was so fraught with turmoil that she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d make it through 2018.\n\nWhile the tabloids keep speculating that a Kim and Kanye divorce is on the horizon, the rapper and the reality TV star have been showing that they at least have an affection/admiration for each other.\n\nAs People Magazine reports, Kanye was part a tribute video for his wife to commemorate her Influencer Award from the CFDA.\n\n\u201cSay \u2018Hi!\u2019 We are making this video for the most influential person on the planet,\u201d the Ye rapper said as he held their son, Saint, in the short video.\n\nGossip Cop notes that the husband and wife duo went to Japan this year after they took a trip to the Bahamas with their family. Just last month, they were filmed kissing with a friend in the background calling them \u201cthe best married couple\u201d they knew.\n\nDespite these outward displays of a affection, there\u2019s a chance that Kim and Kanye could get divorced in the future. That\u2019s a possibility that faces all married couples. But, contrary to that OK! Magazine cover, Kim Kardashian never said that it could have happened to her marriage this year.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce-rumors-saint-north-chicago.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Grannum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4934020/kim-kardashian-never-said-she-and-kanye-west-barely-made-it-this-year-despite-report/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Never Said She And Kanye West \u2018Barely Made It\u2019 This Year, Despite \u2018OK!
