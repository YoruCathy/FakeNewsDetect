{"url": "nypost.com/2017/04/08/inside-the-rock-and-vin-diesels-furious-feud/", "text": "When the cast of \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d \u2014 the eighth film in the \u201cFast and the Furious\u201d franchise \u2014 hit CinemaCon to preview footage for theater owners in Las Vegas on March 29, it was like a star-studded family reunion.\n\nLongtime lead Vin Diesel gave a moving tribute to late actor Paul Walker and laughed it up with co-stars Charlize Theron, Kurt Russell and Tyrese Gibson.\n\nBut there was one member of the family missing: Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, who has appeared alongside Diesel in the last four \u201cFurious\u201d movies.\n\nSources told The Post that\u2019s because Johnson and Diesel can\u2019t stand to be in the same place at the same time anymore after simmering tensions came to a head on the set of \u201cThe Fate of the Furious.\u201d In fact, Johnson was at the same place just the day before, promoting buzzy blockbusters \u201cBaywatch\u201d and \u201cJumanji\u201d to the CinemaCon crowd. Twelve hours later, he was on the Miami set of his HBO show, \u201cBallers.\u201d\n\nBut a Hollywood insider told The Post that it wasn\u2019t TV work that kept Johnson, 44, from attending the \u201cFurious\u201d dog-and-pony show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been with this crew a lot,\u201d said the Hollywood insider. \u201cVin decides who shows up [for promotional events]; he always has.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the franchise is Diesel\u2019s baby. He\u2019s been a producer on the movies, which launched him as an action star and have collectively earned a whopping $3.9 billion globally, since 2001\u2019s \u201cThe Fast and the Furious.\u201d\n\nSo when Johnson lashed out at Diesel, 49, near the end of filming for \u201cFate,\u201d there were bound to be repercussions. On Aug. 8, 2016, Johnson posted a scathing \u2014 but blind \u2014 Facebook attack on one or more unnamed male co-stars.\n\nDwayne finally lost patience after [multiple] films when Vin showed up late for their final [shared] scene on \u2018Fate\u2019\n\n\u201cMy female co-stars are always amazing, and I love \u2019em. My male co-stars however are a different story,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome conduct themselves as stand up men and true professionals, while others don\u2019t. The ones that don\u2019t are too chicken s\u2013t to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, he wrote, \u201cwhen you watch this movie next April, and it seems like I\u2019m not acting in some of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling \u2014 you\u2019re right.\u201d\n\nAccording to TMZ, Johnson was boiling mad at Diesel repeatedly showing up to set late and refusing to start the day before 10 a.m. Insiders reveal that the turmoil has been a long time coming.\n\n\u201cDwayne finally lost patience after [multiple] films when Vin showed up late for their final [shared] scene on \u2018Fate,\u2019 \u201d said another movie-business insider.\n\nAfter Johnson\u2019s social-media scolding, the two A-listers allegedly had it out in his trailer. That night, when the director called \u201ccut\u201d on Diesel\u2019s last scene at around 1 a.m., the actor told the cast and crew, \u201cDaddy\u2019s gone,\u201d and high-tailed it out of there. (Johnson still had another week of shooting.)\n\nTwo days later, on Aug. 10, Diesel himself took to social media: He put up an Instagram video talking about coming home to his 2-year-old daughter Pauline \u2014 named for Walker \u2014 in which he added, ominously, at the end: \u201cGive me a second, and I will tell you everything. Everything.\u201d So far, he hasn\u2019t.\n\nBut Diesel did speak to USA Today this past week. \u201cI don\u2019t think the world really realizes how close we are, in a weird way,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI think some things may be blown out of proportion . . . I know he appreciates how much I work [on] this franchise. In my house, he\u2019s Uncle Dwayne.\u201d\n\nAnd while TMZ reported that Johnson wasn\u2019t the only one on set who was irritated with Diesel, don\u2019t expect any of the money-minting franchise\u2019s regulars, like Gibson and Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges, to say anything. After all, Fortune predicts the upcoming installment could earn $1 billion globally.\n\n\u201cLook, they all depend on Vin for a paycheck,\u201d said a source close to members of the cast. \u201cBut Dwayne [is so successful on his own that he] doesn\u2019t need Vin. He was the only one who could legitimately stand up and bust him.\u201d\n\nAccording to the same source, Johnson \u201cthinks Vin\u2019s disrespectful \u2014 and he is.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Diesel has reportedly caused problems on set. In 2014, while shooting \u201cFurious 7,\u201d he spent a whole day locked in his trailer, then demanded Universal execs show up so he could berate them \u2014 for 2 \u00b9/\u2082 hours, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The next day on set, work was done by stunt doubles.\n\nJohnson, meanwhile, is seen as the nice guy on set, and in Hollywood at large. Said one celebrity publicist close to the films, \u201cVin is always a douche\u201d on set, and \u201cDwayne is always a doll.\u201d\n\n(Representatives for Johnson and Diesel did not return requests for comment.)\n\nThe crew, apparently, sided with Johnson on the set of \u201cFate.\u201d TMZ reported that many people got sick of Diesel holding up shooting by showing up late and goading people \u2014 including Johnson \u2014 by criticizing their acting.\n\nBut a studio insider disagrees. \u201cThere was no junket for this movie because they just couldn\u2019t get everyone in one place. Dwayne and Vin were both at the trailer launch [last December].\u2019\u2019\n\nAs for Johnson, a source close to the film\u2019s crew called him \u201cthe ultimate professional.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the two do play frenemies-turned-furious enemies in \u201cFate,\u201d in which Vin\u2019s Dominic Toretto betrays his family. Could the feud have been concocted to notch up even more interest? After all, an insider told the Hollywood Reporter that Universal, the studio behind \u201cFurious,\u201d was \u201ckeeping [Johnson and Diesel] as separated as possible.\u201d\n\nAn executive close to the film told The Post that, \u201cIf this is some p.r. stunt, Universal did not create it.\u201d\n\nHowever, the source close to the cast added, \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a reason this film is taking a different route. There\u2019s no junket. That tells you a lot.\u201d\n\nBut a studio insider disagrees: \u201cThere was no junket for this movie because they just couldn\u2019t get everyone in one place. Dwayne and Vin were both at the trailer launch [last December].\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile Johnson did show up for the New York City premier Saturday evening, he did not join Diesel and Theron for the Berlin or Paris premiers earlier in the week.\n\nNevertheless, in a movie series that\u2019s all about alphas, there can only be one alpha dog on set.\n\nWhile Diesel has already signed on to star in \u201cFurious\u201d installments 9 and 10 \u2014 and even Gibson is already locked and loaded for No. 9 \u2014 no announcements have been made about Johnson\u2019s fate in the franchise.\n\n\u201cI protect the franchise. I protect everybody including Dwayne,\u201d Diesel told USA Today. \u201cI protected Dwayne more than he\u2019ll ever know.\n\n\u201cIf [Johnson] does return,\u201d says a knowledgeable casting director, \u201cI doubt things will change on set. It\u2019s Vin\u2019s show. He can be late when everyone else has to be on time.\u201d\n\nBut since it is Diesel\u2019s show, \u201cDaddy\u201d probably won\u2019t want to jeopardize his bank account. Johnson may not need the \u201cFurious\u201d movies to pump up his career at this point, but, said the casting director source, \u201cthe franchise would make less money without him.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/spanx-sale.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mcdfafi_ec003.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mcdfafi_ec003.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/mcdfafi_ec003.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/04/08/inside-the-rock-and-vin-diesels-furious-feud/", "title": "Inside The Rock and Vin Diesel\u2019s \u2018Furious\u2019 feud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
