But the scrutiny amped up considerably as other pregnancy-related stories hit the tabloids.\n\nAD\n\nNone of the famous sisters has actually confirmed, on the record, that they are expecting. Still, the stories are breaking and it can be hard to get a handle on them all. Here\u2019s a rundown:\n\nAD\n\nKim Kardashian surrogacy rumors (summer 2017)\n\nThis was the first peg in the pregnancy saga. TMZ ran a story in June that Kim and husband Kanye West had hired a surrogate to carry their third child, including some juicy details as to how much they were paying.\n\nThen in July, Us Weekly ran a story that the surrogate was three months pregnant and expecting in November.\n\nBut, in an August Hollywood Reporter cover story, the outlet wrote that \u201con the possibility of a third child, reportedly via a surrogate,\u201d Kim said: \u201cI hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We\u2019re definitely trying. We are hoping so.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, Kim tweeted the trailer for the upcoming season of her family\u2019s reality show \u2014 in which she confirms that she\u2019s having another baby. \u201cWhat happens every time I say, \u2018Guess what?\u2019 \u201d Kim says to Khlo\u00e9 over FaceTime. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant \u2014 or the person\u2019s pregnant,\u201d her sister responds.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby!\u201d Kim says.\n\nSeason 14 is gonna be wild. Tune in this Sunday!!! #KUWTK pic.twitter.com/rnpIdGiNyK \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 28, 2017\n\nThat Kim may have hired a surrogate at all wasn\u2019t surprising to begin with; she\u2019s been public about her prior difficult pregnancies with North and Saint, and the life-threatening conditions she endured while carrying them.\n\nKylie Jenner, allegedly pregnant (starting Sept. 22)\n\nTMZ dropped the bombshell Friday: The youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner brood is pregnant, and the father is Travis Scott. The two have been romantically linked since April.\n\nAD\n\nBut Kylie herself has not confirmed the reports. Neither have her family members \u2014 sort of.\n\nHollywood Life cited an individual close to Caitlyn Jenner as saying she was \u201cshocked and disappointed\u201d to hear her 20-year-old daughter was pregnant. Then, in a non-denial denial, the British tabloid the Sun wrote: \u201cSpeaking about claims Caitlyn wasn\u2019t personally told her youngest daughter is pregnant, the Olympian\u2019s rep confirmed she was told and said: \u2018All I can tell you is that it was some time ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhat about Kris Jenner? During \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan,\u201d Ryan Seacrest read a text from the momager herself. \u201cKris says Kylie\u2019s not confirming anything,\u201d Seacrest said on air. \u201cThat\u2019s the news from the family this morning. Kylie is not confirming anything.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKris also talked to the Cut at the Bottega Veneta fashion show, and the matriarch offered frustratingly few details:\n\nDid you know the news was going to break about Kylie? I just woke up this morning. She\u2019s not confirmed anything. I think it\u2019s kind of wild that everyone is just assuming that that\u2019s just happening. So, you didn\u2019t know that rumor was going to happen? Something happens every single day. You never know what is going to break at any moment.\n\nEven Kylie herself posted throwback, flat-tummy photos on social media \u2014 along with a more recent one offering an inconclusive peek at her stomach.\n\nThen came the gossip about how the rest of the family was taking it.\n\n\u201cKim Kardashian\u2019s first reaction to Kylie\u2019s pregnancy news was reportedly not great,\u201d read a Harpers Bazaar headline. Kim tweeted it adding:\n\nThis sounds like a very fake story... https://t.co/ZIxCltgK6d \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 26, 2017\n\nPeople cited an individual saying it was the family\u2019s \u201cnightmare\u201d that Kylie would get pregnant with her ex-boyfriend Tyga. (And in case you need a catch-up: Tyga, who dated Kylie Jenner for years, shares a child with Blac Chyna, who then went on to have a daughter with Rob Kardashian. The Blac Chyna-Rob Kardashian romance was short-lived, filmed on a sad reality TV show; it led to a public meltdown and a restraining order.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKhloe Kardashian, also apparently expecting! (Sept. 26)\n\nOn Tuesday, TMZ, E! and BuzzFeed all cited anonymous individuals in reporting that the 33-year-old younger sister of Kourtney and Kim is pregnant, and her boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson, is the father.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Khloe is three months along. Let the clue hunting begin.\n\nKhloe said she was drinking champagne during the family\u2019s 10th anniversary special, which was pretaped. She also talked about Thompson: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a serious relationship.\u201d\n\nShe also said she\u2019s always in Cleveland whenever he is. Days before the anonymously cited reports about her pregnancy broke, she posted this bare-belly photo, prompting a lot of curious fans to wonder if she was actually three months along. (Yes, we\u2019ve approached Zapruder film-level analysis here.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe June season finale of KUWTK included a story line in which Khloe explored whether to serve as a surrogate for Kim. A fertility specialist delivered not-great news to Khloe, and suggested she stop taking birth control pills.\n\nKhloe did just that, and when she received an update that her chances of conceiving had improved, she called Thompson.\n\n\u201cI am so relieved to know that I am able to get pregnant,\u201d Khloe said on air. \u201cNow I have so many other things to think about. Do I wanna have my own baby now? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m at a crossroads.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cTristan and I definitely talk about starting a family. He wants to have about five or six kids with me and that\u2019s lovely. We could start at one and we could grow from there. But now knowing I\u2019m not on birth control is scary. It\u2019s like a really big step.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conspiracy theories (from the beginning until forever)\n\nThe convergence of these three story lines has led to this:\n\n\u201cAll the Evidence That Khloe Kardashian Is Kim\u2019s Surrogate,\u201d reads a Marie Claire headline.\n\n\u201cIs Pregnant Kylie Jenner Secretly Kim Kardashian\u2019s Surrogate? An Investigation,\u201d proclaims the Daily Beast.\n\nWhat if the twist in the alleged Kylie Jenner pregnancy is that she's Kim and Kanye's surrogate for baby no. 3? pic.twitter.com/RI8CG18Qvz \u2014 David Onda (@David_Onda) September 22, 2017\n\nRegardless of whether there\u2019s any truth to these avalanche of rumors, one thing\u2019s certain: People will keep watching the family on TV, keep scouring social media for clues and will keep keeping up.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xm6vEblUTbTKfG5NVcQPNy5MlPw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUIVT4GB5YZUXMXQE4VYS647IE.JPG", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/5bd13033-50c2-4ef3-a231-2f9d3ef43dcc.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUIVT4GB5YZUXMXQE4VYS647IE.JPG&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xm6vEblUTbTKfG5NVcQPNy5MlPw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QUIVT4GB5YZUXMXQE4VYS647IE.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/09/27/keeping-up-with-the-kardashian-pregnancy-rumors-a-timeline/", "title": "Keeping up with the Kardashian pregnancy rumors: A timeline", "meta_data": {"description": "Who is Kim Kardashian's surrogate?
