The singer\u2019s high-end SoCal shopping spree turned \u201cembarrassing\u201d when her credit cards were declined, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.\n\n\u201cShe was shopping on Rodeo Drive and her credit cards were declined,\u201d an eyewitness told Radar. \u201cWhen it happened at Louis Vuitton she thought it was a fluke. But when it happened three more times she was embarrassed and humiliated.\u201d\n\nCarey, 47, played it off like it was a mistake, as she left and came back to purchase the high-end items.\n\n\u201cShe returned with an assistant and her manager Stella [Bulochnikov], who made a total scene,\u201d the eyewitness said.\n\nBulochnikov is the lucky standup comedian-turned-music manager who was on the receiving end of Carey\u2019s once-hefty bank account when the singer shelled out a whopping $34,000 on a Louis Vuitton trunk for her 44th birthday.\n\nYet, despite her cards not going through this time around, Carey didn\u2019t walk away empty-handed.\n\n\u201cThey ended up paying cash,\u201d said the source. \u201cBut Mariah is blaming her manager for the cancelations, postponement and low ticket sales of her tour with Lionel Richie. She\u2019s also had bad press and business deals. Stella keeps saying everything is going to be all right, but it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only bad luck in the bucks department the Grammy winner has faced recently.\n\nThe superstar has spent millions she may not have on her new boy toy Bryan Tanaka only after she called off her South American shows because of late payments. She is currently suing the concert promoter.\n\nThe music legend also only raked in $6.3 million in 2014 and demanded $50 million from her former businessman beau Packer after their engagement imploded.\n\nShe also had a disastrous live performance on New Year\u2019s Eve, and her The House co-star recently called her out for being \u201cunprofessional and borderline abusive\u201d on set.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
