Ellen DeGeneres Treats Her Talk Show Staff Like \u2018Peasants!\u2019 TV talker's a 'terror' & nothing like her public image, say insiders.\n\nForget that wide smile and friendly demeanor. RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 reputation as the \u201cQueen of Nice\u201d is total sham!\n\n\u201cEllen\u2019s public image is that of a sweetie who\u2019s nice to everyone and is a real pussycat,\u201d a source spilled. \u201cBut when the cameras aren\u2019t rolling, she treats staffers as if they are her peasants!\u201d\n\nThe talk show host, 59, allows only a few people to even speak to her, and staffers are expected to turn their backs when she walks by, dished an on-set spy.\n\n\u201cNo one is allowed to engage Ellen in conversation or even look her in the eye!\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even brief the staff about the show anymore!\u201d\n\nInsiders claim DeGeneres\u2019 ego is so out of control that when one of her producers was recently asked if she\u2019d support a charity, he said, \u201cEllen doesn\u2019t work with charities. She IS a big charity!\u201d\n\nThe Finding Dory star \u2014 whose estimated net worth is a staggering $360 million \u2014 is also very manipulative, according to on-set insiders.\n\n\u201cShe picks and chooses people to be nice to when it\u2019s to her advantage,\u201d the insider spilled. \u201cShe\u2019ll invite some staffers to fun outings and purposely exclude others to create tension, jealousy and hurt feelings.\u201d\n\nTrouble in the talkers\u2019 marriage to Aussie beauty Portia de Rossi, 44, can also trigger an eruption, sources said.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s going through a rough spot with Portia, people really have to duck and cover,\u201d an insider snitched.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, DeGeneres is an absolute perfectionist who explodes over the tiniest things, according to another source.\n\n\u201cOne time, a loose thread was hanging off her slacks. Ellen noticed it when she was about to go on air and started screaming about how no one had told her,\u201d said the source. \u201cThen, instead of just tearing off the thread, Ellen demanded a whole new pair of slacks!\n\n\u201cStaffers never know what she\u2019ll go off on, or who she\u2019ll target. It\u2019s like walking on eggshells.\u201d\n\nDoes the truth about Ellen surprise you? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
