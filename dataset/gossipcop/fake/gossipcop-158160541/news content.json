The trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. \u201cIt was Keith\u2019s idea to visit the boot camp,\u201d says the insider. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. \u201cHe gave her an ultimatum.\u201d\n\nBut in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. \u201cThey addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,\u201d the insider explains.\n\nFor more on Nicole and Keith, pick up the latest issue of In Touch magazine, on newsstands now!", "images":
