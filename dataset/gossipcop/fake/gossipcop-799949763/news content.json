New reports claim the comedienne is trying to convert her cast mates on the revived ABC sitcom. A rep, however, exclusively tells Gossip Cop the stories are \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images)\n\nThe virtually identical articles come from the National Enquirer and RadarOnline, which claim Roseanne \u201ccredits the Kabbalah cult for her TV comeback,\u201d and is now \u201cforcing the occult organization on her co-stars.\u201d The sister outlets both quote a so-called \u201con-set source,\u201d who alleges the TV icon \u201cinsists\u201d Kabbalah \u201cgot her show on its feet.\u201d Contends the supposed snitch, \u201cHer religious rants are a little off-putting, [and] she\u2019s not afraid to let the cast and crew know just how she feels.\u201d\n\nThe publications go on to assert Roseanne has \u201cgone so overboard about touting her beliefs at work that it\u2019s made her co-stars uncomfortable.\u201d Alleges the purported tipster, \u201cIt\u2019s not the idea of Kabbalah itself that\u2019s putting everyone on edge. It\u2019s Roseanne\u2019s pushiness about it.\u201d This questionable insider adds, \u201cPeople are sick of it. Everybody\u2019s waiting for things to blow up.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot of key information suspiciously missing from these stories. How is Roseanne \u201cpushing\u201d and \u201cforcing\u201d Kabbalah on her colleagues? What does she say in these \u201creligious rants\u201d? Which \u201cco-stars\u201d are \u201cuncomfortable\u201d and \u201con edge\u201d? Just when has Roseanne been going \u201coverboard,\u201d and when might things \u201cblow up\u201d?\n\n\u00a9 The Associated Press In this image released by ABC, Roseanne Barr, left, and Laurie Metcalf appear in a scene from the reboot of the popular comedy series \"Roseanne.\" 18.4 million viewers tuned in for its premiere. (Adam Rose/ABC via AP)\n\nThe new season of \u201cRoseanne\u201d wrapped production back in December, and while another cycle of the reboot has been ordered, filming has not yet resumed. In fact, when The Hollywood Reporter reported the \u201cRoseanne\u201d renewal last month, the trade outlet specifically noted, \u201cThere was no immediate word whether the network plans to have it ready for fall.\u201d Additionally, the president ABC Entertainment said in a statement that executives \u201ccan\u2019t wait to see what the \u2018Roseanne\u2019 team has in store for next year.\u201d\n\nIn other words, production isn\u2019t taking place right now, so the timing of these claims from a supposed \u201con-set source\u201d makes little sense. It seems as if the tabloid and the website just wanted to capitalize on the ongoing attention \u201cRoseanne\u201d is receiving as it currently airs, and decided to concoct an unsupported narrative based on its controversial lead actress\u2019s religious faith. Roseanne has spoken highly of Kabbalah in the past, and isn\u2019t shy about referencing Judaism on Twitter. But that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s preaching on the set of her TV series to the chagrin of her co-workers.\n\nA rep for Roseanne tells Gossip Cop on the record that these new reports are \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d It also wasn\u2019t true last week when these same sister publications cited an unnamed \u201csource\u201d and untraceable \u201cTV exec\u201d to falsely allege Roseanne was demanding a raise to $1 million per episode. That unsubstantiated claim was also problematic and, similar to now, oddly timed. Again, it appears the magazine and the blog are offering fiction just to exploit a fictional TV show.\n\nSlideshow: Gossip Cop busts more of the latest tabloid stories", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwm9kN.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAw7hkr.img?h=191&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=675&y=313", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAvzko3.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1585&y=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwm9fE.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=5844d9e1b77248259ee235d7255a8b03&rnd=636603840452773557&rf=&tp=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Froseanne-not-pushing-kabbalah-on-co-stars-despite-reports%252Far-AAwmjrs&di=1275&lng=en-us&cv.product=prime&pn=article&activityId=5844d9e1b77248259ee235d7255a8b03&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=tv-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=tv&pg.n=articlevnext", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo11.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyqDE.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&rn=636603840452773557&c7=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Froseanne-not-pushing-kabbalah-on-co-stars-despite-reports%252Far-AAwmjrs&c8=&c9=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwlXc2.img?h=208&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=288&y=91", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAsAtMa.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=1275&pi=&ps=&su=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Froseanne-not-pushing-kabbalah-on-co-stars-despite-reports%252Far-AAwmjrs&pageid=articlevnext&mkt=en-us&pn=article&pp=False&cv.product=prime&cv.partner=Gossip%2BCop&cv.publcat=Gossip%2BCop%2BMedia&st.dpt=tv-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636603840452773557&rf=&rid=5844d9e1b77248259ee235d7255a8b03&cvs=Browser&subcvs=tv&cv.entityId=AAwmjrs&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AAdsRm7&ar=0&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=5844d9e1b77248259ee235d7255a8b03&pm=&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwow8r.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=408&y=154", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBbyo1E.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwo7TS.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=407&y=143", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmaQeF.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwnyAc.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=261&y=192"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAwlXc2.img?h=208&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=288&y=91", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180427000045/https://www.gossipcop.com/roseanne-kabbalah-co-stars-jewish/", "title": "Roseanne Not Pushing Kabbalah On Co-Stars, Despite Reports", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Roseanne Not Pushing Kabbalah On Co-Stars, Despite Reports", "cq": "passed", "description": "Is Roseanne \u201cpushing\u201d Kabbalah on her co-stars?
