In fact, she felt so \u2018inspired\u2019 by JB\u2019s whirlwind romance that she\u2019s got weddings on the brain! Does she finally want to take the next step with Younes?\n\nWill we finally see Kourtney Kardashian, 38, walk down the aisle? \u2014 While that\u2019s been the burning Kardashian question for years, the eldest K sister has recently been thinking of marriage. And, it\u2019s all because of her own ex, Justin Bieber, 24. \u201cSeeing how happy Justin is with Hailey (Baldwin) is very inspiring to Kourtney,\u201d a source close to the famous family tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Bieber proposed to his model girlfriend, 21, on July 7. \u201cHis relationship with Hailey and how peaceful and stable it is reminds Kourtney a lot of her and Younes (Bendjima). Now that Justin is marrying Hailey it\u2019s got Kourtney dreaming of marrying Younes.\u201d\n\nHowever, the mother of three is in no rush to the alter. \u201cIt\u2019s still just an idea for her,\u201d the insider says, adding, \u201cKourtney\u2019s not ready to take that step with him.\u201d The source notes that Kourt is being very cautious, as she wants to \u201ctake her time and so does Younes.\u201d But, it can\u2019t hurt to daydream a bit, right?\n\nKourtney and Younes, 25, have been dating since late 2016, when she met him in Paris on the night of Kim Kardashian\u2019s robbery. She detailed their meeting on an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians last season (14), where she gushed over how protective and supportive was when they got the call about Kim, despite just meeting that night. The pair just returned to LA from their Italian vacation, where Kourt\u2019s kids, Mason, Penelope, and Reign, joined them.\n\nMeanwhile, Kourt\u2019s ex, Justin Bieber, is happier than ever these days after his engagement to Hailey Baldwin. JB surprised the model, as well as onlookers at Baker\u2019s Bay Resort when he popped the question with a massive, oval-shaped diamond. And, what makes the bombshell proposal even better, is the fact that Bieber, himself custom designed his future wife\u2019s $500,000 ring!\n\n\u201cJustin was thrilled with the execution of the ring we made for his girlfriend at the time, and was excited to give it to her,\u201d Solow & Co., Inc. told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe helped us design the ring himself, and he wanted it to perfectly compliment the shape of her hand, which we were able to achieve. The diamond has a beautiful shape and accentuates her hand wonderfully.\u201d\n\nJB and Hailey, who\u2019ve been friends since they were young teens, dated in 2015 and 2016. It wasn\u2019t until June 2018, that they decided to rekindle their romance. This is definitely the year of LOVE!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/kourt_younes-dreamin-ftr.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/kourt_younes-dreamin-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F13%2Fkourtney-kardashian-justin-bieber-engagement-inspired-marriage-younes-bendjima%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3239718", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/kourt_younes-dreamin-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/13/kourtney-kardashian-justin-bieber-engagement-inspired-marriage-younes-bendjima/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian \u2018Dreaming\u2019 Of Marrying BF Younes Bendjima Now That Her Ex Bieber Is Engaged", "meta_data": {"description": "Kourtney Kardashian felt so 'inspired' by JB's whirlwind romance that she's got weddings on the brain!
