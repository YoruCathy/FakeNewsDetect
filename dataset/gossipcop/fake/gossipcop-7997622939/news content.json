ABC will have encore coverage of the match beginning at 3 p.m. Online streaming of the singles final will be available via WatchESPN and via the ESPN App on smartphones and other devices.\n\nFor Williams, playing in the Wimbledon final is nothing new. She has won the title five times, last doing so in 2008. That was also the last time she won a Grand Slam, though she came close earlier this year when she played in the Australian Open finals.\n\nMuguruza has also won a Grand Slam title, but just one \u2014 taking home the win on the clay of Roland Garros, the French Open. Clay is her better surface, and she beat Williams on said surface in Rome earlier this year. That win was Muguruza\u2019s only victory over Williams, however.\n\nPrior to that, Williams had beaten Muguruza three consecutive times, all on the hard court surface. They have never played each other in a Grand Slam. Muguruza\u2019s win earlier in 2017 was a three-set win, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. Williams\u2019 2015 win over Muguruza was cut short when Muguruza had to retire in the second set.\n\nMuguruza took down top seed Angelique Kerber in the fourth round, seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals and the unseeded Magdalena Rybarikova in the semifinals. Williams bested 27th seed Ana Konjuh in the fourth round, 13th seed and French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko in the quarterfinals and sixth seed Johanna Konta in the semifinals.\n\nThe men\u2019s doubles final will be on Centre Court after Muguruza or Williams earns the title. That match sees the fourth-seeded pairing of Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo against the 16th-seeded Oliver Marach and Mate Pavic.\n\nThe women\u2019s doubles final is after that, featuring the second-seeded pairing of Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina taking on the ninth-seeded Hao-Ching Chan and Monica Niculescu.\n\nBelow is all you need to know to watch Saturday\u2019s action from The Championships, on television and online.\n\nHow to watch Wimbledon\n\nDate: Saturday, July 15\n\nLocation: The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, London, England\n\nTime: 9 a.m. ET\n\nTV: ESPN\n\nOnline Streaming: WatchESPN, ESPN app\n\nWomen\u2019s Final\n\nNo. 10 Venus Williams vs. No. 14 Garbine Muguruza", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCFIksviHOdPCmIWPrmYJwho5es=/0x0:4884x3277/1200x800/filters:focal(2039x675:2819x1455)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55722019/813885504.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Alv-s_pttEhLnwLCbPUHcGYA5dE=/0x0:4884x2747/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55722017/813885504.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Alv-s_pttEhLnwLCbPUHcGYA5dE=/0x0:4884x2747/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55722017/813885504.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Brady", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sbnation.com/tennis/2017/7/15/15975050/venus-williams-garbine-muguruza-2017-time-tv-schedule-watch-online-wimbledon-womens-final", "title": "Venus Williams vs. Garbine Muguruza, Wimbledon 2017: Time, TV schedule and live stream for women's final", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "SB Nation", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/SB-Nation/39606211535", "published_time": "2017-07-15T07:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-15T07:00:02-04:00"}, "author": "James Brady", "style-tools": "https://www.sbnation.com/style/community/247/c082338a7b3e875470a3be83b8a18e6e/tools.css", "twitter": {"user_id": 16745015, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/tennis/2017/7/15/15975050/venus-williams-garbine-muguruza-2017-time-tv-schedule-watch-online-wimbledon-womens-final", "title": "Venus Williams vs. Garbine Muguruza, Wimbledon 2017: Time, TV schedule and live stream for women's final", "description": "Williams and Muguruza have both been here before, but never against each other.
