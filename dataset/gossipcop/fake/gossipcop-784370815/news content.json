We were devastated when Jen Garner and Ben Affleck split in June 2015, but after months of hints that they may be working on their relationship, a new report claims that they\u2019ve renewed their vows! We have all the details, right here.\n\nThis is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy just in time for the holidays! Ben Affleck, 44, and Jen Garner, 44, have had a rough year. From a shocking split to cheating rumors and accusations of hard-partying, these two seem to have taken hit after hit in their relationship. However, it may all be over now because they\u2019ve re-made the ultimate commitment to stand by each others\u2019 side through thick and thin, according to a new report.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Star Magazine reports that Jen and Ben have recently renewed their vows as rumors swirled of a fourth child being in the works. \u201cThey wanted something quiet and intimate, with just the children present,\u201d the source told the mag. \u201cJen wore a sweet, simple dress and Ben put on a pair of slacks and a nice shirt.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like the whole event was cathartic, romantic and wonderfully personal to both of them. \u201cAfterward, she laughed and thanked him for making an honest woman out of her,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cHe also surprised Jen with a fabulous $2.3 million diamond ring. It\u2019s all perfect timing, especially now that their pals think she\u2019s expecting again.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re so happy for them! The couple already has three children together: Violet, 10, Seraphina, 7, and Samuel, 4, but fans noticed that Jen seemed to be sporting a baby bump on Nov. 18, and the rumors grew from there. If the family is growing their family, we couldn\u2019t be happier for them. We just hope Ben stays on the straight and narrow so they can all continue to be happy! Congrats, guys!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Ben and Jen renewing their vows is a good idea?
