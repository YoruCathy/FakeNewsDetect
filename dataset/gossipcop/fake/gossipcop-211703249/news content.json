Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.\n\nAs previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The \u201cMisery\u201d singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen \u2014 who I didn\u2019t really know \u2014 and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, \u2018Wow, she feels super bad for me!\u2019\u201d Shelton recalled. \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me much, because we didn\u2019t know each other at the time, but she said, \u2018I\u2019m going through something very similar to what you\u2019re going through. I understand. And I hate it.\u2019\u201d\n\nStefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children\u2019s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.\n\nThe \u201cCame Here to Forget\u201d singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email \u2014 \u2018This s\u2013t happened to me, what happened to you?\u2019 \u2014 to maybe three times a week, then every day, to \u2018Hey, here\u2019s my phone number if you ever want to text,\u2019\u201d Shelton told Billboard. \u201cNext thing I know, I wake up and she\u2019s all I care about, and I\u2019m \u00adwondering if she feels the same about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGwen saved my life,\u201d he added. \u201cWho else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can\u2019t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.\u201d\n\nThe two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, \u201cGo Ahead and Break My Heart,\u201d on his 12th studio album, If I\u2019m Honest.\n\n\u201cWhen we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,\u201d Shelton said of his split from Lambert. \u201cWhen you have a broken heart \u2014 at least, when I do \u2014 you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-zoom-04a1870d-a90c-493f-b4e5-101ef05686d4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1501px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-billboard-cover-zoom-570e1467-1409-4e9e-95c9-0e345665a6d5.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-zoom-6dad6f7f-e911-41e2-a055-d9f1b3e9223d.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-zoom-04a1870d-a90c-493f-b4e5-101ef05686d4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1501px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-saved-my-life-after-divorce-w431463/", "title": "Blake Shelton: Gwen Stefani \u2018Saved My Life\u2019 After Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for saving his life following his split from Miranda Lambert \u2014 get the details!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Blake Fell for Gwen: 'I Wake Up and She's All I Care About'", "description": "Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for saving his life following his split from Miranda Lambert \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-saved-my-life-after-divorce-w431463/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-09T00:03:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-zoom-04a1870d-a90c-493f-b4e5-101ef05686d4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1501px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-zoom-04a1870d-a90c-493f-b4e5-101ef05686d4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1501px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2016-07-28T16:10:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-09T00:03:12+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for saving his life following his split from Miranda Lambert \u2014 get the details!", "title": "How Blake Fell for Gwen: 'I Wake Up and She's All I Care About'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-zoom-04a1870d-a90c-493f-b4e5-101ef05686d4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1501px%2C788px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1469722200.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
