There have been a lot of conflicting reports about the state of the couple\u2019s tortured relationship in the last week, but I trust the Kardashians\u2019 official news network, E!, to have the most honest version of events.\n\nE! reported yesterday that Richie ended things with Disick after he was spotted getting handsy with a \u201cmystery blonde\u201d at Kanye West\u2019s album release party in Wyoming. (It\u2019s interesting that Richie, who has been dating Disick for over a year \u2014 my God \u2014 wasn\u2019t invited to the release party in the first place. I think that shows the Kardashians still have a long way to go in terms of accepting the relationship.) The breakup, however, lasted just 48 hours, as Disick quickly won Richie back with promises to \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nAccording to E!, Richie has been living at Disick\u2019s house in L.A., but she stayed at her father Lionel Richie\u2019s house during the short separation. \u201cLionel and her family encouraged the split and are very upset and disappointed that she decided to get back with him,\u201d a source told the site.\n\nUs Weekly reported last week that Lionel threatened to cut Sofia out of his will if she continued her relationship with Disick. But Sofia seems committed: She referred to Disick as her \u201cwhole [heart emoji]\u201d on Instagram yesterday. Please pray that all relevant parties see reason soon.\n\nKendall Jenner, who once comically referred to Richie as one of Disick\u2019s children, kissed someone in public. That someone is Anwar Hadid, the 18-year-old model brother of Jenner\u2019s friends Gigi and Bella Hadid. TMZ got a photo of the pair making out at an after-party for the CFDAs Monday night. According to the gossip site, \u201cKendall was hangin\u2019 with Anwar at Socialista New York for about 2 hours \u2014 kissing, cuddling and drinking with the youngest Hadid sibling the whole time.\u201d\n\nWill Gigi and Bella be upset? Who cares! Jenner never does anything fun, and this sounds fun. She also never shows PDA with anyone she reportedly dates. (Blake Griffin, Ben Simmons, A$AP Rocky \u2026) Maybe Anwar is the one.\n\nGigi Hadid, meanwhile, looks to be back together with her ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik. And Bella has been spotted hanging out several times with her ex-boyfriend the Weeknd. Everyone is happy.\n\nIn other new celeb relationship news, Jennifer Lawrence reportedly has a new boyfriend. According to \u201cPage Six,\u201d his name is Cooke Maroney, and he is a director at New York\u2019s Gladstone Gallery. A source told the gossip site, \u201cThey met through Jen\u2019s friend Laura \u2026 The relationship has been going on a few weeks. But they have been very private and careful not to be seen together.\u201d This is exactly the thing a \u201csource\u201d would say before a new couple is about to be seen together. Keep your eyes on the Daily Mail!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n\u201cPage Six\u201d says that Maroney is 33, which is great. It\u2019s a nice age for a boyfriend to be, when you\u2019re 27, which Lawrence is. A terrible age for a boyfriend to be is: 49.\n\nOne Small Blessing\n\n\u201cAudrina Patridge is the happiest she\u2019s ever been since reuniting with Ryan Cabrera.\u201d\n\nBlind Item of the Week\n\nAnd here\u2019s an interesting blind item from this week, care of Enty at the best site for blind items, Crazy Days and Nights:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he acts enough any longer to be permanently A or A- list, but this former A+ list mostly movie actor cheated on his wife the night before they got married. He called it a cleanse. Uh huh.\u201d\n\nWho could it be? Richard Gere recently got married. So did Hugh Grant. Put your guess in the comments or speak it to the wind!\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll leave you with this photo of Emma Stone and Justin Theroux \u201changing out\u201d in a bungalow at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc in the south of France last week. Both stars, who have been rumored to be dating since they left Rihanna\u2019s Met Gala after-party together, were in town for the Louis Vuitton cruise show. Stone told reporters Theroux was like her \u201cbrother\u201d at the show. Does this look like a brother-sister relationship to you? Let me know!\n\nPhoto: SAUD/One Shot / BACKGRID\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week.
