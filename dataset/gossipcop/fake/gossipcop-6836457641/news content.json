What started as a weekly newsletter blossomed into a web site, magazine, and pop up store. It was recently valued at $250 million dollars. But Alves ambitions could eat into Paltrow\u2019s profits.\n\n\u201cCamila is working herself into the ground revamping everything and has sunk a ton of her and Matthew\u2019s cash into this project. Gwyneth has seen a few pretenders, but this is by far the most competitive,\u201d the source confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s threatened.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
