Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt after over a decade together and two years of marriage, Us Weekly confirmed on Tuesday, September 20. While some social media users are mourning the end of one of Hollywood\u2019s most celebrated love stories, many can\u2019t forget the complicated origin of Brangelina\u2019s epic love affair.\n\nAs fans are well aware, the Fight Club actor, 52, and the Oscar-winning actress, 41, met on the 2004 set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. At the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. After the Friends alum, 47, reportedly discovered that her then-husband was cheating on her with his sexy costar, she called it quits on their five-year marriage. Months later, Pitt and Jolie went public with their controversial romance.\n\nDuring a now-legendary 2008 interview with Vogue, Aniston \u2014 who married Justin Theroux in August 2015 \u2014 broke her silence about the scandal. \u201cThat stuff about how she couldn\u2019t wait to get to work every day?\u201d she said, referring to former comments made by Jolie to W magazine. \u201cThat was really uncool.\u201d\n\nNow that the Pitt-Jolie saga is coming to a close, Twitter can\u2019t help but revel in Aniston\u2019s revenge. From creative memes to hilarious comments, Us has rounded up the best online reactions.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/faith_x1/status/778259962640334848\n\nThe only good thing about this #Brangelina trending are all the #JenniferAniston gifs pic.twitter.com/GIaJIPzkSR \u2014 Renee H (@mtgreiunicorn) September 20, 2016\n\nThe internet is freaking out over the demise of #Brangelina and Jennifer Aniston is over here like pic.twitter.com/AQMkHatoWg \u2014 Alexis Shaw (@alexisshaw92) September 20, 2016\n\n\u201cThe same way you get him is the same way you lose him\u201d has never been so true #Brangelina pic.twitter.com/yqpAWxa4dF \u2014 Ida.

TMZ reported that she requested that Pitt only get joint legal custody. She is not asking for spousal support.\n\nJolie\u2019s rep issued a statement to Us on Tuesday regarding her decision to permanently part ways with the eternal heartthrob. \u201cAngelina Jolie Pitt has filed for dissolution of the marriage,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis decision was made for the health of the family.
