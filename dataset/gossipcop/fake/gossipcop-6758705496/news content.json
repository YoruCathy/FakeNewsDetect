Despite reports, a source tells Us Weekly that Angelina Jolie is not off the market.\n\n\u201cAngie isn\u2019t dating a real estate agent. She isn\u2019t even dating at the moment,\u201d the insider reveals. \u201cYes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it\u2019s extremely low-key.\u201d\n\nThe Salt actress, 42, and estranged husband Brad Pitt officially called it quits in September 2016 after more than 10 years together and two years of marriage. They are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.\n\n\u201cThe divorce talks between Brad and Angie are ongoing,\u201d the source adds, noting that Pitt, 54, is lonesome for their children, who live with their mom. \u201cBrad wishes the kids would spend overnights at his house, but he is hopeful that over time, that will organically happen.\u201d\n\nThe Tomb Raider star and Pitt much of their marriage on the move, raising their family in various cities. But since their split, Jolie and the kids have remained in L.A. \u201cAngie is frustrated that Los Angeles has become the home base for the family,\u201d the source says. \u201cYes, she does travel, but she misses the nomadic lifestyle of moving around every three or four months. It\u2019s best for the kids that they aren\u2019t moving around all the time. Angie has a restless spirit and would have continued to roam around the world with the kids if the divorce hadn\u2019t occurred. Brad insisted that the kids have stability and wanted them to stop moving around.\u201d\n\nJolie opened up about raising her kids as a single mother in a September 2017 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult. I don\u2019t enjoy being single,\u201d the First They Killed My Father director admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I wanted. There\u2019s nothing nice about it. It\u2019s just hard.\u201d\n\nAlthough Jolie puts on a brave face for the cameras, she quietly battles her emotions. \u201cSometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it together, but really, I am just trying to get through my days,\u201d she disclosed. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s been a very difficult year.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/angelina-jolie-is-single-not-dating-real-estate-agent/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Is Single, Not Dating Real Estate Agent", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Angelina Jolie is still off the market, despite rumors that she is dating a realtor, a source exclusively confirms to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie Is Single, Not Dating Real Estate Agent", "description": "Angelina Jolie is still off the market, despite rumors that she is dating a realtor, a source exclusively confirms to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/angelina-jolie-is-single-not-dating-real-estate-agent/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-08T22:31:34+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-27T23:58:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-08T22:31:34+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Angelina Jolie is still off the market, despite rumors that she is dating a realtor, a source exclusively confirms to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "title": "Angelina Jolie Is Single, Not Dating Real Estate Agent", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522195106.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
