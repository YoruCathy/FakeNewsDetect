Did the photos of them cuddling signify that they were dating, or were they just collaborating on new music? How much could one read into reports that they spent New Year\u2019s together, and he was buying her at least one of the rocks that she got? And how did this all end so that she could embark on a new relationship with fellow New York City treasure Alex Rodriguez?\n\nNow, there are some answers: Drake dropped his album More Life on Saturday night, and E.W. reports that Lopez is all over it, but not on it exactly. \u201cGet It Together,\u201d which first \u201cleaked\u201d to the public when TMZ published videos of J.Lo and Drake at a prom-themed party, dancing to the song, sounded as though it featured Lopez\u2019s vocals. British singer Jorja Smith is the one singing on the final version, though.\n\nMore pointedly still, \u201cTeenage Fever\u201d samples the entire hook from \u201cIf You Had My Love,\u201d Lopez\u2019s 1999 hit from her first album, On the 6, but slows it down so it\u2019s more somber. Is that a dig? Or is that the collaboration part that they were hinting at all along?\n\nThe most pointed reference to Jenny from the Block arrived on the opening track \u201cFree Smoke,\u201d in which he raps, \u201cMiraval to the face\u201d (i.e., Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s shared wine label that specializes in ros\u00e9), followed by, \u201cI drunk text J. Lo / Old number so it bounce back.\u201d How perfectly Drake that he learns he\u2019s been rejected by Lopez via a passive number change while tipsy on ros\u00e9. Almost too Drake, really.\n\nThis was the problem all along. The stories circling these two were on the nose, a little too convenient for drumming up album excitement. Their matching intimate Instagrams arrived too suddenly with not enough confirmed clarity from either camp.\n\nDrake\u2019s feelings could be genuinely hurt, leading to him cutting Lopez out of the album. He also could have pivoted to fit the public narrative when nobody bought that they were together. Or the amount of J.Lo on the album now could have been the plan all along. We don\u2019t know. But what we do know is that Lopez officially denied the relationship almost two weeks before More Life landed. During her Shades of Blue media blitz in early March, she told The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah, \u201cLet me clear this up. I am not with Drake. Maybe that\u2019s all I need to say.\u201d\n\nThe next day was the Instagram double-tap heard round the world, and Page Six confirmed that Alex Rodriguez and Lopez were dating.\n\nThe tone of this relationship is more fitting and authentic. Lopez is neither hiding their time spent together\u2014they\u2019ve been seen out at dinner around Miami and in the Bahamas\u2014nor is she promoting the new coupling on her own feeds.\n\nOn Saturday, right before More Life dropped, she arrived at the Yankee training camp in Florida to reportedly watch the retired Bronx bomber from a private box. By now, it\u2019s very much, \u201cDrake who?\u201d\n\nVanity Fair has reached out to Lopez for comment on the album.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898b79b1eeeaa1f3b7f600f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pregnant-performers-kelly-clarkson.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5682b3cd2c593fd3139281d6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/year-in-drake-memes.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58a119271fce8b83738d9d25/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/beyonce-performance-grammys-2017.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898b79b1eeeaa1f3b7f6010/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pregnant-performers-alicia-keys.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c9acdc55c69a50ab88e702/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Jennifer-Lopez-Alex-Rodriguez.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c17c3a208b4945c3920cfa/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-dating.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kenzie Bryant", "Kenzie Bryan", "Julie Mille", "Josh Dubof", "Richard Lawso", "Emma Stefansk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-more-life-album", "title": "Drake, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez: The Lopsided Love Triangle", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kenzie Bryant", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.", "id": "58cfeff60990073437620952", "keywords": "celebrity,jennifer lopez,alex rodriguez,drake,more life,vanities", "news_keywords": "celebrity,jennifer lopez,alex rodriguez,drake,more life,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58cfeff60990073437620952", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Drake, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez: The Lopsided Love Triangle", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-more-life-album"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "One woman and two rumored relationships, not a Y.A. novel.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cffc0c0990073437620956/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/drake-jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-love-triangle.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Drake, Jennifer Lopez, and Alex Rodriguez: The Lopsided Love Triangle"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
