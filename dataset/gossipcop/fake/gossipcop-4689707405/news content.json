Khloe has been hitting the gym hard with her baby daddy since giving birth to True, which hasn\u2019t just been great for her post-baby bod, but for her relationship as well!\n\nWe\u2019ve all heard of the buddy system, but Khloe Kardashian, 33, and Tristan Thompson, 27, have been putting that into practice at the gym six days a week. Turns out True Thompson\u2018s momma isn\u2019t the only one working to stay slim after welcoming her baby girl in April \u2014 Tristan has been sweating at her side. He is an NBA player, after all, so the training makes sense, but it isn\u2019t just getting these two in shape! It may be getting their relationship off of the rocks and back where they want it. The rock-hard abs are just an added benefit\u2026 \u201cHim being a professional athlete champion, he performs at a higher level. He pushed her to reach that level,\u201d their trainer Don Brooks told Us Weekly. \u201cSo really it\u2019s having me go easier on my job, because he\u2019s in there pushing her, so I can kind of demonstrate the exercises and let them support each other.\u201d This isn\u2019t just a way to get ripped, but to get romantic as well!\n\n\u201cWhen the workout\u2019s up, they might end up with another baby True!\u201d Brooks joked. And TBH, it\u2019s not a crazy idea. Sweating through a tough workout sesh just might lead to sweating somewhere else, if you know what we mean! Plus, these two have been spending a ton of time together since they moved to Los Angeles. But Tristan and Khloe aren\u2019t just grabbing lunch in gym attire or having dinner after the baby is in bed \u2014 they\u2019re allegedly logging lots of quality time in the bedroom as well. \u201cKhloe says they have acrobatic sex, and she\u2019s convinced all their wild sex is doing wonders for her body,\u201d a source told Hollywoodlife EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe\u2019s been joking that her favorite workout is sex.\u201d\n\nLOL. How ironic would it be if all the ways Khloe\u2019s been losing weight only led to another bun in the oven? We\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on her slim self while these workouts continue.\n\nThings may have been difficult for this couple since Tristan\u2019s infidelity surfaced right before Khloe gave birth, BUT we respect their dedication to stick with each other. So to hear that they\u2019re working on their relationship by working out sounds like a step in the right direction.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-having-another-baby-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/riley_cardoza.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-having-another-baby-embed.jpg?w=620&h=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F25%2Fkhloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-baby-number-two-trainer-speaks%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3220179", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-having-another-baby-ftr.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-having-another-baby-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Riley Cardoza", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/25/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-baby-number-two-trainer-speaks/", "title": "Are Khloe & Tristan Having \u2018Another Baby\u2019?
