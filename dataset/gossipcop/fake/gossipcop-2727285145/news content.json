Still, the Aniston jokes came flooding in when news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce, even though Aniston has been happily married to Theroux since 2015.\n\nJolie/Pitt divorce: Now what?\n\nThe Girl on the Train actor addressed the Brangelina breakup with Business Insider Monday.\n\n\u201cAs a child of divorce, all I can say is that's terrible news for those children, and that's all you can really say,\u201d Theroux stated. \u201cIt's boring to sort of comment on anything else.\u201d\n\nHe also said tabloids making Aniston a part of the saga is just the latest instance of \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,\" The Leftovers star said. \"But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to (expletive) about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.\u201d\n\nValid point, Mr. Theroux.\n\nBrad Pitt cancels premiere, says he's 'focused' on his family", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e508bdd9eb76c0b01ab7d6331c8af4b90e6edb76/c=295-20-2679-1367/local/-/media/2016/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636106557865683817-cox.jpg?width=2384&height=1347&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e508bdd9eb76c0b01ab7d6331c8af4b90e6edb76/c=295-20-2679-1367/local/-/media/2016/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636106557865683817-cox.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e508bdd9eb76c0b01ab7d6331c8af4b90e6edb76/c=295-20-2679-1367/local/-/media/2016/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636106557865683817-cox.jpg?width=2384&height=1347&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/09/28/courteney-cox-justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce/91213298/", "title": "Courteney Cox, Justin Theroux want you to leave Jennifer Aniston out of the Brangelina split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Courteney Cox, Justin Theroux want you to leave Jennifer Aniston out of the Brangelina split", "description": "\u2018It\u2019s not about her,\u2019 Courteney Cox said.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/09/28/courteney-cox-justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-divorce/91213298/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e508bdd9eb76c0b01ab7d6331c8af4b90e6edb76/c=295-20-2679-1367/local/-/media/2016/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636106557865683817-cox.jpg?width=2384&height=1347&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2384, "height": 1347}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "\u2018It\u2019s not about her,\u2019 Courteney Cox said.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e508bdd9eb76c0b01ab7d6331c8af4b90e6edb76/c=295-20-2679-1367/local/-/media/2016/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636106557865683817-cox.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Courteney Cox, Justin Theroux want you to leave Jennifer Aniston out of the Brangelina split", "description": "\u2018It\u2019s not about her,\u2019 Courteney Cox said."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1474992000.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
