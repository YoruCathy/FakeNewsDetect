However, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re ready to get married. The musical duo and fellow Voice coaches began dating in November 2015, which has left fans hoping for wedding bells on the horizon.\n\nThey probably shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up, because Stefani and Shelton don\u2019t plan on tying the knot any time soon. Here\u2019s the real reason why, including proof that those breakup rumors are totally false.\n\nThey both came out of marriages before their relationship\n\nMiranda Lambert and Blake Shelton announced their divorce in 2015. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton announced their divorce in 2015. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images\n\nWe can imagine that one factor coming into play would be the fact that Stefani and Shelton\u2019s romance seemingly sparked just after each of their divorces. In July 2015, Shelton announced his divorce from fellow country singer Miranda Lambert. Just one month later, Stefani and her husband of 13 years, Gavin Rossdale, also announced their divorce.\n\nEven if Stefani and Shelton are head-over-heels in love, they might want to give it some time before they rush into tying the knot again.\n\nNext: Here\u2019s the sweet way the couple feels about each other.\n\nThey\u2019re stronger than ever\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani\u2019s relationship is staying strong. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani\u2019s relationship is staying strong. | Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see that Stefani and Shelton are in love \u2014 and just because they aren\u2019t rushing down the aisle doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t stronger than ever.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight\u2019s source, \u201cThey are on cloud nine for each other. They are perfect for each other. They know they have found their true soulmate.\u201d\n\nNext: This could be beneficial to their relationship.\n\nThey\u2019re trying to stay out of the public eye\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton met on The Voice. | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton met on The Voice. | NBC\n\nStefani and Shelton\u2019s relationship may have blossomed on reality TV as The Voice coaches, but they\u2019re trying to make their relationship a bit more private. E! News explained why the couple may be trying to keep their \u201cvery public relationship off the radar for awhile.\u201d\n\nThey have no problem with showing off their love for each other, but their regular PDA led some to believe their relationship just couldn\u2019t be real. Fellow Voice coach Adam Levine weighed in on just how real their relationship is, and the effects of their love being out there for everyone to see.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s in the public eye, a lot of people want to have their own bullsh*t opinions about it, but I\u2019m, like, there,\u201d he explained. \u201cI see it every day.

In Touch Weekly reported that Shelton had dumped Stefani in February 2018, just before going on his Country Music Freaks tour.\n\nA source reportedly claimed, \u201cBlake\u2019s through with Gwen\u2019s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women.\u201d They added, \u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.\u201d\n\nNext: Those rumors couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\n\nStefani\u2019s been posting loving photos on Instagram\n\nThese two are fighting the breakup rumors. | These two are fighting the breakup rumors. | Gwen Stefani via Instagram\n\nSince those rumors have surfaced, Stefani has shut those speculations down. She\u2019s still posting adorable photos of herself and Shelton on her Instagram, showing to the world that they\u2019re still going strong. She\u2019s even joined Shelton on his Country Music Freaks tour and they\u2019ve gotten pretty cuddly on stage (so they clearly aren\u2019t staying completely out of the public eye together).\n\nEven with these photos, In Touch Weekly\u2019s source described them as \u201c[Stefani\u2019s] desperate attempt to ignore the truth.\u201d\n\nNext: This is the main reason they aren\u2019t getting married.\n\nThey\u2019re content in their relationship\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are happy with their current relationship status. | NBC Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are happy with their current relationship status. | NBC\n\nDespite the rumors, Stefani and Shelton don\u2019t see a need to change anything in their relationship \u2014 so they aren\u2019t going to. A source told Entertainment Tonight, \u201cThere is no reason for them to rush into a marriage, so they aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThey added, \u201cBoth of them are happy and content with where their relationship is right now.\u201d\n\nNext: Here\u2019s what Shelton said about Stefani since the rumors sparked.\n\nShelton called Stefani the \u2018greatest\u2019\n\nThe two always gush about each other. | The two always gush about each other. | Gwen Stefani via Instagram\n\nAlthough Shelton isn\u2019t one to share personal photos with Stefani on social media, he\u2019s spilled about his love for her in other ways. In March 2018, Shelton appeared on the Today show, where he gushed about Stefani.\n\n\u201cHow can I not be [in love]? She is the greatest,\u201d he spilled. \u201cShe is the greatest.\u201d He even shared with Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb that he\u2019s loved becoming a father figure to Stefani\u2019s three children, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo. \u201cHaving them around is, I don\u2019t even know how to describe it. It\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like Stefani and Shelton aren\u2019t going their separate ways anytime soon. Maybe one day they will be hearing wedding bells, but for now, they\u2019re enjoying their relationship as it is.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gwen-Stefani-and-Blake-Shelton-Peoples-Choice-Awards-1-e1499781245745.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Gwen-Stefani-.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Miranda-Lambert-1.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-21-at-1.18.14-PM.png?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-the-voice-1.jpg?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-21-at-1.22.59-PM.png?x62514", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/go-ahead-and-break-my-heart-blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-lifeunderaluckystar-kriscondebolos.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Miranda-Lambert-1.jpg?x62514"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Miranda-Lambert-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Leary"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-the-real-reason-this-power-couple-isnt-ready-to-get-married.html/", "title": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton: The Real Reason This Power Couple Isn\u2019t Ready to Get Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-the-real-reason-this-power-couple-isnt-ready-to-get-married.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton seem more in love than ever -- so why aren't they ready to get married any time soon?
