Simpson may be Khloe Kardashian\u2019s father, the disgraced athlete is putting those rumors to rest.\n\nIn video obtained by TMZ, a photographer asked Simpson, 70, if congratulations were in order in reference to Kardashian\u2019s pregnancy. Simpson\u2019s response made it clear that the late Robert Kardashian was in fact Khloe\u2019s biological father.\n\n\u201cWell, for Bob, God bless his soul, yeah. I don\u2019t know for me,\u201d Simpson said in the video. \u201cI don\u2019t think for me. I have nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would be proud \u2026 but trust me, I had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nRobert was Simpson\u2019s defense attorney in his 1995 murder trial over the death of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, in which O.J. was infamously found not guilty. At the time of her death, Nicole was Robert\u2019s ex-wife Kris Jenner\u2019s best friend and Kris has spoken publicly about how the case caused tension between her and Robert.\n\nUs Weekly exclusively revealed in September that Khloe is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson. The Good American designer confirmed the news on Instagram two months later, calling it \u201cmy greatest dream realized!\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9, 34, joked in October 2016 about the rumors that she is Simpson\u2019s daughter. After posting a selfie to Instagram in which her face was disguised by Snapchat\u2019s puppy filter, a commenter wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know why but you look white in this picture,\u201d The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 Some days I\u2019m OJs daughter. Others I\u2019m Roberts daughter.\u201d\n\nin 2013, Ellen Pierson, Robert\u2019s wife at the time of his death from esophageal cancer in 2003, sold excerpts from the lawyer\u2019s private journal to a tabloid and gave an interview in which she claimed that Robert confessed to her that he wasn\u2019t Khlo\u00e9\u2019s biological dad.\n\nIn March 2016, the reality star slammed the allegation on her show Kocktails With Khloe. \u201cShe wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I\u2019m not his daughter and that he confided in her,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI was like, \u2018Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f\u2013king want.\u2019 Do not talk about my dad. \u2026 He\u2019s not here!\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oj-simpson-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oj-simpson-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oj-simpson-khloe-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/o-j-simpson-im-not-khloe-kardashians-dad/", "title": "O.J.
