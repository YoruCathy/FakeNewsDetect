Since that watershed moment \u2014 when Arquette addressed the wage gap on live TV, in front of the entire industry \u2014 actors and actresses have continued to speak out about pay inequality in Hollywood and around the country, to draw attention to the pay gaps that affect women everywhere. Their conversations expand to include discussions on race in the negotiating room, including men in salary conversations, and hard-won advice on how to ask for a raise.\n\n2015: The Year of the Sony Hack and Patricia Arquette\u2019s Milestone Speech\n\n\n\n\n\nActress Patricia Arquette accepts the award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for \u2018Boyhood\u2019 onstage during the 87th Annual Academy Awards at Dolby Theatre on February 22, 2015 in Hollywood, California.

I am terrified to be deemed \u2018difficult,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only woman with that fear. I may not be able to single-handedly fix the pay gap, but I can open my stepdaughter\u2019s eyes to it. I can encourage her to negotiate, ask questions, and stand up for herself. I can remind myself to try that too.\u201d\n\nNicki Minaj, May 2015: \u201cDo your research.\u201d\n\nIn an intimate interview with Cosmo, the rapper discussed all things sex, power, and, of course, money, stressing how she\u2019s never held back in any category. \u201cWomen are uncomfortable talking about money. I know it\u2019s taboo to discuss it at work. But you need to know what people around you are making. Otherwise, you\u2019re not going to know what you\u2019re worth. You have to ask questions. Do your research. I\u2019ve always been pretty competitive in terms of my pay.\u201d\n\nFrances McDormand, winner of the Best Actress award for \u2018Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u2019 poses during the 90th Annual Academy Awards on March 4, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

She went on to discuss her salary for her role in Transformers 3. \u201cI\u2019m glad I did that film and I\u2019m proud that I finally got paid what I was told I was worth by the industry,\u201d she said at the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s Women in Motion panel. \u201cBut that is nothing. That is a tenth of what most males my age, with my experience and my reputation as a film actor, make. We\u2019ve never been paid commensurately and that has to change.\u201d\n\nCharlize Theron, May 2015: \u201cThey did not fight it.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, Theron had successfully negotiated a pay raise to match that of co-star Chris Hemsworth in the upcoming sequel for Snow White and the Huntsman. \u201cI have to give them credit because once I asked, they said yes,\u201d she told Elle U.K. in a cover story. \u201cThey did not fight it. And maybe that\u2019s the message: that we just need to put our foot down. If you\u2019re doing the same job, you should be compensated and treated in the same way.\u201d\n\nAmanda Seyfried, July 2015: He was \u201cpretty even in status.\u201d\n\nFollowing in Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s and Charlize Theron\u2019s footsteps, Seyfried told the Sunday Times about the wage discrepancy on the set of one of her films, where a male co-star whom she described as \u201cpretty even in status\u201d with her was making exactly ten times more than she was.\n\n\u201cI think people think that just because I\u2019m easygoing and game to do things I\u2019ll just take as little as they offer,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how much you get; it\u2019s about how fair it is.\u201d\n\nNominee for Best Supporting Actress in \u2018American Hustle\u2019 Jennifer Lawrence poses on the red carpet at the 86th Academy Awards on March 2nd, 2014 in Hollywood, California.

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJennifer Lawrence, October 2015: The Lenny Letter\n\nIn November 2014, the Sony hack leaks made international news as confidential emails, company secrets, and, yes, individual salaries were publicly disclosed. Lawrence, alongside Amy Adams and Natalie Portman, was among those who discovered their pay had been significantly lower than their male counterparts\u2019 in Oscar-nominated films. This prompted Lawrence to write an essay in Lena Dunham\u2019s Lenny Letter on the wage disparity, titled \u201cWhy Do I Make Less Than My Male Co-stars?\u201d Lawrence drew praise and criticism alike for her willingness to speak out.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to seem \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018spoiled,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn\u2019t worry about being \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018spoiled.\u2019\u201d\n\nBradley Cooper, October 2015: \u201cThere\u2019s a double standard.\u201d\n\nAs Lawrence\u2019s recurring co-star and longtime friend, Bradley Cooper gave Entertainment Tonight an interview the same day J.Law\u2019s Lenny Letter was published, rallying in her support. \u201cThere\u2019s a double standard in the whole world. This is just one aspect. Anytime there\u2019s a place where a voice can come out and be outspoken \u2014 something Sienna (Miller) did, or Jennifer (Lawrence) \u2014 that\u2019s great. \u2026 I think it is making a difference.\u201d\n\nSalma Hayek, October 2015: \u201cThis is a problem that is in every single industry.\u201d\n\nAn honoree at Variety\u2019s Power of Women luncheon alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and Gucci, for her work with the Chime for Change women\u2019s empowerment project, Hayek gave an emotional, rousing speech on the sexism women faced in the industry, praising Patricia Arquette\u2019s Oscars speech for addressing pay disparity in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThis is a problem that is in every single industry. If you have the same capacities and you are doing the same job, it is criminal not to pay the same salary. We are such an economical power, women in the country. We represent such a strong part of the audience that they cannot ignore us anymore.\u201d\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, October 2015: \u201cYour salary is a way to quantify what you\u2019re worth.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to being honest about her thoughts on male co-star Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s paycheck for Iron Man, Gwyneth Paltrow didn\u2019t hold back during an interview with Variety. \u201cLook, nobody is worth the money that Robert Downey Jr. is worth, but if I told you the disparity you would probably be surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cYour salary is a way to quantify what you\u2019re worth. If men are being paid a lot more for doing the same thing, it feels shitty.\u201d\n\nSharon Stone, November 2015: \u201cNo one wanted to pay me.\u201d\n\nHer performance in 1992\u2019s Basic Instinct made her a household name, but Stone didn\u2019t reap many of the financial benefits that can come with fame. At the Celebration of Hope event during Miami Fashion Week, she gave a speech to the audience. \u201cNo one wanted to pay me. I remember sitting in my kitchen with my manager and just crying and saying: \u2018I\u2019m not going to work until I get paid.\u2019 I still got paid so much less than any men.\u201d\n\nSandra Bullock, November 2015: \u201cWhy is it that no one is standing up and saying you can\u2019t say that about a woman?\u201d\n\nFor Variety\u2019s cover story on income disparity, Bullock depicted the wage-gap issue as part of the holistic and fundamentally flawed way women in Hollywood are perceived. \u201cI keep saying, \u201cWhy is it that no one is standing up and saying you can\u2019t say that about a woman?\u201d \u2026 We\u2019re going to walk down the red carpet, I\u2019m going to be asked about my dress and my hair while the man standing next to me will be asked about his performance and political issues. Once we start shifting how we perceive women and stop thinking about them as \u2018less than,\u2019 the pay disparity will take care of itself.\u201d\n\nCarey Mulligan, November 2015: \u201cShe has an enormous platform.\u201d\n\nThe actress defended Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s outspoken stance and advocacy for equal pay within the industry after the Sony-hack leaks, telling Deadline: \u201cThe discrepancy is inherently unfair and she has an enormous platform to speak out against it. Men in Hollywood look up to her because she is powerful. She\u2019s using that platform to correct something that isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s a long-overdue conversation and it\u2019s admirable what she has done.\u201d\n\nKathy Griffin, November 2015: \u201cIt was an all-out brawl.\u201d\n\nGriffin is a veteran in the art of negotiating salaries, but that doesn\u2019t mean her feats came easily. During her breakout role in NBC\u2019s 1996 Suddenly Susan, Griffin discovered she made nearly four times less than a male co-star. After her own agents repeatedly dismissed her, she went directly to Warner Bros. TV chief Peter Roth and demanded a raise. \u201cIt was an all-out brawl,\u201d she told Variety. \u201cI got a raise, but I still didn\u2019t make equal to what the guys were making.\u201d\n\nTen years later, an Emmy-winning Griffin had twice the confidence to ask NBC co-chairman Ben Silverman for a pay hike for her part on the Bravo reality series My Life on the D-List. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this shit on my own forever,\u201d she said in the Variety interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never been paid what the guys get. Ever. It\u2019s not getting better for me.\u201d\n\nToni Colette, November 2015: \u201cMoney is genderless.\u201d\n\nOn HuffPost Live, joined by actresses Jennifer Lawrence, Jessica Chastain, and Amanda Seyfried, Toni Colette didn\u2019t hold back when commenting on the wage disparity in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking sexist industry. I don\u2019t understand why genitalia makes a difference. Creativity is creativity. Creativity is genderless. Money is genderless.\u201d\n\nCate Blanchett, December 2015: \u201cThe industry has the same conversation every year.\u201d\n\nFollowing her Oscars acceptance speech for her role in Blue Jasmine, Blanchett became a figurehead for the feminist movement in Hollywood that aimed to put women in leading cinematographic roles. When asked about pay equality, however, Blanchett believed there was all talk and no walk. \u201cIt just feels like the industry has the same conversation every year, it\u2019s a fabulous conversation, but we\u2019ll be back here like Groundhog Day next year having the same fucking symposium,\u201d she told GQ. \u201cIt just has to shift.\u201d\n\nElection Year 2016: A Hamilton Rap, Race in the Negotiating Room, and the House of Cards Controversy\n\nChris Rock, January 2016: \u201cIf she was black, she\u2019d really have something to complain about.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The New Yorker about Leslie Jones\u2019s road to success, Chris Rock, who met Jones in the late \u201980s when the two were comics on the road, reintroduced the racial dynamics of pay equality for women. \u201cBlack women have the hardest gig in show business. You hear Jennifer Lawrence complaining about getting paid less because she\u2019s a woman \u2014 if she was black, she\u2019d really have something to complain about.\u201d\n\nViola Davis attends PaleyLive NY: \u2018How To Get Away With Murder\u2019 at The Paley Center for Media on November 12, 2015 in New York City. Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nViola Davis, February 2016: \u201cThe struggle for us as women of color is just to be seen the same as our white female counterparts.\u201d\n\nIn a Q&A with Mashable, Davis broached the equal-pay subject through the lens of African-American women. Stressing the different playing fields between white and black women, Davis emphasized the additional hurdles that women of color face regarding the wage gap.\n\n\u201cThe struggle for us as women of color is just to be seen the same as our white female counterparts. Forget the men! We\u2019re not even in that realm yet. It\u2019s like talking to someone who lives in poverty! \u2018You don\u2019t want that Bentley?\u2019 They\u2019re like \u2018Shoot, I\u2019m just trying to get bus fare money.\u2019\u201d\n\nLin Manuel-Miranda, March 2016: \u201cYo, it\u2019s Lin.\u201d\n\nThe Hamilton writer, director, producer, and actor rapped while actress and ambassador to the U.N. Emma Watson beatboxed in a promotional video for the HeForShe Campaign founded by U.N. women, filmed around International Women\u2019s Day of that year.\n\n\u201cYo, it\u2019s Lin and I have to laugh, how can we not be equal, we\u2019re like half. Like women are half of the people on Earth. And yes they should\u2019ve been equal since birth. That means all day, every day, equal pay, every way.\u201d\n\nRobin Wright, May 2016: \u201cI was like, \u2018You better pay me or I\u2019m going to go public.\u2019\u201d\n\nTaking a page from Claire Underwood\u2019s handbook, Robin Wright told Netflix she\u2019d go public if they did not pay her as much as co-star Kevin Spacey for her role in House of Cards. \u201cThere are very few films or TV shows where the male, the patriarch, and the matriarch are equal,\u201d she said in a human rights discussion at the Rockefeller Foundation. \u201cAnd they are in House of Cards. Claire Underwood\u2019s character was more popular than [Frank\u2019s] for a period of time, so I capitalized on it. I was like, \u2018You better pay me or I\u2019m going to go public.\u2019 And they did.\u2019\u201d\n\nAmy Adams, November 2016: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a headline anymore.\u201d\n\nDuring one of The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s recurring roundtable series, actresses Amy Adams, Taraji P. Henson, Natalie Portman, Emma Stone, Annette Bening, Naomie Harris, and Isabelle Huppert discussed a number of topics regarding women in the entertainment industry. When asked about equal pay, Adams sought to redirect the question.\n\n\u201cWe are always put on the chopping block to put our opinion out there. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask [the producers] and then have their statements be the headlines in the press? I don\u2019t want to be a headline anymore about pay equality.\u201d\n\nWilliam H. Macy with Emmy Rossum, December 2016: \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d\n\nWhen Emmy Rossum joined the cast of Shameless in 2011, she had no intentions of being paid as much as the veteran, Oscar-nominated actor William H. Macy. However, as the show\u2019s popularity grew exponentially, so did Rossum\u2019s presence and importance to the plot line, prompting her to ask for equal pay. Both Rossum and Macy spoke about the subject at a panel at the Vulture Festival. \u201cAs the time went on, the leadership role started to feel somewhat shared,\u201d Rossum said. \u201cI just felt that I love the show, I love everyone in it, I want to keep doing it, but I just wanted it to feel right.\u201d\n\nMacy wholeheartedly supported and agreed with Rossum\u2019s sentiments, giving his own opinion on the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable they would pay a woman less for the same job,\u201d Macy said at the panel. \u201cIt\u2019s show biz\u2019s job to get us for as cheaply as they can \u2014 and our job to say no.\u201d That same month, it was confirmed Rossum would receive equal pay going forward.\n\n2017: Oprah Winfrey\u2019s Power Move, Emma Stone on Men, and E!\u2019s Wage Gap Scandal\n\nNatalie Portman, January 2017: \u201cI knew and I went along with it.\u201d\n\nIn an interview for Marie Claire\u2019s cover, Portman revealed she was paid three times less than her male co-star, Ashton Kutcher, for the hit rom-com No Strings Attached. \u201cI knew and I went along with it because there\u2019s this thing with \u2018quotes\u2019 in Hollywood\u2026 His [quote] was three times higher than mine so they said he should get three times more. I wasn\u2019t as pissed as I should have been. The disparity is crazy.\u201d\n\nPriyanka Chopra, May 2017: \u201cI\u2019m still used to being paid a lot less than the boys.\u201d\n\nThe actress got her big break as the lead in the hit series Quantico, and was to star in the highly anticipated reboot of Baywatch, when she told Glamour about her refusal to be typecast as the exotic Indian female character, and the struggles that came with being a woman in the male-dominated industry.\n\n\u201cI was told that female actors are replaceable in films because they just stand behind a guy anyway. I\u2019m still used to being paid \u2014 like most actresses around the world \u2014 a lot less than the boys. We\u2019re told we\u2019re too provocative or that being sexy is our strength, which it can be, and it is, but that\u2019s not the only thing we have.\u201d\n\nEmma Stone, July 2017: \u201cI\u2019ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut.\u201d\n\nStone spoke to Out magazine about her portrayal of Billie Jean King in Battle of the Sexes, a film about the most-watched televised sporting event of all time, between King and Bobby Riggs. In the film, King struggles with her own sexuality as her husband urges her to fight for equal pay. Stone reflected on the ongoing realities of the situation in her personal career, and as an actress in Hollywood at large.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut so that I may have parity with them. And that\u2019s something they do for me because they feel it\u2019s what\u2019s right and fair. That\u2019s something that\u2019s also not discussed, necessarily \u2014 that our getting equal pay is going to require people to selflessly say, \u2018That\u2019s what\u2019s fair.\u2019\u201d\n\nOprah Winfrey attends the European Premiere of \u2018A Wrinkle In Time\u2019 at BFI IMAX on March 13, 2018 in London, England Photo: Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage\n\nOprah Winfrey, August 2017: \u201cI will not work unless they get paid.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Time magazine, Oprah revealed the barriers she faced when trying to get her female producers on The Oprah Winfrey Show higher salaries to match the show\u2019s growing success. \u201cI went to my boss at the time and I said \u2018Everybody needs a raise,\u2019 And he said, \u2018Why?\u2019 He actually said to me, \u2018They\u2019re only girls. They\u2019re a bunch of girls \u2014 what do they need more money for?\u2019 I go, \u2018Well, either they\u2019re going to get raises, or I\u2019m going to sit down.\u2019 I will not work unless they get paid.\u2019\u201d\n\nWinfrey\u2019s determination forced the owners to increase here female colleagues\u2019 salaries. She paid them out of her own pocket while waiting for her request to be processed and finalized.\n\nCatt Sadler, December 2017, E!\u2019s wage gap scandal: \u201cHow can I remain silent?\u201d\n\nFollowing the discovery that her E! co-host Jason Kennedy had been making nearly twice her salary despite similar work histories, Catt Sadler attempted to negotiate a raise that more closely resembled Kennedy\u2019s yearly wage. After her team\u2019s requests were repeatedly denied, Sadler decided to leave the network, releasing a statement on her personal website to explain her decision.\n\n\u201cKnow your worth. How can I operate with integrity and stay on at E if they\u2019re not willing to pay me the same as him? Or at least come close? How can I accept an offer that shows they do not value my contributions and paralleled dedication all these years? How can I not echo the actions of my heroes and stand for what is right no matter what the cost? How can I remain silent when my rights under the law have been violated?\u201d\n\n2018: The Harvey Weinstein Reckoning, #MeToo, and Time\u2019s Up\n\n(L-R) Reese Witherspoon, Eva Longoria, Salma Hayek and Ashley Judd arrives at the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California. Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nThe 2018 Golden Globes: Time\u2019s Up Stands With Catt Sadler\n\nGiven the then-recent blow to E!\u2019s reputation following Catt Sadler\u2019s departure, many celebrities weren\u2019t thrilled to have it aired at the 2018 Golden Globes, particularly people dedicated to the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements, with all attendees dressed in black as a sign of respect and of dissent against the industry\u2019s long-prevailing sexist standards. As a result, many female actresses took to social media or, while speaking with an E! host on the red carpet, called out the network in a show of support for Sadler and the equal pay movement. Here are the women who spoke on camera:\n\nAmy Schumer on Instagram: \u201cIf you\u2019re on the carpet tonight or at home post in support and ask @eentertainment what happened? We thought you would be for pay equality and say #imwithcattsad.\u201d\n\nEva Longoria to E! News\u2019 Ryan Seacrest, standing between Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon: \u201cWe\u2019re here for Time\u2019s Up, we support gender equity and equal pay, and we hope that E! follows that lead with Catt as well. We stand with you, Catt.\u201d\n\nDebra Messing to E! News\u2019 Giuliana Ransic: \u201cI was so shocked to hear that E! doesn\u2019t believe in paying their female co-hosts the same as their male co-hosts. We want people to start having this conversation that women are just as valuable as men.\u201d\n\nLaura Dern to Seacrest: \u201cWe need the powers that be, and all the industries, and all the networks, and E!, to help us with closing this pay gender gap.\u201d\n\nSarah Jessica Parker to Seacrest: \u201cEquality, parity, and safe work environments for men and women across all industries are key; I know it\u2019s affected your network.\u201d\n\nMichelle Williams, January 2018, All the Money in the World Controversy: \u201cToday isn\u2019t about me.\u201d\n\nWilliams learned she made less than one percent of what her co-star Mark Wahlberg made for All the Money in the World\u2019s reshoots, following Kevin Spacey\u2019s dismissal amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations. Wahlberg earned $1.5 million for the scenes collectively, while she received $80 per day, resulting in about $1,000 total. Williams was overcome with support by the community of women rallying around Time\u2019s Up. Wahlberg announced he would donate his $1.5 million to the Times Up Legal Defense Fund, and Williams made a statement of her own.\n\n\u201cToday isn\u2019t about me, my fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me, my activist friends taught me to use my voice, and the most powerful men in charge, they listened and they acted,\u201d she said.\n\nEllen Pompeo, January 2018: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.\u201d\n\nOpening up about her fight for equal pay behind the scenes of Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Pompeo told The Hollywood Reporter about the importance of power leverage and ultimatums when it comes to negotiating. \u201cAt one point, I asked for $5,000 more than [Patrick Dempsey] just on principle, because the show is Grey\u2019s Anatomy and I\u2019m Meredith Grey. They wouldn\u2019t give it to me. And I could have walked away, so why didn\u2019t I? You feel conflicted but then you figure, \u2018I\u2019m not going to let a guy drive me out of my own house.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter 14 seasons, she signed a deal in late 2017 that made her the highest-paid actress on a television drama, with a paycheck of $575,000 per episode. \u201cDecide what you think you\u2019re worth and then ask for what you think you\u2019re worth,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody\u2019s just going to give it to you.\u201d\n\nActors Octavia Spencer (L) and Jessica Chastain attend The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.

At the Sundance Film Festival\u2019s Women Breaking Barriers panel, Spencer recalled a personal conversation with her friend and future co-star in an unnamed film, Jessica Chastain, in which she highlighted the struggles that African-American women face in the context of equal pay. \u201cI said, \u2018Here\u2019s the thing, women of color on that spectrum, we make far less than white women,\u2019\u201d Spencer told the Hollywood Foreign Press at the panel. \u201cSo, if we\u2019re gonna have that conversation about pay equity, we gotta bring the women of color to the table.\u201d Spencer got emotional when she recounted that Chastain, who went quiet at her unawareness of this second disparity, decided to take action and get Spencer five times her salary.\n\nJada Pinkett-Smith, who will co-star alongside both women in a holiday comedy currently in production, sang Chastain\u2019s praises for raising her and Spencer\u2019s wages. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to go out and march, we can do that. It\u2019s nice to wear black at the Golden Globes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what are we doing behind closed doors? And I got to give our sister Jessica Chastain her props.\u201d\n\nJessica Chastain, a longtime outspoken advocate for gender equality and taking on strong female roles (in Zero Dark Thirty, Miss Sloane, and most recently, Molly\u2019s Game) said in an interview with Variety a year earlier, \u201cI\u2019m not taking jobs anymore where I\u2019m getting paid a quarter of what the male co-star is being paid. I\u2019m not allowing that in my life.\u201d\n\nEmily Blunt, February 2018: \u201c\u2018Making an aggressive deal\u2019 [is] a positive.\u201d\n\nIn Vanity Fair\u2019s cover story, Blunt revealed her assertive approach to negotiating her salary for any role, by virtue of the growing pressure and public relations risks faced by current-day producers. \u201cEspecially in this new climate, I think that it\u2019s O.K. to reclaim the words \u2018making an aggressive deal\u2019 as a positive. Usually people are making so much money off your back that it comes down to a sort of justice thing for me. I make it a point to not be too concerned with \u2018I hope they think I\u2019m a team player.\u2019\u201d\n\nSienna Miller, March 2018: Turning down a role was \u201cdifficult and lonely.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian at the UN Annual Meeting on Gender Equality, the actress shared her story of having to turn down a powerful Broadway role because she was offered less than half of what the male co-star would receive. \u201cThe decision to turn down this particular role was difficult and lonely,\u201d she said. \u201cI was forced to choose between making a concession on my self-worth and dignity and a role that I was in love with.\u201d\n\nClaire Foy, March 2018: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\nThe queen of The Crown made international headlines as one of the show\u2019s producers accidentally revealed that Foy, the main protagonist of the series, was paid less than her male co-star Matt Smith, who plays Prince Phillip in a supporting role. \u201cI\u2019m not [surprised about the interest in the story] in the sense that it was a female-led drama,\u201d Foy told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that people saw [the story] and went, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a bit odd.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlicia Keys, April 2018: \u201cWe have to infiltrate our industries. Period.\u201d\n\nIn Variety\u2019s annual Power of Women NY issue, Alicia Keys spoke about the no-makeup movement she inspired and gender parity. \u201cUntil we\u2019re in those rooms as equally as men are, it can\u2019t shift. We have to infiltrate our industries. Period. We have to. That alone will shift the power balance.\u201d\n\nRead the Cut\u2019s guides to how to ask for a raise and what to do when a male co-worker is making more than you.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/equal-pay-lede.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/oprah.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/jennifer-lawrence.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/equal-pay-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/witherspoon-longoria-hayek-judd.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/viola-davis.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/patricia-arquette.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/frances-mcdormand.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/equal-pay-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melania Hidalgo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/equal-pay-day-celebrities-hollywood.html", "title": "All the Celebrities Who Have Spoken Out About Equal Pay in Hollywood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "All the Celebrities Who Have Spoken Out About Equal Pay in Hollywood", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/equal-pay-day-celebrities-hollywood.html", "description": "A timeline.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/equal-pay-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "All the Celebrities Who Have Spoken Out About Equal Pay", "description": "A timeline.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/04/10/equal-pay/equal-pay-lede.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-10T13:16:14.071-04:00", "tag": "equal pay day, lists, culture, celebrity", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "In honor of Equal Pay Day, the Cut presents a timeline of actors and actresses who have spoken up about their fight for equal pay.", "sailthru.tags": "equal pay day, lists, culture, celebrity", "author": "Melania Hidalgo", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523380574.071, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
