As fans of KUWK may already know, it has become apparent for a while that the 19-year-old is stealing her style and Kourt is convinced it is all Scott\u2019s doing!\n\nOne insider explained that \u2018Kourtney\u2019s definitely more than a little creeped out by how Sofia appears to be stealing her look. But, it also makes her sad because she realized how young and impressionable Sofia is.\u2019\n\nThe source went on to say that the mother of three suspects Scott is to blame for Sofia\u2019s drastic physical change ever since she started dating him.\n\n\u2018Kourtney thinks she is probably being controlled, or at the very least, manipulated, by Scott. Some people might find it flattering, but she just thinks it\u2019s gross, and Scott needs to grow up, move on, and start living as an independent adult for once.\u2019\n\nAs you may remember, at the beginning of Scott and Sofia\u2019s relationship, the teen was rocking her blonde hair and was wearing pretty colorful clothes.\n\nNow, however, not only did she dye her hair brunette but her wardrobe consists of mainly dark blazers and crop tops as well as very thin sunglasses.\n\nFans of KUWK know that all of these style elements are staples of Kourtney\u2019s fashion.\n\n@milesrichie ? ? @alansilfen A post shared by Sofia Richie (@sofiarichie) on Mar 7, 2018 at 7:39pm PST\n\nWe have previously learned that Kourtney did try to discuss with Scott the fact that Sofia keeps on copying her look, but he laughed it off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018[Kourtney] makes comments about it to Scott, and he laughs it off and tries to flip it on her. He just calls her a narcissist and acts like she is crazy for mentioning it, which is so frustrating for her. But, also so typical of Scott. As far as Kourtney\u2019s concerned, this bizarre situation is more proof Scott and his girlfriend are obsessed with her.\u2019", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kourtney-Kardashian-and-Reign-700x466.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kourtney-kardashian-2-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ashley-Mitchell-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Missy-Elliot-KRNB.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kylie-Jenner-Claps-Back-At-Trolls-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Mitchell", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kuwk-kourtney-is-creeped-out-by-scott-disicks-gf-sofia-richie-morphing-into-her-feels-like-hes-manipulating-the-girl-126879/", "title": "KUWK: Kourtney Is \u2018Creeped Out\u2019 By Scott Disick\u2019s GF Sofia Richie Morphing Into Her \u2013 Feels Like He\u2019s \u2018Manipulating\u2019 The Girl", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ashley Mitchell", "news_keywords": "kourtney kardashian, kuwk, scott disick, sofia richie, the kardashians,", "keywords": "celebrity news, kourtney kardashian, kuwk, scott disick, sofia richie, the kardashians,", "description": "We have learned that Kourtney Kardashian is not at all impressed by the fact that it looks like her ex Scott Disick\u2019s current girlfriend Sofia", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "KUWK: Kourtney Is \u2018Creeped Out\u2019 By Scott Disick\u2019s GF Sofia Richie Morphing Into Her \u2013 Feels Like He\u2019s \u2018Manipulating\u2019 The Girl", "description": "We have learned that Kourtney Kardashian is not at all impressed by the fact that it looks like her ex Scott Disick\u2019s current girlfriend Sofia", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kuwk-kourtney-is-creeped-out-by-scott-disicks-gf-sofia-richie-morphing-into-her-feels-like-hes-manipulating-the-girl-126879/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-18", "modified_time": "2018-03-18", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/ashleymitchell/", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "the kardashians"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521302400.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
