Maybe I'm right. Maybe I'm not, and the Green Lantern costume's long gone. One thing's for sure, though: He definitely isn't taking the recent stories about himself and Lively seriously. Example: When one outlet tweeted that Reynolds and Lively were struggling to spend \"quality time\" together, he responded with something cheeky, as he's apt to do. \"I wish. I could use a little 'me time,'\" he said.\n\nAnd now he's at it again\u2014this time with a joke about his mother, Tammy Reynolds. The Deadpool actor couldn't help but play dumb when Yahoo! Entertainment tweeted a photo of him, Lively, and Tammy and captioned it, \"Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) joins Blake Lively and his mom on red carpet after shutting down split rumors.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re never splitting. She\u2019ll always be my mom,\" Reynolds said. \"No matter how much jazz-cabbage she smokes with her rollerblading friends.\"\n\nAhhh, we see what he did there. Don't out-troll the King of Trolling himself, my friends. Check out Reynolds' response for yourself, below:\n\nThese celebrity breakup rumors are typically baseless and come out of left field, so it's great that Reynolds has a sense of humor about them. And in all seriousness: I hope Lively and Reynolds never, ever split up. After Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's breakup announcement earlier this week, half of Twitter is turning to Blake and Ryan for comfort. The people need a hot celebrity couple to live vicariously through, and Lively and Reynolds can't let them down now.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nDid You Notice Ryan Reynolds References Blake Lively in the New 'Deadpool' Trailer?\n\n18 Photos of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' Adorable Daughters\n\nBlake Lively's Daughter Is Just as Troll-y as Her Father Ryan Reynolds:", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ac53a3d1817bf419c88ba73/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-488766751.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ac52f148805ed69bfdacae5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BLAKE-LIVELY-RYAN-REYNOLDS.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ac52f148805ed69bfdacae5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BLAKE-LIVELY-RYAN-REYNOLDS.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/ryan-reynolds-responded-again-to-rumors-of-blake-lively-split", "title": "Ryan Reynolds Responded to Rumors He and Blake Lively Are Splitting With a Mom Joke", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Ryan Reynolds responded to rumors he and Blake Lively are splitting again\u2026this time with a joke about his mom.
