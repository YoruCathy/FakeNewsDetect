She's my idea of perfection. I knew that if she wanted me, we would be together forever.\u201d\n\nThey later met at a Manchester United soccer players\u2019 lounge, where it was love at first sight\u2014although Victoria later admitted she was a little tipsy at the time.\n\nThe couple married in 1999 and had four children; sons Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. The pair have also forged a successful brand over their almost 20-year marriage, with Victoria starting a successful fashion label after attempting a less-than-stellar solo music career.\n\nHowever, it hasn\u2019t all been so rosy. The couple have endured a number of accusations of infidelity on David\u2019s behalf, including from his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2004.\n\nThe couple\u2019s former nanny, Abbie Gibson, came forward in 2005 to stay their marriage was a sham, a claim hotly disputed by the Beckhams.\n\nDavid retired from professional soccer in 2013, playing his final game in boots with the names of his wife and children stitched on to them.\n\nHe has consistently ranked among the highest earners in the sport. His net worth as of March 2017 is $450 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth\u2014a number which Victoria matches through her own earnings.\n\nAs their marriage nears the two decade mark, we look back at the couple\u2019s best moments. From spray-tanned party animals to chic and professional parents, these pictures show just how far they\u2019ve come.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/08/intro.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/06/08/1998-01-rtratup.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/06/08/1998-09-rtrxi88.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/06/08/1998-07-rtxi6yi.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/06/08/intro.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/06/08/1998-01-rtratu1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/08/intro.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802/http://www.newsweek.com/david-and-victoria-beckham-romance-pictures-967453", "title": "David and Victoria Beckham: A Romance in Pictures", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "david beckham, victoria beckham, beckham family, marriage, romance, spice girls, soccer, relationship, photos, picture", "fb": {"app_id": 245537789135954, "pages": 18343191100}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180611175802/http://www.newsweek.com/david-and-victoria-beckham-romance-pictures-967453", "title": "See the Beckhams' 20-year romance in pictures", "description": "\u201cThat\u2019s the girl for me and I'm going to get her!
