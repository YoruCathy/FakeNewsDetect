Most notably, there is the Hillsong NYC, which opened in New York in 2010, the Guardian reported.\n\nThe church is led by \u201crock star preacher\u201d Carl Lentz who spoke of bringing Bieber to salvation in that GQ piece and who shadowed him on his tour of Australia in March. Pastor Carl, as he is known, said Bieber got down on his knees \u201cravaged by loss\u201d and sobbed: \u201cI want to know Jesus.\u201d\n\nIn early July, Bieber, who has a \u201cSon of God\u201d tattoo across his chest, attended the annual Hillsong conference in Sydney, Australia with Pastor Carl, the Daily Mail reported. He secretly arrived via private plane for the three-day event and appeared \u201cin happy spirits.\u201d\n\nThe source told Australia Today: \u201cWe know that he was in (Australia) a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Bieber is very close to \u201ca lot of the Hillsong people.\u201d However the source conceded it\u2019s not yet certain whether Bieber is looking to partner with the Hillsong people in some way, or is considering some \u201creligious activity on his own,\u201d including \u201cstarting his own church.\u201d\n\nSo, the Belieber community will just have to wait and see but maybe they\u2019ll soon be hearing from Pastor Justin.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bieber.jpg?w=1024&h=668", "http://thumbnail.newsinc.com/32740886.sf.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bieber.jpg?w=1024&h=668", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
