This time around Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani are the show\u2019s coaches. Gwen\u2019s return as a coach should be interesting now that she and Blake are further into their relationship. There are reports that this has had an effect on their contracts with The Voice and what the couple is planning next for their relationship.\n\nCurious about what\u2019s going on between them? Here are 10 things we know about their relationship.\n\n1. They have recently released music about their divorces\n\nMiranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images\n\nGwen and Blake were both recently divorced when they got together. Blake got a divorce from Miranda Lambert. And his new album, If I\u2019m Honest, purposely starts off with a party song and then goes into sadder music, a transition that reflects his personal life. \u201cThat\u2019s when it became painfully obvious that it wasn\u2019t going to work out in my \u00admarriage,\u201d he told Billboard. Although the singer has made a new album about the end of the relationship, there is still mystery surrounding what caused the divorce.\n\nGwen had a messy divorce from Gavin Rossdale after she reportedly found out he cheated. She came out with a new album that includes a single titled, \u201cUsed To Love You.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really a life-saver record for me,\u201d she told Time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, \u2018God gave me a gift. I\u2019m going to use it now. Because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to die.'\u201d\n\n2. Blake\u2019s divorce announcement on The Voice brought them closer\n\nGwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani, Craig Wayne Boyd, and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC\n\nWhen the two started working together they had no clue they were both going through the same thing. Then, Blake decided to announce his divorce.\n\n\u201cWe were all mic-ed up and everything, and Blake\u2019s like, \u2018I gotta talk to you guys.\u2019 And he basically made his announcement,\u201d Gwen told Howard Stern. \u201cHe basically told me what was going on with him. We just started this friendship. I wasn\u2019t trying to start a relationship. I was just trying to not die. There was no plan. It was an incredible gift to be able to have a friend.\u201d\n\n3. Gwen had no clue who Blake was before going on the show\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC\n\nThis is probably the case for many fans of The Voice who aren\u2019t country music lovers. But it\u2019s a little more surprising for someone in the industry to admit. Gwen revealed on Late Night with Seth Meyers, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that Blake Shelton existed in the world! I had no idea.\u201d She also had no clue what he sounded like.\n\nHe sent me this song in an email, and I was so scared because at that point I really didn\u2019t know even what his voice really sounded like. Like, I\u2019d heard it on the show, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I was like, \u2018Whatever, country guy\u2019s on. When\u2019s Pharrell coming on?\u2019\n\n4. They didn\u2019t confirm they were dating until November 2015\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC\n\nIn the beginning, there were rumors the two were dating, but they still kept it secret. Still, it was badly kept because there were photos of them getting cozy together at a Halloween party. Finally, in November, Blake\u2019s rep confirmed they were dating to E! News.\n\n\n\n5. Gwen and Blake are actually working like a team this season\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC\n\nIt seemed unclear whether the couple\u2019s romantic relationship would make them more competitive with each other or whether they would work together. It looks like the latter will be happening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be driving home at night, and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Do you think I should put these two people against each other?\u2019 and he\u2019ll be like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah,'\u201d Gwen revealed to ET. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t believe you! I think you\u2019re trying to trick me right now!'\u201d\n\n6. They\u2019re reportedly being paid more because of their relationship\n\nBlake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Adam Levine, and Alicia Keys on The Voice | NBC\n\nIt\u2019s possible The Voice might see a ratings boost from fans hoping to get a look into the couple\u2019s relationship on the show. Because of this, they are reportedly getting paid more.\n\n\u201c[Blake and Gwen] are getting paid an exceptional bonus that is significantly higher than the other judges to keep the spark alive on-camera,\u201d a production source told Radar Online. \u201cThe producers really want to see Gwen and Blake in competition more often this upcoming season, versus working with each other like they have in the past.\u201d\n\n7. But they do have a breakup clause in their contracts\n\nGwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC\n\nOf course there is a risk this plan could backfire. Instead of the couple being cute on screen, they could end up breaking up and might not want to work with each other. Well, the producers have a safety net in place in case of a break-up.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, there is a stipulation in their contract, which is more of a break-up clause,\u201d the production source told Radar Online. \u201cIf, for some reason, they call it quits, they are both required to finish out the remainder of their existing contracts.\u201d\n\n8. They have reportedly already finalized their wedding plans\n\nBlake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images Blake Shelton performs on the Honda Stage at the iHeartRadio Theater. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThis couple is all in when it comes to their relationship. They reportedly have already made their wedding arrangements. \u201cThey\u2019ve met with vendors,\u201d a source told Us Weekly in 2016. The source also claimed they want to get married \u201cbefore the end of the year.\u201d So even though we didn\u2019t see a 2016 wedding, one might be on the horizon.\n\n\n\n9. It will reportedly be a $3 million Beverly Hills wedding\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People\u2019s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton backstage at the People\u2019s Choice Awards 2017 | Christopher Polk/Getty Images\n\nThere have been reports the couple decided to get married in Beverly Hills on May 5, 2017. According to OK! Magazine, they sent out invitations that said the ceremony would be at the Church of the Good Shepherd. Other stars, including Mark Wahlberg, Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland, have gotten hitched there previously.\n\n10.

However, it looks like those plans are on hold. According to Life & Style, they want to do one more thing first.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to have a baby first,\u201d a source close to Gwen revealed. \u201cThat\u2019s their main focus right now. She\u2019s determined to have another baby and carry it herself, even though Blake has said it doesn\u2019t matter if they adopt or get a surrogate.\u201d This actually might be a challenging endeavor considering Gwen had her three kids through vitro treatments. \u201cPhysically and emotionally, it was just a lot for her,\u201d continued the source. \u201cSo she\u2019s trying to get pregnant naturally for the time being.\u201d\n\nFollow Nicole Weaver on Twitter @nikkibernice\n\nCheck out Entertainment Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Gwen-Stefani.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/gwen-stefani-the-voice-season-7-640x360.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/the-voice.png?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-1024x720.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Gwen-Stefani-.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gwen-stefani-craig-blake-shelton-the-voice-1.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Gwen-Stefani-and-Blake-Shelton-Peoples-Choice-Awards-1.jpg?x62514", "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-1024x720.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-the-voice-1.jpg?x62514", "http://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-voice-season-12.jpg?x62514", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/go-ahead-and-break-my-heart-blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-lifeunderaluckystar-kriscondebolos.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-and-Miranda-Lambert-1.jpg?x62514"], "top_img": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-1024x720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-voice-things-we-know-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship.html/", "title": "'The Voice': 10 Things We Know About Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton's Relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-voice-things-we-know-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "The couple is back for Season 12 of \"The Voice.\" Find out what they have in store for the upcoming season and their relationship.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'The Voice': 10 Things We Know About Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton's Relationship", "description": "The couple is back for Season 12 of \"The Voice.\" Find out what they have in store for the upcoming season and their relationship.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-voice-things-we-know-about-gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-relationship.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "updated_time": "2017-08-04T14:10:04-04:00", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-1024x720.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "The Voice", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-08-04T14:10:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-04T14:10:04-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The couple is back for Season 12 of \"The Voice.\" Find out what they have in store for the upcoming season and their relationship.", "title": "'The Voice': 10 Things We Know About Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton's Relationship", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Blake-Shelton-1024x720.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501870200.0, "source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
