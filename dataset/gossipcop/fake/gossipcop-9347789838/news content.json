Her two and a half year relationship with Matthew Rutler appears to be solid and happy, but Star magazine claims that this is only smoke and mirrors. A source reveals, \u201cTheir relationship is convenient. It was always casual, very on and off, and not something Christina saw a future in.\u201d The magazine further alleges that Aguilera is \u201cready for a new man\u201d and that she\u2019s \u201calready on the prowl for a replacement.\u201d\n\nAguilera\u2019s temporary departure from The Voice signaled a massive change in her career. Not only did she regain the humungous success she once had, but she also built a completely new fan base from scratch. Aguilera has also been steadfast in her romantic affairs, but there\u2019s still an opportunity for artistic ambition to give her relationship with Rutler a death blow.\n\nThis is, however, highly unlikely.\n\nThe source continues, \u201cChristina plans on being \u2018officially\u2019 single by the time she begins promoting her new album and tour. She\u2019s wasting no time setting her sights on a number of eligible bachelors. [She] wants an A-list boyfriend to complement her newfound confidence. All that\u2019s missing is a hot, headline-stealing man on her arm. She\u2019s already compiled a wish list that includes Colin Farrell and Jared Leto.\u201d\n\nAguilera\u2019s pop ballads speak of heartache and forlorn memories, so we doubt she\u2019d put this spell on Rutler, especially since they\u2019ve been dating for as long as Taylor Swift\u2019s career.\n\nIt\u2019s up to you to decide whether there\u2019s any veracity to this story. What do you think? Do you think Aguilera is about to kick Rutler to the curb and headhunt a hot one?
