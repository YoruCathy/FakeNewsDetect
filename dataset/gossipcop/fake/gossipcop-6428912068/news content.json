As he has four other kids to support, \u201cBritney feels as if she is paying for them also,\u201d the insider says. \u201cHis rapping and DJ\u2019ing don\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d And neither will Spears \u2014 or her dad. \u201cJamie isn\u2019t going to meet an outrageous demand,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe knows how important the kids are to Britney and won\u2019t allow her to lose them.
