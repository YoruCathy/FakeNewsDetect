A new report claims Caitlyn Jenner is gifting her $50,000 for a \u2018full mommy makeover\u2019 as a push present.\n\nKylie Jenner, 20, has been keeping her baby bump under wraps (literally), but after giving birth, she might emerge looking just like her pre-pregnancy self. That is, with the help of a possible gift from Caitlyn Jenner, 68, who is reportedly going to give her daughter a $50,000 coupon for plastic surgery as a push present. \u201cEver since Caitlyn transitioned, the only thing they have in common is makeup and cosmetic procedures, so this gift is Caitlyn\u2019s warped way of bonding,\u201d a source close to Kylie told Star magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s promised Kylie that she would pay for a full mommy makeover: tummy tuck, breast lift and as much liposuction as she wants!\u201d However, don\u2019t hold your breath for this to actually happen. A rep for Caitlyn tells HollywoodLife.com that this isn\u2019t true.\n\nThe 20-year-old is due to give birth in February, but we haven\u2019t seen much of her baby bump throughout her pregnancy (unless you count those leaked pics from September). She starred in a Calvin Klein ad campaign with her sisters, including an already pregnant Khloe Kardashian, and while Koko flaunted her tummy in a bra and underwear, Kylie managed to keep her stomach hidden with the strategic placing of props and blankets.\n\nKylie is seemingly making it through her entire pregnancy without the public ever seeing her look any different than her pre-pregnant self. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing. As we\u2019ve previously reported, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star has been having trouble with accepting her changing body. \u201cHer body is changing and she\u2019s very self-conscious about it,\u201d a source close to the star shared with People in November. \u201cShe\u2019s always been insecure that she\u2019s not as curvy or pretty as her sisters.\u201d We don\u2019t think the youngest KarJenner sister has anything to worry about, but the relationship people have with their own bodies tends to be complicated, and Kylie\u2019s feelings about her own stomach are entirely valid.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Caitlyn\u2019s reported push present for Kylie?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/caitlyn-jenner-kylie-push-present-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F24%2Fcaitlyn-jenner-kylie-plastic-surgery-push-present-baby-gift%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2961938&comment_count=3", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/caitlyn-jenner-kylie-push-present-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/24/caitlyn-jenner-kylie-plastic-surgery-push-present-baby-gift/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Reportedly Giving Kylie A $50K Push Present To Get Plastic Surgery After Birth", "meta_data": {"description": "Caitlyn Jenner is reportedly giving Kylie Jenner a $50,000 push present to get plastic surgery after giving birth.", "news_keywords": "Caitlyn Jenner, Kylie Jenner", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Reportedly Giving Kylie A $50K Push Present To Get Plastic Surgery After Birth", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/24/caitlyn-jenner-kylie-plastic-surgery-push-present-baby-gift/", "description": "Will Kylie Jenner get plastic surgery after giving birth?
