Arriving for an interview at a West Hollywood hotel suite to promote By the Sea, her upcoming movie with Pitt, she\u2019s trailed only by a lone bodyguard\u2014she doesn\u2019t employ a manager or even a publicist. A few weeks earlier, photos of the Jolie-Pitt clan\u2019s visit to a Subway in Glendale, California, had been splashed across multiple websites (\u201cThey\u2019re just like us!\u201d), but the trip from which Jolie Pitt has returned just before the interview\u2014an outing to a lakeside retreat the couple owns near Pitt\u2019s hometown of Springfield, Missouri\u2014had gone entirely unnoticed. (\u201cIt\u2019s a real Midwestern family kind of place,\u201d says Tom Brokaw, who got to know Jolie Pitt during the making of her most recent film, Unbroken. \u201cHis whole family comes down, cousins, you name it.\u201d) Likewise, the couple\u2019s wedding ceremony at their ch\u00e2teau in the south of France in August 2014 was not followed by a romantic getaway featuring the typical telescopic paparazzi shots of sunbathing on a yacht. The two went back to work almost immediately, shooting the new film together on a tiny island in Malta, \u201cwhile our children ran around the set,\u201d says Pitt. \u201cThat this became our honeymoon is just f\u2014ing funny.\u201d WSJ. Magazine November 2015 All this under-the-radar normalcy would not be noteworthy in the least if the two stars weren\u2019t the most staggeringly high-profile Hollywood couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (except with only three divorces between them and not nearly as much booze or bling). This month, in By the Sea, they\u2019ll appear together for the first time in a decade, since the action-packed romp Mr. and Mrs. Smith introduced them to the world as a couple onscreen and (subsequently, they insist) off. Though the new film, by Jolie Pitt\u2019s own account, is a \u201csmall\u201d one, it will likely attract a lot of interest in the media juggernaut known as Brangelina\u2014especially since the story involves a couple whose marriage is in deep crisis. The movie, set in an isolated seaside hotel in France, lays them emotionally bare in a way they\u2019ve rarely been seen before, and certainly not together. \u201cIt was not easy,\u201d says Jolie Pitt. \u201cWe just had to be brave and say, \u2018OK, honey, we\u2019re strong enough to do this; let\u2019s somehow use this to make us stronger.\u2019 \u201d Jolie Pitt wrote the script, her first, not long after her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died in 2007. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know if I could make film and I didn\u2019t think I could write film, so I wrote with a certain amount of freedom,\u201d she says. \u201cI gave myself the task that it would be about grief and how different people react to and process it.\u201d In one scene, the local barkeep (played by a remarkable French actor, Niels Arestrup) talks to Pitt\u2019s character, who is trying to restart a foundering writing career, about forcing himself to love his terminally ill wife enough to let her go. \u201cThat\u2019s me speaking about my mother,\u201d Jolie Pitt says. \u201cI think maybe his character came from the purest place inside me.\u201d The actress-writer-director Angelina Jolie Pitt occupies a rarefied station in contemporary culture, at once a Hollywood icon and compassionate humanitarian. A film by MediaStorm The most difficult scenes of the film were made harder by the fact that \u201cwe had to stay in our corners, like boxers, and not be husband and wife,\u201d Jolie Pitt says. \u201cIt was very hard to do those scenes without Brad and I taking care of each other. Normally in between takes, you\u2019d make sure that the other\u2019s OK, but we had to be able to really get ugly.\u201d At the end of the day, she adds, it was the kids who kept them from staying in character. \u201cThat might have been an absolute disaster. But as soon as we got home, it was bedtime stories, children\u2019s needs and problems, the fights they\u2019d had during the day. We had to immediately snap back to something that was uniting and positive and loving.\u201d WSJ. Magazine 2015 Innovators Angelina Jolie Pitt\n\nRichard Serra\n\nKarl Ove Knausgaard\n\nMiuccia Prada\n\nThomas Heatherwick\n\nStewart Butterfield\n\nMark Parker For Pitt,By the Sea marked the first time he\u2019d been directed by a woman, let alone his own wife, but he professes not to see the difference. The main thing, he says, is that the director has \u201cthe reins on the story and taste in the telling\u201d so that the actors have \u201cfreedom to explore.\u201d In his case, he adds, \u201cMy director has an elegant intuition for character. And anyway, I trust her with my life.\u201d Occasionally, though, their husband-wife ease on set was a double-edged sword. \u201cBeing a couple, we have that shorthand that can be communicated in a look. Conversely, it means I knew immediately if she felt a take stunk.\u201d If By the Sea\u2014the third feature film Jolie Pitt has directed\u2014could not be further in intent or plot from the couple\u2019s comic debut, it\u2019s consistent with Jolie Pitt\u2019s pattern of taking on risky projects. As a director and screenwriter, she came out of the box in 2011 with In the Land of Blood and Honey, a romantic drama set in a place\u20141990s war-torn Bosnia\u2014most Americans had managed to ignore. As a rule, actors who direct for the first time tend toward slightly less complicated fare; even Tom Hanks went with a comedy/drama about a one-hit-wonder rock band in the 1960s. Jolie Pitt\u2019s period piece touched on issues of rape and captivity, was cast with local unknowns and was filmed simultaneously in Bosnian and English. Though ultimately well received, the film was hardly an obvious bet. \u201cShe called me to take a look at the script and after about 25 pages, I remember thinking, Wait, I have to go back and read this again,\u201d says Graham King, the Oscar-winning producer (The Departed, Argo) who ended up investing in and producing the film with Jolie Pitt. \u201cI did not expect Bosnia. It was an extremely bold choice for a first-time screenwriter.\u201d ON POINT | Porselli sweater, price upon request, Porselli, Milan, Wolford tights, $53, wolford.com, Repetto bodysuit, $50, and shoes, $64, repetto.com Likewise, she campaigned hard to direct 2014\u2019s Unbroken, the film based on Laura Hillenbrand\u2019s best-selling bio of Olympic runner and war hero Louis Zamperini, despite the fact that the technical issues of filming the air-and-sea sequences would make for an especially brutal shoot. \u201cAngie is not fearless; almost no one is,\u201d says Hillenbrand. \u201cBut she is intrepid and bold and willing to look down her fears and do things anyway.\u201d One of those fears stemmed from the love Jolie Pitt ended up feeling for the subject himself. \u201cThe bond between her and Louis was uncommon between filmmaker and subject, and she was very afraid of not getting Louis\u2019s story right,\u201d Hillenbrand says. \u201cI felt the same enormous sense of obligation when I interviewed him and the other prisoners of war. These are the most painful, personal memories in these men\u2019s lives. But she threw her whole heart and soul into it.\u201d Hillenbrand says she was reassured that her book was in the right hands when Jolie Pitt, whom she now refers to as \u201ca sister,\u201d called to inquire about the uniforms of a high school track team Zamperini had raced against in the 1930s. Hillenbrand, known for her meticulous period research, had no idea what they looked like. \u201cBut I knew from the question that I could relax. It was a pleasing question to get even though it was impossible!\u201d\n\nC\u00e9line dress, $3,250, C\u00e9line Madison Avenue, New York\n\nJolie Pitt was equally painstaking about By the Sea\u2019s 1970s period wardrobe\u2014including her oversize sunglasses, which Pitt\u2019s character, Roland, keeps righting for his wife after she tosses them, a lot, onto tables, a mini pas de deux Jolie Pitt took from their actual marriage. \u201cBrad hates that I always scratch my glasses,\u201d she says, adding that in the film, the gesture shows that Roland still cares for her character, Vanessa. \u201cEven when he wants to punch her in the face, he still fixes her glasses!\u201d In life, Jolie Pitt says, \u201cI wear the same thing every day, very much like now.\u201d As she speaks, she\u2019s in fairly minimalist garb (skinny black pants, a camel jersey T-shirt and camel flats) with equally minimal makeup (a bit of eyeliner) and jewelry (a Cartier tank watch, a diamond-encrusted gold wedding band). The far more self-conscious Vanessa, on the other hand, sports a collection of elaborate negligees and peignoirs, frilly 1970s blouses and midi skirts, and full-on eye makeup, including lashes, which we watch her apply each morning. According to King, Jolie Pitt\u2019s attention to detail extends well beyond wardrobe. When she first approached him about In the Land of Blood and Honey, she was \u201cextraordinarily well prepared,\u201d he says. \u201cShe turned up in my office with the location, photos, storyboards, casting information. The train was leaving the station. When she said, \u2018I\u2019d love for you to produce this movie,\u2019 I was already hooked.\u201d He also came to admire her \u201chands-on\u201d approach. \u201cWhether it\u2019s interviews, photo shoots or directing films, she gets involved herself,\u201d he says. \u201cAngie does not send people into meetings. There\u2019s no manager or agent, no PR. When I first met her I couldn\u2019t believe how accessible she was.\u201d AUTEUR, AUTEUR | \u2018I didn\u2019t know if I could make film and I didn\u2019t think I could write film, so I wrote with a certain amount of freedom,\u2019 Jolie Pitt says of \u2018By the Sea,\u2019 her third movie as director, but the first screenplay she wrote. Haider Ackermann coat, $2,500, haiderackermann.com Even before Blood and Honey and Unbroken, Jolie Pitt was attracted to stories about real-life characters and bravery under all sorts of fire. Mariane Pearl, widow of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan in 2002, was thrilled when Jolie Pitt signed on to play her in A Mighty Heart, a 2007 film adaptation of her memoir. As early as 2004, Jolie Pitt optioned Franklin and Winston, Jon Meacham\u2019s best-selling portrait of the genuine and all-important friendship between Roosevelt and Churchill during World War II. She says Anthony Hopkins has been attached to the project, as Churchill, for years but that she herself has no desire to play a role or direct. \u201cI just wanted to see it get made, because I have a thing for those guys. It would give me an excuse to work on it and be around the characters.\u201d HBO has expressed interest in the project, but more imminent on Jolie Pitt\u2019s to-do list is a film for Netflix, First They Killed My Father, which begins shooting this month. Based on a memoir by Cambodian author and human rights activist Loung Ung, it chronicles her survival under the murderous Khmer Rouge. The whole family will relocate to Cambodia for the shoot, during which Jolie Pitt\u2019s 14-year-old son, Maddox, whom she adopted from Cambodia when he was barely 1 (Pitt subsequently adopted him as well), will help with the research. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sit with me while we watch the videos and re-create such a difficult time in his people\u2019s history,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the whole family understands all that it means to him and to us.\u201d The Cambodian connection is both familial and visceral. Not only is it the place where Jolie Pitt had the \u201cepiphany\u201d that she could be somebody\u2019s mother, but her initial experience in the country (while shooting Lara Croft: Tomb Raider) led to her lasting connection to the United Nations, for which she currently serves as special envoy for refugee issues. \u201cI\u2019d been expecting people who were bitter and unhappy,\u201d she says, \u201cand instead, they were full of light and kindness and humor.\u201d She spent much of the shoot avoiding land mines, meeting land mine victims, learning about refugees. \u201cI thought, There is so much I\u2019m not aware of, and it\u2019s a big world out there and I really need to educate myself.\u201d She came back, did a lot of research and found herself deeply affected by the vast number of people around the world displaced by war. When she asked the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to put together a learning trip (which she paid for herself), she ended up in Tanzania, at a camp where many refugees were missing limbs. \u201cI called my mom from the airport and said, \u2018I am never going to take my life for granted, I\u2019m never going to complain. I want to be a part of this world.\u2019 And not out of pity\u2014I found the people so extraordinary, and I wanted to be around them and learn from their resilience.\u201d\n\nDEEP FOCUS | Jolie Pitt has \u2018never been a person who hides,\u2019 says husband Brad Pitt. \u2018She\u2019s utterly forthcoming and sincere about who she is.\u2019 C\u00e9line dress, $3,250, C\u00e9line Madison Avenue, New York", "images": ["https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV570_1115JO_750V_20151020124823.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV577_1115JO_750V_20151020124954.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LD448_magjol_NS_20151106133933.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV582_1115JO_750V_20151020125058.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV575_1115JO_750V_20151020124935.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV571_1115JO_750V_20151020124849.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV583_1115JO_1000V_20151020125121.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV668_1115_j_G_20151020135521.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LB210_JOLIEC_750V_20151102152454.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV578_1115JO_750V_20151020125014.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LJ111_INNOVA_8H_20151119155258.jpg", "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LC677_magjol_NS_20151105013141.jpg"], "top_img": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV668_1115_j_G_20151020135521.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Reed", "Photographs Peter Lindbergh", "Styling Anastasia Barbieri"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-examined-life-of-angelina-jolie-pitt-1446687750", "title": "The Examined Life of Angelina Jolie Pitt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0", "dj.asn": "i-0b6a", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "page.section": "Article", "page.content.type": "Article", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online", "article.template": "full", "page.site": "wsj", "page.site.product": "WSJ", "page.region": "na,us", "article.id": "SB11429965440205254550404581291282456845812", "article.type": "Experiential", "article.type.display": "In Depth", "article.access": "freeforever", "article.origheadline": "WSJ.
