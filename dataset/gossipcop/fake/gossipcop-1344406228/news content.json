Photo: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nThe moment that makes Taylor Swift\u2019s new album comes roughly two minutes and 30 seconds into \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d the third to last song. She\u2019s claiming to find reconciliation with her greatest foe Kanye West and extend an olive branch, when \u2014 psych! \u2014 she interrupts her own attempt at forgiveness to immediately rescind the offer. Taylor cackles with a confession: It\u2019s all bullshit. \u201cI can\u2019t even say it with a straight face,\u201d she says, cracking herself up. This is what you\u2019ve been waiting for \u2014 finally, Swift has dropped the act. It\u2019s her very own \u201csorry not sorry\u201d bundled in a song that doubles as her harshest critique of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian yet. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d was the warm-up; the rest of the album is a fast ball down the middle. Here are the songs and lines most definitely, unmistakably meant for Kanye and Kim.\n\n\u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d\n\nThere are lines on other songs that speak more broadly to Taylor\u2019s perceived victimization by Kanye, but \u201cTIWWCHNT\u201d turns the tables on her enemy. Here, she\u2019s the attacker. To begin, she sets the scene and rewinds the clock back to the simpler times of last July. Back when she was \u201cthrowing nice big parties,\u201d \u201cjumping to the pool from the balcony,\u201d and enjoying an embarrassment of riches that come with being a pop star so titanic that she seemed untouchable. \u201cFeeling so Gatbsy for that whole year,\u201d she reminiscences about what was meant to be her hiatus. She\u2019s referring specifically to her 2016 Fourth of July party, the last time the court of public opinion largely ruled in her favor.\n\nWeeks later, the party was over when Kardashian exposed Swift on Snapchat for having lied about not approving controversial lyrics about her on Kanye\u2019s song \u201cFamous.\u201d (The one where he calls Tayor a \u201cbitch\u201d and half-jokes that they \u201cmight still have sex.\u201d) Swift has been playing defense ever since and resents it: \u201cSo why\u2019d you have to rain on my whole parade?\u201d she sings.\n\n\u201cIt was so nice being friends again / There I was giving you a second chance / But then you stabbed my back while shaking my hand / And therein lies the issue / Friends don\u2019t try to trick you / Get you on the phone and mind-twist you / And so I took an ax to a mended fence.\u201d\n\nThe history of Swift and Kanye\u2019s feud goes back nearly a decade, when Kanye interrupted her speech at the 2009 VMAs. It was contentious for years, but they eventually made amends and Taylor presented him with the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2015 VMAs. It\u2019s the \u201csecond chance\u201d Taylor refers to. But she concludes that Kanye deceived her when he recorded her without her knowledge in the soundbite heard around the world during their chat about \u201cFamous.\u201d The gloves are off.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not the only friend you\u2019ve lost lately / If only you weren\u2019t so shady.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a low blow, but boy is it good. Swift goes on to take a potshot at Kanye about the dissolution of his friendship with Jay-Z, alluding to the fact that Hov cut him out of his life after Kanye said some shady things about Beyonc\u00e9. (Jay-Z confirmed his bad blood with Kanye on 4:44 earlier this year).\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a toast to my real friends / They don\u2019t care about that he said, she said / And here\u2019s to my baby / He ain\u2019t reading what they call me lately / And here\u2019s to my momma / Had to listen to all this drama / And here\u2019s to you / \u2019Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do / Haha, I can\u2019t even say it with a straight face.\u201d\n\nBut of all Taylor\u2019s digs at Kanye, her subtlest is her best. She makes a play on Kanye\u2019s \u201cRunaway\u201d \u2014 \u201clet\u2019s have a toast for the douchebags\u201d \u2014 and twists his words to praise the only people still standing in her corner through it all: her mom, her man, and her mates. And when she breaks in the middle of trying to praise Kanye. That\u2019s just what he made her do.\n\n\u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d\n\nAt the top of the album, Swift is at her most vindictive. \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d is a \u201cLWYMMD\u201d sequel and it\u2019s also where you\u2019ll find the best line of the album:\n\n\u201cIf a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing.\u201d\n\nTaylor builds to the line by first mentioning a narcissist who loves her and tells her more lies than she tells him. \u201cThis is how the world works / Now all he thinks about is me,\u201d she sings, implying that\u2019s just industry politics. Kanye West, of course, has long been crowned music\u2019s biggest narcissist. She follows that rare expletive-laced missive with \u201cI don\u2019t regret it one bit, \u2019cause he had it coming.\u201d Taylor\u2019s setting the stage for her own reenactment of Chicago. Both lines and others on this song could be interpreted about a number of men she feels have done her wrong \u2014 Kanye, Calvin Harris, Tom Hiddleston \u2014 but it\u2019s the breakdown that lets you know that she\u2019s most perturbed about Kanye.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re burning all the witches, even if you aren\u2019t one / They got their pitchforks and proof / Their receipts and reasons / They\u2019re burning all the witches, even if you aren\u2019t one / So light me up.\u201d\n\nThis whole section is sung in Auto-Tune, Kanye\u2019s much-loved creative device. But Auto-Tune has never really been Taylor\u2019s thing, making her use of it here all the more calculated. \u201cThey\u2019re burning all the witches\u201d appeared as an Easter egg in her \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d video; it\u2019s her way of owning the villainous image she\u2019s been branded with since Kanye and Kim tarnished her reputation. They\u2019ve burned her with their \u201creceipts\u201d (namely Kim\u2019s Snapchat), but she\u2019s happy to go up in flames. In fact, with this song, she\u2019s lighting the match. As her chorus makes crystal clear, she\u2019s still not sorry: \u201cThey say I did something bad / But why\u2019s it feel so good? / Most fun I ever had / And I\u2019d do it over and over and over again if I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnd Game\u201d\n\nThe subject of this song is vaguer than the previous two, but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t still get in a couple well-played digs at Kanye:\n\n\u201cI hit you like bang / We tried to forget it, but we just couldn\u2019t / And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put \u2018em / Reputation precedes me, they told you I\u2019m crazy / I swear I don\u2019t love the drama, it loves me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks / So here\u2019s a truth from my red lips.\u201d\n\nHer last laugh: She raps the whole thing.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/09/09-kim-kardashian-kanye-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/09/09-kim-kardashian-kanye-west.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/09/09-kim-kardashian-kanye-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dee Lockett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/which-lines-on-taylor-swifts-album-diss-kanye-and-kim.html", "title": "The Songs on Taylor Swift\u2019s Album That Definitely Diss Kanye and Kim", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Songs on Taylor Swift\u2019s Album That Definitely Diss Kanye and Kim", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/which-lines-on-taylor-swifts-album-diss-kanye-and-kim.html", "description": "\u201cFriends don\u2019t try to trick you / Get you on the phone and mind-twist you / And so I took an ax to a mended fence.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/09/09-kim-kardashian-kanye-west.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Which Lines on Taylor Swift\u2019s Album Diss Kanye and Kim?", "description": "\u201cFriends don\u2019t try to trick you / Get you on the phone and mind-twist you / And so I took an ax to a mended fence.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/09/09-kim-kardashian-kanye-west.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-09T18:30:59.387-05:00", "tag": "taylor swift, kanye west, kim kardashian, reputation, music, where's the beef?, vulture homepage lede", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Every line on Taylor Swift\u2019s Reputation about Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, and the \u201cFamous\u201d scandal. .", "sailthru.tags": "taylor swift, kanye west, kim kardashian, reputation, music, where's the beef?, vulture homepage lede", "author": "Dee Lockett", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510270259.387, "source": "http://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
