T\n\nhings quickly heated up after she introduced him to close friends \u2014 including Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux \u2014 at a July 4 party at her home in Austin, Texas.\n\nA month later, Bryan was Sandra\u2019s plus-one at Jennifer and Justin\u2019s surprise wedding.\n\nThen he accompanied her to the L.A. premiere of her new movie, \u201cOur Brand Is Crisis,\u201d which co-stars George.\n\nSandra and her man were also seen holding hands as they strolled the red carpet!\n\n\u201cSandra wouldn\u2019t be willing to face public scrutiny if she wasn\u2019t serious about this guy,\u201d said an insider.\n\nBryan is her first boyfriend in five years and, like her ex-husband, Jesse, he has a bad-boy past \u2014 with The ENQUIRER revealing how some of Sandra\u2019s own close friends have warned her to be cautious!\n\nBryan was picked up on a DUI in 1988, tore up a hotel room in 1990 \u2014 and had an order of protection levied against him by a neighbor who claimed Bryan menaced him in 2012!\n\nBut both Sandra and Bryan have told pals this is the beginning of an exciting new chapter in their lives.\n\nSaid a source: \u201cHe is a true family man, but he has an edge. That\u2019s very appealing to Sandra.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s convinced she\u2019s found the one!\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn-neq0.heartyhosting.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-neq/images/svg/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://cdn-neq0.heartyhosting.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-neq/images/svg/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/www.nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/old_neq/article_images/sandra-bullock-ne-short.jpg?fit=480%2C480&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/24399de577a35bb008327e75da473905?s=64&d=identicon&r=g", "https://cdn-neq0.heartyhosting.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-neq/images/nationalenquirer-logo.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/www.nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/old_neq/article_images/sandra-bullock-ne-short.jpg?resize=540%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/www.nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Hot-pics-feb-2020-jlo-shakira-n.jpg?resize=300%2C194&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/www.nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/old_neq/article_images/sandra-bullock-ne-short.jpg?fit=480%2C480&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["National Enquirer Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/sandra-bullock-bryan-randall-marriage-new-boyfriend/", "title": "Sandra Bullock\u2019s Getting Hitched", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicon/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://cdn-neq0.heartyhosting.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-neq/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "kONM_PqGX8Za53dFcExSTIIPZxxN_S4QtvDlONzzdA0", "description": "Sandra Bullock's Getting Hitched", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sandra Bullock's Getting Hitched", "url": "https://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/sandra-bullock-bryan-randall-marriage-new-boyfriend/", "description": "Sandra Bullock is hearing wedding bells!
