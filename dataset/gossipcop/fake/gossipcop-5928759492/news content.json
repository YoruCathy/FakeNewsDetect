Australian author Liane Moriarty had gone through the process of having a book optioned for a movie or TV series before and had endured the realities of it getting lost in Hollywood development purgatory.\n\nMoriarty, though, had never done business with Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.\n\n\u201cWhen I met with Nicole, she was like, \u2018No, no, no. If we option it, get excited. We don\u2019t option things just for the sake of it. We don\u2019t have time for that,\u2019 \u201d Moriarty said by phone when recalling her midmorning coffee meeting with Kidman in a Sydney suburb about 18 months ago.\n\n\u201cShe kept her word.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoriarty\u2019s 2014 bestseller \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d is now a seven-episode limited series on HBO. And it boasts the Oscar-winning actresses as leads and executive producers.\n\nIt continues in the HBO tradition of drawing marquee feature film stars to the small screen. And it serves as a bit of an antidote to the premium network\u2019s recent tent-pole attraction, \u201cWestworld,\u201d and the unusual religious drama \u201cThe Young Pope.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot since \u2018Big Love\u2019 have we had a drama that is this female-centric,\u201d said Casey Bloys, HBO\u2019s president of programming. \u201cThe issues they get into on the show are things people deal with in life, and it was nice to have this framework to put these stories forward.\u201d\n\nLaura Dern, left, Reese Witherspoon and Shailene Woodley in a scene from HBO\u2019s all-star adaptation of the bestseller \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d (Hilary Bronwyn Gayle / HBO)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe drama, which debuts Sunday, features five women \u2014 Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley and Zo\u00eb Kravitz, in addition to Witherspoon and Kidman \u2014 as mothers of first-graders in a wealthy Northern California community. It\u2019s a setting that lends itself to social satire, replete with fake smiles and a heavy helping of passive aggressiveness in the battle for power and status. There\u2019s even a murder mystery that stitches the story together.\n\nBut underneath the melodrama and moments of acerbic humor are women dealing with private angst, running the gamut of adultery, divorce, volatile marriages, sexual assault and the stresses of motherhood. Beneath all that too is a sense of sisterhood when intense situations call for it.\n\n\u201cIt really delved into a lot of issues that women are dealing with daily that we don\u2019t often see on-screen in this way,\u201d Witherspoon, 40, said on a recent weekday in Pasadena. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not black and white. These aren\u2019t women who are good or bad. We wanted to show the rainbow of the female experience, which I think is sort of absent in Hollywood in a lot of ways.\u201d\n\nKidman affirmed the dearth of nuanced roles for women and said it was symptomatic of a larger systemic issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need great roles,\u201d the 49-year-old actress said. \u201cOur stories are relevant; people do want to hear them. But our stories often get brushed off. Seeing five women front a project is not common \u2014 and it shouldn\u2019t be that way.\u201d\n\nWe wanted to show the rainbow of the female experience, which I think is sort of absent in Hollywood in a lot of ways. Reese Witherspoon, who stars in and executive produced the new HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Witherspoon and Kidman have been proponents of female-driven projects that redefine how women are portrayed through their respective production companies.\n\nWitherspoon\u2019s Pacific Standard, which she co-founded with Bruna Papandrea in 2012, has been behind such female-led movies as \u201cWild,\u201d \u201cGone Girl\u201d and \u201cHot Pursuit.\u201d Kidman\u2019s Blossom Films has spearheaded such films as the low-budget drama \u201cRabbit Hole,\u201d the romantic comedy \u201cMonte Carlo\u201d and the family drama \u201cThe Family Fang.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThese women are trailblazers,\u201d Woodley, 25, said of her costars. \u201cThey made \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 because they were sick of reading scripts that didn\u2019t honor women and womanhood. That has been really inspirational for me. I kind of joke now, like, \u2018If I don\u2019t start a production company soon, man, I\u2019m going to be throwing away all this beauty I\u2019ve been given in the form of learning from Reese and Nicole.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBig Little Lies\u201d went from book club page-turner to star-studded TV series all because Witherspoon and Kidman had been looking for a project on which to collaborate. The actresses knew each other through Papandrea, who had known Kidman since the two were teenagers.\n\nIf I don\u2019t start a production company soon, man, I\u2019m going to be throwing away all this beauty I\u2019ve been given in the form of learning from Reese and Nicole. Shailene Woodley, who stars in the new HBO limited series \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d\n\nWitherspoon and Papandrea were sent a copy of Moriarty\u2019s novel, and it wasn\u2019t long before the latter called Kidman. The actress read it that day in one sitting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt just so happened that Kidman was leaving the next day for Australia, and while there, she met Moriarty for that coffee.\n\n\u201cWe chatted about our kids, we talked about the book,\u201d Kidman said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to make this big sales pitch. We were just two women talking. And I just told her we would get it made. And then Reese and I set out on our mission.\u201d\n\nThat mission included finding the project\u2019s writer and director. Witherspoon said consideration had been given to carrying over the project\u2019s female-empowered sensibility behind the scenes. Kidman had asked Moriarty at their initial meeting if she wanted to write the screenplay; the author declined.\n\nCircumstances and familiarity ultimately resulted in the selection of veteran TV scribe David E. Kelly to write the script and Witherspoon\u2019s \u201cWild\u201d director, Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, to bring it to life on the screen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirector Jean-Marc Vallee, left, and writer-producer David E. Kelley of the upcoming HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nKelley, 60, had just been signed to CAA, which reps both actresses along with their producing banners, so he was proposed as a possible candidate for the job. But it was his knack for balancing drama with humor, more than a business connection, that closed the deal.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, [David] is so deft,\u201d Witherspoon said. \u201cHe wrote the scenes for Nicole so beautifully \u2014 he understood the complexity of her character\u2019s experience, but he also writes hysterical comedic dialogue for my character. To find somebody who does that very well is threading a needle.\u201d\n\nKelley said the biggest challenge of the miniseries was servicing all the characters. In addition to the women, the drama stars Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Adam Scott and James Tupper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon us to get to know these people in order for the stories to be as rich as they can be,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cThat was the biggest challenge, a lot of spinning plates. But the architecture of the book was so sure-footed \u2014 that made my job easier.\u201d\n\nThe architecture of the book was so sure-footed -- that made my job easier. David E. Kelley, who adapted the 2014 bestseller \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d for TV\n\nVall\u00e9e, meanwhile, had been tapped to direct the first episode almost since the project\u2019s inception. But with a series, it\u2019s common for each episode to have a different director. Witherspoon said they had approached \u2014 and were close to signing \u2014 two female directors for other episodes, but ultimately asked Vall\u00e9e to do the whole series for the sake of continuity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a marathon,\u201d said Vall\u00e9e. The 53-year-old director is gearing up next to shoot all the episodes of HBO\u2019s upcoming Amy Adams drama, \u201cSharp Objects.\u201d \u201cI learned how to train mentally, emotionally and physically, because you\u2019ve got to be Superman. It was basically shooting a very long feature film.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe director was central in bringing the cast together, encouraging the actors to get to know each other outside of work. Witherspoon said they\u2019d often go out to dinner or socialize at her house on the weekends.\n\n\u201cEveryone was able to connect,\u201d Kravitz said of the bonding sessions. \u201cWith Reese and Nicole also being producers, they spent a lot of time with us and were very warm and really wanted our opinion.\u201d\n\nThe conversations were less about finding their characters, Kidman said, and more about how to shift the female narrative.\n\n\u201cThere was enormous love and loyalty and friendship,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019ll find that\u2019s the greatest thing about the series.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most-read Entertainment stories this hour \u00bb\n\nTimes staff writer Sarah Rodman contributed to this report.\n\nyvonne.villarreal@latimes.com\n\nTwitter:
