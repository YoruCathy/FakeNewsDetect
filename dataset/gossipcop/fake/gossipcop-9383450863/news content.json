And he is particularly sensitive about how his wife, Kim Kardashian, is perceived and treated.\n\nThat said, Yeezy has had enough off the \u201cstiff-arm\u201d treatment that Kardashian has received from music royalty Beyonc\u00e9 and, to a lesser extent, her husband Jay-Z. More specifically, according to Celebrity Insider, West is irate by the lack of respect that his former friends have for his wife.\n\nAn insider told the publication that Kanye goes \u201cnuts\u201d thinking about the fact that Queen Bey feels that she is far more talented and is superior to Kardashian.\n\nThis issue is really coming to light now because of the fact that Bey and Jay skipped out on Kanye and Kim K.\u2019s wedding a few years ago \u2013 even though their names were engraved into their designated table \u2014 yet Beyonc\u00e9 was able to go to Serena Williams\u2019 wedding recently.\n\nThe source stated, \u201cIt drives Kanye insane that Beyonc\u00e9 treats Kim like she is inferior and not worthy of her friendship; it infuriates him. Kanye is fiercely protective of his family and feels that by dissing Kim, he is being dissed, too.\u201d\n\nThe family friend said West, contrary to many people, is proud of Kardashian\u2019s accomplishments and wished Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 would recognize that she is a great mother and businesswoman.\n\nThe person elaborates: \u201cAs far as Kanye is concerned, Beyonc\u00e9 has no right to look down her nose at Kim, sure she is a reality TV star, but she is also a wildly successful businesswoman and a self-made multi-millionaire.\u201d\n\nIt has gotten to the point where West will only accept Jay and Bey\u2019s friendship if they are more accommodating to his wife.\n\n\u201cThe way Beyonc\u00e9 has been toward Kim is a bone of contention for Kanye, and when it comes to any future relationship with Jay-Z, it is a real sticking point,\u201d the insider says. \u201cKanye feels that unless Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z are willing to treat his wife with respect, he believes she deserves then he has no desire to make nice with either of them.\u201d\n\nAnother insider told Celebrity Insider that is not about to happen anytime soon. The music superstar does not think much of the reality star and socialite.\n\nOn top of that, it was widely speculated a few years ago that Beyonc\u00e9 was very wary of Kardashian\u2019s intentions, believing that Kim K. was trying to use Queen Bey to gain even wider fame, acceptability and respectability \u2014 which is why some people think she really wanted Beyonc\u00e9 at her and Kanye\u2019s wedding.\n\n\u201cBeyonce has never gelled with Kim, she just doesn\u2019t respect her, or like her, she never has, even before Kim got with Kanye,\u201d the source said. \u201cBeyonce cannot stand the whole reality TV thing, and she thinks Kim would do anything for fame. She just feels they are two different people with nothing in common. Beyonce is always polite to Kim when she sees her, but you can tell it is forced and that there\u2019s no warmth or genuineness in her interactions.\u201d", "images": ["https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/beyonce-and-jay-z.png?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/InShot_20200410_180332260-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-kim-k-e1511273535509.png", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1739-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/InShot_20200416_134048369-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_0371-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2FBAB6DE-BF57-4177-A1FD-6F4255A7703E-1-e1587061407694-380x215.jpeg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ro-logo-18-100.png?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ro-logo-18.png?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/getImgIntranet-1-8-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Terry-Shropshire_avatar_1492395300-164x164.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/jay-z-featured-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Tina-Knowles_Splash-News_getImgIntranet-11-960x624-1-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Goodie-MOB-380x215.png?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Farrah-Franklin-Instagram-Cover.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/getImgIntranet-1-6-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=666484143716324&ev=PageView\r\n&noscript=1", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fcclub.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/kanye-featured-380x215.jpg?x99451", "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/sws2b.jpg?x99451"], "top_img": "https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-kim-k-e1511273535509.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Terry Shropshire"], "canonical_link": "https://rollingout.com/2017/11/21/kanye-infuriated-that-beyonce-and-jay-z-treat-kim-kardashian-disrespectfully/", "title": "Kanye \u2018infuriated\u2019 that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z treat Kim Kardashian disrespectfully", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "google-site-verification": "0Yj3tUrHdnc2yWCwimJKlw92aQSuA-NlLsRRxJ8FFOI", "dailymotion-domain-verification": "dmo4qzl4r7iqtl9wm", "description": "Rap savant Kanye West can be, shall we say, a little temperamental sometimes.
