And now the drama seems worse than ever, as she\u2019s reportedly not wanted inside her baby\u2019s delivery room!\n\nAs Kim Kardashian, 37, has previously admitted, not carrying her third child has been super stressful for her \u2013mainly because the star can\u2019t stand not being \u201cin control,\u201d which we totally get. But apparently, things are only getting MORE challenging for her, as InTouch magazine reports the selfie queen\u2019s surrogate doesn\u2019t want her inside the delivery room at all when she gives birth! \u201cThere will be major tension between them in the delivery room,\u201d an insider told the media outlet. \u201cThe surrogate doesn\u2019t even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice. Everyone is fearful a fight could break out between them!\u201d Click here to see gorgeous pics of celeb baby bumps.\n\nWhy all the hostility? Apparently the surrogate is angry Kim didn\u2019t invite her to the baby shower she threw last month. While Kim claimed she didn\u2019t invite her surrogate to the party because she hadn\u2019t explained to her kids \u2014North West, 4, and Saint West, 2 \u2014 that another woman was carrying their sibling, apparently the REAL reason she didn\u2019t extend an invite was far more selfish. \u201cKim didn\u2019t want her to be the center of attention,\u201d the source told the mag, which reportedly left the woman \u201cfuming.\u201d The negative feelings apparently go both ways though, as Kim doesn\u2019t want the surrogate bonding with her child any more than she already has.\n\n\u201c[Kim] doesn\u2019t want the surrogate to even hold her daughter after she gives birth,\u201d a second source informed the publication. \u201c[She\u2019s] extremely concerned that she won\u2019t bond with the baby because she didn\u2019t carry it.\u201d Apparently Kim\u2019s concerns are very strong too, as she\u2019s reportedly been \u201ccrying on a routine basis because this baby just feels so physically distant from her,\u201d the source explained. On top of that, \u201cShe has been unable to even form a bond with the surrogate.\u201d We have a feeling Kim\u2019s insecurities haven\u2019t been helping the issue either.\n\nThe surrogate is also insisting she give birth in San Diego, which is 120 miles away from Kim and Kanye West\u2018s, 40, home. Kim would prefer to have her deliver in LA at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. However, if the surrogate gets her way, it means Kim and Kanye will have to rush to San Diego at a moment\u2019s notice, which is stressful in itself. \u201cKim can\u2019t stop crying or worrying,\u201d the source said. \u201c\u2026She\u2019s unhappy that things aren\u2019t going her way.\u201d\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think there\u2019s really birthing drama between Kim and her surrogate? Were you surprised to learn Kim didn\u2019t invite her surrogate to the baby shower?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kim-kardashian-surrogate-delivery-room-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2F07%2Fkim-kardashian-surrogate-delivery-room-baby-birth-drama%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2902043&comment_count=4", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kim-kardashian-surrogate-delivery-room-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kim-kardashian-surrogate-delivery-room-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/07/kim-kardashian-surrogate-delivery-room-baby-birth-drama/", "title": "Is Kim Kardashian\u2019s Surrogate Demanding Star Not Be In Delivery Room During The Birth?", "meta_data": {"description": "Having a surrogate hasn't been easy for Kim Kardashian.
