Other fashion-crucial news revolved around Meghan\u2019s sleek silk boatneck gown: it was by the British designer Clare Waight Keller, for Givenchy.\n\nThere was plenty of fairy-tale romantic spark on plain view for a worldwide audience of millions to soak up eagerly: a sotto-voce \u201cYou look amazing\u201d from the groom to his beloved at the altar, the pair hand-holding and gazing deeply into each other\u2019s eyes as the ceremony progressed, the iconic kiss on the sun-dappled steps of the chapel, with the bride\u2019s voluminous veil and long train draped just so.\n\nAs the day\u2019s festivities shaded into twilight, the vibe shifted distinctly in the direction of Hollywood mystique, when a tuxedoed Harry squired Meghan \u2014 now clad in a bare-shouldered halter-type gown \u2014 to an evening reception in a classic Jaguar E-type all-electric convertible, with their wedding date as the license tag.\n\nA royal wedding TV spectacle where the new world met the old and showed a rethinking of the monarchy \u00bb\n\nThat was just one of the ways in which the couple signaled that theirs would be a more modern sort of royal union.\n\nIn marrying into the House of Windsor, Markle, a divorcee who is 36 to Harry\u2019s 33, provided an invigorating jolt not only to the royal family, but to a Twitterverse that suddenly sat up and took notice, in what were the wee hours in much of America, that this was perhaps not a staid, standard-issue royal ceremonial occasion.\n\nThat realization took hold when the Most Rev. Michael Bruce Curry, the first African American to lead the Church of England\u2019s American cousin, the Episcopal Church, stepped up to the pulpit to deliver a stirring wedding address probably unlike any ever heard within the chapel\u2019s venerable walls.\n\nSpeaking in the classic cadences of African American preachers \u2014 and in fact specifically invoking the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 Curry turned a predictable paean to romantic love into a powerful call for justice and equality, and in doing so rendered it a pointed commentary for these highly fraught times, in both Britain and the United States.\n\nMeghan Markle arrives for her wedding to Prince Harry.

When love is the way, we actually treat each other \u2014 well, like we are actually family.\u201d\n\nFrom the start of this particular love story, Harry seemed to have sought a life partner outside the normal range of expectations for a senior member of the royal family, even one very unlikely to ascend the throne. (As has been pointed out by many commentators, Harry would only become king if some cruel Game of Thrones-style fate befell not only his grandmother, the 92-year-old queen, and his father, 69-year-old Prince Charles , but also his elder brother William, 35, and William\u2019s three small children, two of whom played a prominent and eye-meltingly adorable role in Saturday\u2019s nuptials.)\n\nHarry dated a series of posh British blondes \u2014 at least two of whom were looking on as Saturday\u2019s vows were recited, in a wholly modern nod to dealing respectfully and civilly with one\u2019s exes \u2014 but wound up smitten by Markle, who came into his life via a mutual friend who thought they might just click.\n\nThey did.\n\nPhotos of the royal wedding bridal party \u00bb\n\nBut back to the ceremony, which went more or less as might be expected in its initial moments. Royal relatives, friends of the bride and groom and celebrities both British and American \u2014 Elton John , Oprah Winfrey, Serena Williams, Idris Elba, George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham, cast members from Markle\u2019s long-running TV drama \u201cSuits\u201d \u2014 mingled in a cocktail-party-without-the-cocktails milieu in the chapel nave.\n\nThe bride\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, a 61-year-old social worker and yoga teacher from Los Angeles, was ushered into the chapel after \u2014 in a break with tradition \u2014 accompanying her daughter by car to the castle from the nearby luxe hotel where they had spent the night.\n\nWomen wearing wedding dresses and signs for Prince Harry are part of the crowd for the royal wedding in Windsor, England, on May 19. Tom Nicholson / EPA/Shutterstock\n\nHarry arrived at the wedding chapel with his brother and best man, William, both of them resplendent in custom-tailored military formalwear from the Blues and Royals, a British cavalry regiment.\n\nThe sight of the two princes striding in tandem a short distance along a castle roadway brought back, for many Britons, a memory of two boys, 15 and just 12, walking 21 years ago behind the coffin of their mother, Princess Diana. Both Harry and William have spoken of their regret that Diana, who died at 36, did not live to see them grow to adulthood and meet their respective brides.\n\nDiana was indeed a ghostly presence at the wedding, but somewhat of an understated and wistful one, in light of child-of-divorce sensibilities that so often persist into adulthood.\n\nPrince Charles, whose 1996 split with Diana was drawn-out, cringemakingly public and highly acrimonious, stepped in at the bride\u2019s request, on the eve of the wedding, to walk Markle down the aisle after her own father, Thomas Markle, bowed out. (His decision followed an ambiguous mix of health issues and a tabloid-fueled scandal over staged paparazzi-style shots of him preparing to travel to Britain.)\n\n\u201cThanks, Pa,\u201d British press reports quoted Harry as saying as Charles settled Markle in her place at the altar next to his son.\n\nSorry, but a wedding \u2014 no matter how royal \u2014 will not create 'Princess Meghan' \u00bb\n\nDiana\u2019s sister Lady Jane Fellowes, who has largely shunned the spotlight since her sister\u2019s death, did the only reading at the ceremony: a passage from the biblical Song of Solomon that the British press said had particular resonance for Diana\u2019s bereaved sons.\n\n\u201cSet me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm,\u201d Lady Jane intoned quietly. \u201cFor love is as strong as death, passion fierce as the grave.\u201d\n\nAnother reminder of Diana was the presence at the wedding of Elton John, who memorably sang at Diana\u2019s funeral \u2014 repurposing his song \u201cCandle in the Wind\u201d with new lyrics \u2014 then refused to perform the song ever again.\n\nKensington Palace said Sir Elton performed at a post-wedding reception in recognition of the \u201cclose connection\u201d with the prince and his family. The celebrity gossip website TMZ said the selection was his 1970 hit \u201cYour Song.\u201d\n\nAmong the crowd of tens of thousands gathered outside the confines of the castle, some felt a particular pride in Markle\u2019s biracial background, thrilling at the sight of her as the couple passed by in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nRuth Maunze, a 48-year-old midwife who moved to Britain from her native Zimbabwe, traveled to Windsor with her friend Beauty Nxumalo, 55, originally from Swaziland.\n\nWhen they heard the strains of American soul singer Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand by Me,\u201d performed by a gospel choir and piped from the chapel \u2014 an arresting counterpoint to the more traditional fare of Handel, Anglican anthems and English choral music \u2014 they sang along.\n\n\u201cI had shivers down my spine,\u201d Maunze said. \u201cAt the end of the day, love conquers all.\u201d\n\nSupport our journalism Already a subscriber?
