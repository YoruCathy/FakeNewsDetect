that was a hell of a run.\"\n\nEarlier this year he also shared a hilarious anecdote about the then Republican candidate when he appeared on The Graham Norton Show.\n\nHe said that Trump offered him a pair of platinum diamond cufflinks as a belated wedding gift on a night out, however the 'expensive' items turned out to be nothing more than cheap fakes.\n\nSheen told Norton that after the discovery \"I just thought, 'what does this say about the man?'\" and described Trump as a \"charlatan\".", "images": ["https://img.rasset.ie/000d141d-614.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=532150710329020&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.rasset.ie/00094c77-1600.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6422572&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1055413517874698&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.rasset.ie/00094c77-500.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=513914798814299&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.rte.ie/static/images/advertising/ad.gif"], "top_img": "https://img.rasset.ie/00094c77-1600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2016/1230/841844-charlie-sheen-faces-backlash-after-trump-death-wish/", "title": "Charlie Sheen defends Trump death wish after backlash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "siteCS": "master", "language": "en", "app-name": "dotie", "fb": {"admins": 100010507681175, "pages": 103898372992206, "app_id": 212765848759773}, "pillar": "entertainment", "description": "Actor Charlie Sheen has defended a Tweet in which expressed his hope that US\u00a0president-elect Donald Trump will be the next celebrity to die.", "topic": "entertainment", "pillarCS": "entertainment", "chapter1": "entertainment", "DC.identifier": "urn:epic:841844", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=355836123, app-argument=rtenewsnow://article:841844", "categories": "Entertainment, Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen", "DC.type": "article", "DC.isPartOf": "urn:epic:350", "section": "Entertainment", "level2": "Entertainment", "safe_ads": "false", "article-type": "newsdocument", "DC.date": "2016-12-30T15:27:52+00:00", "date": "2016-12-30", "sh": {"articleId": 841844}, "og": {"title": "Charlie Sheen defends Trump death wish after backlash", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2016/1230/841844-charlie-sheen-faces-backlash-after-trump-death-wish/", "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/00094c77-1600.jpg", "site_name": "RTE.ie", "description": "Actor Charlie Sheen has defended a Tweet in which expressed his hope that US\u00a0president-elect Donald Trump will be the next celebrity to die.", "published_time": "2016-12-30T14:23:59+00:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rteentertainment/", "published_time": "2016-12-30T14:23:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-12-30T15:27:52+00:00", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Entertainment, Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@rte", "title": "Charlie Sheen defends Trump death wish after backlash", "domain": "rte.ie", "creator": "@rteentertainment", "description": "Actor Charlie Sheen has defended a Tweet in which expressed his hope that US\u00a0president-elect Donald Trump will be the next celebrity to die.", "image": "https://img.rasset.ie/00094c77-1600.jpg"}, "estagid": 33}, "movies": ["//www.youtube.com/embed/dp6BIDCZRic"], "publish_date": 1483107839.0, "source": "http://www.rte.ie", "summary": ""}
