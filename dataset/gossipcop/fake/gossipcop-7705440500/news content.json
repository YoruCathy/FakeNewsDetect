Brad Pitt is reeling over the end of his two-year marriage (and 14-year relationship) with Angelina Jolie, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. According to the insider, the Fight Club hunk\u2019s impending divorce from the Oscar-winning actress, 41, has been a tough pill to swallow.\n\n\u201cHe is beside himself and has been crying. He was completely caught off guard and blindsided and had no idea she would do this,\u201d the source tells Us of Pitt\u2019s fragile emotional state after Jolie filed divorce documents on Monday, September 19.\n\n\u201cAngelina filed the court papers a minute before the courts closed on Monday night,\u201d the insider explains of the Maleficent star\u2019s tactful filing. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a lawyer or anything. She had threatened divorce in the past but he did not think she would file this time.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cHe is completely devastated and beside himself. He is a shattered man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely upset,\u201d another source tells Us. \u201cBut he is totally focused on just being helpful and making sure his kids are doing as well as possible.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Jolie cited irreconcilable differences in her divorce docs. The humanitarian and actress is requesting sole physical custody of their six kids, Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8. The divorce filings indicate that she requested Pitt receive joint legal custody. She is not asking for spousal support.\n\nA third insider previously told Us that Jolie\u2019s decision to part ways with the World War Z actor \u201cwas only made one week ago.\u201d\n\nDays after the shocking news of Brangelina\u2019s demise broke, it was reported that Pitt, 52, was being investigated for child abuse by the FBI following an incident (caught on tape, an insider told Us) that occurred on the former couple\u2019s private plane.\n\nAccording to multiple insiders, the dad of six can be seen on video \u201clooking drunk\u201d and \u201cyelling.\u201d The footage is reportedly from Wednesday, September 14, after the family\u2019s jet stopped for fuel at Minnesota\u2019s International Falls Airport during their flight from Nice, France, to Burbank, California.\n\n\u201cIn response to your inquiry regarding allegations within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; specifically, an aircraft carrying Mr. Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,\u201d the FBI told Us in a statement on Thursday. (The FBI has jurisdiction over the situation because the alleged incident happened in the air.)\n\nEarlier this week, a source told Us that some of Jolie and Pitt\u2019s most contentious fights leading up to their breakup stemmed from their disagreement over opposing parenting styles, among other factors. \u201c[Jolie] did try to make it work, but her kids come first, and she couldn\u2019t let them see Mommy and Daddy like this,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThe fighting got worse, and they disagreed a lot about parenting and a lot of things.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-sad-9342b49d-2e8a-4266-9fc3-d7d914cfca73.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-74ed4e78-10c2-46ca-ac12-bd6f738a60fb.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-sad-f13368f1-cdd1-4e50-8326-0e2613fa1a60.jpg?crop=0px%2C38px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-sad-f13368f1-cdd1-4e50-8326-0e2613fa1a60.jpg?crop=0px%2C38px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-completely-devastated-after-angelina-jolie-split-w441790/", "title": "Brad Pitt \u2018Completely Devastated\u2019 After Angelina Jolie Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Brad Pitt is \u2018completely devastated\u2019 after his surprise split from estranged wife Angelina Jolie, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Is \u2018Completely Devastated\u2019 After Angelina\u2019s Surprise Divorce", "description": "Brad Pitt is \u2018completely devastated\u2019 after his surprise split from estranged wife Angelina Jolie, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-completely-devastated-after-angelina-jolie-split-w441790/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T23:41:38+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-sad-f13368f1-cdd1-4e50-8326-0e2613fa1a60.jpg?crop=0px%2C38px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-sad-f13368f1-cdd1-4e50-8326-0e2613fa1a60.jpg?crop=0px%2C38px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2016-09-23T20:10:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T23:41:38+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Brad Pitt is \u2018completely devastated\u2019 after his surprise split from estranged wife Angelina Jolie, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 details", "title": "Brad Is \u2018Completely Devastated\u2019 After Angelina\u2019s Surprise Divorce", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/brad-pitt-sad-f13368f1-cdd1-4e50-8326-0e2613fa1a60.jpg?crop=0px%2C38px%2C1333px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1474661400.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
