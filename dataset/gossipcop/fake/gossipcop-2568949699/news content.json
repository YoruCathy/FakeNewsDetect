NBC has been a leader for diversity in broadcasting, but recent reports that Hall and Roker will be replaced by former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly are being seen by industry professionals as whitewashing.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, an NBC spokesperson issued a response. \u201cNBC News has a long and proven history as an industry leader in newsroom diversity,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe will continue to engage in the running dialogue we\u2019ve had for many years with the National Association of Black Journalists and other advocacy groups to advance those goals.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, NBC announced that Hall, 46, was leaving NBC and MSNBC. She joined the Today show in 2014 and MSNBC in 2007.\n\n\u201cTamron Hall will be leaving NBC News and MSNBC when her contract expires this month,\u201d the company said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201c[January 31] was her last day as an anchor on both networks. Tamron is an exceptional journalist, we valued and enjoyed her work at Today and MSNBC and hoped that she would decide to stay. We are disappointed that she has chosen to leave, but we wish her all the best.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Today Show's Biggest and Most Memorable Moments\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Hall was told only \u201cminutes before going on air Friday that she and Al were being taken off the show for Megyn Kelly.\u201d Last month, Kelly, 46, announced she was saying goodbye to Fox News after 12 years for a new role at NBC.\n\n\u201cShe was a wreck in commercial breaks and couldn\u2019t believe the company would tell her just before going live on MSNBC,\u201d the source told Us of Hall. \u201cIt was especially surprising after receiving an email of praise from the co-executive producer just days before about how they were No. 1 in the ratings for seven weeks in a row.\u201d\n\nHall released a statement about the matter on Wednesday. \u201cThe last 10 years have been beyond anything I could have imagined, and I\u2019m grateful,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m also very excited about the next chapter. To all my great colleagues, I will miss you and I will be rooting for you.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tamron-hall-zoom-54bcd4ce-2489-441f-a261-a4e4e946dee5.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/today-show-zoom-30b07ae4-3a53-41bd-848a-6c01c21b4833.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tamron-hall-zoom-dfa723a5-280e-4380-a9c1-7044acd1fe20.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1759px%2C922px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tamron-hall-zoom-dfa723a5-280e-4380-a9c1-7044acd1fe20.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1759px%2C922px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nbc-accused-of-whitewashing-after-tamron-halls-exit-w464849/", "title": "NBC Accused of 'Whitewashing' After Tamron Hall's Exit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "The National Association of Black Journalists accused NBC of 'whitewashing' following Tamron Hall's exit \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NBC Accused of 'Whitewashing' After Tamron Hall's Exit", "description": "The National Association of Black Journalists accused NBC of 'whitewashing' following Tamron Hall's exit \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nbc-accused-of-whitewashing-after-tamron-halls-exit-w464849/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:47:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tamron-hall-zoom-dfa723a5-280e-4380-a9c1-7044acd1fe20.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1759px%2C922px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tamron-hall-zoom-dfa723a5-280e-4380-a9c1-7044acd1fe20.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1759px%2C922px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-02-03T17:43:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:47:55+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The National Association of Black Journalists accused NBC of 'whitewashing' following Tamron Hall's exit \u2014 find out more", "title": "NBC Accused of 'Whitewashing' After Tamron Hall's Exit", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tamron-hall-zoom-dfa723a5-280e-4380-a9c1-7044acd1fe20.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1759px%2C922px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1486143799.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
