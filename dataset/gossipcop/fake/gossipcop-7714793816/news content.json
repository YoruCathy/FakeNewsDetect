Jenner Leans On New Girlfriend For Support As She Goes Deaf New arm candy Sophia Hutchins doesn\u2019t judge former Olympian for wearing hearing aids.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner has been spotted sporting hearing aids, sparking fears the transgender star may be heading toward another transition \u2014 deafness, but thankfully, the former Olympian has new girlfriend Sophia Hutchins as a shoulder to lean on.\n\nJenner, 68, was snapped wearing the devices during her recent beach holiday in Mexico with her 21-year-old new trans arm candy.\n\n\u201cCait\u2019s hearing has gotten worse over the years, and she can\u2019t hear much without them,\u201d a source told RadarOnline.com exclusively. \u201cShe\u2019s tried covering them up with her hair, but the beach wind exposed them to the world!\u201d\n\nSophia, a student at California\u2019s Pepperdine University, credits the famous former athlete for inspiring her gender reassignment surgery.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, she\u2019s been totally supportive as Caitlyn struggles with hearing issues.\n\n\u201cSophia doesn\u2019t judge Cait for wearing hearing aids. In fact, she said that she wanted to get a pair just like them when the time comes, which made Cait laugh,\u201d dished the insider.\n\nBut Cait\u2019s fading hearing is no joke to family insiders. \u201cThey\u2019re worried that Cait\u2019s happiness is clouding the bigger issue \u2014 she might be going deaf!\u201d added the source.\n\nAs Radar exclusively reported, things between the two have been heating up for the past few months. Hutchins posted frequent pictures of Jenner\u2019s dog and tell-tale shots about their relationship from the Sherwood Country Club, where her girlfriend was a member and an avid golfer.\n\nHutchins continues to hint her relationship with Jenner is going strong as the younger girlfriend posted another picture with a clue about their romance just last week! She posted an Instagram story where she was hugging Jenner\u2019s dog, Bertha, and captioned the pic \u201ccuddling with my love bug,\u201d on Halloween, the same day Radar exclusively revealed details about their hidden relationship.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
