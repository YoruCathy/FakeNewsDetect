Now, Reese seems ready to wiggle her way into Jen's love life. And, since Reese eventually found love with agent Jim Toth after her marriage to a high-profile actor (Ryan Phillippe,) she thinks Jen should take a page out of her playbook.\n\n\"Reese advised Jen to go for a guy who works behind the scenes rather than another big star whose ego could get in the way of their relationship,\" the tabloid's source said.\n\nThe two actresses have been close friends for years. They recently celebrated Jennifer's 45th birthday together. On that same day, Reese posted a photo of them smiling.\n\nHere's lookin' at you, Jen! Happy Birthday to my gorgeous friend #JenniferGarner who always laughs at my jokes and my bad dance moves! \ud83d\udc6f\ud83d\ude02 Love you! \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude18 A post shared by Reese Witherspoon (@reesewitherspoon) on Apr 17, 2017 at 9:12pm PDT\n\n\"Here's lookin' at you, Jen!

A source told the mag that Jen \"wants to start dating.\" The same report says that Ben isn't dating anyone seriously.\n\nOne thing that a potential suitor needs to understand is that she will always have a soft soft spot in her heart for Ben.\n\n\"These two have so much love for each other,\" a second source told People. \"It's deep.\"'\n\nStill, according to Life & Style's source, \"Jen is finally seeing that there is life after Ben.\"\n\nVideo provided by Wochit Entertainment", "images": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBAuD2n.img?h=405&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=556&y=678", "https://web.vortex.data.msn.com/collect/v1/t.gif?name='Ms.Webi.PageView'&ver='2.1'&appId='JS:MSN'&ext-app-env='prod'&ext-javascript-libver='4.0.0-beta-10'&ext-user-localId='t:3E059AD937B661571D2F947636C960B1'&*baseType='Ms.Content.PageView'&*isJs=False&*title=''&*isLoggedIn=False&*isManual=True&*serverImpressionGuid='9098cd5b-3355-4a66-bd4c-f4a68ad2ee6f'&-ver='1.0'&-impressionGuid='9098cd5b-3355-4a66-bd4c-f4a68ad2ee6f'&-pageName='article'&-uri='http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-sg%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Freese-witherspoon-reportedly-playing-matchmaker-for-jennifer-garner%252Far-BBAyxry%253Fli%253DBBr8zL1'&-referrerUri=''&-pageTags='{\"pg.t\":\"article\"%2C\"pg.p\":\"prime\"%2C\"pg.c\":\"\"%2C\"ex\":\"\"%2C\"rid\":\"9098cd5b33554a66bd4cf4a68ad2ee6f\"%2C\"clid\":\"3E059AD937B661571D2F947636C960B1\"%2C\"clidType\":\"muid\"%2C\"di\":\"3829\"%2C\"partner\":\"Wonderwall\"%2C\"publcat\":\"Whalerock%2BIndustries\"%2C\"cvs\":\"Browser\"%2C\"subcvs\":\"entertainment\"%2C\"entityId\":\"BBAyxry\"%2C\"entitySrc\":\"ar\"%2C\"provid\":\"AA8YSYV\"%2C\"dpt\":\"celebrity\"%2C\"sdpt\":\"\"%2C\"ar\":\"0\"%2C\"dgk\":\"downlevel.pc\"%2C\"imd\":\"0\"%2C\"parentId\":\"BBr8zL1\"%2C\"pgIdx\":\"\"%2C\"pgTot\":\"\"%2C\"anoncknm\":\"\"%2C\"afd\":\"\"%2C\"issso\":\"0\"%2C\"aadState\":\"0\"}'&-behavior=0&-market='en-sg'", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f", "http://static-entertainment-eas-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZ9iZ.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "http://static-entertainment-eas-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/42/4dbd0d.png", "http://sg.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net:80/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyzQZ.img?f=png&h=20&w=20&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f&f=png", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB12Gosc.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=762&y=412", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=637227361442786987&c7=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-sg%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Freese-witherspoon-reportedly-playing-matchmaker-for-jennifer-garner%252Far-BBAyxry%253Fli%253DBBr8zL1&c8=&c9=", "http://static-entertainment-eas-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/d3/9f8e92.gif", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB12HrZs.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=1206&y=1188", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZ9iZ.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZrQ8.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB12Juzj.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=1492&y=559", "http://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=9098cd5b33554a66bd4cf4a68ad2ee6f&rnd=637227361442786987&rf=&tp=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-sg%252Fentertainment%252Fcelebrity%252Freese-witherspoon-reportedly-playing-matchmaker-for-jennifer-garner%252Far-BBAyxry%253Fli%253DBBr8zL1&di=3829&lng=en-sg&activityId=9098cd5b33554a66bd4cf4a68ad2ee6f&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=entertainment&pg.n=article&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&aadState=0", "http://static-entertainment-eas-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif"], "top_img": "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBAuD2n.img?h=405&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=556&y=678", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.wonderwall.com/news/reese-witherspoon-reportedly-playing-matchmaker-jennifer-garner-3005977.article", "title": "Reese Witherspoon reportedly playing matchmaker for Jennifer Garner", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Reese Witherspoon reportedly playing matchmaker for Jennifer Garner", "cq": "passed", "Search.Interest": "Entertainment", "robots": "noindex, nofollow", "description": "Reese Witherspoon wants Jen to date someone behind the scenes.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.msn.com", "summary": ""}
