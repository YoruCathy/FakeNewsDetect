He was one of 23 pitchers to throw a perfect game, and joined the Yankees\u2019 Don Larsen as the only two to fire a no-hitter in the postseason.\n\nHalladay did it for the Phillies in his playoff debut, on Oct. 6, 2010, and came within a fifth-inning walk to the Reds\u2019 Jay Bruce of also being perfect that remarkable evening at Citizens Bank Park. The baseball world was in shock Tuesday after learning of Halladay\u2019s fatal accident, which came only four years after his retirement from the Phillies, his 16-year career prematurely ended by his decision to avoid back surgery.\n\n\u201cWe are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay\u2019s untimely death,\u201d the Phillies said in a statement. \u201cThere are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.\u201d\n\nHalladay recently purchased the A5 ICON, a two-seat, single-engine amphibious plane capable of landing on water, and his Twitter feed was filled with photographs of him flying the aircraft. According to the Pasco County (Fla.) Police Department, the plane went down in the water, about a quarter-mile offshore, and Halladay died in the crash. There was no one else traveling with him.\n\nHalladay\u2019s accident is the latest in a number of plane crashes that have claimed the lives of prominent baseball players. The Pirates\u2019 Roberto Clemente perished while on a relief mission to Nicaragua on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1972, the Yankees\u2019 Thurman Munson crashed while piloting his own plane near his Ohio home, and another Yankee, Cory Lidle, died when his plane collided with a Manhattan apartment building in 2006.\n\n\u201cOur hearts are broken,\u201d said Tony Clark, the union\u2019s executive director and a former player. \u201cRoy Halladay was not just one of the greatest competitors, but was also among the best men in our generation of players.\n\nSubscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\n\n\u201cOur paths crossed many times during our careers, and I can tell you he was among the toughest pitchers I ever faced. But while he never gave in on the mound, he was known in both leagues as an outstanding teammate, a guy who would go out of his way to help other players.\u201d\n\nHalladay, nicknamed \u201cDoc,\u201d was a throwback. As baseball gradually moved to de-emphasize the starting pitcher, he still took pride in going the distance, with 67 complete games, including 20 shutouts. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay also was a three-time 20-game winner, twice during his 12-year stint in Toronto. Halladay will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise\u2019s greatest and most respected players, but even better human being,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cIt is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his impact on baseball, Halladay left a lasting imprint on his Florida community, with the Pasco County Police struggling both to investigate the crash and mourn a friend.\n\n\u201cHe was one in a million,\u201d Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told The Associated Press. \u201cIt is a true loss for us.\u201d\n\nNick Fanti, the former Hauppauge High School pitching standout, fondly remembered Halladay after having him as an instructor at the Phillies\u2019 camp in spring training.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate enough to work with Roy Halladay and can honestly say I\u2019m not only a better baseball player, but a better person off the field for it,\u201d Fanti tweeted. \u201cTo be able to listen to him talk about his process and how he played the game was an honor. Truly a professional and a legend and will be missed.\u201d\n\nHalladay is survived by his wife, Brandy, and two sons, Ryan and Braden.\n\nFormer and current players flocked to Twitter to express their condolences, with Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy summing up a generation\u2019s feelings.\n\n\u201cRoy Halladay was your favorite player\u2019s favorite player,\u201d McCarthy tweeted. \u201cA true ace and a wonderful person. Heartbroken for those who knew him best.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43930890.1587183558!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43934738.1587182425!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43871091.1587184071!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14806359.1510110131!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_456/image.jpeg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43930890.1587183558!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://www.newsday.com/img/newsday/newsdayLogo.svg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.22642050.1556723435!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.22642050.1556723435!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_768/image.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43932012.1587184956!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43931426.1587192932!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43928113.1587186133!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43931106.1587191345!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.22642050.1556723435!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43929075.1587184310!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43933429.1587180362!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43933303.1587179995!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43931493.1587179243!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/preview_115/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.1270476.1509456354!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/mugshot_88/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14806359.1510110131!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.15554637.1513924653!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_456/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14806359.1510110131!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Lennon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/roy-halladay-dead-plane-crash-1.14806071", "title": "Roy Halladay dead in plane crash;
