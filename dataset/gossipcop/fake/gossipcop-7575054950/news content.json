We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how he\u2019s learning how to change diapers from Kim and Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nKylie Jenner, 20, is reportedly due to deliver her first child in just a few months and that\u2019s giving baby daddy Travis Scott, 25, time to learn some hands-on infant care. While most new fathers wouldn\u2019t want to go near stinky diapers, the rapper is willing to give it a try and getting some help from moms Kim, 37, and Kourtney Kardashian, 38. \u201cTravis has asked Kim and some of the other mothers in the Kardashian family how to change diapers, bottle feeding advice and other tips to help him prepare for the arrival of his new baby. As the due date approaches, Kylie is happy with Travis\u2019s commitment to be a hands on daddy and she is impressed with the steps he is taking to prepare himself for the arrival of their baby,\u201d a source close to the Kardashians tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cTravis has reached out to his own family, but it has also given him a chance to connect with Kim and Kourtney who have been helpful with advice and what not to do. While Kourtney has given Travis and Kylie a list of which all organic and natural products with their sensitive baby, Kim was a little more casual with her advice. Kim joked with Travis that as long as he gets out of bed in the middle of the night when the baby starts to cry, he is doing more than many husbands do,\u201d our insider adds.\n\nOnce the infant finally arrives maybe Kylie and Travis will finally open up about this life-changing event. The reality star still hasn\u2019t publicly confirmed her pregnancy and has become a total recluse ever since the baby news broke back in Sept. of 2017. She still hasn\u2019t been photographed with a baby bump because she quit leading her high-profile lifestyle as soon as the baby news hit. The former queen of Instagram even quit posting sexy pics of herself, limiting what few photos she shares to just head shots. As for Travis, he\u2019s keeping fans in the dark as well. In a recent interview with Billboard Magazine , he artfully dodged the baby question by simply answering, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that. They\u2019re just guesses. Let them keep fishing.\u201d Sheesh! Most parents to be can\u2019t wait to share their amazing news with the world. Who would have thought these two would be the opposite.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kylie and Travis will wait until after the baby is born to finally acknowledge that they\u2019re parents?", "images": ["https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dr.-phil-mcgraw-5-things-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-ftr-1.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F15%2Ftravis-scott-changing-diapers-baby-care-kylie-jenner%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2949006&comment_count=6", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-ftr-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/15/travis-scott-changing-diapers-baby-care-kylie-jenner/", "title": "Travis Scott Learning How To Change Diapers From Kim & Kourtney Kardashian & Kylie\u2019s \u2018Impressed\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Travis Scott is learning about diaper changing and baby feeding from Kim Kardashian, and that has pregnant Kylie Jenner impressed.", "news_keywords": "Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Travis Scott Learning How To Change Diapers From Kim & Kourtney Kardashian & Kylie\u2019s \u2018Impressed\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/15/travis-scott-changing-diapers-baby-care-kylie-jenner/", "description": "Travis Scott wants to be a hands-on daddy to Kylie Jenner\u2019s baby.
