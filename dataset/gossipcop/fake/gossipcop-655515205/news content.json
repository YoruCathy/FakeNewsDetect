While fans expect Tay to throw some shade towards her rival with her new album, \u2018Reputation\u2019 will reportedly have no anti-Katy disses at all!\n\nIs this it? Could the longstanding war between Taylor Swift, 27, and Katy Perry, 32, finally be over? It seems that Taylor is ready to move on, as her upcoming album, Reputation, has absolutely no anti-Katy tracks, according to TMZ. Taylor\u2019s new record is \u201cdevoid of hate or trash talking directed at [Katy],\u201d a source tells the publication. Huh. It may be too soon to call Reputation a peace treaty, but if Taylor has refrained from dissing Katy, her sixth album could signal a cease-fire between these warring divas.\n\nWait, what about that Mean Girls reference on \u201cLook What You Made Me Do?\u201d Taylor\u2019s brand new single seems to take a subtle dig at Katy, as Ms. Swift sings \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names/ and yours is in red underlined.\u201d Some fans have compared that line to the movie where Regina George\u2019s picture is in the burn book, with her name underlined in red ink. Katy, back in 2014, warned fans to \u201cwatch out for the Regina George in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d Plus, another Internet Nancy Drew said that the song sounds similar to Peaches\u2019s song \u201cOperate,\u201d which was featured in the movie.\n\nSurely, this means something, right? Well, it may be pure coincidence, as a source tells TMZ that Taylor\u2019s album lyrics have \u201cnothing to do with Mean Girls, Regina George or Katy.\u201d Interesting. With the video for \u201cLWYMMD\u201d dropping during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards \u2013 an event that Katy is hosting, by the way \u2013 fans will see if Taylor has truly decided to give Katy a \u201cpass\u201d on her new album. If that wasn\u2019t enough, sources tell TMZ that \u201csomething big\u201d will happen at the VMAs between Katy and Taylor, and that it \u201cwould not be surprising\u201d if the two appeared on stage together to \u201cpublicly bury the hatchet.\u201d\n\nWatch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing\u2026 \u2014 KATY PERRY (@katyperry) September 9, 2014\n\nWhile Taylor\u2019s reportedly not going after Katy, the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer is not squashing all her beefs. While \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d may not be Taylor\u2019s response to Katy\u2019s \u201cSwish, Swish,\u201d many fans have taken it as a shot at Kanye West, 40, and Kim Kardashian, 36. After all, it was Taylor\u2019s drama over Kanye\u2019s \u201cFamous\u201d that had fans rebranding her as \u201cQueen of the Snakes,\u201d and many have interpreted the lyrics of the song to be a Kanye-diss. However, Kim isn\u2019t really sweating Taylor, as a source close to Kimye EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLiife.com that Taylor\u2019s track isn\u2019t really bothering Kim. On the other hand, \u201cKanye is clearly pissed over the song,\u201d the source said. Uh-oh. One feud may have ended, but another is still going strong.\n\nDo you want to see Taylor and Katy call off their feud, HollywoodLifers? Do you think it\u2019s time?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jason_brow.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/taylor-swift-katy-perry-extending-oliva-branch-ftr.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/prince-william-kate-middleton-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fiona-4.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-baker-and-the-beauty.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F08%2F26%2Fis-taylor-swift-ending-katy-perry-feud-reputation-album-diss%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2758003", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sophie-brussaux-workout-splashnews-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/vitamin-c-serum-senstive-skin.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1575856a.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kaitlynn-carter-miley-split-changed-perception-backgrid-ftt.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/taylor-swift-katy-perry-extending-oliva-branch-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Amelia Edelman", "Nikki Brown", "Vlada Gelman", "Claire Shaffer", "Zack Sharf", "Music", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/26/is-taylor-swift-ending-katy-perry-feud-reputation-album-diss/", "title": "Is Taylor Swift Extending An Olive Branch To Katy Perry?
