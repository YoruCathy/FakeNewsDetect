Kim liked Sel\u2019s photo showing off the new \u2018do and it\u2019s left fans puzzled. Why\u2019s she hanging around her nemesis\u2019 best friend\u2019s Instagram?\n\nBlondes against blonde! Kim Kardashian, 37, more than approves of Selena Gomez\u2018s pretty peroxide hair that she debuted at the 2017 American Music Awards on November 19! Selena, 25, actually posted a photo of her new bombshell look on Instagram right before strutting the red carpet, and five million people liked the photo, including Kim! It can\u2019t be a coincidence that Kim\u2019s liking a photo posted by Taylor Swift\u2018s good friend. Kim and Selena don\u2019t really have a relationship (as far as we know) so it\u2019s a little random that she\u2019d be following her on Instagram. Was this a little shot at her nemesis, Taylor, 27?\n\nWell, maybe Kim\u2019s just giving Selena props for going blonde after she took the same plunge. While Kim kept her signature long, sleek hair and dyed it blonde (with some killer darker roots), Selena styled her in a voluminous bob. With her leather minidress at the American Music Awards, the whole look was very \u201cBad Sandy\u201d at the end of Grease. Taylor\u2019s Reputation style is equally edgy, though she ditched the short, sleek bob for her natural curls.\n\nSomeone else who liked Selena\u2019s Instagram? On-again love Justin Bieber! Justin, 23, was one of the first people to like Selena\u2019s photo, making it clear that he was wild about her beauty transformation. We\u2019re pretty sure this was purely out of love, and had nothing to do with Taylor! Now, if only The Weeknd, 27, could get in on the liking action; that would be interesting!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kim was trying to shade Taylor, or does she just approve of Selena\u2019s new blonde hair?
