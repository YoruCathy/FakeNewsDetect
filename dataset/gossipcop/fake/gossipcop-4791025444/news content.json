Katie Holmes Demands Jamie Foxx Give Up Junk Food Now that they've gone public, the actress has laid down the law.\n\nKatie Holmes won\u2019t take any more of Jamie Foxx\u2019s bad habits! RadarOnline.com has learned the health-conscious actress told her junk food-loving boyfriend that his obsession with fatty snacks has got to go.\n\n\u201cWhen she first started dating Jamie, he made it seem like he was healthy, too, and a nature lover,\u201d an insider told Radar. \u201cThe truth soon came out \u2013 he\u2019s a candy bar-eating closet junkie.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Holmes, 39, is the epitome of good health, and works hard to keep her thin frame. She is a big fan of cycling and yoga, and has even run in the New York City Marathon.\n\n\u201cKatie runs a minimum of three hours a week on the treadmill and she\u2019s athletic to the bone,\u201d the insider added.\n\nHolmes and Foxx, 50, were first linked to each other back in 2013, a year after her high profile divorce from Tom Cruise. They spent years hiding their love, but since going public with their relationship last August, Holmes has dropped the hammer down on the Ray star.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s banned him from eating that stuff, but she\u2019s caught him hoarding cookies and pickles and ketchup for his burgers,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe insider insisted that no matter how hard Holmes\u2019 tactics may seem, she\u2019s really only doing it for Foxx\u2019s own good.\n\n\u201cShe worries about him,\u201d the source concluded. \u201cAfter all, he\u2019s 50!\u201d\n\nDoes Jamie seem out of shape to you?
