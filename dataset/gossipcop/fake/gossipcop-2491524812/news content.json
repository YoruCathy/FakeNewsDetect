Now the site has manufactured a single made-up story involving all three superstars. Gossip Cop can expose this blatant fabrication. In the wake of Gomez making a surprise appearance at Swift\u2019s concert this weekend, the site is pretending to have \u201cexclusive\u201d insight on their friendship. The blog was seemingly inspired to concoct its narrative because Gomez celebrated her bond with Swift during an on-stage speech, in which she declared, \u201cThis person has never ever judged a single decision I\u2019ve made.\u201d To capitalize on the comments, HollywoodLife quotes a so-called \u201csource\u201d as saying, \u201cSelena meant every word she said about Taylor.\u201d This supposed snitch goes on to assert, \u201cTaylor was literally the only one of Selena\u2019s pals who never said anything bad about her getting back with Justin, she\u2019s always just been there for Selena as a supportive and loving friend, no matter what.\u201d While the sentiments are nice, the problem is that they completely contradict what the website has been telling fans for years. Throughout Gomez and Bieber\u2019s years-long, on-and-off relationship, the outlet has repeatedly insisted that Swift objects to the romance. The evidence is still available right on the site itself, and Gossip Cop has gathered some of the headlines in a screengrab below. In 2014, for example, HollywoodLies, as it is nicknamed for its tendency to make-up bogus stories, claimed Swift was giving Gomez an ultimatum, demanding she dump Bieber or their friendship would be over. A few days later, the online publication followed up with a piece about their supposed \u201cicy feud.\u201d In 2015, amid speculation Gomez and Bieber might be reconciling, the blog claimed to have \u201cexclusively learned\u201d Swift was \u201choping Jelena\u2019s rekindled flame burns out real quick.\u201d And in 2016, the outlet maintained Swift was \u201cpushing\u201d Gomez to cut ties with Bieber \u201cfor good.\u201d But in the fall of 2017, HollywoodLies started to change course with a post that claimed Swift wouldn\u2019t \u201cjudge\u201d Gomez for getting back together with Bieber. There, an alleged \u201csource\u201d insisted Swift wasn\u2019t going to let the relationship \u201caffect their friendship negatively, as it might have in the past.\u201d Now the website is ignoring that purported \u201cpast\u201d completely, with its latest piece about how Swift has \u201cnever said anything bad\u201d about Gomez being with Bieber and has been a loyal friend \u201cno matter what.\u201d At no point does the outlet acknowledge how this is inconsistent with the dozens of previous tales in its own archives. This is the result of the publication seemingly making up its articles as it goes along, as opposed to regularly investigating, researching and fact-checking with genuine sources. Gossip Cop, on the other hand, has done a number of stories over the years explaining how HollywoodLies has been wrong with its claims of a Bieber-fueled feud between Gomez and Swift. And on top of Gomez\u2019s own statement about Swift never judging her, the sheer fact that their friendship has continued no matter how many times she and Bieber have gotten back together proves that our debunkings were correct. HollywoodLies\u2019 lack of credibility isn\u2019t just apparent with this particular storyline, but is also clear from the performers\u2019 own comments. In a 2015 interview with Billboard, Gomez bluntly called the site \u201cthe worst,\u201d and has also told fans on Instagram that it is \u201cnever true.\u201d In 2016, Bieber tried to have HollywoodLife shut down, using his social media to deem the blog \u201cuntruthful and hurtful.\u201d Given those remarks and the website\u2019s documented history, there is zero reason to trust that it now has a legitimate \u201csource\u201d waxing poetic about Gomez and Swift\u2019s friendship as it relates to Bieber. Rather, it appears the outlet has once again made it all up.
