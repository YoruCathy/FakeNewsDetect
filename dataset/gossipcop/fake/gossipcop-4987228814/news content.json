Jay-Z has 99 problem but being a weak ass tipper ain\u2019t one! \u2014 Darrel Robinson (@texasdarrel) February 20, 2018\n\nNot even 20% smh \u2014 Morris Fabbri (@MoMoneyMoFabbri) February 20, 2018\n\nThat's only a 13.87% tip, Jay Z. pic.twitter.com/v4cMkKKwSQ \u2014 Rudolf E. Havenstein (@RudyHavenstein) February 21, 2018\n\nService must have sucked,because that isn't even the customary tip of 15% or 21% or Jay-Z was ripped and couldn't figure out 15 or 21% of $91,135 I'll give him that\u2026that's a lot of jet fuel \u26fd\ufe0f \u2014 Jim Hatch (@Troutconsiglier) February 20, 2018\n\nAlthough us Brits are use to seeing a 10-12% service charge on the end of our bill, in America the average tip is based around 15-20%.\n\nNot everyone was up in arms about the tip, with some fans getting excited for the lucky waitress on the receiving end of the thousand dollar cash out.\n\nImagine Jay Z randomly comes to your work 1 day and leaves you that tip, Jesus be my inhaler I would actually pass out. https://t.co/1WTMuBhJsm \u2014 YT: The Focus Group (@manlikekofii) February 19, 2018\n\nimagine waking up thinking you\u2019re gonna have a bad day at work, and getting an $11,100 tip from Jay Z https://t.co/T8lTETkJ9C \u2014 cort\u2741 (@cortneeymariexo) February 20, 2018\n\nJay-Z doing so many bottles in the club last night just made me rethink my profession ? the waitress made a 11 thousand dollar tip wtf \u2014 tatyanaa:*\u2661 (@princesstatyy) February 19, 2018\n\nThe lady (dayhana) that served Jay Z is the real winner here. That tip might be her annual salary. pic.twitter.com/loK4nAnLJy \u2014 Senator Wale Abba (@waleabba) February 21, 2018\n\nJay-Z\u2019s apparent bill first came to light after a server posted the black-and-white receipt on Snapchat, causing the star\u2019s expenditure to go viral.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Playroom NYC commented on the controversy via Instagram saying: \u2018First of all Thank God for everything!!
