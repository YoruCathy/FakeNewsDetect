But the show, which she debuted on May 8, also delivers a surprise song on each tour stop. Swift's nightly choices have run the gamut from fan favorite \"All Too Well\" to career throwback \"Teardrops on My Guitar.\"\n\nWhile most of Swift's performance is based on the main stage, she makes her way back to two smaller B-stages, giving more fans a chance to see her up close. There, she performs \"Shake It Off,\" \"Dancing With Our Hands Tied,\" \"Blank Space\" and \"Dress\" -- as well as the surprise song of the night on acoustic guitar.\n\nBelow, check out the list of all the special songs she's brought to the Reputation Tour B-stage. Luckily, Swifties in the crowd have been quick to upload clips of these rare live cuts.\n\n\"All Too Well\"\n\nGlendale, Ariz., May 8; Pasadena, Calif., May 19; Arlington, Texas, Oct. 6\n\nIt's no secret among Swift fans that the emotional Red stand-out \"All Too Well\" is widely cherished. What better surprise to sprinkle into the set list on the opening night of tour, then? \"I figured...I would play this song you seem to request more than the others,\" she said, introducing the beautiful tearjerker.\n\nA post shared by Simone (@simoneyybaloneyy) on May 9, 2018 at 12:38am PDT\n\n\"Wildest Dreams\"\n\nSanta Clara, Calif., May 11; Tokyo, Japan, Nov. 21\n\nSwift once performed \"Wildest Dreams\" acoustic at a Grammys event, and she brought that raw, impassioned version of the 1989 song to the Reputation Stadium Tour B-stage twice -- first in Santa Clara, then on the final night of tour in Tokyo.\n\nA bit of Wildest Dreams from the 1st night in Santa Clara #repTourSantaClara #TaylorSwift pic.twitter.com/FyUCIyww9i \u2014 Erica Love (@Erica_Love16) May 13, 2018\n\n\"The Best Day\"\n\nSanta Clara, Calif., May 12\n\nOn Mother's Day weekend, Swift gifted her mom -- and, apparently, tour opener Camila Cabello's mom -- with this touching ode to the mother-daughter memories they've made. The sweet Fearless track is one that is rarely performed live.\n\nA post shared by taylor swift fan page (@taylorswift_gorgeous13) on May 13, 2018 at 2:48pm PDT\n\n\"Red\"\n\nPasadena, Calif., May 18\n\nThe Rose Bowl served as inspiration for Swift's B-stage surprise on her first of two nights at the venue. \"Roses are red,\" she mused. Cue an acoustic take on \"Red,\" the title track off of her 2012 album.\n\n\"Holy Ground\"\n\nSeattle, Wash., May 22\n\n\"Holy Ground\" is all about romanticizing the time you've shared with someone -- and an excellent selection to surprise an audience full of longtime, loyal fans with. \"Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through,\" she sings. \"But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you.\"\n\n@taylorswift13 sang Holy Ground in front of me so close she smiled at me she saw my outfit, my heart sign and smiled. I made eye contact.

Based on this clip, the classic from her canon had just about everyone singing along. Will she \"play it again\"?\n\n\"22\"\n\nChicago, June 2; Foxborough, Mass., July 26; Sydney, Australia, Nov. 2\n\nSwift's friend Martha Hunt says she's the one who suggested \"22\" as the surprise song on night two in Chicago, and Swift credited the enthusiastic crowd at her first night in Foxborough for her decision to perform it again. It's not every day that you get \"22\" acoustic, but Swifties got it three times so far on this tour, the most recent of which came during a rain-heavy performance in Sydney.\n\n\"I Knew You Were Trouble\"\n\nManchester, England, June 8\n\nIt's unlikely that the Manchester crowd of Swifties did not know the lyrics to \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" but the pop star offered some advice anyway: \"Even if you don't know the words, it's kind of easy to remember this one part.\" She led them in a practice round of the post-chorus \"oh, oh!\" and went on to deliver an acoustic rendition of the frenetic tune.\n\n\"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\"\n\nManchester, England, June 9\n\nThose who attended the second Taylor Swift stadium show in Manchester were in for a treat: a rare live performance of \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever,\" Swift's 50 Shades duet with Zayn.\n\n\"Mean\"\n\nDublin, Ireland, June 15\n\nPlaying \"Mean\" live is a sure crowd-pleaser, and Swift did just that at the first of two headlining shows in Dublin. Although the song was a mainstay back in her days touring in support of Speak Now and Red, this date marked the debut of \"Mean\" seeing the Reputation Stadium Tour stage.\n\n\"How You Get the Girl\"\n\nDublin, Ireland, June 16\n\n\"If you want to sing along, that would be absolutely glorious,\" Swift encouraged the crowd at her second night at Croke Park. She then smiled her way through a rare, acoustic performance of the 1989 track.\n\n\"So It Goes...\"\n\nLondon, England, June 22\n\nReputation album track \"So It Goes...\" has been noticeably absent from this tour's set list, making Swift's surprise addition to her Wembley Stadium set all the more special. With this acoustic treat, she perhaps hinted at what the song sounded like when she first wrote it.\n\n\"Fifteen\"\n\nLondon, England, June 23\n\nJune 23 marked Swift's fifteenth show on the Reputation Stadium Tour, so what better song to play? The country-pop Fearless single was an early hit for her -- and based on the crowd's reaction, it's still holds a place in fans' hearts.\n\n\"Mine\"\n\nLouisville, Ky., June 30\n\nThe opening track of Speak Now wrapped the June leg of Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour. \"I haven't played this song in so many years, and you're singing it so loud,\" she beamed from the B-stage.\n\n\"Sparks Fly\"\n\nColumbus, Ohio, July 7\n\nKeeping in the tradition of Speak Now, Swift moved onto the pop-country album's second track at her next tour stop. The song, about a classic crush that's so clearly a \"bad idea,\" was written when the singer was a teenager but held its own in a 2018 Taylor Swift set list.\n\n\"State of Grace\"\n\nLandover, Md., July 10\n\nFor the first of two nights in Maryland, Swift harkened back to the \"golden age of something good and right and real\" and the acoustic guitar beginnings of \"State of Grace,\" the opening track on her Red album.\n\nState of Grace + lights ??-- pic.twitter.com/EgJKAnTX6q \u2014 reptourpics (@reptourpics) July 11, 2018\n\n\"Haunted\"\n\nLandover, Md., July 11\n\nThe second Reputation Tour set in Maryland delivered a rare, understated performance of \"Haunted,\" a Speak Now track that hasn't seen Swift's stage much since 2011/2012 -- back when she gave it a decidedly more dramatic treatment.\n\n\"Never Grow Up\"\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa., July 13\n\nBefore strumming the chords of \"Never Grow Up,\" Swift explained that she'd just gone back to visit the nearby farm where she had actually grown up. \"I got especially emotional when I walked into my old bedroom,\" she admitted. She hinted she'd be playing the song with picture of herself in her childhood room on Instagram earlier in the day, and the performance that night took on an especially sentimental tone.\n\n\"Treacherous\"\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa., July 14\n\nAfter some technical difficulties that temporarily left Swift stranded at the main stage rather than floating in her cage over the crowd to the B-stage, she bestowed fans with a highlight from her Red album.\n\n-- | Another clip of Taylor singing Treacherous as the surprise song #repTourPhilly (via @lysst_) pic.twitter.com/Vx0RBjKXra \u2014 Taylor Swift News (@TSwiftNZBU) July 15, 2018\n\n\"Babe\"\n\nCleveland, Ohio, July 17\n\nA concert in Cleveland brought Swift's live debut of \"Babe,\" the Red-era-turned-2018-country-single she penned (with Train's Pat Monahan) that got away -- er, was given away, to Sugarland for their latest album.\n\n\"Welcome to New York\"\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 20\n\nIt was Swift's first show in New Jersey on this tour, but she gave a little shout-out to its neighbor New York with her ode to the loud sounds, bright lights and new beginnings that the big city brings.\n\nTwitter is going to ruin the quality, but here\u2019s welcome to New York!@taylorswift13 @taylornation13 pic.twitter.com/2tqifzR42K \u2014 Bekah (@volcanicheartt) July 21, 2018\n\n\"Fearless\"\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 21\n\nThere's somethin' bout the way a Taylor Swift show feels in the rain, or so they say. Singing in the rain, Swift happily performed the title track of her second album while dancing \"in a storm in my best dress, fearless.\"\n\nFearless in the rain is the most magical thing ? pic.twitter.com/IaD5r16dxA \u2014 taylor videos (@swiftvids_) July 22, 2018\n\n\"Enchanted\"\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 22\n\nDuring her third night at MetLife Stadium, Swift left fans \"Enchanted\" as they sang along to her acoustic take on the Speak Now track. First released in 2010, the song has rarely seen the live stage since 2011, when she was on her tour in support of that album.\n\nThis night is sparkling, don't you let it go --? #repTourMetlifepic.twitter.com/pDEaDyBmxx \u2014 daniela -- (@InviernoDe1989) July 23, 2018\n\n\"Change\"\n\nFoxborough, Mass., July 27\n\nAt the second of three nights playing Gillette Stadium -- which is where Swift had her first-ever stadium concert, back on the Fearless Tour in 2010 -- the star of the show dedicated \"Change\" to a fan she'd met at her meet and greet. That fan had told the singer how much the song meant to her, and it just so happened that Swift had already been thinking of adding it into her set. The stars aligned on this Friday night as the crowd was treated to a song that hasn't been performed live in years.\n\n\"Ours\"\n\nFoxborough, Mass., July 28\n\nSwift whipped out another rarity as the surprise B-stage song for her third and final show at Gillette Stadium: \"Ours.\" This concert date marked her tenth time performing at the stadium, where she was also the first female to ever to headline three shows in a row.\n\n\"Out of the Woods\"\n\nToronto, Aug. 3\n\nFor its tour debut, Swift introduced an emotional second bridge to her acoustic performance of 1989 standout \"Out of the Woods.\" \"Remember when we hit the brakes too soon?\" she called out again. \"Twenty stitches in a hospital room. You started crying, I did too.\"\n\nher out of the woods vocals paid all my bills pic.twitter.com/LqZzCJoYF4 \u2014 SARAH ---- // taylor swift -- (@swiftismydrug) August 4, 2018\n\n\"Come Back... Be Here\"\n\nToronto, Aug. 4\n\nNot only did Toronto get a surprise \"Summer of 69\" duet between Swift and Bryan Adams, but the crowd also got what was seemingly the singer's first-ever live performance of \"Come Back... Be Here,\" an underrated Red album bonus track.\n\nSo if we stop with all the drama for one sec: SHE SANG SO IT GOES!!!!!!!

This special throwback quickly become a favorite out of all the unexpected songs Swift has performed thus far.\n\nA place in this world -- it was absolutely amazing to watch her perform this so close to us @taylorswift13 @taylorswift13 #taylornation #taylorswift #reptourPittsburgh pic.twitter.com/UV5BFt1Kxb \u2014 Kelly Nicholson Reptour 8/7/18 -- (@Kelbe114) August 9, 2018\n\n\"This Love\"\n\nAtlanta, Ga., Aug. 10\n\nDuring the first of a two-night stint in Atlanta, Swift admitted it was the first time she'd ever performed an acoustic cut of \"This Love,\" which she once said was the one 1989 track she kept listening \"back to, over and over and over again.\" In the interview, the singer added, \"It's kind of like hypnotic in a way, and it kind of is somewhat romantic and wistful and relaxing.\"\n\nan acoustic version of this love is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me pic.twitter.com/Lmcu3jP6v1 \u2014 crystal-- (@swiftsmicheIe) August 11, 2018\n\n\"The Lucky One\"\n\nAtlanta, Ga., Aug. 11\n\nIt was back to the era of Red at Swift's second show in Atlanta, where she played \"The Lucky One\" on the B-stage. The song, about the highs and lows of fame, hasn't been heard live recently, though it was a mainstay on the Red Tour.\n\nTaylor singing The Lucky One #repTourAtlanta @taylorswift13 you were amazing last night . ??---- pic.twitter.com/y2AEUstTZm \u2014 CelebSheep (@CelebSheep) August 12, 2018\n\n\"Invisible\"\n\nTampa, Fla., Aug. 14\n\nBringing \"Invisible\" to the stage in 2018 is about as unheard of as it gets from the canon of Taylor Swift. Not only is the song from the era of Swift's debut album, but it's a bonus track from the deluxe version of that album. She reportedly brought \"Invisible\" back to life on a Tuesday in August for a fan who told her the song helped him come out when he was a teenager.\n\ntaylor swift singing invisible in 2018 i\u2019m so blessed pic.twitter.com/gFD0Qsanrc \u2014 taylor swift vocals (@tswiftvocals) August 15, 2018\n\n\"Breathe\"\n\nMiami, Fla., Aug. 18\n\n\"I'm 99 percent sure I've never played this song live,\" Swift admitted before performing \"Breathe,\" a deep cut from her Fearless album. The album recording of the country-pop ballad features vocals from Colbie Caillat, meaning this live solo surprise was a one-of-a-kind thing for fans to experience.\n\n\"Better Man\"\n\nNashville, Aug. 25\n\nSwift says she wanted \"Better Man\" to \"have its own moment,\" and it certainly did -- at the Grammys, the CMAs and at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena, where she treated the crowd to a rare solo performance of the beautiful song that was written by her, but recorded by country group Little Big Town.\n\nI wish you were a Better Man... #repTourNashville pic.twitter.com/NIYJLy1POU \u2014 Taylor Nation (@taylornation13) August 26, 2018\n\n\"Jump Then Fall\"\n\nDetroit, Mich., Aug. 28\n\nThe pop star unveiled the rare gem from the re-release of Fearless in Detroit, marking the first time she performed \"Jump Then Fall\" in eight years. Her delivery of the love song is just as bubbly and bouncy as ever before.\n\n\"Begin Again\"\n\nMinneapolis, Minn., Aug. 31\n\nIn another return to her country roots, Swift strummed a pretty \"Begin Again\" at the first of two nights at U.S. Bank Stadium, the tour stop where she played the closing track from her Red album for the first time in 2018.\n\nAug 31 2018\n\nRep Tour Minneapolis (Night 1). ?

The pop star played in the city back in 2013.\n\n\"I'm Only Me When I'm With You\"\n\nMelbourne, Australia, Oct. 26\n\n\"I wrote this song when I was 13 years old, and it was a bonus track on my first album,\" Swift said before launching into a performance of the track from her self-titled 2006 debut. The song is reportedly about her friend Abigail Anderson, and Swift later was a bridesmaid in her wedding.\n\nTaylor singing \u201cI\u2019m Only Me When I\u2019m With You\u201d on the b-stage! #repTourMelbourne pic.twitter.com/YViF9YWddl \u2014 Taylor Swift Updates (@TSwiftLAMedia) October 26, 2018\n\n\"Starlight\"\n\nBrisbane, Australia, Nov. 6\n\nSwift brought out \"Starlight\" -- from her 2012 AOTY-nominated Red -- on her third date in Australia. She has previously noted that the song was largely inspired by Ethel and Bobby Kennedy's young romance.\n\n\"Out of the Woods\"\n\nAuckland, New Zealand, Nov. 9\n\nCo-written by Jack Antonoff, \"Out of the Woods\" was the sixth official single from 1989 and later peaked at No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100.
