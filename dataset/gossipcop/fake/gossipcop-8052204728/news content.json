Because the show\u2019s first season, which starred Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, spanned 1947 and 1955, viewers worried that it would take at least three or four more seasons until the drama catches up to Charles and Diana\u2019s 1977 meeting, 1981 wedding, and subsequent marriage. But series creator and writer Peter Morgan has revealed that The Crown will tackle the monarchy-marriage drama sooner than expected.\n\nPrincess Diana will be introduced toward the end of Season 3, Morgan confirms in a new interview with People, with Seasons 4 and 5 \u201cheavily\u201d focused on her as one of the main characters. To facilitate the time jump, the series will recast the major roles with older actors who can better portray Elizabeth, Philip, Charles, etc. as they age.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how The Crown, which is very much Team Monarchy, approaches the relationship, which began somewhat informally in 1977 when Charles and Diana met through her sister, whom Charles was dating at the time. When Diana became a princess, the world largely sympathized with her\u2014a deft manipulator of her public image\u2014as opposed to her less-photogenic and less P.R.-savvy husband. But Morgan will likely offer a new, Charles-sympathetic perspective to the royal marriage. In The Queen, for example, Morgan depicted Charles as a responsible and caring father frustrated by the old-fashioned, out-of-touch constraints dictated by the monarchy. And he depicted Diana, at least through Queen Elizabeth\u2019s eyes, as a drama-stirring, attention-hogging, trouble-making headache to the family.\n\nBefore getting to Diana, though, Morgan and Co. are busily filming the show\u2019s second season, which will debut in late 2017 and, according to People, \u201cfeature a greater emphasis on the life of Elizabeth\u2019s husband Prince Philip and introduce a greater role for her oldest son and direct heir, Prince Charles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe start to focus on Charles as a young boy and his education, and on Philip and his backstory,\u201d Morgan told the magazine. Executive producer Suzanne Mackie added, \u201cWe glance backward to Philip\u2019s childhood and his upbringing, and how that might have impacted him as a man, a father and as Prince Consort\u2014which is fascinating.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582e1890364154776b0bab7d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/queen-elizabeth-home-videos-the-crown.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/581ced6502ce22a66b4c6df6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/the-crown-netflix-princess-margaret-peter-townsend-scandal.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582e63437d9aa14f739fa424/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/the-crown-queen-elizabeth-claire-foy.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/583eda31ca6f7ee00ec2921a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/princess-margaret-vanessa-kirby-the-crown.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9875f114d3ca724a0db7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582637517d9aa14f739fa2ba/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Lord-Porchester-Relationship.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9875f114d3ca724a0db8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss01.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582369bbaf70ea5e7082bcd0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Queen-Elizabeth-Prince-Philip-The-Crown.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac98767a51b09e1bf347f7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5db88b725720ea00089a61dd/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Contributor-Julie-Miller-by-Peter-Hapak.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Miller", "Julie Mille", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/princess-diana-charles-the-crown-netflix-marriage", "title": "Netflix\u2019s The Crown Is Already Plotting Diana-Charles Drama", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Julie Miller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Move over, Queen Elizabeth.", "id": "58669e3f12f608c91db97863", "keywords": "television", "news_keywords": "television", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58669e3f12f608c91db97863", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Move over, Queen Elizabeth.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Move over, Queen Elizabeth.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Netflix\u2019s The Crown Is Already Plotting Diana-Charles Drama", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/princess-diana-charles-the-crown-netflix-marriage"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Move over, Queen Elizabeth.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582b7df3ca6f7ee00ec28dc3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/extravagant-weddings-princess-diana-charles.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Netflix\u2019s The Crown Is Already Plotting Diana-Charles Drama"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
