How do you guys ever know? What are the clues?'\n\n\n\n'Well they don't make it obvious like that. That would be creepy if you were like just looking somebody up and down,\u2019 Ellen replied.\n\n\n\n'I don't know how it works,' laughed Jen.\n\n\n\nEllen retorted: 'It's just I don't know, flirty or something. But I do think girls had crushes on you. Well it's too late now!'\n\n\n\n'Yeah,' Jennifer responded, keeping quiet about the news of her split.\n\n\n\nJennifer and Justin, 46 issued a statement via their publicist yesterday confirming they had gone their separate ways late last year.\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nIt read: 'In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.\n\n\n\n'This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\n\n\n\n'Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.\n\n\n\n'Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.'\n\n\n\nThe pair first met on the set Ben Stiller and Jack Black comedy Tropic Thunder in 2007.\n\n\n\nThey met once again on 2012\u2019s Wanderlust and began dating shortly after, before tying the knot in a surprise ceremony at their LA home in August 2015.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23120/jennifer.jpg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23120/jennifer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nadia S"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/jennifer-aniston-dodges-question-about-justin-theroux-during-interview-with-ellen-degeneres", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s emotional interview after split from Justin", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Ever the consummate actress, Jennifer Aniston put her emotions aside to give an interview to Ellen DeGeneres, just one day after news of her split from Justin Theroux broke.", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Aniston Justin Therous split, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux divorce, ellen degeneres, the ellen degeneres show, celebrity splits, celebrity relationships, celebrity divorce, New Idea, new idea australia", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/jennifer-aniston-dodges-question-about-justin-theroux-during-interview-with-ellen-degeneres", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s emotional interview after split from Justin", "description": "Just one day after the sad news broke, Jen put on a very brave face", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23120/jennifer.jpg", "width": 1131, "height": 756}}, "twitter": {"title": "Jennifer Aniston dodges question about Justin Theroux during interview with Ellen DeGeneres", "description": "Ever the consummate actress, Jennifer Aniston put her emotions aside to give an interview to Ellen DeGeneres, just one day after news of her split from Justin Theroux broke.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/23120/jennifer.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/jennifer-aniston-dodges-question-about-justin-theroux-during-interview-with-ellen-degeneres"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518818424.193, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
