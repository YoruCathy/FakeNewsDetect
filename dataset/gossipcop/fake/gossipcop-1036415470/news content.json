The Insane Demands Kim Kardashian Gave Her Surrogate The contract states she was allowed 'no more than 6 ounces' of tuna per week.\n\nBeing pregnant is no easy task \u2013 especially if it\u2019s Kim Kardashian West\u2018s baby you\u2019re carrying.\n\nRadar exclusively viewed the contract signed by Kardashian\u2019s surrogate \u2013 and it reveals an entire list of insanely bizarre demands Kardashian put in place that governed what the carrier of her baby could and could not do, wear and eat!\n\nAs Radar exclusively reported, Kim and her \u201cFamous\u201d rapper husband Kanye West paid their surrogate a mere $68K for carrying and delivering their baby girl.\n\nOn her app on Friday, Kardashian revealed her baby girl\u2019s name is Chicago West, sending fans into a social media frenzy over the wacky name.\n\nThe agreement, signed by the surrogate and her husband in March 2017, included a long list of foods the surrogate had to refrain from eating.\n\nAnd hopefully the surrogate isn\u2019t a lover of cheese! According to the contract, the surrogate agreed to refrain from \u201cconsuming, at any time, mold-ripened soft cheese, including, but not limited to, brie, camembert, chevre, blue cheese, and gorgonzola.\u201d\n\nThe surrogate\u2019s new Kardashian-inspired diet also meant \u201craw or partially cooked eggs, raw or undercooked meat, cold deli meats, hot dogs, any and all live products (excluding yogurt), all pates, meat spreads, liver, supplements containing Vitamin A, raw peanuts, unpasteurized dairy and juices, raw sprouts and any unwashed fruits and vegetables\u201d were also off limits.\n\nThe carrier of the newest Kardashian family member also agreed to not eat fish \u2013 and the Wests spelled out what types were and weren\u2019t allowed, even down to the portion size!\n\nAccording to the document, \u201cconsuming tile fish, raw shellfish, mackerel, raw fish, smoked salmon, or swordfish\u201d were not allowed \u201cat any time.\u201d\n\nHowever, the surrogate was allowed to eat tuna, but \u201cno more than six ounces\u201d per week!\n\nThe contract begs the question whether or not Kardashian followed these rules when she was pregnant with her other two children, North, 4, and Saint, 2.\n\nIn addition to food, the surrogate was ordered to not drink \u201cmore than one cup of a caffeinated beverage per day.\u201d\n\nAlso in the agreement are a strict set of rules pertaining to the surrogate\u2019s wellness and beauty regimen. The KKW Beauty founder specified that \u201chot tubs or saunas\u201d were not allowed.\n\nThe gestational carrier also signed off on steering clear from \u201cingesting medical herbs, exposure to essential oils and aromatherapy, and prolonged exposure to chemical cleansers, hair spray, pesticides, and paint fumes.\u201d\n\nLuckily, massages were allowed \u2013 but only if the surrogate used a special oil.\n\n\u201cIt shall only be with sweet almond oil which the treating physician has approved for her to have contact with during the pregnancy,\u201d the agreement states.\n\nThe surrogate was also instructed to only receive manicure and pedicures with a protective mask. Additionally, the surrogate was unable to undergo chemical teeth whitening or go to the tanning salon, the documents state.\n\nChicago\u2019s carrier also agreed to avoid the use of certain medicines spelled out for her in the contract, including \u201cIbuprofen, Aleve, Advil and Naproxen.\u201d\n\nAn insider close to the surrogate admitted that although the agreement featured countless over-the-top requests, the surrogate was still ecstatic to find out she\u2019d be carrying a soon-to-be very famous newborn.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s watched every episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d the insider revealed, adding meeting the couple for the first time \u201cwas a surreal moment.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of Kimye\u2019s over-the-top demands?
