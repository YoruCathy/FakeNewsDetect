The parents of Presley, 19, and Kaia, 16, are on the rocks after two decades as husband and wife, an insider recently told In Touch in the magazine\u2019s latest issue, on newsstands now. \u201cThere has been constant drama in their marriage for years,\u201d the insider said of Cindy, 52, and Rande, 56, who have mostly clashed over cheating rumors.\n\nNow, with their kids getting older and establishing modeling careers of their own, the pair are drifting apart. \u201cPut it this way: They don\u2019t keep tabs on each other anymore. Sometimes it seems like they\u2019re living separate lives,\u201d the source shared.\n\nCindy has been known to obsess over Rande\u2019s ladies\u2019 man reputation. \u201cHe\u2019s a big flirt, especially when he was more involved with his nightclub business,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cWomen were hitting on him all the time.\u201d In 2004, former W hotel waitress Harmony Kubiak claimed she and Rande made out and nearly had sex in 2000 \u2014 just two years after he wed Cindy. \u201cIt was a shock to Cindy when she heard that,\u201d the source explained. (Rande has denied affair rumors.) \u201cEveryone thought she\u2019d leave him, but she stayed.\u201d\n\nCindy\u2019s rep has insisted that \u201cthere are no problems in Cindy\u2019s marriage, nor is anyone fearing they are going to separate.\u201d But several years ago Cindy consulted a psychic, the insider said, because she \u201cfelt like her marriage was crumbling.\u201d Instead of ending things, Cindy decided on couples therapy, the source confessed. \u201cShe likes to say she\u2019s older now so she doesn\u2019t listen to the rumors, but she still worries.\u201d And she\u2019ll never forget.\n\nThough the insider said the co-founder of the Casamigos tequila brand \u2014 which Rande sold for $1 billion last year \u2014 parties less now that his BFF, George Clooney, is a married dad, Cindy often \u201cguilts Rande\u201d about his wild past. The insider added, \u201cHe just takes it.\u201d But he might not for much longer.\n\nAccording to the insider, the pair are waiting for Presley and Kaia to fully leave the nest before making any decisions about the fate of their marriage. \u201cIt is,\u201d said the insider, \u201ca complicated relationship.\u201d", "images":
