Credit: Glenn Harris / PR Photos\n\nBoth Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have films out that premiere at the Toronto Film Festival later this month, and US is breathlessly reporting that the ex husband and wife might run into each other \u2013 gasp! Aniston , Pitt and his girlfriend Angelina Jolie were sort-of supposed to meet at a charity dinner they were all listed as co-hosting during the Oscars in February. Aniston went to the event for an hour, but Pitt and Jolie were no-shows, which wasn\u2019t surprising as there were 10 other hosts listed and not all of them came to the event. Brad and Angelina went to the Independent Spirit Awards instead, where Angelina first showed off her pregnant belly in a tight black dress.\n\nNow exes Brad and Jennifer, who split up in January, 2005 after four and a half years of marriage, might see each other again at this film festival. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be cordial to each other if they end up even speaking. Maybe someone behind the scenes will work to ensure they don\u2019t cross paths though:\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston could reunite at this year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, when the exes are debuting their new flicks just two days apart. Pitt, 44, is among the stars who will walk the red carpet gala at the festival for the North American premiere of his Coen Brothers\u2019 flick Burn After Reading on Sept. 5. (Pitt is also expected to attend the Venice Film Festival, where his film screens on August 27.) Meanwhile, Aniston, 39, is scheduled to attend the Toronto fest to promote her romantic comedy Management \u2014 about a traveling art saleswoman fighting off the advances of a flaky motel manager \u2014 which is premiering Sept. 7.\n\n[From US Weekly]\n\nI would bet this meeting never happens and Brad blows in and out of there before Jennifer\u2019s film premieres. He does have six kids at home now and probably can\u2019t be away for several days at a time.\n\nIt also seems like they\u2019ve both moved on despite the tabloid\u2019s unwillingness to let go. Last week a columnist at the Chicago Sun Times reported that an insider claimed Jennifer \u201cstill is hurting from losing Brad [Pitt] to Angelina [Jolie] \u2014 even after all this time.\u201d How true do you think that is, though? Maybe she thinks about it once in a while, but surely it doesn\u2019t consume her like it still seems to dominate the press. Three years isn\u2019t a lot of time in the grand scheme of things, but it\u2019s enough time to carve a new life for yourself, which Aniston has surely done \u2013 even if she hasn\u2019t found a lasting love. She\u2019s living single, and it looks like she\u2019s living damn well. A lot of happily attached women would love a taste of that healthy carefree life. They\u2019ll just have to settle for slugging some of that Vitamin water she endorses.", "images":
