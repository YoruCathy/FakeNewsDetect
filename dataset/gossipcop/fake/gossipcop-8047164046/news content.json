It\u2019s like they are back together already.\u201d\n\nThe mag goes on to claim that the reconciliation was Lopez's idea:\n\n\u201cAfter splitting from Casper [Smart], she reached out to Ben. She thinks he could be the one and is convinced they\u2019ll make the perfect couple.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that is \u201copen to reuniting, too,\" adding:\n\n\u201cOnce his divorce is official, she\u2019d love to be running around town with him.\u201d\n\nRunning around town together?\n\nSounds like a remake of the \"Jenny From the Block\" album is on its way!\n\nSure, sources from both camps have flat out denied the rumor, with one rep dismissing the report as \"stupid,\" but we prefer to live in a world where true love will always find a way - and it's always 2001.\n\n* pops in Linkin Park CD, weeps gently *\n\nJet fuel can't melt steel beams, y'all.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--3GP2G6Qt--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1473943052/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-throwback-photo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--3GP2G6Qt--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1473943052/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-throwback-photo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/09/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-back-together/", "title": "Ben Affleck & Jennifer Lopez: Back Together?!?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2016/09/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-back-together/", "title": "Ben Affleck & Jennifer Lopez: Back Together?!?!", "description": "Could Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez be on the verge of getting back together?
