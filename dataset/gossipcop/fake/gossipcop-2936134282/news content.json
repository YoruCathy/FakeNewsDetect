(Yes, #JustinPeeber was a thing.)\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nBut the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer has a totally reasonable explanation.\n\nLate in the evening on Thursday, Biebs set the record straight about the source of the stain. \u201cSomeone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d\u2014 area,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nWhile most celebrities might have been peed-off about the embarrassing photos, Bieber has a good sense of humor about it.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!\u201d he added.\n\nImage zoom Source: Justin Bieber Twitter\n\nHe also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison.\n\n\u201cYou ain\u2019t cool unless you pee your pants,\u201d Bieber wrote \u2014 quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Says the Weeknd\u2019s Music Is \u2018Wack\u2019 Following Selena Gomez Romance Rumors\n\nBieber is apparently a big fan of 1990s comedies.
