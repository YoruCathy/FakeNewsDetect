HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that Khloe Kardashian fears ex-husband Lamar Odom could \u2018divulge major family secrets\u2019 in his upcoming book.\n\nLamar Odom, 37, is about to deliver his great slam dunk \u2014 but not everyone is cheering. The former Los Angeles Lakers superstar did in fact confirm that he\u2019s writing a tell-all about his \u201clife,\u201d which everyone assumes will mention Khloe Kardashian, 33, in some parts. It\u2019s concerning to the reality star and her entire family because the power to reveal jaw-dropping secrets lies in his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re all very concerned about this tell-all book and have reached out to ask him to be respectful,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nEven though the basketballer has preached nothing but love over recent months, he\u2019s gone of the rails before and it could happen again. \u201cLamar has spoken recklessly about her family in the past,\u201d the source continues. \u201cKhloe fears what major secrets he could reveal. While Khloe and the rest of the Kardashians try to live a good life, they are no saints. Like any family, they have skeletons in their closet which could seriously hurt their brand if revealed.\u201d Lamar told reporters that \u201ceverything\u201d is up for discussion in the tell-all, so let that be a warning to Khloe and everyone in her inner circle.\n\nLamar has not only dissed his ex-wife in the past, but also the men she\u2019s dated. He thought James Harden was just another one of her \u201cgroupies\u201d looking to ride the fame train and wasn\u2019t thrilled about Tristan Thompson in the beginning either. But after a few months, he actually warmed up to the Cleveland Cavaliers player and gave Khloe his blessing to marry him. \u201cThey seem happy together,\u201d he told Wendy Williams on her show, adding, \u201cGood for them.\u201d Let\u2019s see how long these positive vibes last\u2026\n\nHollywoodLifers, if you were in Khloe\u2019s position, how would you feel about Lamar\u2019s tell-all?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/khloe-k-worried-lamar-odom-tell-all-book-will-tell-family-secrets-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/140c0e0fd0ad702646ff54aed53914eb?s=64&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F07%2F19%2Fkhloe-kardashian-lamar-odom-tell-all-book-family-secrets%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2702484", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/khloe-k-worried-lamar-odom-tell-all-book-will-tell-family-secrets-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/khloe-k-worried-lamar-odom-tell-all-book-will-tell-family-secrets-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Radvan", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/19/khloe-kardashian-lamar-odom-tell-all-book-family-secrets/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Fears Lamar Odom Tell-All Book Could \u2018Divulge Major Family Secrets\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Another day, another tell-all.
