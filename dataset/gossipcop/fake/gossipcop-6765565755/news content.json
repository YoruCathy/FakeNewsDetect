After hearing about Breezy\u2019s flirty comment, we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY learned that Drizzy thinks his \u2018creeping\u2019 is coming across as \u2018desperate.\u2019\n\nRihanna, 29, looked drop-dead gorgeous at the Crop Over Festival, so of course she was getting all sorts of attention. Her ex, Chris Brown, 28, publicly thirsted over her sexy style, commenting a googly-eyed emoji underneath one of her smoldering pics. Now, we\u2019ve learned that Drake, 30, thought her former flame was trying way too hard. \u201cDrake thinks Chris looks sad, lonely and desperate for comment creeping on Rihanna\u2019s Instagram,\u201d a source close to Drizzy tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cDrake feels it is time for Chris to grow up and move on from Rihanna. Drake is very protective and has a lot of love for her even though he is not with Rihanna.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrake is not afraid of Chris and even reached out to Rihanna to let her know that he is willing to talk to Chris if she needed him to tell Chris to back off,\u201d our insider revealed. \u201cDrake even joked with his own team that, if Chris is not careful, he is going to find himself on the bad end of another restraining order.\u201d RiRi turned heads as she arrived to the Kadooment Parade on Aug. 7, rocking a bejeweled bikini and aqua colored hair for the special occasion. The songstress seemed to be living it up to the fullest while dancing to her hit single \u201cWild Thoughts.\u201d Breezy wasn\u2019t the only one losing his mind over Rihanna\u2019s look \u2014 even Pharell Williams, 44, took to social media to swoon!\n\nBreezy and RiRi have been over for years, but the singer re-followed his former flame on IG this March. He also released an epic new jam titled \u201cPills and Automobiles\u201d on Aug. 4, and fans wildly speculated that he was gushing over his ex with his \u201cUmbrella\u201d lyric. Meanwhile, Drake has been having a blast at the OVO fest, slaying the stage with his lyrical prowess. The rapper\u2019s romance with Rihanna simmered down months ago, after they got matching shark tattoos. Even so, it looks like he\u2019s always got her best interests at heart!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Drake and Rihanna will ever rekindle their romance?
