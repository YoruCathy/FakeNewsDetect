Simpson\u2014who is up for parole this October after serving the first nine years of a 33-year prison sentence on 12 charges, including kidnapping and armed robbery\u2014has received comparatively cushy treatment while incarcerated. He has even found a new favorite show. You may have heard of it: Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nA former prison guard told the newsmagazine that Simpson \u201clikes Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\u201d More specifically: \u201cHe likes to keep up with all the gossip with them.\u201d\n\nLast year, The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story illuminated the ties between the Simpson family and the Kardashian clan for casual fans who may not have been aware of their connection\u2014largely helped by David Schwimmer\u2019s \u201cJuice!\u201d-y performance as the late Kardashian patriarch, Robert. Robert, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob Kardashian, was one of Simpson\u2019s best friends; his first wife (and the mother of his children), Kris, was very close with the slain Nicole Brown Simpson. (Regrettably, Simpson has not seen American Crime Story, reports Inside Edition, \u201cbecause the prison doesn\u2019t get the FX network.\u201d)\n\nAt the time A.C.S. was airing, Kim Kardashian West told GQ that she \u201cloved\u201d the FX drama. She also revealed that she had gone through the Louis Vuitton bag that was presented as evidence during Simpson\u2019s murder trial\u2014only to find it empty. Amusingly enough, Simpson was not quite as enthusiastic about the Kardashian-starring E! reality show\u2014at least, not at first.\n\nIn O.J.: Made in America, memorabilia dealer Thomas Riccio\u2014who was involved in the fiasco that landed Simpson in prison\u2014said that K.U.W.T.K. was playing in the background as Simpson and company planned their ill-fated confrontation. Simpson, Riccio said, spotted the show and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my goddaughter. Her name is Kim!\u201d Then he added, \u201cThat show ain\u2019t going to last two weeks.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57a8f9807a51b09e1bf3477a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kardashian-nudes-01.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5949981065b7164374c5bfff/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/OJ-Kardashians.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57a8f9817a51b09e1bf3477c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kardashian-nudes-15.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5949981065b7164374c5bfff/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/OJ-Kardashians.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57a9dac07a51b09e1bf3478f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a-kardashian-nudes-08.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5949981065b7164374c5bfff/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/OJ-Kardashians.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/oj-simpson-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians", "title": "O.J.
