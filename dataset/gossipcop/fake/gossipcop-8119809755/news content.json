Chris Brown and Soulja Boy got into a feud on social media on Monday, January 2, over Brown\u2019s ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran.\n\nThe fight ignited after the \u201cCrank That\u201d rapper, 26, liked a photo of Tran, 28, on Instagram. \u201cChris brown just called me and said he wanna fight me because I liked @karrueche picture on Instagram this n\u2014a a bitch,\u201d Soulja Boy wrote on Twitter on Monday night.\n\n\u201cAye @chrisbrown pull up n\u2014a I\u2019ll knock yo Bitch Ass out,\u201d he continued. \u201cF\u2013k @chrisbrown.

Fruits!\u201d\n\nSoulja Boy then brought up Brown\u2019s tumultuous relationship with ex Rihanna as well as his previous legal trouble. \u201cChris Brown think he hard cuz he hit a woman,\u201d the rapper tweeted. \u201cAnd jumped a fan at his house party on New Years lmao u can\u2019t fight Bitch do that s\u2013t to me.\u201d\n\nBrown, 27, responded on Instagram with a series of videos and memes poking fun at his nemesis. In one, Brown mentioned his 2-year-old daughter, Royalty, saying, \u201cHappy New Year! Royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than Soulja Boy already. I\u2019d be mad too.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGrass Ain\u2019t Greener\u201d singer also slammed Soulja Boy for dragging Rihanna, 28, into the spat, saying, \u201cThis s\u2013t is beneath me. I want to bring black people together, but you gotta get your ass whooped, my n\u2014a. Because at the end of the day, what\u2019s the first joke you had? The Rihanna joke, my n\u2014a? I was 17. I\u2019m 27 now. You can get a grown man ass whoopin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe feud continued on Tuesday, January 3, when Tran responded, writing in a since-deleted Instagram post: \u201cFirst off this drama between the both of these two is so ridiculous it makes no sense. We just brought in a new year and this is what we doing?? \u2026 This isn\u2019t cool or funny.. it\u2019s draining.. not just for me.. but for everyone. There\u2019s so much more out there in life then \u2018twitter beefs.\u2019 \u2026 I been chillen.. working.. eating my veggies.. hitting these squats and minding my own business and that\u2019s exactly how I want to keep it.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Brown replied to his ex\u2019s post, writing, \u201cNOONE ASKED FOR THIS OPINION!!! IT AINT OVER YOU!! GIRL KEEP THE FAME YOU GOT AND STAY CLASSY! \u2026 IM SO SICK OF N\u2014AS COMING AT ME LEFT AND RIGHT AND NOW SHE WANNA CHIME IN.

So advice from bitches that had my d\u2013k in they mouth is really not informative!\u201d\n\nAnd just when we thought it was over, Soulja Boy chimed in again, tweeting, \u201cF\u2013k Chris brown. Bitch ass n\u2014a ain\u2019t nothing but a woman I wish he hit my sister like he did Rihanna I would beat his ass. The difference between me and Chris is I shot a N\u2014a before. And he hit a woman before. We not the same.\u201d\n\nBrown and Tran dated on and off for four years until March 2015, when the model called it quits after finding out the singer had fathered his daughter, Royalty, with another woman while they were together.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-karruche-soulja-inline-8240430b-5745-44c0-aaf0-a35ae5413329.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-karruche-soulja-main-58a5bf81-1b4d-4cdf-86ff-df99b81bceea.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-karruche-soulja-main-58a5bf81-1b4d-4cdf-86ff-df99b81bceea.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chris-brown-soulja-boy-feud-over-karreuche-tran-w458787/", "title": "Chris Brown, Soulja Boy Feud Over Karreuche Tran", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Chris Brown and Soulja Boy got into a feud on social media on Monday, January 2, over Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chris Brown, Soulja Boy Feud Over Karreuche Tran", "description": "Chris Brown and Soulja Boy got into a feud on social media on Monday, January 2, over Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chris-brown-soulja-boy-feud-over-karreuche-tran-w458787/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T23:03:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-karruche-soulja-main-58a5bf81-1b4d-4cdf-86ff-df99b81bceea.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-karruche-soulja-main-58a5bf81-1b4d-4cdf-86ff-df99b81bceea.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-01-03T20:20:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T23:03:16+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chris Brown and Soulja Boy got into a feud on social media on Monday, January 2, over Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran \u2014 details", "title": "Chris Brown, Soulja Boy Feud Over Karreuche Tran", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chris-brown-karruche-soulja-main-58a5bf81-1b4d-4cdf-86ff-df99b81bceea.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1483474800.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
