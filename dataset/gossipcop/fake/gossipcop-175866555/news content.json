He\u2019s pretty chuffed about it.\u2019\n\nWhile Brad would\u2019ve been more than happy to finally catch up with George and Sean \u2013 friends who he wasn\u2019t allowed to hang out with while he was married to Ange \u2013 one notable no-show at the pre-Oscars weekend dinner was Jen.\n\nSources say she and Brad chose not to go to the restaurant together, to avoid any public scrutiny so soon after her official split from husband Justin Theroux \u2013 however it\u2019s believed she caught up with Brad and George later.\n\n\u2018Jen lent George her bodyguard, knowing he and Brad would be coming back to her place in Bel Air after dinner,\u2019 says a source.\n\n\u2018Given that George and Amal are mostly based in the UK now, he doesn\u2019t have his own security detail in LA anymore \u2013 so Jen was only too happy to help.\n\n\u2018After the dinner, George and Brad went back to her place and they had a nightcap. Like old times.\n\n\u2018Brad raved about what a great mum Jen has been to his kids \u2013 that made him fall in love with her even more. And because George is a new dad he could really appreciate it.\n\n\u2018Brad said the kids have taken to Jen and they get really upset when they have to leave. He\u2019s really enjoyed watching them bond.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/6671/161109_jennifer_aniston_brad_pitt_divorce.jpg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/6671/161109_jennifer_aniston_brad_pitt_divorce.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/george-clooney-helped-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together", "title": "George Clooney helped Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston get back together", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "George Clooney\u2019s friendship with Brad Pitt all but crumbled after ex-wife Angelina Jolie banned them from seeing each other during their tumultuous marriage, but it appears the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star has had the final laugh.", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, George Clooney, George Clooney got Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together, Brad and Jen, Brad and Jen back together, George and Amal Clooney, Justin Theroux, Angelina Jolie, celeb news, latest celeb news, celebrity news, latest celebrity news, celeb goss, celebrity goss, celebrity gossip, latest celebrity gossip, George Clooney helped Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston get back together", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/george-clooney-helped-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together", "title": "Revealed: Who got Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together", "description": "George Clooney\u2019s friendship with Brad Pitt all but crumbled after ex-wife Angelina Jolie banned them from seeing each other during their tumultuous marriage, but it appears the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star has had the final laugh.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/6671/161109_jennifer_aniston_brad_pitt_divorce.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1080}}, "twitter": {"title": "George Clooney helped Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston get back together", "description": "George Clooney\u2019s friendship with Brad Pitt all but crumbled after ex-wife Angelina Jolie banned them from seeing each other during their tumultuous marriage, but it appears the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star has had the final laugh.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/6671/161109_jennifer_aniston_brad_pitt_divorce.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/george-clooney-helped-brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-get-back-together"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520892095.31, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
