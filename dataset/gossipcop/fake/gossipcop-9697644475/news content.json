There were engagement and breakup rumors. They appeared on each other\u2019s Instagram accounts. They shot down pregnancy rumors. And they took their romance to the next level: Snapchat. (Hands up if that video of Kylie \u201ckissing\u201d Tyga\u2019s grill comes to mind right away.)\n\n\n\nEven though it\u2019s all over now, take a look back at how Kyga came to be.\n\nNovember 2011: Kendall Jenner\u2019s Sweet Sixteen birthday party is one of the first encounters between Kylie and Tyga.

Make what you will of the brief flirting, if you can even call it that.\n\nJuly 2014: Tyga makes what many Kyga fans believe is his first appearance on Kylie\u2019s Instagram feed. Kendall and Chris Brown are there for the hang too.\n\nAugust 2014: Tyga celebrates Kylie\u2019s 17th birthday and even offers her a shot of tequila while she\u2019s dancing on some platform.

She tells The Breakfast Club: \u201c[He] should be ashamed of himself. That\u2019s how I feel. For sure....He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17. Like, nah.\u201d\n\nFebruary 16, 2015: Khlo\u00e9 responds to Amber\u2019s comments and defends Kylie on Twitter.\n\nWe get asked questions about people all the time and my sisters and I always take the high road and don't answer.

Rather, Kylie is a businesswoman and goes on private planes with Karl Lagerfeld.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rare circumstance, so let\u2019s treat this as a special case,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says.\n\nJuly 30, 2015: Kylie marriage update #4,059,687.\n\nNot planning on getting married anytime soon :) \u2014 Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) July 30, 2015\n\nAugust 9, 2015: Tyga buys Kylie a Ferrari 458 convertible valued at a cool $320,000.\n\nAugust 10, 2015: Kylie turns 18.
