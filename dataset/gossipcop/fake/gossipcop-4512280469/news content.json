Can I give you my number?\u2019 and, \u2018Come to my hotel later,\u2019\u201d a source exclusively tells In Touch of the alleged encounter, which happened during the actor\u2019s trip to the Windy City for a Dec. 8 book signing. \u201cMy friend, who\u2019s a fan of Neil\u2019s, told him he\u2019s straight and said, \u2018I\u2019m confused. Aren\u2019t you married?\u2019 Neil told him, \u2018My marriage isn\u2019t working out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just a pickup line: In Touch has learned that Neil and husband David Burtka, who\u2019ve been together since 2004, are facing a relationship crisis. \u201cThey\u2019re on shaky ground,\u201d an insider close to the actor, 44, and the chef, 42, tells In Touch. And while David always knew Neil is a big flirt, \u201clately, it\u2019s been more of an issue,\u201d adds the insider. \u201cThey love each other and their kids [seven-year-old twins Gideon and Harper], but they want their relationship and lives to be more harmonious. Right now, the marriage could go either way.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\nThey\u2019re fundamentally different people. \u201cNeil is outgoing and loves to party and go out on a moment\u2019s notice, while David often calls himself \u2018Mr. Homebody,\u2019\u201d explains the insider, noting\n\nthat the Emmy-winning How I Met Your Mother alum can be high maintenance and moody. \u201cThat drains David. So that\u2019s a constant source of conflict.\u201d (A rep for Neil denies there is marriage trouble or that Neil hit on another man at Girl & the Goat.) They\u2019ve been dealing with their problems for a long time.\n\nA year ago, Neil, who wed David in 2014, revealed he was going to therapy twice a week, and in April, David told In Touch that they\u2019ve long sought a professional\u2019s help together. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being in a relationship. We go to couples therapy,\u201d David said. \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything wrong, but it\u2019s nice to sort of just talk to someone who is a mediator. That\u2019s helped.\u201d But lately, according to the insider, \u201cbecause of Neil\u2019s schedule, the therapy hasn\u2019t been as consistent, but they\u2019ve been going.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re also struggled to adjust to David\u2019s decision to stop drinking alcohol last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the way I was acting, I thought, \u2018I owe it to myself. I owe it to my kids, to be there 100 percent,\u2019\u201d David said in April. But instead of helping strengthen the family, tension with Neil only increased, says the insider: \u201cIt always does when one partner gets sober and the other one doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nStill, divorce is a step neither of them is willing to take lightly. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly told how much their public marriage and kids have meant to the gay community, and both take that seriously and want to remain role models,\u201d says the insider. \u201cThey\u2019re both decent people who love each other and their kids and are trying to work it out.\u201d\n\nFor more on this, pick up the
