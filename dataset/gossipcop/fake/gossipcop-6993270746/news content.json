They have one of those real loves that everyone adores and looks up to in both Hollywood, and evidentally, Nashville. Here is the amazing story of how these two megastars in their own right came to find each other.\n\n\n\nThe Defining Moment\n\nOne fateful evening in 2005, Urban\u2019s life would change forever. He bumped into the stunning Kidman at a G\u2019day LA event. The conversation between the two stars was electric, and the pair instantly struck a bond. But Urban was trying to play it cool and chose not to get too close to Kidman so soon. And in 2013, the actress told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview that it took Urban four whole months to ask her out.\n\nLoved By Many\n\nDuring the early stages of her career, Kidman had flings with Australian stars such as Marcus Graham and Tom Burlinson. Then, when she moved onto bigger projects in Hollywood, she dated a variety of high profile stars. These included The Pianist actor Adrien Brody, who she was reportedly only briefly involved with. Also, after working on Cold Mountain with Jude Law, the pair were rumored to have had a relationship on set. Another brief romance happened between Kidman and rock star Lenny Kravitz.\n\nThings Got Messy\n\nIt did not take long at all before Kidman\u2019s ever growing number of fans were discussing her personal life. Just a year after Dead Calm, the Aussie began working on the 1990 drama, Days Of Thunder. Fortunately for Kidman, the studio paired her up alongside the legendary Tom Cruise. It was true love at first sight and very soon after production, the two got married. Kidman and Cruise were the talk of the town, for ten years, at least\u2026\n\nA Match Made In Hollywood\n\nIt seemed like the perfect match. Of all days, Kidman and Cruise had tied the knot on Christmas Eve. It could not be more romantic. The couple seemed to be invincible for a while and even adopted two children together \u2013 Isabella Jane and Connor Anthony. But ultimately, their relationship wasn\u2019t meant to stand the test of time, and the couple broke up in 2001. Cruise swiftly filed for divorce and claimed that they parted due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nUnbreakable Bond\n\nHowever, it was more complicated than that. Despite separating, Cruise has always considered Kidman to be a massive part of his life, and this was true vice versa. \u201cHe was huge; still is,\u201d Kidman said regarding Cruise\u2019s role in her life. \u201cTo me, he was just Tom, but to everybody else, he is huge. But he was lovely to me. And I loved him. I still love him.\u201d It seems that even when separated, certain bonds can not be broken.\n\nAward Winning Performances\n\nA separation as high profile as the one between Cruise and Kidman could have crushed their careers. But on the contrary, both stars only got bigger and bigger as their career\u2019s progressed. The years following her break up would bring her considerable success. Kidman won an Academy Award for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in 2003\u2019s The Hours. Other notable performances came in movies like thrillers, such as The Others, Dogville and the national historical epic, Australia.\n\nKidman's Fortune\n\nKidman wasn\u2019t only critically successful, she has also received considerable commercial success in her thirty-plus year career. In 2006, Forbes magazine ranked Kidman the number four in the list of highest paid actors/actresses. As of 2016, her movies have grossed more than $3.7 billion, and 17 of her flicks have made over $100 million. Shortly after her Forbes ranking in 2006, she announced to the world that she had recently got engaged to the new love of her life. It was none other than Keith Urban.\n\nKeith Urban\n\nLike Kidman, Keith Urban is a native of the Australasian continent. Born in Whangarei, New Zealand, Urban made his first splash in stardom after winning the prestigious talent show, Star Maker in 1990. This paved the way for a lucrative contract with EMI and before he knew it, Urban was writing and recording his own country music. During the early stages of his career, Urban had a number of hits under his belt, before getting a huge break and got the chance to move to Nashville.\n\nHumble Beginnings\n\nThings didn\u2019t run so smoothly during Urban\u2019s early years in the United States. The country singer had stepped into an arena where there was already a huge array of talented country and folk artists. And Urban was at a disadvantage as he was a foreigner. American fans wanted American singers. Urban struggled to sell tickets to his concerts and record sales were modest. A battle with drink and substances in the early 90s also didn\u2019t help his cause.\n\nLiving Life Like A Roller Coaster\n\nHowever, Keith Urban\u2019s fortunes were about to turn for the better. In 1999, the country singer released the first album he had completely produced in the US. The self-titled American debut hit record highs commercially. But Urban\u2019s struggles with substance abuse continued to haunt him. \u201cThe whole back-end of the nineties were just awful,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019d go to sleep, wake up a couple of hours later, go at it again, drinking to take the edge off.\u201d\n\nAll The Lonely People\n\nWhen it comes to the lifestyle of a celebrity, it seems like a conveyor belt of opportunities to socialize with the richest and most beautiful people in the world. No one would expect it to be an environment where one could ever get lonely. But this certainly applied to both Kidman and Urban. All the parties and shows couldn\u2019t take away the sense of pain and loneliness that both stars experience in the years building up to their encounter.\n\nRight Place At The Right Time\n\nKidman admitted that their shared sense of loneliness was the reason that the couple struck a bond so quickly. \u201cI think we were two lonely people,\u201d she said. \u201cI would probably say that two very lonely people managed to meet at a time when they could open themselves to each other. We were a mixture of frightened and brave.\u201d Urban agreed with Kidman\u2019s rationale, saying,\u201dwe [definitely] both met each other exactly at the right time.\u201d\n\nThe Odd Couple\n\nIt seems like Urban played his cards right and his patience paid off. Without hesitation, Kidman said yes when the country singer asked her out. It wasn\u2019t long before the couple started to appear on numerous magazine covers. It was unexpected, but it worked. And after a short space of time, after just one year of dating, Urban knew that Kidman was one. In 2006, he asked Kidman for her hand in marriage. But was it \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d?\n\nThe Answer Was...\n\nYES! Kidman gave Urban a resounding \u201cYes.\u201d He was absolutely ecstatic and couldn\u2019t believe that he was now engaged to one of if not the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. And they didn\u2019t spend long as far as wedding planning was concerned. A month later, the couple tied the knot in Sydney. Some of Australia\u2019s finest stars were in attendance, including Hugh Jackman and Naomi Watts. It was a truly perfect ceremony. But was it too good to be true?\n\nSomething Was Off\n\nThe monumental wedding only covered up the cracks that started to show, as soon as they both said: \u201cI do.\u201d Urban\u2019s turbulent past seemed to catch up with him and instantly had an impact on the couple\u2019s marriage. During the wedding party, Kidman noticed that her new husband was showing signs of erratic behavior. But what could have been the cause of this? Was it just because of the magnitude of the day? Or was it something much darker?\n\nThe Sad Truth\n\nKidman was aware that Urban had a checkered past before meeting her. But she was under the impression that he had moved on since those dark times. The truth became clear to Kidman: her husband Keith was still using. From day one, the signs were there and within four months of their marriage, Kidman organized an intervention for Urban. At this point, he realized that things had gone too far and that he needed to do something about it.\n\nTime To Take Action\n\nUrban knew that things needed to change if he wanted to hang on to Kidman. He had already undergone rehab twice in his life but to no avail. But was this going to be third time lucky? Urban needed it to be. It was time to make some serious changes and in 2006, he checked into the Betty Ford Center. This time, things were different, and after three months of serious rehab, Urban had made considerable strides and came out the other side a renewed person.\n\nGetting Support From Nicole\n\nMaybe Urban\u2019s successful rehab was partly due to having someone special there by his side, every step of the way. Kidman played this role majestically and Urban believes that the test only strengthened the couple\u2019s resolve. \u201cThere were times early on when I wished I would have been sober and in recovery and everything when I met Nic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the other way to look at it\u2026is that we\u2019ve been able to build our relationship with that.\u201d\n\nPain Runs Deep\n\nUrban knows how hard his struggles with addiction and rehab must have been for his wife. And Kidman made it clear just how traumatic the entire process was for both of them. She said that \u201cit was painful, deeply painful. We were in a very, very, very bad, painful place.\u201d But she was glad that they \u201cmanaged to step through it, and I hope that gives some people some hope who may be in the same place.\u201d\n\nGrowing Love\n\nKidman has said in the past that despite the instant connection that she struck with Urban when they met all those years ago, she feels like they only truly got to know each other after getting married. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really know each other \u2013 we got to know each other during our marriage.\u201d The priority of her marriage with Urban was to have a partner and have kids. But as the years have gone on, the relationship has become so much more.\n\nA New Chapter\n\nNow that Urban finally overcame his demons, the couple were now able to move on and live a much simpler life together. They built a home together and two years after Urban made a full recovery, they started a family together. In 2008, Kidman happily announced that she was pregnant and had her first child with Urban, a daughter by the name of Sunday Rose. Shortly after, the couple welcomed a second daughter, Faith Margaret, into the world.\n\nA Blast From The Past\n\nAs if Keith\u2019s personal demons were not enough to shake the grounds beneath their feet, Urban\u2019s blast from the past was fast approaching their way. In an interview with Star Magazine, Keith\u2019s ex-girlfriend and Australian entertainer Angie Maquis claimed that his Nicole\u2019s \u201ccontrolling\u201d team banned her from discussing her previous relationship with Keith. She said, \u201cI have said a few things about Keith in the past, and he got a bit funny with me\u2026 I think it\u2019s Nicole\u2019s publicity who are controlling that.\u201d\n\nNotorious For Her Actions\n\nAngie dated the country singer for two years and even attended the couple\u2019s wedding in 2006 before the friendship went sour. Ever since her claims hit the fan, Keith\u2019s former lover seemed to enjoy her newly gained spotlight, especially since she expressed her thoughts regarding writing a book on the matter. But recently, Angie spoke up and announced the opposite is true \u2013 in fact, if anything, she regrets having anything to do with the singer, saying: \u201c\u2018I seem to have gained notoriety because of it.\u201d\n\nIssues Of Insecurity\n\nBeing the talented musician he is, Keith finds it easier to write about things he experiences. When asked about the inspiration behind his hit song The Fighter, he replied: \u201cI had such a learning curve in our marriage! When she\u2019d get scared, I\u2019d think she was angry; then I\u2019d get defensive, go tearing out the driveway at 90 miles an hour\u2026 What she needs, and it\u2019s in the song, is for me to stay, to be close, to hear her.\u201d\n\nHome Is Where The Heart Is\n\nIn addition to the external actress playing a role in rocking the boat that is their relationship, Keith and Nicole have also argued about one of the most crucial matters imaginable \u2013 in which country they should live. A source revealed that \u201cNicole wants to move back to Australia so they can raise their children among family, but Keith is opposed to leaving Nashville because his career is there. They\u2019ve been having this argument for almost two years now. It\u2019s taking a toll on the relationship.\u201d\n\nDecisions, Decisions\n\nSince Nicole is an actress, her career does not require her to live in America. If she stars in a movie in the U.S., all she has to do is hop on a plane toward whatever destination she is meant to film. On the other hand, Keith performs at casinos and state fairs as well as award shows \u2013 this means that in order to make sure he stays relevant in the music industry, he must stay relatively close. However, they are not the only two pawns in this game.\n\nFirst Things First\n\nAs it turns, out, Nicole\u2019s motherly instincts are pulling her toward living in Australia since she has fond memories of being brought up there and she wants their children to experience the same upbringing. The duo\u2019s top priority was and always will be their daughters \u2013 Sunday, 8, and Faith, 6 \u2013 but Keith moved to Nashville for a reason. \u201cNicole likes the laid-back lifestyle there,\u201d said another insider at one point. \u201c[She] wants her kids to have the same kind of upbringing she did.\u201d\n\nTough To Be Around\n\nKidman may seem like every man\u2019s deepest desire, but she herself revealed being married to her far from being all fun and games. Apparently, some things can drive the belle of the ball utterly mad: \u201cWhen people say they will do something and they don\u2019t \u2013 and I know it\u2019s terribly demanding, but \u2013 I don\u2019t like it when my husband doesn\u2019t answer his phone,\u201d Nicole told W Magazine. \u201cI have to keep calling and calling, and I get anxious. Does that make me high-maintenance?\u201d\n\nLeading Separate Lives\n\nNicole and Keith might both count as A-list celebrities, but they come from very different backgrounds and work in vastly diverse industries. They say \u201cdistance makes the heart grow fonder,\u201d but what if the exact opposite occurs? Earlier this month the sweetheart couple were said to be struggling to make time for each other, creating a somewhat long-distance relationship. In fact, the two have sort of been leading separate lives, a notion that made headlines after one particular incident on Nicole\u2019s behalf.\n\nStruggling With The Rumors\n\nRecently, photos of Nicole Kidman\u2019s friendly nature were published and raised serious eyebrows. The movie star is known to have an exceptionally favorable character which could explain why she was spotted embracing her friend, director Garth Davis, while they were both in Sydney for the premiere for Top Of The Lake. The two were said to be more than platonic: \u201cWhen Nicole and Garth said hello and goodbye, they shared a very lingering embrace.\u201d As for Keith\u2019s whereabouts \u2013 apparently, he was not even in the country.\n\nTrust Is Everything\n\nKeith was away on tour, and a close friend of his revealed that while the talented singer is usually very understanding and open minded, he will be \u201cfurious\u201d once he will see the photos \u2013 even though he \u201cknows there\u2019s nothing going on between them.\u201d However, this couple is no stranger to these types of stories and alleged rumors of affairs. Working in Hollywood, this is just another part of a greater package deal walking hand in hand with fame.\n\nPriceless Present\n\nAlthough born to Australian parents, Nicole\u2019s place of birth was Honolulu. She lived in the capital of Hawaii until she was 4 years-old due to her father\u2019s academic career as a Ph.D. at a local university. Her father, Anthony, passed away in 2014, and ever since then Kidman has had a hard time bouncing back, says a close friend. That is why Keith decided to surprise his wife with an incredible present she never saw coming \u2013 he bought her her childhood home.\n\nLess Than Thrifty Fifty\n\nKeith and Nicole already have a multi-million dollar property, but some things cannot be labeled by a price tag. The real estate office that aided Urban with the purchase claimed Keith \u201cmade the current owners an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse, laying down millions for the beachside property.\u201d Additionally, they declared that \u201cwhen Nicole thinks of Hawaii she thinks of her dad,\u201d making this gift all the more priceless. Needless to say, this costly acquisition came at the perfect timing \u2013 just months short of Nicole\u2019s milestone 50th birthday.\n\nHow Are Things Now?\n\nAfter a difficult start to their relationship, Kidman and Urban have overcome many obstacles to build a happy life together. They have been happily married now for over a decade and unlike many Hollywood couples, have stood the test of time. But even still, the couple have challenges in their lives. Between Kidman\u2019s continuous acting career and Urban\u2019s continuous touring schedules, the couple a lot of time away from one another. So what is their secret? How do they still make it work?\n\nWhat's Their Secret?\n\nFor many couples, therapy or counseling is what does the trick when maintaining a healthy marriage. But Kidman and Urban do things a little differently in their household. And it was only recently when Kidman revealed her big secret as to what has kept her and Urban together. In an interview with InStyle, the actress claimed that the couple obeys a particular rule when either partner leaves home. But what on earth could this stipulation be exactly?\n\nOne Condition\n\nIn InStyle\u2018s July 2017 edition, Kidman revealed that the couple only have one form of communication when they are apart \u2013 they only speak on the phone. Letters? Forget it. E-Mail? No Chance. Facebook? Out of the question. Kidman and Urban only talk over the phone if they are not together. \u201cKeith and I don\u2019t ever text,\u201d she said in her interview. \u201cWe call. That\u2019s just what we\u2019ve always done. We\u2019re old school.\u201d Sometimes, the beauty is in the simplicity. However\u2026\n\nException To The Rule\n\nThe couple have been known to bend their rules every once in a while. Only once or twice in their marriage has Kidman sent a text to her husband. So Kidman isn\u2019t as \u201cold school\u201d as we originally thought. Also, since the discovering the popular app, the couple have used FaceTime frequently and believe it is just as good as a typical phone call. Kidman has even made impromptu cameos at some of her husband\u2019s concerts. Urban has surprised his fans by showing Kidman on the app.\n\nOne Step Further\n\nTo take liberties even further, the couple have admitted to sending some cheeky texts to each other. Like many happy couples, Kidman and Urban have been known to get creative with their words and capture each other\u2019s imagination while away from one another. The confirmation came in 2013 when Urban had an interview with Ellen DeGeneres. He confessed to sending \u201cthose kind of texts\u201d to Kidman. \u201cI\u2019m a little red now,\u201d he said. So you should be Keith. So you should.\n\nA Normal Couple\n\nWhen all\u2019s said and done, Kidman isn\u2019t on set and Urban isn\u2019t on the road touring, the couple just like to live a normal life with their two girls. \u201cOn weekends, we just hang \u2013 wake up, get the paper,\u201d Kidman said. \u201cWe\u2019re very, very tight.\u201d And it is little statements like this that remind the public that celebrity couples are just like any other \u2013 striving to live the typical life of an everyday couple and enjoy the little things together.\n\nStronger Together\n\nAfter overcoming all the obstacles that fame and fortune brought them over the years, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are stronger than ever. It\u2019s a testament to their unbreakable bond that they are able to be so vocal about each other. And to share the mechanics of how their relationship works in their interviews is nothing short of commendable. It\u2019s little tidbits like their cheeky communication quirks that make them feel just a bit more relatable to us.\n\nRenewing Wedding Vows\n\nAfter Nicole laid a wet one on Alex Skarsgard, she defended the kiss by saying \u201cI\u2019ve got an amazing, supportive, gorgeous husband who I love more than anything in the world and I gave Alex a congratulatory kiss and he\u2019s like a mannequin.\u201d In a twist of events, Nicole and Keith have decided to renew their marriage vows. Get ready for the duo to say their \u201cI do\u2019s\u201d one more time. An insider claims that it was Nicole\u2019s idea and that this is vital for the both of them.\n\nIt's Complicated\n\nLike all relationships, things haven\u2019t been perfect for the star couple, and drama can constantly overshadow those glamorous walks down the red carpet. And it was only recently that Kidman revealed just how deep the problems can go.\n\nAn Instant Star\n\nLong before she tied the knot with Kieth, Kidman had already firmly established herself as one of the biggest actresses, not only in Australia, but the entire world. Her first break came in 1989 when she starred in the horror hit movie Dead Calm. Her performance caught the attention of Hollywood\u2019s finest and before she knew it, Kidman became an instantly recognizable name. She would go on to lead in classics such as Cold Mountain and Moulin Rouge.", "images":
