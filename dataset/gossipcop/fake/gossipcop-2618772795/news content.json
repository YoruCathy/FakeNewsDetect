After catching preview performances, she declared that the musical about her life could use a little more life.\n\n\u201cSome times, I was having a blast. Some times, my mind was wandering. I think those are the parts that are going to get better,\u201d she said in a Q&A with the Chicago Tribune.\n\nNever one to hold back, Cher said the production is a work in progress.\n\n\u201cSome parts of it are really fabulous. We\u2019re going to work on the other parts,\u201d the 72-year-old pop icon said. \u201cIn many parts, it was much, much better than I thought it would be. And there were no parts where I wanted to gouge my eyes out.\u201d\n\nGet more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.\n\nSign up for our Coffee Break newsletter here.\n\nCher, seeing the show for the first time, said the show focuses on the key men in her life (ex-husbands Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman, Robert Altman), her movies, her relationship with her mother. Three different actresses portray her at different stages of her life, but at times all three share the stage, singing and interacting with each other.\n\nCher said she pushed for the show to be honest as possible.\n\nRelated Articles Dr. Phil slammed for comments on coronavirus deaths \u2014 \u2018bad examples\u2019\n\nK-pop act Monsta X delivers new video from first all-English album\n\nCoronavirus: Napa Valley Film Festival postponed\n\n\u2018Disney Family Singalong\u2019: Which number was your favorite?\n\n\u2018Jump Shot\u2019: Steph Curry-produced film shines a light on basketball pioneer \u201cMy life is 72 years. My career is 53 years,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the show has to skip all over the place. I am actually pushing them to be more truthful about me. I\u2019ve already said so much about my life. It would be silly for them to come up with a Mother Teresa.\u201d\n\nAs for the changes she\u2019d like to see, Cher says she\u2019s been in the ear of director Jason Moore. \u201cThere are lines in the show that sound like quotes but aren\u2019t quite right. I\u2019ve been telling him the real quotes,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a lot to say. And I am pushing them to do three dance songs in a concert-style way at the end, a bit like they do in \u2018Mamma Mia.\u2019 I think the audience would like that.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/020bf2b94c0fb6ac1f396598e197cf31?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cher.jpg?w=1024&h=696", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cher.jpg?w=1024&h=696", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cicero Estrella", "Online Producer", "Cicero Estrella Is The Bay Area News Group'S Entertainment", "Lifestyles Producer.
