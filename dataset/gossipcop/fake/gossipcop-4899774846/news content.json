We love you so much but thats too much. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\n\nAnother posted: \u201cJustin, I love you so much. I know, that\u2019s ur body but can we, your belieber, ask you to stop having tattoo? Thats too much. Love you\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Reilly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-bieber-fan-arrested-for-trespassing-at-los-angeles-home-2152853", "title": "Justin Bieber fan arrested for trespassing at his Los Angeles home", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Justin Bieber fan arrested for trespassing at his Los Angeles home", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber fan arrested for trespassing at his Los Angeles home", "description": "Justin Bieber fan arrested for trespassing at his Los Angeles home", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/justin-bieber-fan-arrested-for-trespassing-at-los-angeles-home-2152853", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2017-10-24T11:27:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Justin Bieber fan arrested for trespassing at his Los Angeles home", "title": "Justin Bieber fan arrested for trespassing at his Los Angeles home", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/GettyImages-805742236_BIEBER_CHURCH_1000.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/8e4f9f-j-5Y?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1508844442.0, "source": "http://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
