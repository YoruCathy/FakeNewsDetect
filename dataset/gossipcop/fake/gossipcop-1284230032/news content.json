In an appearance on Bravo\u2019s Watch What Happens Live, Lawrence not only got to hang out with two of her favorite housewives, but she finally cleared up one of the few unverified, false rumors about her that she was actually O.K. with. So, is Jennifer Lawrence secretly dating Brad Pitt?\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve met him once in like 2013, so it was very random,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, I also wasn\u2019t like, in a huge hurry to debunk it.\u201d\n\nSince his separation from Angelina Jolie in September 2016, Brad Pitt has been rumored to be dating everyone from the average Los Angeles civilian to Lawrence, but he\u2019s yet to confirm anything about his personal life.\n\nLawrence was, however, in an actual relationship with Mother! director Darren Aronofsky. In her Vanity Fair cover story she confirmed that while they may no longer be dating, she still considers him a friend and creative partner.\n\n\u201cWe have an amazing friendship that started before the movie, then we had a partnership with the movie, and then we had a romance that came from the movie, so when you strip the romance away, we still have immense respect for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cAs clich\u00e9 as it sounds, we were good to each other. I read stuff all the time that I think would be perfect for Darren. And I think we\u2019ll work together again.\u201d\n\nDuring the Watch What Happens Live appearance, Lawrence also revealed the note that her friend Amy Schumer sent her after the Aronofsky breakup. \u201cWhen Darren and I first broke up. I told [Amy], and I was really sad,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cThe next day I got a bouquet of flowers delivered and I said, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI bring the bouquet of flowers in and there was a note that says, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry to hear you\u2019re gonna die alone. Love, Amy.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo top off the entire glorious appearance, host Andy Cohen then surprised Lawrence, a self-appointed reality-TV obsessive with a \u201cdinner party\u201d featuring Real Housewives of New York City cast members Luann de Lesseps and Bethenny Frankel, as well as a cardboard cutout of Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Scott Disick. Judging by her reaction, Lawrence seems perfectly fine being single with her housewives.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9489051d14714f6de44038/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-on-phantom-thread.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f73c0f45451fecd45d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f83c0f45451fecd45f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dd9221d14714f6de43f70/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/lede-Jennifer-Lawrence.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f83c0f45451fecd45f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9442f70acfa84d3c08ca2b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrence-03-2018-ss03.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood", "Erika Harwoo", "Krista Smit", "Inez", "Jessica Dieh", "Yohana Dest"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/jennifer-lawrence-brad-pitt-dating-rumors", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is Perfectly Fine with Those Brad Pitt Dating Rumors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "But, to be clear, they are not actually dating.", "id": "5a996bc8e6cd8a4072c5d81b", "keywords": "celebrity,jennifer lawrence,brad pitt,darren aronofsky,vanities", "news_keywords": "celebrity,jennifer lawrence,brad pitt,darren aronofsky,vanities", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a996bc8e6cd8a4072c5d81b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"But, to be clear, they are not actually dating.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "But, to be clear, they are not actually dating.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is Perfectly Fine with Those Brad Pitt Dating Rumors", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/jennifer-lawrence-brad-pitt-dating-rumors"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "But, to be clear, they are not actually dating.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a996c73374b104fc486435a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/JLaw-Brad-Pitt.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is Perfectly Fine with Those Brad Pitt Dating Rumors"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
