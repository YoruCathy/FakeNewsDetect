Fans of the novel are of the opinion that Johnson and Dornan are \"horribly miscast\" for the lead actors' role \u2013 Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey.\n\n\"Fans should at least be seeing Jamie and Dakota out and about, if not talking to the press about the movie. Even paparazzi are having a hard time locating them,\" Celebs Dirty Laundry reported quoting sources.\n\nAccording to reports, Dornan is trying to shed Christian Grey's image from the Fifty Shades franchise, as he is looking for different roles in Hollywood for months now. Dornan does not want his fans to remember him only for his role in the Fifty Shades franchise.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has debunked the news and said that Dornan and Johnson are gearing up to promote the film, which is set for Valentine's Day release.\n\nFifty Shades Darker has been in the spotlight again for the wrong reasons. Earlier, the Celebs Dirty Laundry reported that critics are not happy with the sex scenes in the movie due to which Johnson and Dornan are forced to reshoot the scenes.\n\nCritics who saw the film laughed off watching Johnson and Dornan's intimate scenes. Though Johnson and Dornan tried hard to maintain the chemistry, they could not perform up to the mark, thus making the second instalment film worse than the first part.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop also debunked this report as well. The website quoting sources reported that the makers have wrapped up the film and the lead pair is not shooting the sex scenes again.", "images": ["https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/604818/fifty-shades-darker.jpg", "https://graphic1.ibtimes.co.in/www/img/logo-stack.png", "https://graphic1.ibtimes.co.in/www/responsive/latest/home.png"], "top_img": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/604818/fifty-shades-darker.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ankita Mehta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson-jamie-dornan-refuse-promote-film-711812", "title": "Fifty Shades Darker: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan refuse to promote the film?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "language": "english", "author": "Ankita Mehta", "copyright": "2020 IBTimes", "subject": "Fifty Shades Darker: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan refuse to promote the film?", "description": "Fifty Shades Darker, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, will hit screens on Valentine's Day at the worldwide box office.", "keywords": "Fifty Shades Darker,fifty shades darker promotion,dakota johnson,jamie dornan,Dakota john Jamie Dornan not to promote,Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson sex scenes,fifty shades darker sex scenes,Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson chemistry,Anastasia Steele Christian Gr", "article": {"published_time": "2017-01-11T12:22:16+05:30", "modified_time": "2017-01-11T12:22:16+05:30", "section": "Hollywood", "tag": "Anastasia Steele Christian Grey", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ibtimes.india"}, "og": {"title": "Fifty Shades Darker: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan refuse to promote the film?", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson-jamie-dornan-refuse-promote-film-711812", "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/604818/fifty-shades-darker.jpg", "description": "Fifty Shades Darker, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, will hit screens on Valentine's Day at the worldwide box office.", "type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times, India Edition"}, "DC.title": "Fifty Shades Darker: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan refuse to promote the film?", "DC.description": "Fifty Shades Darker, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, will hit screens on Valentine's Day at the worldwide box office.", "DC.subject": "Fifty Shades Darker,fifty shades darker promotion,dakota johnson,jamie dornan,Dakota john Jamie Dornan not to promote,Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson sex scenes,fifty shades darker sex scenes,Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson chemistry,Anastasia Steele Christian Gr", "news_keywords": "Hollywood,Fifty Shades Darker,Fifty shades darker promotion,Dakota johnson,Jamie dornan,Dakota john Jamie Dornan not to promote,Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson sex scenes,Fifty shades darker sex scenes,Jamie Dornan Dakota Johnson chemistry,Anastasia Steele Christian Grey", "syndication-source": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson-jamie-dornan-refuse-promote-film-711812", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"title": "Fifty Shades Darker: Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan refuse to promote the film?", "description": "Fifty Shades Darker, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, will hit screens on Valentine's Day at the worldwide box office.", "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/604818/fifty-shades-darker.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ibtimes_india", "domain": "www.ibtimes.co.in", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/fifty-shades-darker-dakota-johnson-jamie-dornan-refuse-promote-film-711812"}, "fb": {"pages": 134755750024728, "app_id": 1386147698272496}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484117536.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in", "summary": ""}
