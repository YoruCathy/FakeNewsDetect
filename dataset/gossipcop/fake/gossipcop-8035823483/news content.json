Grand Central Publishing is tentatively scheduled to release the Jenner book in the spring of 2017.\n\nRumors have swirled about a possible book deal for Ms. Jenner since last April, when she announced that she was becoming a woman during an interview with Diane Sawyer that drew nearly 17 million viewers.\n\nThe interview was followed by a Vanity Fair cover story, written by Mr. Bissinger, in which Ms. Jenner revealed her new identity as Caitlyn, and described her decades-long struggle with gender dysphoria. The flurry of publicity culminated in the premiere of a documentary series on E!, \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d which will begin its second season this March, about Ms. Jenner\u2019s new public life as a woman.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2016-01-19T13:30:08.000Z", "modified": "2016-01-19T13:30:02.000Z", "section": "Books", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/alexandra-alter", "tag": "Bissinger, Buzz", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000004151962, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/37719de1-5cc0-5a4c-9ad9-ef24fa3d3c1c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/d5afbe5887704a5984a97f788d75c0b7", "description": "Ms. Jenner will write the book, tentatively scheduled to be released in the spring of 2017, with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "byl": "By Alexandra Alter", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": ",Caitlyn Jenner;Bruce Jenner,Books,Transgender;Gender Dysphoria,Grand Central Publishing,Buzz Bissinger", "pdate": 20160119, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "alt": "Caitlyn Jenner will write a memoir with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger."}, "description": "Ms. Jenner will write the book, tentatively scheduled to be released in the spring of 2017, with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation", "description": "Ms. Jenner will write the book, tentatively scheduled to be released in the spring of 2017, with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-articleLarge.jpg", "alt": "Caitlyn Jenner will write a memoir with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/37719de1-5cc0-5a4c-9ad9-ef24fa3d3c1c"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "books", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/37719de1-5cc0-5a4c-9ad9-ef24fa3d3c1c", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1453219200.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
