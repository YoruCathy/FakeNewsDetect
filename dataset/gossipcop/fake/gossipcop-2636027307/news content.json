The most common target was, unsurprisingly, the president, who has had a troubled relationship with celebrities and awards shows \u2014 including the Emmys. Some went hard against the Trump administration, while others skipped the takedowns, and instead highlighted causes and marginalized groups.\n\nHere are all the moments when honorees and presenters got topical:\n\nStephen Colbert was right at home\n\nThe evening\u2019s host had a prescription for those struggling with the tumultuous news cycle: watch TV! He opened the ceremony with the musical number \u201cEverything Is Better on TV,\u201d running through this year\u2019s sizable roster of options for escapism with cameos from the likes of Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Chance the Rapper. Of course there were digs about how House of Cards is beginning to feel like real life. The big finish: a battalion of Handmaid\u2019s Tale showgirls topped off the spectacle.\n\nColbert even looked at the camera and addressed President Trump directly. \u201cHello sir. Thank you for joining us. Looking forward to the tweets,\u201d he said. The hits only got more pointed from there.\n\n\u201cHowever you feel about the president, every show was influenced by Trump in some way. All the late night shows, obviously. House of Cards, the new season of American Horror Story, and of course next year\u2019s Latin Grammys hosted by Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\u201d\n\nPredictably, Colbert made a meal out of Trump complaining about his failure to snag an Emmy for his reality TV series Celebrity Apprentice.\n\n\u201cIf he had won an Emmy I bet he wouldn\u2019t have run for president. So in a way, this was all your fault,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cI thought you people loved morally compromised anti-heroes. You loved Walter White. He\u2019s just Walter much whiter.\u201d\n\nColbert hit Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Emmys are rigged\u201d gripe hard by playing actual footage from the presidential debate when Trump peppered in his remark that \u201cI should have gotten it,\u201d while Hillary Clinton was attacking Trump about his Emmy snub complaints.\n\nBut Trump doesn\u2019t have an Emmy, because as the host explained to huge applause, \u201cUnlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winner of the popular vote.\u201d\n\nSean Spicer rolled onstage\n\nColbert then segued into the cameo of the night. \u201cOf course what really matters to Trump is ratings. You got to have the big numbers. We have no way of knowing how big our audience is. Sean, do you know?\u201d\n\nThe audience lost it as Trump\u2019s former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer came out to assess the crowd size. When asked about how many eyeballs were on the show, Spicer delivered: \u201cThis will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys period \u2014 both in person and around the world,\u201d referencing his own controversial responses to contested reports about Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd size.\n\nTargets who weren\u2019t Trump\n\nColbert also went after Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s recent Twitter debacle. \u201cEveryone loves streaming video. Just ask Ted Cruz,\u201d he said, referencing the fact that Cruz\u2019s Twitter account recently \u201cliked\u201d a tweet from a porn account. \u201cBut knock first. You don\u2019t want to just walk in.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all about politicians, though. Colbert also blasted Real Time host and Emmy nominee Bill Maher for his controversial use of the N-word.\n\nJohn Lithgow nods to history\n\nThe Crown\u2019s Lithgow praised his character Winston Churchill\u2019s leadership in his supporting actor acceptance speech. \u201cIn these crazy times, his life reminds us what courage and leadership in government looks like.\u201d\n\nSaturday Night Live players address their political counterparts\n\nA tearful Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton, the main subject of her own political satire on Saturday Night Live, for her \u201cgrace and grit.\u201d\n\nAlec Baldwin opened his acceptance speech, for his SNL performance as Trump, with a dig about POTUS: \u201cAt long last I suppose I should say, here, Mr. President, is your Emmy.\u201d\n\n9 to 5 Reunion\n\nThe cast of the 1980 movie 9 to 5 \u2014 Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda \u2014 used their platform as presenters to take a stab at Trump, too. \u201cIn 1980, we refused to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss,\u201d Fonda opened. \u201cAnd in 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss,\u201d Tomlin added.\n\nLena Waithe\u2019s emotional speech\n\nAfter a standing ovation, Master of None\u2019s Lena Waithe accepted the award for Outstanding Writing of a Comedy Series with a message for her \u201cLGBTQIA family:\u201d \u201cI see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers \u2014 every day when you walk out the door and put on your imaginary cape and go out there and conquer the world because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it. And for everybody out there that showed so much love for this episode, thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer black girl from the South Side of Chicago.\u201d\n\nDonald Glover actually thanked POTUS in his second speech\n\nAtlanta auteur Glover gave Trump a shout-out for activating him. \u201cI wanna thank Trump for making black people the number one most oppressed group. He\u2019s the reason I\u2019m probably up here.\u201d\n\nVeep\u2018s political moment\n\nEmmy darling Julia Louis-Dreyfus won for her leading role on Veep, the HBO comedy about incompetence in the White House, and included a reference to POTUS. \u201cWe did have a whole storyline about impeachment but we abandoned that because we were worried someone else might get to it first.\u201d\n\nRiz Ahmed gave his causes a powerful dose of publicity\n\nWhen Ahmed won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or TV Movie for The Night Of, he used his speech to drive home a point. \u201cIf this show has shone a light on some of the prejudice in our societies, Islamophobia, some of the injustice in our justice system, maybe that\u2019s something. I will shout out South Asian Youth Action for helping me prepare for this, and the Innocence Project.\u201d\n\nNicole Kidman propelled domestic violence to the top of the agenda\n\nAfter winning an Emmy for her powerful portrayal of a domestic abuse survivor on Big Little Lies, Kidman closed her acceptance speech with a call to action. \u201cWe shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know, it is filled with shame and secrecy and by you acknowledging me with this award it shines a light on it even more.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.
