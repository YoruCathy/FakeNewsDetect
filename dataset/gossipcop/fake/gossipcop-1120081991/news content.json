Ivanka, who has a White House job as her one of her father's key advisors, was apparently told to take his place in the meeting while he briefly exited the room.\n\nA Russian official tweeted (and then deleted) a photograph of Ivanka Trump sitting in between British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The move was heavily criticized, as a BBC correspondent noted that when a President isn't available to take his seat in meeting for whatever reason, it is usually filled by a high-ranking member of his office.\n\nHere's a sample of the reaction from enraged social media users:\n\nIvanka Trump, unelected, unqualified, daughter-in-chief, is representing the US at the G20 summit next to May, Xi, Merkel.

Ivanka Trump went to the G20 instead of her dad \u2014 Will Black (@WillBlackWriter) July 8, 2017\n\nShe is no more competent than her father. America should be ashamed we are sending incompetent nobodies to international summits. \u2014 Laurie Payne (@ljpne) July 8, 2017\n\nThis pic of Ivanka seated next to the Pres China and PM of UK is disturbing.
