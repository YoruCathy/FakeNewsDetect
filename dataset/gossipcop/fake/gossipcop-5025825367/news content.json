Gossip Cop can debunk this claim. We\u2019re told the reality star hasn\u2019t had her baby just yet.\n\nAn article posted on OK!\u2019s website on Thursday theorizes that Kardashian has given birth because she hasn\u2019t posted a selfie in nearly a week. The reality star actually did post a photo of herself Sunday on Easter, but the site baselessly speculates it\u2019s an old picture.\n\nThe unreliable tabloid goes on to say it\u2019s \u201csuspicious\u201d that Kardashian wasn\u2019t at her family\u2019s Easter party over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely strange for her to miss the big event,\u201d adds the publication. Actually, it\u2019s not. Kardashian is currently in Cleveland, where her boyfriend Tristan Thompson lives and where she plans to give birth. The Kardashian-Jenner clan threw their Easter bash in Los Angeles.\n\nAdditionally, Kardashian tweeted on Wednesday night that she was still \u201cnesting\u201d by relaxing and watching \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York City.\u201d Meanwhile, Us Weekly reported that Kris Jenner plans to be by her daughter\u2019s side when she gives birth, but the momager hasn\u2019t arrived in Cleveland as of yet. E! also confirmed on Monday that Kardashian \u201cis still resting and relaxing at home.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, Kardashian revealed on her website on Wednesday that she\u2019s still in \u201cthe final stretch of pregnancy\u201d and can\u2019t wait for her baby to arrive, even noting she\u2019s staring to get \u201cimpatient.\u201d Regardless of the overwhelming amount of proof that the reality star didn\u2019t give birth over Easter, Gossip Cop still checked in with a source close to the situation, who confirms she hasn\u2019t delivered yet.\n\nIt should be noted, the birth of Kardashian\u2019s baby is imminent. It\u2019s likely the reality star will welcome her child any day now, but it simply didn\u2019t happen last weekend. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not surprised OK! got the story wrong. This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had to call out the magazine for publishing a bogus report surrounding the reality star\u2019s pregnancy.\n\nLast month, Gossip Cop busted the unreliable outlet for falsely claiming that Kardashian had been rushed to the hospital with pregnancy complications. That never happened, and this latest article speculating the reality star already gave birth is equally inaccurate.", "images": ["http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/legal.svg?v=2", "http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/screenshot_aplication.png", "http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/world.svg", "http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/flag_dark.svg?v=2", "http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/sidebar_statistics.svg", "http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/main_logo.svg", "https://s3.gossipcop.com/up/2018/04/Khloe-Kardashian-Birth-Easter-542x395.jpg", "http://theworldnews.net/ui/images/paper.svg"], "top_img": "https://s3.gossipcop.com/up/2018/04/Khloe-Kardashian-Birth-Easter-542x395.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Did NOT Give Birth Over Easter, Despite Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "(Getty Images) Khloe Kardashian did not give birth over Easter weekend, despite inaccurate speculation.
