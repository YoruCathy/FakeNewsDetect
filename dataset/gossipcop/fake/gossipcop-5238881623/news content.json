Announced two days after the president\u2019s rally in Phoenix, the pardon comes before Arpaio, who spoke at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention, has even been sentenced following his July conviction of criminal contempt for disregarding a court order in a racial profiling case. In defense of the move, the administration is citing Arpaio\u2019s long history of military and law enforcement service.\n\nThe Arpaio pardon comes on the heels of Trump officially putting into place his ban of transgender people serving in the military, and simultaneously, as controversial White House aide Sebastian Gorka resigned.\n\nMany celebrities and political figures strongly criticized the moves and their timing on social media, calling the president a \u201cracist,\u201d \u201cmonster,\u201d and \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cTransgender Ban & Arpaio pardon on the same day, hiding behind the news of Hurricane Harvey,\u201d tweeted House of Cards creator Beau Willimon. \u201c@realDonaldTrump is a hateful, cowardly menace.\u201d\n\nRead more reactions below.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "title": "Celebs rip 'racist' and 'cowardly' Trump for pardoning former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Donald Trump", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump", "description": "Don Cheadle, Debra Messing, and more ripped Trump for his many controversial decisions on Friday.", "og": {"title": "Celebs Rip 'Racist' and 'Cowardly' Trump for Pardoning Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "description": "As much of the country is tracking the arrival of Hurricane Harvey, the Trump administration has taken the term \u201cFriday news dump\u201d to a new&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "description": "Don Cheadle, Debra Messing, and more ripped Trump for his many controversial decisions on Friday.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/08/25/celebs-react-trump-pardon-joe-arpaio/", "title": "Celebs Rip 'Racist' and 'Cowardly' Trump for Pardoning Former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio", "description": "Don Cheadle, Debra Messing, and more ripped Trump for his many controversial decisions on Friday.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-joe-arpaio-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503590400.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
