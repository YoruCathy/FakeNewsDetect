It was released as the album's second single on May 16, 2018 by RCA Records, impacting hot adult contemporary radio and contemporary hit radio on June 19 and May 28, respectively.[1][2] Aguilera co-wrote the song with Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Raul Cubina and Jon Bellion, while the production was handled by the latter.\n\n\"Fall in Line\" is centered around lyrical themes of female empowerment, being recognized as a feminist anthem.[3] The song received positive response from music critics, who commended Aguilera and Lovato's vocal deliveries, as well as the lyrics and the inspiring theme. Commercially, \"Fall in Line\" made minor impact on charts, but reached top-forty positions in Hungary and the digital charts of Greece, Spain and the United States. For promotion, an accompanying lyric video was uploaded onto Aguilera's official YouTube channel simultaneously with the song's release, followed by a music video directed by Luke Gilford. The singer also performed it on several occasions, including the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden, 2018 Billboard Music Awards, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Today Show. The song was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.[4] This marked Aguilera's twentieth Grammy nomination and Lovato's second Grammy nomination.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nAguilera described the song: \"I wrote 'Fall in Line' a few years ago before all this news came out [Time's Up and Me Too movement]. It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood. So I've always wanted to be that advocate for women and anybody that was struggling to have their own voice. I watched my mom have to be submissive, watch her Ps and Qs or she's gonna get beat up. You can either be, unfortunately, so damaged by it that you take a turn for the worse, or you can feel empowered by it and make choices to never go down that route.\"[5] In November 2018, the track's songwriter and producer Jon Bellion revealed that at one point, Beyonc\u00e9 had tried to secure the song for the R&B duo Chloe x Halle.[6]\n\nIn June 2018, Aguilera appeared on DJ Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show, giving an interview about Liberation. The singer explained that the track was committed to everyone that felt disempowered, adding: \"It's a message that I've preached [...] I think the chorus can fit anybody's feeling if they feel repressed, or oppressed, or whatever's going on in their lives that they feel they need to come to their own realization\". Aguilera also revealed that she decided to work with Lovato because it was important to choose someone that is vocal about their own struggles and past, stating: \"I wanted somebody that could 'come to play', and she put so much heart and passion into it [...] I teared up when I first heard her vocal on it. I sent her flowers and I was just like, 'Oh my God, you took it to the next level'\".[7]\n\nRelease and promotion [ edit ]\n\n\"Fall in Line\" premiered on May 16, 2018, at 8 a.m. EST, and was released commercially for digital download worldwide at the same time.[8] Aguilera stated in a tweet: \"To anyone who's ever felt silenced and repressed, the truth seekers and bold thinkers...may you liberate your voice and break the mold, never back down, and never fall in line.\"[9]\n\nRecording and composition [ edit ]\n\nAguilera co-wrote \"Fall in Line\" alongside Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Jon Bellion, and Raul Cubina, while the production was handled by Jon Bellion.

She added: \"It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood.
