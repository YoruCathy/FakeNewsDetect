For that reason alone trans people deserve something vital. They deserve your respect.\u201d\n\nJenner, formerly known as 1976 Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, received the award to recognize \u201cthe courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years,\u201d according to ESPN.\n\nBruce Jenner, who said he has long suffered from gender confusion and told ABC earlier this year that he identifies as a woman, was re-introduced to the world as Caitlyn Jenner on June 1 with a flashy photo spread and feature story in Vanity Fair magazine.\n\nLater that day, ESPN announced plans to give Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, which is presented \u201cto individuals whose contributions transcend sports.\u201d\n\n\u201cBruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but the ESPYs are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,\u201d ESPYs executive producer Maura Mandt said.\n\n\u201cShe has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.\u201d\n\nPrevious recipients of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award include Muhammad Ali, Jim Valvano, Pat Tillman, Robin Roberts and Nelson Mandela. Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, received the honor last year.\n\nThe selection of Jenner to receive the award has generated some criticism \u2014 notably from sportscaster Bob Costas, who dubbed the choice \u201ccrass exploitation.\u201d\n\nSome critics suggested that the honor should have gone to Lauren Hill, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor but continued to pursue her dream of playing college basketball.\n\nThe Indiana native made the team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and played in four games \u2014 while helping to raise more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research.\n\nHill died on April 10 at age 19.\n\nHours before the ESPYs ceremony, organizers announced in a statement to USA Today that Hill will be honored during the show \u2014 noting that the recognition had always been planned, but was not previously announced.\n\nThe ESPY Awards honor celebrities from sports and entertainment to recognize major sports achievements and salute \u201cleading performers and performances.\u201d\n\nGolden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry received the best male athlete award, beating a field that also included Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Houston Texans defensive end J.J.
