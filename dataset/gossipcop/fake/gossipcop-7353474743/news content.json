The model wrote,\n\n\u201cHow did this get approved by an entire marketing team? Why is okay to tell young kids being fat = ugly?\u201d\n\nHolliday also tagged the film\u2019s star, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, asking her to comment on the advertisement. Dozens of Twitter users did the same, understandably disgusted by the body-shaming poster.\n\nNow, Moretz has finally chimed in on the controversy. In a series of tweets, the 20-year-old actress said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the ad, and it hadn\u2019t been approved by her or her team.\n\nThe actress wrote,\n\n\u201cI have now fully reviewed the [marketing] for Red Shoes, I am just as appalled and angry as everyone else, this wasn\u2019t approved by me or my team. Pls know I have let the producers of the film know. I lent my voice to a beautiful script that I hope you will all see in its entirety. The actual story is powerful for young women and resonated with me. I am sorry for the offense that was beyond my creative control.\u201d\n\nIronically, the film is about celebrating yourself for who you are. An overview on the Red Shoes website reads,\n\n\u201cA normal girl born into extraordinary circumstances, she\u2019s a Princess who doesn't fit into the celebrity world of Princesses \u2014 or their dress size. She wants to stay true to herself but Fairy Tale Island is all about looks, so it makes it hard not to be like the others. In her quest to find her lost father, she learns not only to accept herself, but to celebrate who she is, inside and out. And to let the beauty within \u2014 the beauty that Prince Merlin falls in love with \u2014 shine brighter than anyone else in the land.\u201d\n\nMore on body-shaming:\n\nAccording to CNN, the film\u2019s marketing team has already cut the body-shaming campaign in its entirety. Unfortunately for them, once something is on the internet, it\u2019s there forever \u2014 and it\u2019s unlikely people are going to forget about this anytime soon.\n\nWatch: Model Myla Dalbesio's Body-Positive Poem", "images": ["http://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "http://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/593030eb34dd9342700a83ea/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-632329528.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gillian Fuller", "Gillian Fulle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-red-shoes-and-the-7-dwarfs-ad", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Speaks Out About Body-Shaming 'Red Shoes And The 7 Dwarfs' Ad", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Gillian Fuller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz addressed the body-shaming 'Red Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs' advertisement in a series of Tweets on Wednesday.", "id": "59301f0b34dd9342700a83e7", "keywords": "body,chlo\u00eb grace moretz,body-shaming,tess holliday,chloe grace moretz,body shaming", "news_keywords": "body,chlo\u00eb grace moretz,body-shaming,tess holliday,chloe grace moretz,body shaming", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59301f0b34dd9342700a83e7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz addressed the body-shaming 'Red Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs' advertisement in a series of Tweets on Wednesday.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/593030eb34dd9342700a83ea/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-632329528.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/593030eb34dd9342700a83ea/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-632329528.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actress says the advertisement wasn't approved by her team.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Is \"Appalled\" At Her New Movie's Body-Shaming Ad", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-red-shoes-and-the-7-dwarfs-ad"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "The actress says the advertisement wasn't approved by her team.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Is \"Appalled\" At Her New Movie's Body-Shaming Ad"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
