A representative for Victoria Beckham shut down the gossip to Harper's BAZAAR UK, saying, \"This is nonsense.\" A rep for David Beckham also denied rumors.\n\n\"There is no statement due, no divorce,\" a spokeswoman for the couple also told The Sun, calling the speculation \"fake social media news.\" \"This is all very bizarre and an embarrassing waste of time,\" the rep added.\n\nThe Beckhams have been married for 18 years after tying the knot in July 1999 in a posh ceremony at a castle in Ireland. They share four children together: Brooklyn, 19, Romeo, 15, Cruz, 13, and Harper, 6.\n\n\n\nThe couple was last seen out together at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on May 19 at Windsor Castle. \"It was just the best day,\" the fashion designer and former Spice Girl previously said of the big event.\n\nGetty Images\n\nJust this morning, Victoria shared a sweet note to David on Instagram, saying she misses him. \"Morning cuddles x So much love \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb We love and miss u @davidbeckham \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95,\" she captioned an image with their daughter Harper.\n\nIn fact, both Beckhams are apt to share heartfelt family moments on Instagram, from joint outings and vacations to down time at home.\n\nVictoria and David met at a Manchester United players' lounge, and she described it as \"love at first sight\" in an open letter to her younger self in 2016. The designer noted that Beckham was standing with his family while his teammates drank at the bar, which reminded her about her close relationship with her own family. She added that David later asked for her number on a London-to-Manchester plane ticket\u2014which he still has.\n\nDavid credited their long-lasting marriage to having a \"strong family unit,\" he told BBC in a 2016 radio interview. \"Of course you make mistakes, and we all know that marriage is difficult at times. It is about working through it,\" the star athlete said. \"We have come up against tough times. But we know each other better than anyone else knows us. And we talk.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"Do we stay together because it is a brand? Of course not. We stay together because we love each other and because we have four amazing children.\"\n\nSince linking up in the '90s, the Beckhams have been known for acing the art of couple style, from matching leather get-ups to royal wedding-worthy wardrobes.
