In fact, saying that he\u2019s sorry for his past has been one of the premiere promotional tools for his highly-anticipated follow-up to 2013 compilation Journals.\n\nEven before he kicked off his notorious string of bad behavior in 2013 and 2014, however, Bieber has been offering mea culpas to fans for his actions, whether intentionally or accidentally terrible. Here are 22 of the 22-year-old\u2019s best apologies.\n\n1. Apology for ignoring British fans (2010)\n\n\u201cWish I could have come out from the performance at the Mayfair but security wouldn\u2019t let me. For those girls who cursed me out for it, I\u2019m sorry, but sometimes I need to listen to security so no one gets hurt. But I like your attitude. The UK goes hard.\u201d\n\n2. Apology for ignoring Brazilian fans (2011)\n\n\u201cLove when the press think I\u2019m annoyed because I look tired. I\u2019m just tired. It\u2019s normal. I\u2019m not a machine. I\u2019m in Brazil!! Not annoyed. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\n3. Apology for ignoring French fans (2012)\n\n\u201cThe other day in the airport I got surrounded by 20 paps. I don\u2019t like small spaces, and I just wanted to get on the plane. I ran to get through the gate and there is a video of me running by fans and on the other side you don\u2019t see the 20 paps. I would never run by my fans. For those that I did pass that day I AM SORRY. I know my fans are my everything. I know my responsibility to love them. I LOVE MY BELIEBERS.\u201d\n\n4. Apology for flipping off paparazzi (2011)\n\n\u201cHad a great bday and at the end of the night [Selena and I] got surrounded by paps and I reacted in a way I know better. I\u2019m sorry. #killthemwithkindness. It\u2019s not always easy but I know better than to react in anger.\u201d\n\n5. Apology for throwing up onstage (2012)\n\n\u201cI know that you guys don\u2019t judge me, do you? You love me just the same, even though I\u2019m throwing up all over the stage. You love me that much?\u201d\n\n6. Apology to Bill Clinton after cussing him out on video (2013)\n\n\u201cThanks for taking the time to talk, Mr. President. Your words meant a lot. #greatguy\u201d\n\n7. Apology for canceled show (2015)\n\n\u201cI look forward to the opportunity to give my UK beliebers a great show in the near future and hope to honor my commitment to [the Prince\u2019s] Trust at that time.\u201d\n\n8. Apology for canceled TV appearance (2010)\n\n\u201cJust want to let my people in Germany know I won\u2019t be on Wetten Dass tonight as an accident has taken place and we all don\u2019t think it is right to continue \u2026 I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t perform tonight but some things are more important than putting on a show.\u201d\n\n9. Apology for smoking weed (2013)\n\n\u201cI also heard he got busted for smoking weed,\u201d Bieber said in a Saturday Night Live sketch in reference to himself. \u201cAnd he\u2019s really sorry about it. And people make mistakes. And he\u2019s never gonna do it again.\u201d\n\n10. Apology to China and Japan after visiting a controversial Tokyo shrine honoring fallen WWII soldiers, including war criminals (2014)\n\n\u201cWhile in Japan, I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine. I was misled to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. To anyone I have offended, I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan.\u201d\n\n11. Apology to Argentina for mishandling the country\u2019s flag onstage (2013)\n\n\u201cPeople throw stuff on my stage all show and I get it to the stage hands to get off so no one got hurt. That video I saw a bra and thought it was a shirt. I\u2019m being told by my team it was a shirt, but even if it was a flag I would never do anything to disrespect Argentina or the fans.\u201d\n\n12. Apology for walking off stage (2015)\n\n\u201cSadly, it\u2019s been a rough week for me, long days no sleep while having to be \u2018on\u2019 as they would say for cameras, fans, etc. In no way did I mean to come across mean but chose to end the show as the people in the front row would not listen \u2026 I don\u2019t always handle things the right way but I\u2019m human and I\u2019m working on getting better at responding, not reacting.\u201d\n\n13. Apology for naked butt (2015)\n\n\u201cI deleted the photo of my butt on Instagram not because I thought it was bad but someone close to me\u2019s daughter follows me and she was embarrassed that she saw my butt and I totally wasn\u2019t thinking in that aspect. I felt awful that she felt bad. To anyone I may have offended I\u2019m so sorry. It was completely pure-hearted as a joke but didn\u2019t take in account there are littles following me!!!\u201d\n\n14. Apology to Love Live anime fans for a poorly worded tweet\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for getting my otaku Beliebers\u2019 hopes up, but I\u2019m still not really sure which words in a sentence you need to capitalize so it ended up looking like I tweeted the title of the show.\u201d\n\n15. Apology for racist joke (2014)\n\n\u201cAs a kid, I didn\u2019t understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes but didn\u2019t realize at the time that it wasn\u2019t funny and that in fact my actions were continuing ignorance.\u201d\n\n16. Apology for another racist joke (2014)\n\n\u201cFacing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever dealt with. But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger. I just hope that the next 14-year-old kid who doesn\u2019t understand the power of these words does not make the same mistakes I made years ago. At the end of the day I just need to step down and own what I did.\u201d\n\n17. Apology to Ellen (2015)\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just cool to be able to laugh at yourself. I\u2019ve done some things. That might not of been the greatest. I just want to be able to own up to some of the things.\u201d\n\n18. Apology for appearance on Ellen (2015)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a minute since I\u2019ve done a public appearance, and I didn\u2019t want to come off arrogant or conceited or basically how I\u2019ve been acting the past year, year and a half.\u201d\n\n19. Apology for apologizing (2015)\n\n\u201cPeople often forget that [I\u2019m human], even with their comments and stuff they think it doesn\u2019t get to me, but it gets to me. Things that people say bother me, and I gotta be strong enough to keep it pushing. That\u2019s why I wanted to make a video, just to let people know that I\u2019m human \u2026 I\u2019m passionate about being better and growing so I think that this is going to be an awesome chapter in my life.\u201d\n\n20. Apology at Comedy Central Roast (2015)\n\n\u201cThere was really no preparing me for this life. I was thrown into this at 12-years-old and didn\u2019t really know what I was getting into. There\u2019s been moments I\u2019m really proud of and moments I\u2019m pretty disappointed in myself for.\u201d\n\n21. Apology to mom (2015)\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for this woman, let\u2019s just say I would have had a way LONGER stupid phase. I love you and thank you for not giving up on me!\u201d\n\n22. Apology for not apologizing (2015)\n\n\u201cIs it too late now to say sorry? Yeah I know that I let you down. Is it too late to say I\u2019m sorry now?\u201d", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.rollingstone.com&path=%2Fmusic%2Fmusic-news%2Fall-apologies-22-times-justin-bieber-said-sorry-41634%2F&ct=article&lob=rollingstone&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=41634", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-215991-GettyImages-494723598.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RS-Get-The-Magazine-Free-Tote.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-215991-GettyImages-494723598.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brittany Spanos", "Staff Writer", "Brittany Spanos'S Most Recent Stories", "Rina Sawayama Is The Pop Moment On Her Debut Album", "Sawayama", "Lauren Jauregui Praises Social Distancing In New Song", "Sam Smith", "Demi Lovato Announce", "I M Ready", "For Love With New Song"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/all-apologies-22-times-justin-bieber-said-sorry-41634/", "title": "All Apologies: 22 Times Justin Bieber Said \u2018Sorry\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#df3535", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Rolling Stone", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2018/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cropped-rs-favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "application-name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "From ignoring fans to throwing up on stage, Justin Bieber has had many reasons to atone.
