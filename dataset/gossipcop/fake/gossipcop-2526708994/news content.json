A wild new report claims that newly single Angelina Jolie is \u2018getting close\u2019 with none other than Hollywood bachelor, Jared Leto. OMG!\n\nDid Angelina Jolie, 41, trade ex Brad Pitt, 53, in for a slightly younger model? It\u2019s hard to believe anyone would want to pass on Brad, but Star magazine is reporting that Angelina is cozying up to Jared Leto, 45. Whoa!\n\n\u201cThere has always been a spark between them,\u201d a source told the magazine inside their February 27 issue. \u201cNow, during these tough times for Angie, it seems Jared has helped her cope and even brought her out of her funk. They\u2019re kindred, unconventional spirits \u2014 so much so that I think Jared could be the perfect guy for Angie if she\u2019s ever ready for a new love in her life.\u201d\n\nThat is some seriously heavy romance talk. The sources added that Angelina and Jared have shared some \u201csecret\u201d time together since it was revealed she would be divorcing Brad. Even better? \u201cJared reached out to Angie after she filed divorce papers in September,\u201d an insider claimed. \u201cThe word is they spoke several times on the phone before meeting up in L.A. for dinner, and they\u2019ve been seeing each other whenever they can since then.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how Jared and Angie would even know each other, they\u2019ve co-starred in two films together over the years. The first was 1999\u2019s Girl, Interrupted, and the second was 2004\u2019s Alexander. Interestingly, Jared has also worked with Brad, as they co-starred in 1999\u2019s Fight Club. Small world, right?\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 Do YOU think Angie and Jared would make a cute couple?
