Following fan speculation that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 45, was planning to split from husband Joe Giudice after she posted an Instagram photo with a divorce attorney, Teresa clarified that she was simply at dinner with a friend.\n\nAs previously reported, Teresa posted a photo to Instagram on Saturday, January 6, posing with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, \u201cDinner with a great friend getting great advice\u201d before quickly changing it to \u201cDinner with a great friend lots of laughs\u201d with the hashtag \u201c#webothlovefood.\u201d\n\nDuring Teresa\u2019s Wednesday, January 10, appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. \u201cI was helping her. Just in case \u2013 If anybody\u2019s getting divorced, she\u2019s a great divorce attorney to call,\u201d she explained. \u201cGet it? I was helping her.\u201d\n\nGorga, 38, chimed in, \u201cOh, you\u2019re saying you were publicizing her,\u201d to which Teresa said, \u201cYes! Capisce? Capisce.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with two women sitting together and shooting the breeze,\u201d Teresa continued. \u201cTalking about growing up?\u201d\n\nGorga, who happened to be at the same restaurant that night, also recalled her initial confusion when she approached the pair at dinner to say hello. \u201cI was like, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and she was like, \u2018I\u2019m so and so\u2019 and Teresa\u2019s like, \u2018She\u2019s a divorce attorney,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Huh?\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Teresa also opened up about the months-long period that she didn\u2019t visit her husband, who is currently serving time for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. \u201cMy mom got sick, so I didn\u2019t see him the whole time my mom was sick, those three months,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember the one day I was going to see him, that\u2019s when my dad got sick, and then I had to turn around and go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there was a chicken pox breakout there, in the prison, so we weren\u2019t allowed to go see him,\u201d she continued. \u201cOh, and then they found contraband from other inmates!\u201d\n\nHowever, Teresa, who also served 11 months in prison in 2015 for fraud, isn\u2019t exactly eager to return to jail \u2013 even to visit Joe. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t really enjoy going there,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when I was [in prison], I was like, \u2018Don\u2019t come!'\u201d\n\nThe couple has been plagued by divorce rumors in recent months, however two after before Teresa posted the photo with Forge-Kyriakoulis, the television personality\u2019s attorney James Leonard Jr. shut down the speculation. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain\u2019t happening. Period,\u201d Leonard told Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cWhy can\u2019t people accept the fact that these two people simply want to stay married to one another and let them live their lives?\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-wwhl.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-joe-giudice.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-wwhl.jpg?crop=287px%2C14px%2C673px%2C353px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-wwhl.jpg?crop=287px%2C14px%2C673px%2C353px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teresa-giudice-opens-up-about-her-dinner-with-divorce-lawyer/", "title": "Teresa Giudice Opens Up About Her Dinner With Divorce Lawyer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Teresa Giudice defended her dinner with a divorce lawyer \u2013 find out what happened", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Teresa Giudice Opens Up About Her Dinner With Divorce Lawyer", "description": "Teresa Giudice defended her dinner with a divorce lawyer \u2013 find out what happened", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teresa-giudice-opens-up-about-her-dinner-with-divorce-lawyer/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-11T16:52:15+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-wwhl.jpg?crop=287px%2C14px%2C673px%2C353px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-wwhl.jpg?crop=287px%2C14px%2C673px%2C353px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-01-11T16:11:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-11T16:52:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Teresa Giudice defended her dinner with a divorce lawyer \u2013 find out what happened", "title": "Teresa Giudice Opens Up About Her Dinner With Divorce Lawyer", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/teresa-giudice-wwhl.jpg?crop=287px%2C14px%2C673px%2C353px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515687111.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
