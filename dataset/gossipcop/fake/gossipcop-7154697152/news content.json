So many people have been awesome to us\u2026 Even though we\u2019ve lost Heather, our lives have been enriched in so many ways.\u201d\n\nBro also says that she feels sorry for James Alex Fields Jr., who she believes thought hate was going to solve the world\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cAll I keep thinking is how sad for his mother. She\u2019s lost her son, too,\u201d Bro said. \u201cHe\u2019s lost every chance he has in life. There\u2019s no life left for them now.\u201d\n\nBro hopes the takeaway message from the tragedy is to be aware of what\u2019s going on in the world and to know that doing the right thing never involves hate or violence.\n\n\u201cHeather\u2019s message was always, \u2018If you\u2019re not outraged, you\u2019re not paying attention,\u2019\u201d Bro said.\n\nBut Bro said that while a lot of people equate outrage with anger, it is important to remain positive.\n\n\u201cAnger doesn\u2019t have to go to hate and to violence,\u201d Bro said.\n\nEllen surprises Susan with a $50,000 donation to the Heather Heyer Foundation, courtesy of Shutterfly.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nThursday\u2019s show also features the first exclusive appearance by international superstar Miley Cyrus before the release of her highly anticipated new album.\n\nCyrus will perform the title track off her upcoming album \u201cYounger Now.\u201d\n\nEllen also chats with Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt via live shot from Houston. J.J. started a fundraising campaign to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey which has currently raised over $7.5 million.\n\nWTVR DAYTIME, AFTERNOON AND EVENING LINEUP\n\n9 a.m. \u2014 \u201cVirginia
