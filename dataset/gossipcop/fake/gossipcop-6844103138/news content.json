Just going to get straight to it, no! There is a public persona of the guy who looks at you directly in the eye and shakes your hand and hugs you and is an attentive person to you and there\u2019s the person behind the mask who is a completely different person,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cSomeone could say we all have that \u2014 what we are to the public and who we are behind the scenes, but the people who are around Tom and work for Tom, not even people who are Scientologists, they will say he is diabolical,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve worked with me will say I can be an a-----e \u2014 all actors can be. That is different. He\u2019s very similar to David Miscavige, they could be twins.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Remini\u2019s spoken publicly about the most famous Scientologist in the world \u2014 in an interview with Larry King late last year, she said she suspected Cruise thought she was \u201cthe devil\u201d for leaving the religion.\n\n\u201cTom and most Scientologists, all Scientologists, are taught to believe that people like me are literally the devil, that we mean them harm,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTom is very well-aware of what is Scientology, truthfully. He is very well-aware that it\u2019s an organization that is defrauding people out of their lives.\n\n\u201cBut in his heart, I believe he believes it.\u201d\n\nAsked by another Reddit user how she\u2019s now treated by Scientologists in Hollywood, Remini responded:\n\n\u201cThey ignore me and walk out of rooms.\u201d\n\nThis comes just days after \"Handmaid\u2019s Tale\" actress and lifelong Scientologist Elisabeth Moss reportedly left the room at the Television Critics Association Awards when Remini took to the stage to accept an award.\n\n\u201cElisabeth Moss believes that she can\u2019t talk to me,\u201d told Remini in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published three days after the incident.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a thing in Scientology called \u2018acceptable truth.\u2019 It means you only say what\u2019s acceptable to the public. But she believes that I\u2019m an anti-social personality \u2014 because I\u2019ve spoken out against Scientology. So she isn\u2019t allowed to talk to me. And me knowing that, I wouldn\u2019t put her in the awkward position.\u201d\n\nMoss does appear alongside Cruise\u2019s ex-wife Nicole Kidman, who is believed to have left the church after their 2001 divorce, in the new season of drama \"Top Of The Lake.\"The pair also appear together in an hour-long roundtable video interview with The Hollywood Reporter:\n\nThis article originally appeared in
