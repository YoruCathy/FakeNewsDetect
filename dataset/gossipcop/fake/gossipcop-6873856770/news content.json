Her parents divorced when she was less than a year old and she has had a dysfunctional relationship with her actor father, Jon Voight, their previous estrangement playing out in the public sphere with barbs traded back and forth.\n\nWhile Brad is said to share a close bond with his siblings Jolie went a step further when she famously locked lips with her only sibling, brother James Haven, at the Oscars in 2000.\n\nJolie has also admitted to enduring rebellious and turbulent years during her teens and 20s, describing periods of self-harm and drug use saying she had used \u201cjust about every drug possible,\u201d particularly heroin.\n\nJolie had been married twice before she met Brad to British actor Jonny Lee Miller and Billy Bob Thornton while Brad had only been married once before to Aniston.\n\nJolie turned up to her first wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt with the groom\u2019s name written in blood and wore the blood of her second husband in a vial around her neck.\n\nBrad and Aniston\u2019s marriage was however seen as the perfect union of two big stars. Aniston, the wholesome actress we came to love on hit show Friends, seemed to slot perfectly into the Pitt family.\n\nAfter their divorce in 2005, which came about after Brad and Jolie admitted to falling in love on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, Aniston still kept a foot in the Pitt family with Jane unable to let go of the daughter-in-law she loved so much.\n\nDoug revealed to Star magazine in 2006 that his mother still spoke to Aniston on the phone every single week.\n\n\u201cBrad is not happy about mum talking to Jennifer. He feels that mum should move on now, and cut the link that was there. But she is in a difficult position \u2014 she has great affection for Jennifer \u2014 born out of the fact Brad once loved her and did marry her.\u201d\n\nBut Doug changed his tune in a 2007 interview with People saying it was not odd that the two remained friends.\n\n\u201cJennifer is a friend of Brad\u2019s,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be a friend of ours?\u201d\n\nThe pair are still so close that when Aniston married Justin Theroux she reportedly invited Jane to witness the nuptials.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s closer to her than she is to her own mother Nancy and it just feels right,\u201d a source told The Sun.\n\nWith such contrasting upbringings, a mother-in-law who still has such a strong connection to the ex, and a scandalous union Jolie always seemed out of place in the Pitt family.\n\nRadar Online, quoting Star, reports that Jolie was reportedly mortified after Jane wrote a letter to a Missouri newspaper condemning same-sex marriage and President Barack Obama\u2018s re-election.\n\nJane wrote, \u201cAny Christian should spend much time in prayer before refusing to vote for a family man with high morals, business experience, who is against abortion, and shares Christian conviction concerning homosexuality just because he is a Mormon.\u201d\n\nJolie and Brad are both big supporters of same-sex marriage, previously stating they wouldn\u2019t get married until it was legal in the US.\n\n\u201cJane has never wanted to talk politics with Angelina,\u201d a source allegedly told Star as reported by Radar Online.\n\n\u201cShe knew it would cause greater issues for them, and she wanted to try to have a relationship with the mother of her grandkids. She never thought her letter would be such a big deal.\u201d\n\nPrevious reports also suggest that Jolie was unimpressed when Jane bought femine clothes for tomboy Shiloh.\n\nBut regardless of their differences, and whether there is any truth to the reports of fueding, Jane and Jolie always seemed to be in good spirits when spotted out in public.\n\nAnd in 2013 when Jolie revealed she had decided to undergo a double mastectomy, citing genetic predispositions towards breast cancer, Jane had nothing but support for her.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re so very proud of Angie. This means so much to our family especially our grandchildren. We love her dearly,\u201d she said as reported by Perez Hilton.\n\nOnly time will tell whether Jolie and Jane will have the kind of long-lasting relationship that she shares with Aniston after the divorce is finalised.", "images": ["https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/74be640c840d02c20af9463da69a5b65", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4b33b10ee0c049b600c53c92fc4492b0", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3cada8d1f198289453081cf6447a692a", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?path=components.nav-primary&t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a41d917ffcdfad6aa534dcba1f6b1038", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/899551da0deb1ae3c91c8738f2a74f6b", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b165ec991996faf89eb8a60bd5e0fe75", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/8e3ecfb9c831bc764e40b97954873485", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cbfa1025f6f8de391e9f2fef9c5ba1a2", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/98cfd47be1e0f29c1a7826248e13cd00", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/e6542ad40efe3b837013e370c06602d1?t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/bodyandsoul/fragment/thumbnail", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/6c0861dbf662b939287e9d4fb487bd9f?t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/bodyandsoul/fragment/thumbnail", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f969d629d8b5463cd72b32a907c4f4da", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/ab46f25ddf125ce2f0c56cd216c4dd3b?t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/bodyandsoul/fragment/thumbnail", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/chartbeat/live/toppages/v3/?esi=true&host=news.com.au&limit=5&section=entertainment&sort_by=internal&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/bodyandsoul/fragment/trending&td_heading=trending%2520in%2520entertainment&td_showcount=true&td_showimages=true&type=article", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?articleGMT=10&path=components.footer-desktop&t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/37c528d4d89042e2c0dc15f101d6edb5", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1fc2539da2be8632113e7c5a29abb0b8", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?esi=true&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_channel=desktop&td_domain=news.com.au&td_pagetype=story&td_section=entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template/?path=components.header-desktop&t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2?includeRelated=true&pageSize=8&query=(contentType:NEWS_STORY%2520AND%2520paidStatus:NON_PREMIUM%2520AND%2520domains:news.com.au%2520AND%2520categories.value:%2522%252Fdisplay%252Fnewscorpaustralia.com%252FWeb%252FNewsNetwork%252FEntertainment%2520-%2520syndicated%252FLife%252Fhooks%2520up%2520and%2520break%2520ups%252F%2522)&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/standalone/readnext/more-in&td_module-header=celebrity+life&td_storyID=083b539f0317f3f0029676e6ef3c88e8", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/340cb7cdac57540a9b027fa61d36c538", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/f8f3c04086f03f4a06886c4f64b8680c?t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/bodyandsoul/fragment/thumbnail", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/61dade57f4b7224bf8bad578454dd126", "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/76799c1cc1e43fda720467af8ca8368a", "https://i1.wp.com/pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9882787a7813dcabf5e9bf3e423ed843?t_domain=news.com.au&t_product=newscomau&t_template=s3/ncatemp/bodyandsoul/fragment/thumbnail"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/899551da0deb1ae3c91c8738f2a74f6b", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/how-did-jolie-the-tattooed-and-outspoken-actress-fit-into-the-all-american-pitt-clan/news-story/083b539f0317f3f0029676e6ef3c88e8", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt divorce: how actress fit into the clan", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "tcog", "articleid": "083b539f0317f3f0029676e6ef3c88e8", "article": {"published_time": "2016-09-23T03:39:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-09-23T08:42:37.000Z", "publisher": "News Limited", "author": "Staff writer", "publicationdate": "23/09/2016"}, "description": "SHE was accused of breaking up Brad Pitt\u2019s marriage to Jennifer Aniston, a woman beloved by his mother.", "keywords": "Angelina Jolie;
