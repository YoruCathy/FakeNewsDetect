If you aren\u2019t familiar with the theory, this blogpost dating back to 2011 from a Brazilian site should bring you up to speed. The basic idea is that Lavigne, who was at the peak of her career at the time, committed suicide after her grandfather\u2019s death in 2003. Rather than coming to terms with what had happened, Lavigne\u2019s record company used Melissa Vandella \u2013 Lavigne\u2019s doppleganger who was supposedly hired to pose as Lavigne for paparazzi \u2013 in her place to profit off of her celebrity.\n\nAs the story goes, Vandella then went to record \u201cUnder My Skin\u201d as Lavigne (\u201cFrom here it was no longer the real Avril,\u201d the blog post reads, \u201cbut \u2018Avril Lavigne\u2019 under the skin of the other singer\u201d) and left subtle hints along the way about what had really happened. That, along with pictures of how Lavigne\u2019s face and handwriting had changed, was all the proof they needed.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem. As Buzzfeed explained in an article titled \u201cHere\u2019s How I Accidentally Made An Old Avril Lavigne Death Hoax Go Viral,\u201d that Brazilian post made it clear at the beginning that it was created to show \u201chow conspiracy theories can look true.\u201d And yet, despite that disclaimer, the theory quickly spread like wildfire thanks to the Buzzfeed writer sharing the conspiracy theory as a joke with his fellow Americans following a visit to Buzzfeed Brazil.\n\nWhich brings us to today. Late last week, Twitter used @givenchyass brought the conspiracy theory back to life with a long thread explaining it all. It begins with this tweet, which has over 100,000 retweets and 160,000 favorites:\n\navril lavigne is dead & was replaced by a look alike: a conspiracy theory thread pic.twitter.com/9eearQ2rte \u2014 ?
