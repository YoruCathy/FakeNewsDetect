Aerial photos published by TMZ indicate the pool\u2014reportedly clocking in at 20-by-60 feet\u2014is already well in development, although it's unclear when it will be complete. TMZ also reported that the Wests spent another $12,000 on building a new guard shack. Whether this is specifically to deter would-be skinny-dippers, or if it's just another add-on to their already tight security team, is unclear.\n\nThere's no word on who designed the pool, but it would not be surprising if it turned out to be Kanye West himself. In May, the multihyphenate added another hyphen when he announced he was starting a new architecture firm called Yeezy Home. \"We\u2019re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better,\" he wrote on Twitter. As Architectural Digest reported, this wasn't just a ploy to expand his r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014he worked with Axel Vervoordt on the Hidden Hills home, sharing photos of its Zen Brutalist aesthetic on Twitter.\n\nIt would also not be surprising if West got pretty hands-on in the construction of his new pool. In a previous interview with Architectural Digest, Kim Kardashian West revealed that her husband is quite the builder. \"My husband makes all of his own furniture in his office,\" she said. \"My office is all Vincent Van Duysen, but Kanye is so good at it, he loves to draw out pieces. Axel made a couch in our house called the 'Kanye couch' because Kanye designed it with him.\"", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg", "http://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-reverse.13d6d4955ed232771a3c921b77513eaddd3ac58b.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg", "http://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-header.4beb0fb9c7bbd6bb98b552777bf0f8c6e71764c1.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evelyn Wang", "Evelyn Wan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-50k-pool", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Are Reportedly Building a $50K Pool", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Evelyn Wang", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "TMZ reported it has obtained building permits appearing to show that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are building a 20-by-60-foot pool.", "id": "5b69b6486f48c85479ae3fa0", "keywords": "celebrity style,celebrity homes,snd,kim kardashian,kanye west", "news_keywords": "celebrity style,celebrity homes,snd,kim kardashian,kanye west", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b69b6486f48c85479ae3fa0", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"TMZ reported it has obtained building permits appearing to show that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are building a 20-by-60-foot pool.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "It's apparently 20-by-60 feet.", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Are Reportedly Building a $50K Pool", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-50k-pool"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ArchDigest", "description": "It's apparently 20-by-60 feet.", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b69b810e4ca455528fdf8f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-980333580.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Are Reportedly Building a $50K Pool"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
