The PTC\u00eds latest study, The \u010fNew\u0112 Tube, not only analyzes content in 280 of the most popular YouTube videos between March and October 2008 according to Compete Data Hub, but also takes into account the text commentary and advertisements that were available alongside the videos.\n\n\u010fJust as the number of entertainment options is growing by leaps and bounds with new and emerging technologies, so too are the risks that parents face when trying to protect their children from inappropriate material. Our study today marks the PTC\u00eds first foray into analyzing content in digital media, and as such we wanted to help parents with the most popular online video resource \u0116 YouTube,\u0112 said PTC President Tim Winter.\n\n\u010fWhile we applaud YouTube for its commitment to gating procedures and its recently announced plans to curb inappropriate content, the core implication of our analysis is that the site isn\u00edt doing enough to protect kids.\n\n\u010fChildren who use YouTube to search for video clips of their favorite stars like Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers are exposed to some of the most offensive profanity in the English language. Video searches for these popular terms showed that YouTube\u00eds gating procedures do not extend to text commentary.\n\n\u010fAnd despite YouTube\u00eds policy of not hosting sexually graphic videos, entering any number of popular search terms produced videos linked to ads for triple-X pornography \u0116 often without even requiring age verification.\n\n\n\n\u010fWith nearly half of boys and a third of girls ages 13-17 naming YouTube as one of their top three favorite websites, no parent can afford to ignore these findings. The results of this study should serve as a wake-up call for any parent concerned about graphic or indecent material on websites they perceive to be \u010esafe\u00ed for their children,\u0112 said Winter.\n\n\n\nMajor Findings:\n\n\n\nChildren entering such \u010fchild-friendly\u0112 search terms as Miley Cyrus, Jonas Brothers, High School Musical and Hannah Montana were confronted with highly offensive content in the accompanying text commentary posted by other site users:\n\nViewing 20 YouTube videos under each \u010fteen idol\u0112 search term produced a total of 422 instances of explicit content within the text commentary that accompanies the videos.\n\nAn average of 68% of those comments included profanity and 31% of the profanity was of the most offensive nature (e.g. the f, s, and b-words).\n\nThe 20 highest-ranked YouTube videos from each of the site\u00eds most popular search terms yielded an extraordinary amount of graphic and adult-themed content:\n\nFor example, 98 percent of the videos analyzed under the popular search term \u010fLil Wayne\u0112 did not require any form of age verification, despite containing high levels of explicit adult content. In fact, 50 percent of the videos that were associated with the rapper featured verbalized non-muted expletives, including the s-word, b-word, several variations of the f-word, and explicit references to human anatomy.\n\nTwenty-eight percent of the videos resulting from the search term \u010fporn\u0112 did not require any form of age verification.\n\n\u010fYouTube\u00eds status as the leading site for online video combined with the fact that more and more children are consuming entertainment media outside the confines of a television set underscore our demand for more responsibility,\u0112 Winter stated.\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/emailalerts/images/SA IPTV_logo_163x70.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/TVicon.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/square.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/FVC-Banner11(2).gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/news/release/2008/images/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/YouTube/newtube.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/Tivo/tivo_162x70_ss.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_07.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/images/medved.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_08.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/boone.1.c.162.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_09.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_04.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/ealerticon.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/joinus/images/Best%20Of%20America%20Logo.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_11.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/news/release/2008/images/nav/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_06.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_12.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/TEMPLATE_02.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/donatebanner.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/nav/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/images/Movieicon.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20081223093911im_/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/YouTube/newtube.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "PTC Analysis of YouTube Finds Explicit Content is One Click Away from Children", "meta_data": {"description": "PTC- A nonprofit organization dedicated to educating parents  about television content, improving the quality of prime time television, promoting family  friendly entertainment, restoring positive values, and making Television a socially responsible  medium -- the Parents Television Council based in Hollywood, California", "keywords": "Parents Television Council, PTC, TV, Television, family hour,  family guide, family friendly, media violence, sex, language, parents, clean up tv, trash tv,  children, vulgarity, filth, network, sponsor, Hollywood, responsibility, shows, programs, prime  time, entertainment, studies, statistics, reviews, best and worst, v-chip, ratings, video games,  album, movies, steve allen, brent bozell, archive, action alerts, e-alerts, insider, effects,  recommendations"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
