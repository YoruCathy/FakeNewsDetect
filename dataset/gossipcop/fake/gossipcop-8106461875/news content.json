She's painfully wealthy, with a TV show, branded products left and right and an appearance fee surely only rivaled by Hillary Clinton.\n\nHers is such a cushy life that she can listen to Kanye West any time she wants.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that a Twitter user called Kevin James offered a wry dig at her countenance.\n\nIs it me, or is @KimKardashian Sooo Self-absorbed.. even when she's saying Nothing.. lol.. & I Like the Kardashians #KUWTK -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018\n\nIf you've ever been attacked on Twitter, you have choices.\n\nYou can reply aggressively. This is rarely worth it with a troll.\n\nYou can ignore it and even block the person who directed their bile your way.\n\nYou can wait for your own fans to descend upon this poor individual and shred him from tweet to tweet.\n\nOr, you can be splendidly disarming.\n\nThis last path was the one taken by Kardashian.\n\nNo it's not you, I totally am! https://t.co/9ZxgPyVkko -- Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 22, 2018\n\nNot everyone can pull this off with a straight face.\n\nBut here, Kardashian showed she understood the emotional essence of her interlocutor.\n\nHis biggest problem was surely that he isn't Kim Kardashian.\n\nSo she brought him onto her side with something so blessedly charming that it not only made her seem entirely self-aware -- rather than merely self-absorbed -- but also must have enticed a chuckle from Kevin James himself.\n\nIndeed, it incited James to respond with quite considered contrition.\n\n@KimKardashian Listen: altho my tweet came across \"seemingly\" disrespectful, it was just a thought/tweet worthy reaction.. lol... No DisRespect.. .. & I Appreciate ur Sense of humor, & @cassbrunelle14 for calling me out.. lol.. props to the Kardashian Empire -- Kevin James (@kevinjames4good) January 22, 2018\n\nAnd so, without a word of insult, without so much as a miffed gesture, Kardashian took a situation that could have been emotionally straining and turned it into one the most pleasant feelings we have: laughter.\n\nWe'd all love to have that skill.\n\nOn truly good days, we find it.\n\nOn most other days, we walk away from a tense situation and only then do we start kicking ourselves that we didn't react a different way.\n\nHarnessing it surely takes practice. A lot of practice.\n\nSomething Kardashian has surely done.\n\nHow will you ever keep up with her?\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.", "images": ["https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/", "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/2015_SP_CM-39_69112.JPG", "https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0", "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_844545642_200013332000928042_341954.jpg", "http://www.incimages.com/inc-logo-black.png"], "top_img": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_844545642_200013332000928042_341954.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Owner", "Howard Raucous Llc", "The Opinions Expressed Here Inc.Com Columnists Are Their Own", "Not Those Of Inc.Com."], "canonical_link": "https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/kim-kardashian-just-offered-most-perfect-example-of-emotional-intelligence-youll-see-this-week.html", "title": "With 7 Well-Chosen Words, Kim Kardashian Just Offered the Most Perfect Example of Emotional Intelligence You'll See This Week", "meta_data": {"title": "With 7 Well-Chosen Words, Kim Kardashian Just Offered the Most Perfect Example of Emotional Intelligence You'll See This Week", "description": "Clever and, in its way, profound.", "syndication-source": "https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/kim-kardashian-just-offered-most-perfect-example-of-emotional-intelligence-youll-see-this-week.html", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Emotional Intelligence, Twitter, trolls, critics, handling criticism, emotions, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, TV", "og": {"title": "With 7 Well-Chosen Words, Kim Kardashian Just Offered the Most Perfect Example of Emotional Intelligence You'll See This Week", "description": "Clever and, in its way, profound.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/kim-kardashian-just-offered-most-perfect-example-of-emotional-intelligence-youll-see-this-week.html", "image": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_844545642_200013332000928042_341954.jpg", "site_name": "Inc.com"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1940x900/getty_844545642_200013332000928042_341954.jpg", "site": "@Inc", "creator": "@ChrisMatyszczyk", "url": "https://www.inc.com/chris-matyszczyk/kim-kardashian-just-offered-most-perfect-example-of-emotional-intelligence-youll-see-this-week.html", "title": "With 7 Well-Chosen Words, Kim Kardashian Just Offered the Most Perfect Example of Emotional Intelligence You'll See This Week", "description": "Clever and, in its way, profound."}, "fb": {"app_id": 139291179414843}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-23 19:13:14", "section": "Lead", "author": "Chris Matyszczyk"}, "robots": "noarchive", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width height=device-height", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516705994.0, "source": "http://www.inc.com", "summary": ""}
