But one thing we still don\u2019t know for certain is what the royal couple\u2019s combined net worth is now that they\u2019ve tied the knot.\n\nThe 36-year-old former Suits actress met Prince Harry back in 2016 after being set up on a blind date by a mutual friend. After dating for 15 months, Harry, who is sixth in line for the throne, popped the question during a quiet night in at Nottingham Cottage, the royal residence he calls home on the grounds of Kensington Palace. Six months later, the world-famous couple got married on May 19 at Windsor Castle. Meghan and Harry live together at Nottingham Cottage, though according to Architectural Digest, \u201cNott Cott\u201d is only their temporary digs. And while the newest royal couple is living at the cottage rent-free, being philanthropic, jet-setting newlyweds doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know Prince Harry and Meghan\u2019s net worth, and how much money they have as a married couple:\n\nWhat is Meghan Markle\u2019s net worth?\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s net worth far exceeds his wife\u2019s, but Meghan made a good living as an actress.\n\nShe was reportedly paid $50,000 per episode on the USA Network legal drama Suits, raking in a salary of about $450,000 per year, according to Fortune, with some additional income from film roles.\n\nWhile\u2019s Meghan\u2019s net worth was relatively easy to estimate before she married Harry, her finances are more complicated now that she\u2019s married to her prince.\n\n\u201cShe will continue to pay U.S. income tax on her income even after marrying Prince Harry, as the U.S. is one of two countries that taxes expats,\u201d said Marlene Koenig, a royal expert. \u201cShe cannot start the process of becoming a U.K. citizen until she is married three years, and when she has acquired British citizenship, she will need to make a decision on whether or not she renounces her U.S. citizenship.\u201d\n\nRoyal spouses are often encouraged to pursue philanthropy full-time, meaning Meghan will most likely not have any personal income to report in the future, especially since she already gave up her acting career to relocate for Harry.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle leave St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding.

Other reports speculate his net worth is as high as $40 million, but $25 million is the conservative estimate, Wealth-X told MONEY.\n\nBoth Prince Harry\u2019s private income and the money he receives to take care of official royal obligations come from the same place \u2014 The Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the public, private and charitable activities of the Prince of Wales \u2014 Prince Charles, Prince Harry\u2019s father \u2014 and his family. The estate has served the financial needs of the royal family since 1337, according to the estate\u2019s website.\n\nIn 2017, all official expenses incurred by Prince Harry, his brother Prince William and his sister-in-law Kate Middleton \u2014 including official state visits, royal staffing and wardrobe costs \u2014 cost around $4.9 million, and were paid for by The Duchy of Cornwall, according to official documents.\n\nHarry has even more in the bank when you look at his inheritance. Both William and Harry inherited half of their late mother Princess Diana\u2019s estate \u2014 which is estimated to be worth about \u00a320 million, or about $28 million \u2014 and the money was given to them when they each turned 30. \u201cIt has been suggested that William and Harry each received about \u00a310 million ($14 million) from their mother\u2019s estate, with Harry getting more because the money was invested longer for him,\u201d Koenig said.\n\nThe inheritance also included Princess Diana\u2019s personal jewelry collection, though it is unclear how much the jewels are worth.\n\nIn addition to Prince Harry\u2019s wealth from his inheritance from his mother\u2019s estate and his pay for royal obligations, he also earned a steady paycheck while serving 10 years in the British Royal Air Force \u2014 where he rose to the rank of captain before retiring. While he was working for the military, he made about $50,000, according to Forbes.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle leave St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding. Jane Barlow - PA Images/Getty Images\n\nWill Meghan inherit Prince Harry\u2019s fortune now that they are married?\n\nWhile Meghan and Prince Harry were legally married in May, the royal pair will likely wait to combine their finances, Koenig said.\n\nIf Markle and Harry open a joint bank account, their financial information could be open to scrutiny by U.S. regulatory bodies because Meghan is a U.S. citizen, according to Ryan Ellis, former tax policy director at Americans for Tax Reform. For that reason, the couple will probably keep their finances separate unless Meghan decides to gives up her U.S. citizenship.\n\nNow that they\u2019ve tied the knot, Queen Elizabeth \u2014 whose net worth is estimated to be around $490 million \u2014 has anointed Meghan and Prince Harry as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, just as Prince William and Kate Middleton became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Koenig said.\n\nMeghan initially received the official title of Henry of Wales \u2014 it is common to literally take the prince\u2019s name and title. But now that Harry is a duke, Meghan\u2019s title is Her Royal Highness Duchess of Sussex. Meghan will also take on any other titles the Queen bestows upon Harry. But because neither Meghan nor Kate Middleton come from royal blood, they will never officially be called \u201cprincess,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nWhat were the details of Meghan and Prince Harry\u2019s wedding?\n\nThe newest royal romance became official this spring when Meghan and Prince Harry tied the knot at Windsor Castle, just outside of London, on Saturday, May 19.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know the exact cost of their wedding, it is estimated to be around the same as Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s April 2011 nuptials. Luckily for them, the newlyweds did not foot the bill. Instead, their wedding was paid for by the royal family. The chapel they got married in, St. George\u2019s, is smaller than Westminster Abbey where Will and Kate got hitched, holding only about 800 guests compared to Westminster\u2019s 2,000.\n\nAimee Dunne, a London-based wedding planner, told CNN Money that she expected Meghan and Harry\u2019s actual wedding \u2014 excluding security costs \u2014 to total nearly $1 million. But security is where the real costs add up: Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s entire wedding reportedly cost $34 million with security alone totaling $32 million. The security costs for Harry and Meghan\u2019s celebration ere unclear since it wasn\u2019t an official occasion like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding.", "images": ["https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/prince-harry-meghan-markle-net-worth-royals.jpg?quality=85", "http://time.com/img/navigation/subscribe-icon.svg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/net-worth-prince-harry-meghan-markle.jpg", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/prince-harry-meghan-markle-net-worth.jpg"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/prince-harry-meghan-markle-net-worth-royals.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alix Langone"], "canonical_link": "https://money.com/prince-harry-meghan-markle-net-worth/", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Net Worth: What We Know", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "meghan markle, prince harry, prince harry meghan markle, meghan markle net worth, prince harry net worth, prince harry net worth 2017, meghan markle net worth 2017, prince harry age, prince harry engaged, british royal family net worth", "news_keywords": "meghan markle, prince harry, prince harry meghan markle, meghan markle net worth, prince harry net worth, prince harry net worth 2017, meghan markle net worth 2017, prince harry age, prince harry engaged, british royal family net worth", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are royal newlyweds.
