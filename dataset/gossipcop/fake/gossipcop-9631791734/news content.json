Then, a scantily clad onetime Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus, twerked up a storm at the MTV VMAs two years ago. Now, it\u2019s former Disney star Selena Gomez, 23, who\u2019s shed most of her clothing as part of an attempt to establish herself as a grown-up artist.\n\nAll eyes are on her new album, \u201cRevival\u201d (her first for Interscope), out Friday \u2014 or, more accurately, all eyes are on her album cover. It\u2019s got Gomez practically in her birthday suit, topless and wearing only barely there shorts.\n\nLike Disney alumni who have gone before, she\u2019s looking to shake things up with a new look and sound that are a world away from her previous, wholesome persona. The lyrics from the opening title track explain it plainly, as Gomez sings, \u201cNo more hiding . . . it\u2019s my time to butterfly.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been the easiest journey from child star known for kid shows such as \u201cBarney & Friends\u201d and \u201cWizards of Waverly Place\u201d to full-blown adult celebrity. After canceling an Australian tour to support her debut solo album, \u201cStars Dance,\u201d at the end of 2013, Gomez voluntarily entered Dawn at the Meadows recovery and rehab center in Arizona at the start of 2014. Rumors of substance abuse and addiction swirled \u2014 maybe brought on by her consorting with Justin Bieber (another onetime child star with his own set of troubles). But Gomez set the record straight this week, telling Billboard it was actually so she could get chemotherapy for lupus.\n\nShe returned later in the year with the single \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants,\u201d an obvious referral to her on-off relationship with Bieber, and her final release for Disney\u2019s Hollywood Records.\n\nBut Gomez turned over a new leaf this summer with the sultry, R&B-flavored single \u201cGood for You,\u201d featuring A$AP Rocky.\n\n\u201cWe definitely felt that the sexier sound of that song was a good progression for Selena,\u201d says Sharon Dastur, senior vice president of programming integration at iHeartMedia. \u201cAs you grow up, you want to try different things. It\u2019s not just a thing for ex-Disney artists \u2014 all young people feel that way.\u201d\n\nAnother sign of a maturing Gomez: She fired her mother, Mandy Teefey, and stepfather, Brian, as her managers. That, notes veteran Nashville-based entertainment lawyer Stephen Weaver, is a positive career move.\n\nManager-parents can cause problems for record labels. Weaver recalls pitching an artist with a father-manager to a powerful producer. \u201c[He\u2019d] had so many bad experiences with parents as managers that he refused to listen to it. He was afraid he would like it!\u201d\n\nAlthough Gomez is following a tradition of other young stars transitioning to adulthood, her \u201cRevival\u201d cover photo is about more than hitting the world over the head with sexuality. Gomez recently explained that it was a kiss-off to the body-shamers who have savaged her bikini body in the past online. \u201cI did start gaining weight, and I didn\u2019t mind it,\u201d she told the Los Angeles radio station Power 106 last month. \u201c[The comments were] really hurtful . . . but I\u2019m not gonna give a f \u2013 \u2013 k what people say. I\u2019m not gonna let them get to me.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/revival_-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/revival_-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/revival_-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hardeep Phull", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2015/10/09/why-selena-gomez-fired-her-mom-and-took-off-her-clothes/", "title": "Why Selena Gomez fired her mom and took off her clothes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
