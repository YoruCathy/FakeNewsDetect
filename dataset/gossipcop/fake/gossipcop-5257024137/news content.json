Georgina was one of the 22 people killed in Monday night's bombing at Manchester Arena at Ariana Grande's concert. But she was also a superfan of ABC's fantasy fairy tale series. She went to a convention to meet the likes of Emilie de Ravin (Belle), Rebecca Mader (Zelena), and Lana Parrilla (Regina), and was incredibly excited, documenting her amazing time in a Twitter thread spanning more than 70 posts. OH MY GOS I LOVE HER SOO MUCH SHEES SOO PRECIOUS \u2014 gina \ud83e\udd40 today! (@emiliesatwell) April 29, 2017\n\nIn one of the tweets, Georgina raved about getting the chance to speak with and have her picture taken with de Ravin, who plays Belle on the show.\n\nAnd it seems that meeting had left a huge impression on the actress, as she paid tribute to the superfan after learning that she had passed away.\n\nRIP @emiliesatwell remember meeting her last month.

My love and courage goes out to Georgina's family and friends and to all the families and friends of the victims last night. Praying for eternal peace for Georgina and all involved.\"\n\nDe Ravin wasn't the only Once Upon a Time star to reminisce, either.\n\nMader and Parrilla also shared their tributes, as well as Sean Maguire (Robin Hood) and Karen David (Jasmine).\n\nColin O'Donoghue (Hook) tweeted as well:\n\nsaddened to hear about the death of Oncer @emiliesatwell last night!!
