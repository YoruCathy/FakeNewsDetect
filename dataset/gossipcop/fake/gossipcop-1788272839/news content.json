Hosted by The Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, the night proved to be full of surprises.\n\nSweeping the movie awards was the critically-acclaimed musical La La Land, which broke the record for most wins by any one film. It won all seven of the categories it was nominated in, including a Best Actor statuette for Ryan Gosling, Best Actress for Emma Stone and Best Director for its auteur Damian Chazelle.\n\n\"There was something about these characters and what they're going through that feels very human and natural even in their fantastic circumstances,\" said Stone backstage, speaking of the Lionsgate movie-musical. \"Struggling and falling in love is something I think everybody can relate to in some way.\"\n\nHeavier fare also won out: the coming-of-age story Moonlight took home Best Picture, one of its six categories, while the August Wilson play adaptation Fences earned a nod for its female lead. \"It's not everyday Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen,\" said Best Supporting Actress winner Viola Davis of the movie, which grossed $40.7 million at the box office. \"It doesn't scream moneymaker, but it does scream art.\"\n\nOn the TV side, The Night Manager took home three awards, more than any other. (The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, The Crown and Atlanta, each took home two apiece.)\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of winners, in the order in which they were presented:\n\nMOVIES\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nAaron Taylor-Johnson, Nocturnal Animals\n\nBest Original Score\n\nLa La Land\n\nBest Original Song, Motion Picture\n\n\"City of Stars,\" La La Land\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nViola Davis, Fences\n\nBest Actor, Musical or Comedy\n\nRyan Gosling, La La Land\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nDamien Chazelle, La La Land\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nZootopia\n\nBest Foreign-Language Film\n\nElle\n\nBest Director\n\nDamian Chazelle, La La Land\n\nBest Actress, Musical or Comedy\n\nEmma Stone, La La Land\n\nBest Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy\n\nLa La Land\n\nBest Actor, Drama\n\nCasey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea\n\nBest Actress, Drama\n\nIsabelle Huppert, Elle\n\nBest Picture, Drama\n\nMoonlight\n\nTELEVISION\n\nBest Actor, Television Drama\n\nBillie Bob Thornton, Goliath\n\nBest Actress, Television Series Comedy or Musical\n\nTracee Ellis Ross, Black-ish\n\nBest Television Series Comedy or Musical\n\nAtlanta\n\nBest Performance by an Actress In A Mini-series or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nSara Paulson, The People v.
