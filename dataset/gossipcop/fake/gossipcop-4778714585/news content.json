So I waited. I wanted it to be great, and had I not waited a good year or two, I wouldn\u2019t have had the best songs I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Gomez.\n\nThe singer is currently in the process of \u201cfinishing up\u201d the third album and is yet to decide its release date.\n\nShe gave fans a taste of her new music by dropping Back to you on May 10, and quickly cleared up speculation suggesting the song is about her on-off romance with former boyfriend Justin Bieber.\n\nThe 25-year-old says the song was written with her hit TV drama 13 Reasons Why in mind.", "images": ["https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/gn_round_logo.png", "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2018/5/12/1_16a08497705.2220090_3094423567_16a08497705_medium.jpg", "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2018/11/07/tabloid_logo_new_resources1_16a085314ff_logo.jpg", "https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif"], "top_img": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2018/5/12/1_16a08497705.2220090_3094423567_16a08497705_medium.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://gulfnews.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-terrified-of-recording-new-album-1.2220091", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018terrified\u2019 of recording new album", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "fb": {"app_id": 1718868628348238, "pages": 143017562431177}, "twitter": {"site": "@gulf_news", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018terrified\u2019 of recording new album", "description": "\u2018Come & Get It\u2019 hit maker delayed her third album as she fears recording a flop", "image": {"src": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2018/5/12/1_16a08497705.2220090_3094423567_16a08497705_medium.jpg"}}, "description": "\u2018Come & Get It\u2019 hit maker delayed her third album as she fears recording a flop", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://gulfnews.com/entertainment/hollywood/selena-gomez-terrified-of-recording-new-album-1.2220091", "title": "Selena Gomez \u2018terrified\u2019 of recording new album", "description": "\u2018Come & Get It\u2019 hit maker delayed her third album as she fears recording a flop", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2018/5/12/1_16a08497705.2220090_3094423567_16a08497705_medium.jpg", "width": 540, "height": 405}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526109064.0, "source": "http://gulfnews.com", "summary": ""}
