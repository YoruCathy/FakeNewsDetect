With her expertise on the matter Saldana is back in the headlines for her assessment of how Hollywood treated Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory.\n\n\u201cWe got cocky and became arrogant and we also became bullies,\u201d she explained during an interview with the AFP. \u201cWe were trying to single out a man for all these things he was doing wrong\u2026 and that created empathy in a big group of people in America that felt bad for him and that are believing in his promises.\u201d\n\nWhile Saldana did not speak out in support of the president-elect\u2019s highly criticized offensive behavior, her comments were perceived to have been in defense of Trump, and many Twitter users were not here for it.\n\nZoe Saldana is only talking about us \"bullying\" Trump because she got dragged for years for starring in that awful \"Nina\" movie.
