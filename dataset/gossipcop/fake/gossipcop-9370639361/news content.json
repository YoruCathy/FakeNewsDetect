Only one show can come out on top in the ratings and Gwen Stefani, 48, has two big reasons to be cheering on The Voice. Her boyfriend Blake Shelton, 41, is still a star judge and she\u2019s a coaching alum herself. No offense to the \u201cRoar\u201d singer, but Gwen wants Blake\u2019s show to slay her AI. \u201cGwen has been totally supporting Blake and really wants him to kick Katy Perry\u2019s butt in the ratings war while The Voice goes against American Idol. Gwen is on Team The Voice all the way and is doing everything she can to help her man Blake come out on top while dueling Idol,\u201d a source close to Gwen tells HollywoodLife.com.\n\n\u201cGwen has been in his trailer watching tapings, giving Blake notes while sharing words of encouragement during the latest season of The Voice. She loves her man and gets turned on by his continued success. She loves that The Voice has been the best show on TV every season for years and thinks it\u2019s all because of Blake,\u201d our insider continues.\n\n\u201cGwen has been keeping a close eye on Katy and all the action on Idol too. Since her time on the show, Gwen has always felt a part of The Voice family and is into all the competition between the singing reality shows. Now she wants to see Blake, Adam (Levine) and the rest of The Voice stars continue to produce the best reality show on TV,\u201d our source adds.\n\nThis could end up being a tight battle. One thing that Idol has going for it is Katy has been making headlines for her antics while doing their nationwide search for contestants. In the two episodes that have aired so far, she already fell over and nearly flashed her hoo-hah under her super short dress. Then she literally stole the first kiss of a chaste young 19-year-old singer who had been saving the smooch for his first love. That kind of sexy behavior is getting plenty of buzz for the ABC show. It had a solid 10.3 million viewers when it debuted on March 11 so we will see what kind of ratings threat it will be to The Voice in the weeks to come.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gwen-supporting-blake-to-kick-american-idols-butt-ftr.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F16%2Fgwen-stefani-supporting-blake-shelton-the-voice-ratings-american-idol%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3039933", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gwen-supporting-blake-to-kick-american-idols-butt-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/16/gwen-stefani-supporting-blake-shelton-the-voice-ratings-american-idol/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Supporting Blake Shelton To Kick Katy Perry & \u2018American Idol\u2019s Butt In Ratings War", "meta_data": {"description": "Gwen Stefani is cheering on 'The Voice' to crush Kary Perry's 'American Idol' in the ratings as the shows go head to head.", "news_keywords": "American Idol, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, The Voice", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani Supporting Blake Shelton To Kick Katy Perry & \u2018American Idol\u2019s Butt In Ratings War", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/16/gwen-stefani-supporting-blake-shelton-the-voice-ratings-american-idol/", "description": "Gwen Stefani is Blake Shelton\u2019s biggest cheerleader as \u2018The Voice\u2019 takes on\u2019American Idol.\u2019 We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she wants him to kick ratings butt\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gwen-supporting-blake-to-kick-american-idols-butt-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 352, "alt": "Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton And Katy Perry"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-16T04:49:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-16T04:52:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Gwen Stefani Supporting Blake Shelton To Kick Katy Perry & \u2018American Idol\u2019s Butt In Ratings War"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gwen-supporting-blake-to-kick-american-idols-butt-ftr.jpg?w=620", "alt": "Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton And Katy Perry"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gwen Stefani Supporting Blake Shelton To Kick Katy Perry & \u2018American Idol\u2019s Butt In Ratings War", "description": "Gwen Stefani is cheering on 'The Voice' to crush Kary Perry's 'American Idol' in the ratings as the shows go head to head."}, "author": "Beth Shilliday", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/16/gwen-stefani-supporting-blake-shelton-the-voice-ratings-american-idol/?ia_markup=1"}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Celebrity & Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521129600.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
