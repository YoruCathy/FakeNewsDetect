It even begins with a literal casting-out of devils: A recording of a young girl (apparently taken from Instagram), saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want no devils in the house! We want the Lord!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe exorcism performed, the track quickly moves into the prophesied gospel: \u201cWe on an ultra light beam \u2026 This is a God dream \u2026 This is everything,\u201d West sings. Though the track, a clear highlight, is packed with guests, the runaway star is Chance the Rapper. Even setting aside the rising star\u2019s overflowing talent, featuring him at the top of the album was a brilliant bit of casting: Not only has Chance started combining hip-hop and gospel himself (the track also features gospel artist and past Chance collaborator Kirk Franklin), but he is a longtime Kanye superfan, for whom finally getting to work for West is itself a sort of religious moment. As Chance says, \u201cI met Kanye West/ I\u2019m never going to fail.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n2. \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d\n\nAfter opening with the gospel sounds of Pastor T.L. Barrett\u2019s \u201cFather Stretch My Hands,\u201d this two-parter quickly moves from the sacred to the profane. As Wests raps at the top of the opening verse, over a Metro Boomin beat, \u201cNow if I f--k this model/ And she just bleached her asshole/ And I get bleach on my T-shirt/ I\u2019mma feel like an asshole.\u201d\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 2\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a sample from Street Fighter II (\u201cPerfect!\u201d) brings Part 1 to a close, Part 2 turns confessional, as West reflects on the calamities his family has faced, including his mother\u2019s tragic death, his father\u2019s struggles with money, and his own nearly fatal car crash. The day of the album\u2019s release, West tweeted the lyrics, saying, \u201cI cried writing this. I love my Dad.\u201d But West has always embraced contradictions, and these confessional lyrics play over a repeated sample of \u201cPanda\u201d\u2014a swaggering, a street-tough track from new G.O.O.D. music signee Desiigner\u2014all before a melancholy vocoder coda that sounds like Imogen Heap.\n\n\n\n4. \u201cFamous\u201d\n\nAgain, gospel and cursing, sacred and profane. This one opens with Rihanna singing over church organ, seconds before West delivers what has instantly became the most controversial line on the album: \u201cFor all my Southside niggas that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d TMZ cites unnamed sources \u201cdirectly connected with Swift\u201d to claim that Swift approved the line beforehand, understanding it was just a joke. Swift\u2019s publicist has denied this, saying, \u201cKanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single \u2018Famous\u2019 on her Twitter account.\u201d The publicist continued, \u201cShe declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message,\u201d and added, \u201cTaylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, \u2018I made that bitch famous.\u2019 \u201d For his part, West is more or less sticking by his story:\n\nFirst thing is I\u2019m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n2nd thing I asked my wife for her blessings and she was cool with it \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n3rd thing I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop like the word Nigga \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n5th thing I\u2019m not even gone take credit for the idea\u2026 it\u2019s actually something Taylor came up with \u2026 \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\nShe was having dinner with one of our friends who\u2019s name I will keep out of this and she told him \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\nI can\u2019t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous! #FACTS \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\nThe rest is, lyrically, fairly straightforward: West raps about being famous and how it makes others jealous. But the sonic collage is all over the place, from the Swizz Beatz beat to the samples of Sister Nancy\u2019s reggae classic \u201cBam Bam,\u201d to, on the outro, a sample of Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cDo What You Gotta Do.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. \u201cFeedback\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis song finds another way to pun on the idea of the album as gospel: \u201cY\u2019all heard about the GOOD news?\u201d, referencing the origins of the word gospel in order to make a pun about his own GOOD Music label. West raps over a beat seemingly constructed from audio feedback, one of his best. The subject matter, meanwhile, is wide-ranging, with West telling listeners to \u201cWake up, nigga, wake up!\u201d Is this a reference to staying woke? It\u2019s hard to say, but, elsewhere on the track, West leaves no room for doubt about his allegiance to Black Lives Matter, rapping, \u201cHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us/ Hands up, hands up, and the cops shot us.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. \u201cLow Lights\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLow Lights\u201d is essentially an extended intro to \u201cHighlights,\u201d with the two tracks returning to the same template set up at the top of the album: \u201cLow Lights\u201d is a jubilant one-minute intro that rejoices in God (albeit over melancholy piano chords, with DJ Mustard-style synth bass slathered on top), before \u201cHighlights\u201d brings things back down to earthly temptations.\n\n\n\n7. \u201cHighlights\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m wishing that my dick had GoPro/ So I could play that shit back in slo-mo/ Just shot an amateur video. I think I should go pro.\u201d That begins to sum up the conceit of the song: for Kanye West, some nights are nothing but highlights.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, this possible first single (West has said that he and Young Thug will perform the song on Saturday Night Live on Saturday) maintains that jocular tone throughout, with memorable lines like \u201cI bet me and Ray J\u2019d be friends,/ if we ain\u2019t love the same bitch./ Yeah, he might have hit it first/ Only problem is: I\u2019m rich.\u201d A reference to Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna\u2019s sexercise regimen also suggests that this verse was recorded in the last two or three weeks. Of course, West has been making sexercise jokes since the first album, and he ends the song with another new workout plan.\n\n\n\n8. \u201cFreestyle 4\u201d\n\n\n\nRemember when I said that TLOP isn\u2019t all the anti-Yeezus? This \u201cfreak dream\u201d would have fit right in on that album and marks the beginning of TLOP\u2019s turn toward more nightmarish material. Like Yeezus\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m in It,\u201d this freaky sex fantasy is a mix of horror sounds (hear those Bernard Herrmann-esque strings?) and explicit lyrics (here they\u2019re mostly about getting it on in public). Surely some fans will, as West later puts it, \u201cmiss the old Kanye.\u201d\n\n\n\n9. \u201cI Love Kanye\u201d\n\n\n\nThis charming a-cappella interlude finds West speaking directly to (and for) his fans, as he addresses those who have been disappointed with West\u2019s Yeezus-era sourness and aggression and want the cuddly, soul-sampling Kanye back. He returns to that friendlier mode here, while offering no apologies for his recent work. As he says at the song\u2019s highly quotable closing:\n\nWhat if Kanye made a song about Kanye\n\nCalled \u201cI Miss the Old Kanye\u201d\n\nMan, that would be so Kanye. That\u2019s all it was, Kanye.\n\nWe still love Kanye, and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n10. \u201cWaves\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to West, the late addition of this song is the reason the album got delayed an extra day, but the wait was worth it. Another uplifting/vulgar track in the vein of the Chance collaboration that opens the album, \u201cWaves\u201d finds West mixing braggodocious bars (\u201cStep up in this bitch like/ I\u2019m the one your bitch like\u201d) with a more somber message about death, or the legacy of relationships: \u201cEven when somebody go away/ the feelings don't really go away/ That\u2019s just the wave.\u201d\n\nI wrote and arranged and fought for Waves, and I make great decisions. S/o to @chrisbrown I been a fan since day one \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf \u2014 Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) February 14, 2016\n\n11. \u201cFML\u201d\n\n\n\nThough the title of this one puns on the teen-slang acronym for \u201cF--k my life,\u201d make no mistake: This is a dark song that finds West pondering self-destruction. It\u2019s only appropriate, then, that West also gets an assist from R&B\u2019s leading poet of self-destruction, the Weeknd, who sings the titular phrase on the chorus, \u201cWish I would go ahead and fuck my life up/ Can\u2019t let them get to me/ And even though I always fuck my life up/ Only I can mention me.\u201d West even makes mention\u2014not for the first time\u2014of the anti-depression and anti-anxiety drug Lexapro, something with which he seems to have personal experience. Before, he complained about the side effects, and this time he talks about what happens when you go off it.\n\n\n\n12. \u201cReal Friends\u201d\n\nThis is the first song from The Life of Pablo that was available in a studio version before, and it doesn\u2019t seem to have undergone any significant changes. As before, it\u2019s a confessional song, with \u201cBlame Game\u201d-esque production (built around another melancholy piano loop). But while \u201cBlame Game\u201d was about a breakup, this one is about the struggle to maintain relationships with friends. Once again, everyone is to blame: West for staying too busy to keep up (\u201cI guess I get what I deserve, don\u2019t I?\u201d), and West\u2019s friends for concealing hidden self-interests.\n\n\n\n13. \u201cWolves\u201d\n\nThis is another one we\u2019d heard before\u2014both at Yeezy Season 1 and on SNL\u2019s 40th anniversary special\u2014but unlike \u201cReal Friends,\u201d it\u2019s changed a lot. The most notable change is that in place of the old verses from Vic Mensa and Sia, the song now features a new verse from West and an outro from longtime collaborator Frank Ocean. That new verse\u2014delivered over the same blend of heavy, ominous-sounding bass and soaring (howling?) falsetto that anchored the original track\u2014fleshes out the song\u2019s central metaphor. In it, West imagines himself and wife Kim Kardashian as the rap game Joseph and Mary, before worrying about his two children: \u201cCover Nori in lambs\u2019 wool/ We\u2019re surrounded by wolves \u2026 Cover Saint in lambs\u2019 wool/ We\u2019re surrounded by the f--kin\u2019 wolves.\u201d\n\n\n\n14. \u201cSilver Surfer Intermission\u201d\n\n\n\nThis interlude marks the transition from the album West played at MSG to what could almost be considered the deluxe-edition bonus tracks. In itself, it\u2019s not much more than West trying to get the last word on a recent beef: After Wiz Khalifa came at West for naming the album Waves (briefly, before changing it once again), claiming that West was stealing from the so-called \u201cwavy movement\u201d pioneered by Max B., West plays a message from Max B. that gives the album his blessing.\n\n\n\n15. \u201c30 Hours\u201d\n\n\n\nThis late addition, premiered on Friday, opens with a sample of disco producer and composer Arthur Russell\u2019s \u201cAnswers Me,\u201d which repeats in various forms throughout. The lyrics start with West\u2019s smoothie-drinking life in the present day before he reflects back on an affair for which he drove 30 hours across the country, and then 30 hours back. An aura of disappointment looms over this flashback (and I\u2019m not just talking about how West\u2019s paramour eats all his Popeye\u2019s), which also finds the rapper referencing Nelly and taking some typically unnecessary shots at an ex. (\u201cMy ex says she gave me the best years of her life,\u201d he raps, \u201cI saw a recent picture of her\u2014I guess she was right.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n16. \u201cNo More Parties in L.A.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs this back on the album due to popular demand? The long-awaited first collaboration between Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West became a fan favorite after West shared it in mid-January, but it briefly disappeared from West\u2019s ever-evolving tracklists. Thought it\u2019s Lamar who\u2019s known for rapid-fire raps, the Madlib-produced showcase centers around West rattling off rhymes for almost four minutes straight. As he says a few minutes in, \u201cSome fans thought I wouldn\u2019t rap like this again.\u201d I guess this is that \u201cold Kanye\u201d?\n\n17. \u201cFacts\u201d (Charlie Heat Version)\n\nWhile many fans were outraged to see \u201cNo More Parties in L.A.\u201d briefly disappear from the tracklist, fewer were sad about the prospect of losing this Nike diss track. In what amounts to a parody of \u201cJumpman\u201d from Nike pitch man Drake and his collaborator Future (West even borrows the flow), West brags about the success of his Yeezy shoes. That said, as West made extra clear as he debuted the new version of the song (from GOOD music producer Charlie Heat), he has no beef with the original Jumpman himself, Michael Jordan. (Still, he couldn\u2019t help but add: \u201cPeople come to Madison Square Garden to see me play one-on-no-one.\u201d)\n\n", "images": ["http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2011/09/29/hugo_chavez_caption_contest/the_life_of_pablo.jpg.CROP.promovar-mediumlarge.jpg", "http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/jcr:content/logo.gif", "https://pv.surveywall-api.survata.com/s?eid=2ca7ac88-8963-4abf-acff-c1114097be96", "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/14/kanye_west_s_new_album_the_life_of_pablo_a_track_by_track_breakdown/509641972-kanye-west-performs-during-kanye-west-yeezy-season-3-on.jpg.CROP.promo-large.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fw53_-Tq3MNK1.gif", "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/14/kanye_west_s_new_album_the_life_of_pablo_a_track_by_track_breakdown/509641972-kanye-west-performs-during-kanye-west-yeezy-season-3-on.jpg.CROP.promo-xlarge2.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18406752&c3=&c4=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/14/kanye_west_s_new_album_the_life_of_pablo_a_track_by_track_breakdown.html&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1"], "top_img": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/14/kanye_west_s_new_album_the_life_of_pablo_a_track_by_track_breakdown/509641972-kanye-west-performs-during-kanye-west-yeezy-season-3-on.jpg.CROP.promo-large.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/02/14/kanye_west_s_new_album_the_life_of_pablo_a_track_by_track_breakdown.html", "title": "Kanye West\u2019s new album The Life of Pablo: A track-by-track breakdown.", "meta_data": {"description": "After three name changes and more than a year of teases, Kanye West premiered his first album since 2013\u2019s Yeezus on Thursday.
