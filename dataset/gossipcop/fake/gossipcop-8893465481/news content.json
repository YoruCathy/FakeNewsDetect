Most recently one outlandish claim was made about the star and her attempts to make some cosmetic adjustments for a steep price. As Gossip Cop notes, rumor had it that Holmes was set to pay $20,000 to fix her teeth. The gossip policing site shares the rumor that was spread by an unreliable tabloid.\n\n\u201cAccording to the repeatedly discredited National Enquirer, the actress needs major dental work to fix her \u201c\u2018twisted\u2019 teeth. A so-called \u2018source\u2019 tells the outlet, \u2018She grinds her teeth in her sleep, and they\u2019re in bad shape.\u2019 \u2018Katie is so self-conscious she often smiles with her mouth closed,\u2019 further contends the magazine\u2019s clearly ill-informed insider, adding, \u2018She wants something to smile about, and she\u2019s willing to break the bank to get it!'\u201d\n\nThe publication notes that a real source close to the star has stated that the rumor is absolutely false and that Holmes is in no way self-conscious of her smile, nor is she so concerned that she smiles with her mouth closed.\n\nAlthough this rumor has turned out to be a fabrication, the rumor regarding Jamie Foxx and Katie has been given new life since the two were spotted holding hands in Miami on New Year\u2019s Eve. Apparently, they also spent the night together in a luxury room in the beachside party town. The pair has certainly done their best to keep the romance under wraps and have each individually stated to the press that they are merely friends. It appears as though it really is all a cover up to keep their relationship private and out of the spotlight.\n\nExclusive! Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve together in Miami \u2014 all the details: https://t.co/Bji06zf5d7 pic.twitter.com/kFXevPIIoh \u2014 Us Weekly (@usweekly) January 5, 2017\n\nHowever, Katie is all about sharing in regards to her recent roles onscreen and behind the scenes as a new director. Holmes has enjoyed a successful run on the series Kennedys: After Camelot, in which she stars as Jackie Kennedy. She has also recently made her directorial debut and is set to direct one of the episodes for the next season of the Kennedy drama.\n\nThe latest interview with the star has uncovered the fact that Holmes is going to be a part of the Ocean\u2019s Eight cast. TV3 shares about the stars set to have cameos in the film.\n\n\u201cShe joins a cast which already boasts Anne Hathaway, Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, and Mindy Kaling.\u201d\n\nAlso, Matt Damon is set to reprise a role in the highly-anticipated film that is a part of a very successful franchise that includes the remake from 2001, Ocean\u2019s Eleven and the two sequels that followed, Ocean\u2019s Twelve and Ocean\u2019s Thirteen. Entertainment Tonight notes the words of Damon about the upcoming film and cast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a little bit in the movie,\u201d he revealed to ET. \u201cI haven\u2019t read it yet, but the cast is phenomenal and I\u2019m excited to see what those women do with it. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d\n\nIt does sound as though it will be a sure hit with that incredible lineup and, based on the former films of the franchise, this installment will likely not disappoint fans. Katie Holmes has certainly spread her wings lately with the choices she has made in the world of entertainment, and it\u2019s obvious that she has come a long way since her start as awkward Joey on the teen hit show Dawson\u2019s Creek.\n\n[Feature Image by Frederick M.
