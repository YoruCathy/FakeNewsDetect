So far we have three songs and I\u2019m not in love with any of them. I\u2019m meh on Younger Now but I find Malibu and Inspired practically unlistenable. There\u2019s a few left to release, though, including Rainbowland featuring her godmother, Dolly Parton. I\u2019m sure one of them will appeal to me.\n\nAnyway, with all this new music coming out, people are once again wondering if Miley and fianc\u00e9 Liam Hemsworth will ever walk down the aisle. I maintain that the speculation is as much the couple\u2019s doing as the press. I think Miley likes us talking about her and she knows this is one thing fans will never tired of. However, if Life & Style is to be believed, it goes much deeper than that. L&S claims that Miley pitched a major fit over Liam not wearing his promise ring and the fight grew loud before she gave him the silent treatment for almost two days.\n\nWhen Miley Cyrus channeled her inner Beyonc\u00e9 and put a ring on longtime boyfriend Liam Hemsworth, it was supposed to be a sign of their commitment to each other. There was just one small problem: the Australian actor refused to wear it. That did not sit well with Miley, 24, and sources reveal exclusively to Life & Style that the piece of jewelry became the subject of a nasty shouting match. \u201cShe pushed him and pushed him to wear the ring,\u201d the insider says, \u201cand she finally lost her temper and was screaming at him furiously. The fight was one of the worst they\u2019ve ever had.\u201d The former Disney star was so mad she actually threw her phone to the ground and smashed it. \u201cShe refused to talk to him for almost two days after that,\u201d the source adds. Liam, 27, has since apologized and agreed to wear the promise ring. He was recently spotted out with the hardware on that finger, prompting wedding rumors. However, the couple is not walking down the aisle anytime soon. Miley and Liam, who have been engaged on and off since 2012, both agree the fight has strengthened their relationship. \u201cThings have turned around lately,\u201d the source tells Life & Style. \u201cMiley and Liam are so much happier now.\u201d\n\n[From Life & Style]\n\nWait a minute \u2013 these two are engaged so this is an engagement ring, isn\u2019t it? If you need a promise ring when you\u2019re engaged, you have bigger issues. But it definitely sounds like they have issues if Miley is smashing phones. The question is, of course, did this happen? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m inclined to think it might have. Not that the fight was solely over the ring but the ring was the last straw and Miley snapped. I get it, she\u2019s under a lot of pressure. I haven\u2019t heard the songs yet but the titles are all about love and coupledom \u2013 if Malibu is any indication, this album is one giant love note to Liam. And given Liam\u2019s track record, I guess I can understand why she needs a symbolic gesture. If it is true, I\u2019m glad Liam made the effort by finally wearing the ring.\n\nUnfortunately, Liam\u2019s lack of ring is not all Miley has to deal with. She is among those to have intimate photos stolen in the latest hacking scandal. Oh, how I hate these creeps, I hope they get what\u2019s coming to them. I\u2019m not going to give them any more space so that\u2019s all I will say about that. On a nicer note, Miley bought a ranch in Nashville and I am positively emerald with envy. You can see pictures here, it\u2019s just gorgeous. It would also be a beautiful setting for a wedding.
