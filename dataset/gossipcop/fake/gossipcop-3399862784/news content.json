But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston\u2019s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, \u201cThor\u201d has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.\n\nAlthough Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.\n\nThis is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.\n\nAudience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn\u2019t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom\u2019s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn\u2019t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.\n\nMany believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom\u2019s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.\n\nOf course, Tom and Taylor Swift\u2019s romance only lasted a few months, but it has been reported that his brief romance with the singer has hurt his Hollywood career, and may have even cost him the opportunity to take over the role of James Bond. For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.\n\nPhoto by Alberto E.
