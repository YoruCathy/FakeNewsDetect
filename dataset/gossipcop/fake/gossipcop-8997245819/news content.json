This is \u201cMean Girls\u201d lite.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, the musical starts on a high note, with stage-wall projections of the infamous Burn Book\u2019s slams \u2014 \u201cI suck in all ways,\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t contour for s - - t.\u201d A likably daffy Erika Henningsen gets out from under the long shadow cast by the teenage Lindsay Lohan as Cady Heron, transported from the Kenyan savannah, where she was homeschooled, to suburban Chicago.\n\nOnce there, she\u2019s thrown into a different wild kingdom \u2014 high school, where a clique known as the Plastics reigns supreme. Narrating the action is the outsider duo of Janis (Barrett Wilbert Weed, who makes an excellently sardonic Goth girl) and the \u201calmost too gay to function\u201d Damian (a droll Grey Henson), who befriend Cady and goad her into going undercover to undo the Plastics\u2019 queen bee.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: As off-Broadway\u2019s \u201cHeathers\u201d proved, it\u2019s tough to transfer a big-screen bitch onto the stage. As Regina George, Taylor Louderman can really belt, stomping around on a cafeteria table in tight white denim announcing she\u2019s a \u201cmassive deal.\u201d But she comes across as less cruel nightmare, more future reality-show star. As her wingwomen, Ashley Park\u2019s Gretchen Wieners is a fluttery mass of insecurity, while Kate Rockwell\u2019s Karen Smith is still dumb as rocks but not as overtly laughable; here, thanks to Fey\u2019s updated book about the hazards of social media, Karen\u2019s a sexting victim.\n\n\u201cMean Girls\u201d fans will love hearing their favorite lines, from \u201cOn Wednesdays we wear pink\u201d to \u201cStop trying to make \u2018Fetch\u2019 happen!\u201d and \u201cYou go, Glen Coco!\u201d To their credit, Fey, her composer-husband Jeff Richmond and lyricist Nell Benjamin have resisted crafting these into shameless musical numbers (though I\u2019d have liked to see Coco get his moment in the spotlight). But many of the songs feel like padding, including an uninspired ballad (\u201cMore Is Better\u201d) between Cady and her love interest, Aaron (Kyle Selig).\n\n\u201cMean Girls\u201d the musical is best when it breaks from the movie. Damian amps up the energy in the room with a tap-dancing ode to the perils of smartphone addiction (\u201cStop\u201d), and another song, \u201cApex Predator,\u201d links Cady\u2019s zoologist past to the primal rites of high school.\n\nIn this post-\u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d world, some of Fey\u2019s script changes are for the better. The film\u2019s racially branded social groups are exchanged for monikers like \u201cWoke Seniors,\u201d and there are far fewer mentions of \u201csluts\u201d and \u201cwhores.\u201d Fey still finds her way to the core of the story.\n\n\u201cCalling someone ugly doesn\u2019t make you better looking,\u201d says math teacher Ms. Norbury (Kerry Butler, doing a credible Fey imitation). \u201cWe have to stop beating each other up over every little thing, \u2019cause meanwhile men are running around grabbing butts and shooting everybody!\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be real: Fey is at her funniest when she\u2019s brutally cutting, and songs like Getchen\u2019s lament, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With Me?,\u201d and Karen\u2019s PG-rated ode to racy Halloween costumes (\u201cSexy\u201d) fall far short of the so-real-it\u2019s-painful zingers from her film.\n\nFey\u2019s show has heart, but it\u2019s not terribly fetch.", "images": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/060418-mean-girls-bway1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/060418-mean-girls-bway1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/060418-mean-girls-bway1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara Stewart", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/04/08/how-tina-fey-messed-up-mean-girls-musical/", "title": "How Tina Fey messed up \u2018Mean Girls\u2019 musical", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
