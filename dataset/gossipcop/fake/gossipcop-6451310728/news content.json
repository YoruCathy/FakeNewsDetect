I feel like it was so meant to happen. I\u2019m such a different person,\u201d she shared. Kardashian continued, \u201cMy whole life as changed as far as how I travel and security. I never thought that I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry. If you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I\u2019m traveling and I didn\u2019t. Now, I have several, just for me to be able to sleep at night.\u201d The reality star fully believed she was going to die, and now she no longer cares about possessions and materialistic items.\n\nKardashian also discussed life with her kids following the frightening ordeal in Paris, and said her 1-and-a-half year-old son Saint is her \u201c10,\u201d which the audience member understood to mean is a \u201cperfect baby.\u201d And, after DeGeneres asked about West and his well-being, Kardashian noted that the rapper\u2019s 40th birthday is on June 8, and she\u2019s still struggling with what she should do to mark his milestone. At that point, we\u2019re told, the talk show host offered to host the entire Kardashian family for a one-hour birthday party. No word yet whether Kardashian will take DeGeneres up on the invitation.
