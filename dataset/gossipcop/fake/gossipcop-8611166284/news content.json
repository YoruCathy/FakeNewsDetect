Following her mother\u2019s death, one of Dow\u2019s caregiver says she was there for many of the fights between the two and now she\u2019s going to share what she heard and knows in a new book, according to In Touch Weekly. (RELATED: Jennifer Aniston UNLOADS On The Media For Speculating That She\u2019s Pregnant)\n\n\u201cThe caregiver was present for the few phone calls and even fewer meetings between Jen and Nancy,\u201d a source told the outlet. \u201cShe wants to expose the real Jennifer Aniston.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy was so sick and lonely,\u201d the source said according to another report. \u201cEveryone knows that she and Nancy had a horrible relationship. She was an absentee daughter and now, even with Nancy gone, it seems that she still doesn\u2019t want her mom around.\u201d (RELATED: Jennifer Aniston, Black Dress, No Bra \u2014 That\u2019s Quite A Combination)\n\n\u201cThe world sees Jen as adorable Rachel from Friends, but the real story is more like reversed Mommie Dearest.\u201d\n\nIn 1996 the actress cut ties with her mother after Dow gave a tabloid an interview. She followed that up with a memoir called \u201cFrom Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir\u201d about their relationship.\n\nLast year, Aniston talked about their relationship in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cShe had a temper,\u201d Aniston said. \u201cI can\u2019t tolerate that. If I get upset, I will discuss [things]. I will never scream and get hysterical like that.\u201d\n\n\u201c[But] I was never taught that I could scream,\u201d she added. \u201cOne time, I raised my voice to my mother, and I screamed at her, and she looked at me and burst out laughing. She was laughing at me [for] screaming back. And it was like a punch in my stomach.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was critical,\u201d she continued. \u201cShe was very critical of me. Because she was a model, she was gorgeous, stunning.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI never was. I honestly still don\u2019t think of myself in that sort of light, which is fine. She was also very unforgiving. She would hold grudges that I just found so petty.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1660572110829759&ev=PageView\r\n\t&noscript=1", "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-461603702-e1468415462392.jpg", "http://dailycaller.com/files/images/newsletter-small.jpg", "https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=960,height=411,fit=cover,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-461603702-e1468415462392.jpg", "http://dailycaller.com/files/images/logo-white.png", "https://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2016-07-14T023114Z_3_LYNXNPEC6C1IG_RTROPTP_4_PEOPLE-ANISTON-620x406.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10110104&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://dailycaller.com/files/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spl1312341_001-533x620.jpg", "https://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/GettyImages-462239140-487x620.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-461603702-e1468415462392.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://dailycaller.com/2016/10/05/jennifer-anistons-mothers-caregiver-writing-tell-all-book-to-expose-actress/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Mother\u2019s Caregiver Writing Tell-All Book To \u2018Expose\u2019 Actress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "https://dailycaller.com/2016/10/05/jennifer-anistons-mothers-caregiver-writing-tell-all-book-to-expose-actress/", "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-461603702-e1468415462392.jpg", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Mother\u2019s Caregiver Writing Tell-All Book To \u2018Expose\u2019 Actress", "description": "Jennifer Aniston's mother's caregiver is writing a tell-all book to &quot;expose&quot; the actress's &quot;terrible&quot; relationship with her mother, a new report claims."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "dailycaller", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Mother\u2019s Caregiver Writing Tell-All Book To \u2018Expose\u2019 Actress", "description": "Jennifer Aniston's mother's caregiver is writing a tell-all book to &quot;expose&quot; the actress's &quot;terrible&quot; relationship with her mother, a new report claims.", "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-461603702-e1468415462392.jpg"}, "description": "Jennifer Aniston's mother's caregiver is writing a tell-all book to &quot;expose&quot; the actress's &quot;terrible&quot; relationship with her mother, a new report claims.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=381099982", "fb": {"pages": 182919686769}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1475596800.0, "source": "http://dailycaller.com", "summary": ""}
