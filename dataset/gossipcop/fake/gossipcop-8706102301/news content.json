Speaking on the BBC, Ms McCartney said: \u201cI feel it\u2019s such a private experience. And as a designer and as a woman who\u2019s been married, it\u2019s such a big deal. \u201cIt was very much her dress, and I felt very proud that she came to me for that part of the wedding. She got to reflect her in it.\u201d Asked whether the American had contributed her own ideas to the creation, Ms McCartney said: \u201cYeah, we worked together. When you come to a wedding you don\u2019t just go, \u2018here, this is what you\u2019re wearing\u2019.\n\nClaire Waight Keller said she was absolutely focused on making Meghan's wedding dress perfect\n\nMs McCartney also dressed A-list celebrities including Amal Clooney and Oprah Winfrey\n\nThat person has to feel like a million dollars; they need to feel like they own it Stella McCartney\n\n\u201cThat person has to feel like a million dollars; they need to feel like they own it.\" The daughter of famed musician Paul McCartney noted she wanted to bring joy and self-expression to the dress before Meghan embarks upon her Royal duties. She said: \u201cThe role she\u2019s taken on, it\u2019s very austere, it\u2019s very sort of serious, and I think there\u2019s a great weight that she has acquired through that and she takes it very seriously. \u201cI think it was the last moment that she could, sort of, reflect the other side of her: the joy and the human within her.\u201d\n\nPointing to the complexity of the task, the designer added: \u201cI was aware that we had to get the right kind of positioning, the right pace, the right voice. \u201cThere was a delicate line, it\u2019s either a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down, it\u2019s that kind of gig.\u201d It had remained a secret prior to the wedding that Ms McCartney was designing the dress for the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s reception, and the designer said she was surprised by the positive response she received.
