In perhaps an even more surprising passage of time, it\u2019s been nearly five years since Cruise and Holmes announced their split in June 2012 when their daughter, Suri, was just six years old. The divorce was surrounded by rumors and reports, namely involving Cruise\u2019s involvement in Scientology. In a new interview with Town & Country, Holmes made a vague reference to how the rumor mill still affects her and her daughter\u2019s lives\u2014or doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn\u2018t true, so we don\u2019t pay attention,\u201d she said.\n\nThis quote begs the question of just how much Holmes, who has primary custody of her daughter, lets Suri see or read when it comes to tabloid mentions (especially involving the two of them).\n\nIn a clear effort for privacy, the actress and director has been careful to keep her only child out of the public eye. Suri makes rare appearances on Holmes\u2019s social-media accounts, mostly for occasions like a family birthday party last September and her mother\u2019s birthday in December.\n\nIn her Town & Country interview, Holmes said she knows she cannot control the fact that her name will be tabloid fodder.\n\n\u201cThere are more important things,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s very relatable to me; if people know who you are, they might write about you, and you can't control that.\u201d\n\nThroughout the piece Holmes remained coy about just how private she keeps her daughter\u2018s life. But she was direct about one thing in particular: her main focus is for Suri, who will be 11 in April, to maintain her childlike innocence as long as possible.\n\n\u201cMy child is the most important person to me, and her upbringing is paramount to my work right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that I\u2019m present and she has a stable, innocent childhood. I feel so blessed to do what I do, but there's nothing in the world better than watching your child succeed.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/583f09e90fd158c6587ec2de/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/SHOT_03_014c_final.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/583f0b71364154776b0baed8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/SHOT_05_079b_final.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5857f025972218dd2057563d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/katie-suri.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/582c710f364154776b0baace/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/583f09ed0fd158c6587ec2e4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/SHOT_07_067_V2c_final.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Weaver", "Hilary Weave", "Neha Prakas", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/katie-holmes-on-parenthood-and-tabloids", "title": "What, Exactly, Is Katie Holmes\u2019s Relationship to Tabloids?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hilary Weaver", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "In a new interview, the actress makes a vague reference to how she and her daughter handle life in the spotlight.", "id": "58bda20bf8260a3f190f2c12", "keywords": "celebrity,katie holmes,tabloids,suri cruise,tom cruise", "news_keywords": "celebrity,katie holmes,tabloids,suri cruise,tom cruise", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58bda20bf8260a3f190f2c12", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In a new interview, the actress makes a vague reference to how she and her daughter handle life in the spotlight.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "In a new interview, the actress makes a vague reference to how she and her daughter handle life in the spotlight.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "What, Exactly, Is Katie Holmes\u2019s Relationship to Tabloids?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/katie-holmes-on-parenthood-and-tabloids"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "In a new interview, the actress makes a vague reference to how she and her daughter handle life in the spotlight.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58bda22cf8260a3f190f2c14/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katie-holmes-tabloids.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "What, Exactly, Is Katie Holmes\u2019s Relationship to Tabloids?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
