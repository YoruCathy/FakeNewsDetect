Middle-aged, male A-list stars are taking a beating. The situation has become so dire that the celebrity news channel E! Online is predicting the \u201cEnd of an era for celebrity idol worship\u201d.\n\nBut nothing quite prepared the celebrity world for the totalling of Brangelina.\n\nFrom alimony to palimony to the rise of the pay-as-you-go marriage (the wage-earning party to pay into a separation fund throughout the length of the marriage so there are no surprises when or if the marriage eventually ends), Hollywood couples have long been pioneers when it comes to marital innovation, but the end of Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie has left a nuclear pall over Hollywood-land.\n\nThe normally loquacious PR Howard Bragman, known for containing tabloid feeding frenzies, offered no advice. \u201cJust sad to me,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nIn some instances, say managers, both parties should be able to walk away with their careers and box-office potential enhanced. But the Brangelina marriage crack-up already looks to be heading in the opposite direction, with reports of the FBI looking into \u201can incident\u201d on a flight the Pitt-Jolie family took on 14 September.\n\nPitt was reportedly \u201clawyering up\u201d after the FBI announced the agency \u201cis continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis one is going to end with both of them having their images bruised,\u201d predicts Allison Hope Weiner, a lawyer and journalist who has covered Hollywood for more than 15 years.\n\nWhat is clear is that in this confrontation nothing is left to chance and the leaks that appear in the media \u2013 usually via celebrity website TMZ\u2019s host Harvey Levin, are deliberate and highly strategised.\n\n\u201cThey know that if they can get to Harvey first, and he publishes first, they can set the tone because the rest of the media consider TMZ a first-party source,\u201d says one talent manager familiar with the frontlines of Hollywood scandal. \u201cAngelina needs some kind of leverage to go for full custody for the kids.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re wise enough you can see that websites like TMZ granulate \u2013 serialise \u2013 everything because it creates entertainment product for them to carry it. They\u2019re making money off it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery, then, that barely a week into the split, the children are already the focus of the battle. On Thursday, the LA Times received a leak that Pitt was subject to the FBI investigation over the private plane trip back from France last week.\n\nImage conscious: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the Cannes film festival in 2011. Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs TMZ reported: \u201cSources familiar with the situation tell us, Brad, Angelina and their kids were on a flight last Wednesday when he allegedly got wasted on the private jet. He allegedly went wild, screaming at the kids.\u201d\n\nThe website continued: \u201cWe\u2019re told the plane landed at an airport around 8pm, and witnesses say Pitt continued his rant on the tarmac, and even tried leaving in one of the fuel trucks.\u201d\n\nIn her divorce filing, Jolie listed the couple\u2019s date of separation as the following day, 15 September, and it was later suggested that the LA county department of children and family services had looked into the incident.\n\nThough LA celebrity divorce lawyers routinely deny leaking to TMZ \u2013 and blame court clerks for those leaks \u2013 both anti-Pitt items suggest that Jolie\u2019s publicists and lawyers (she is represented by divorce specialist Laura Wasser) are setting the pace.\n\n\u201cHow do you think the media find out that a parent is being investigated for not properly caring for a child?\u201d says Weiner. \u201cIn many instances, the existence of an investigation is leaked to the press.\u201d\n\nBy Friday, Pitt was fighting back, reportedly enlisting the help of attorney Lance Spiegel, who has worked with celebrities such as Charlie Sheen and Michael Jackson. One source told People magazine: \u201cHe was appealing to her to do this quietly \u2013 not to save the marriage but to consider the wellbeing of the children \u2013 and it was ignored. He is just wrecked by this.\n\n\u201cHe was willing to do anything, change any habit, change any lifestyle, to do what had to be done to make this work,\u201d adds the source. \u201cAnd by \u2018make this work\u2019 that means doing what has to be done to make even a split one that is amicable and in the best interests of the children.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s demands are already clear: The actor, 41, has asked for physical custody of the children and is requesting that Pitt be granted visiting rights, while Pitt wants shared custody, sources have said.\n\nWhile none of that is entirely new or surprising, the PR battle over both stars\u2019 parenting skills is well under way, according to Weiner: \u201cIt\u2019s managed so the client looks like a loving and caring parent. In some cases, nannies are instructed to walk in the back so parents can be photographed with their children and look as if they have no professional help with parenting.\n\n\u201cMoreover, paparazzi are informed when to catch parents out at the park with their children, providing an opportunity for the star to be photographed \u2018spending quality time\u2019 with his or her child.\u201d\n\nCould a celebrity divorce ever be harnessed to engineer a career lift? The answer, in at least one high-profile case, seems to be yes.\n\nWhen Gwen Stefani divorced British rocker Gavin Rossdale for allegedly cheating with the nanny \u2013 \u201cthe two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage; we remain partners in parenthood\u201d \u2013 Stefani came swinging back with a new relationship (Blake Shelton), and heartbreak-linked new material: a duet (Go Ahead and Break My Heart); a hit album (This is What Truth Feels Like) and a TV show (The Voice).\n\n\u201cThey may say that but it\u2019s a racket among the lawyers,\u201d says the talent manager. \u201cThey want to inflame and create issues that extend the back-and-forth. Then it becomes a media thing \u2013 a crisis \u2013 and that becomes licence to bill.\u201d And that\u2019s before the whole thing gets wrapped up in a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nWhen Depp and Heard\u2019s marriage hit the rocks earlier this year amid reports of domestic violence, a settlement was quickly agreed before any further damage could be inflicted.\n\nThe couple concluded their relationship with this, somewhat enigmatic, statement: \u201cOur relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future.\u201d\n\nTHE PRICE OF SEPARATION\n\nTiger Woods and Elin Nordegren\n\nThe couple divorced in 2010 following reports of Woods\u2019 serial infidelity. Details of the financial settlement have not been disclosed, but US media reports suggest the former Mrs Woods will receive more than $100m (\u00a377m).\n\nSteven Spielberg and Amy Irving\n\nReports suggest the film director paid $100m to Irving after they divorced in 1989. The couple had been married for three and a half years but cited career-related pressures as a reason for separating.\n\nNicole Kidman and Tom Cruise\n\nThe couple, pictured, adopted a son and daughter, Connor Antony and Isabella, and were married for 11 years, separating in 2001. Cruise cited irreconcilable differences. It was not disclosed how the couple divided their \u00a3214m joint fortune.\n\nMel Gibson and Robyn Gibson\n\nAfter their 30-year marriage ended in 2011, Robyn, the mother of Mel\u2019s seven children, was reported to have been awarded half of her ex-husband\u2019s estimated $850m fortune.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Angelina Jolie,Brad Pitt,TMZ,Film,World news,Digital media,Media,Divorce,Life and style", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfbb4c3e02eccf0fae7cf132715ae03ceecbee7/0_186_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=23bfcbb6738e7100abe2eb55a03fdddd", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71ffbc6dc507f44aeb174f753a4ffa1301726399/0_163_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=588adad9fd276a54e3c700257bddf5fb", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfbb4c3e02eccf0fae7cf132715ae03ceecbee7/0_186_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=edfe33f883ee27bd89763da64d8b6711"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfbb4c3e02eccf0fae7cf132715ae03ceecbee7/0_186_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=23bfcbb6738e7100abe2eb55a03fdddd", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "canonical_link": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/24/brangelina-divorce-pr-feeding-frenzy", "title": "Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and the search for the perfect PR Hollywood divorce", "meta_data": {"description": "Brad%20Pitt%2C%20Angelina%20Jolie%20and%20the%20search%20for%20the%20perfect%20PR%20Hollywood%20divorce%20%7C%20Angelina%20Jolie%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/24/brangelina-divorce-pr-feeding-frenzy", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dfbb4c3e02eccf0fae7cf132715ae03ceecbee7/0_186_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&enable=upscale&s=23bfcbb6738e7100abe2eb55a03fdddd", "description": "The gloves are off in the marital breakup of the decade.
