After the Barbadian singer heated up the internet with her photos with Hassan Jameel, the Canadian rapper reportedly reacted and said that he is wondering why his former girlfriend fell for the Arabian business tycoon.\n\nDrake is reportedly starting to regret letting go of RiRi\n\nA source told Hollywood Life that the \"Thank Me Later\" artist was \"kinda jealous\" when he found out that his ex-girlfriend is already seeing a new guy.\n\n\u201cDrake is kinda jealous of Rihanna\u2019s new billionaire boyfriend. He has no idea why she likes this guy,\u201d it said.\n\nIt added that despite their on-off relationship, the 30-year-old rapper is still affected whenever the \"What's My Name\" singer is caught up in dating rumors. \u201cDrake thinks Rihanna is one of the baddest chicks\u2019s ever and he doesn\u2019t think this new guy deserves her at all,\u201d the insider added.\n\nAside from him, rumor has it that Naomi Campbell, who previously dated Hassan, was \"furious\" when she saw her ex-boyfriend getting cozy with her former bestie.\n\nThe English model reportedly said that she is still \"hotter and more successful\" than RiRi and guaranteed that her relationship with him won't last long.\n\nThis rumor has caused the fans to speculate about Campbell and Rihanna's stained friendship which was first noticed by an eagle-eyed fan who figured out that the two have stopped following each other on social media earlier this year. When asked if she has a beef with her best friend, the 47-year-old model suggested that she is just pretending that everything is fine between them.\n\nRihanna and Hassan's Ibiza getaway\n\nRiRi and Hassan, both 29, were first seen in public during their romantic vacation in Spain on Wednesday. Several photos of them getting all steamy in the swimming pool immediately went viral and had caused the public to start digging about the new guy. It was later revealed that he is the expected heir of a $1.5 billion business called Abdul Latif Jameel which has acquired the distribution rights to Toyota in Saudi Arabia.\n\nTheir family business has placed them in 12th spot on the list of richest Arabs in the world by Forbes. Hassan currently works as the Deputy President and Vice Chairman of the said company. Aside from that, his family also owns Saudi Professional League or Jameel League which was founded in 1976.\n\nAfter spending some down time at their luxury villa, Rihanna and her billionaire beau stepped out in public on the same day, where the singer was seen holding a bouquet of flowers while her the tycoon was all smiles walking behind his girl.", "images": ["https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/p/4/2020/04/17/v_640x360/b92ea92f-b040-4aed-a129-1ae4edb1d46c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/12/660x290/b_160x130/on-90-day-fiance-fans-are-disgusted-over-big-eds-nasty-bath-with-roses-father-image-source-tlc-youtube_2439395.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/6/30/660x290/b_1200x630/drake-is-reportedly-jealous-of-rihannas-new-boyfriend-wikimediathe-come-up-show_1416387.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/1/390/profile_1390431_1457504078.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/6/30/660x290/b_502x220/drake-is-reportedly-jealous-of-rihannas-new-boyfriend-wikimediathe-come-up-show_1416387.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/4/549/profile_4549221_1509419470.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/50/50963/1280x330/b_350x93/39803150634345259c8fa1ccd0b9_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/8/8569/1280x330/b_350x93/41024150675557959cf43fb71fc7_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/51/51733/1280x330/b_350x93/59484150283796459937ccc323cc_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/16/660x290/b_160x130/o15/90-day-fiance-ed-brown-gets-a-rude-awakening-over-relationship-with-rosemarie-vega-image-source-tlc-youtube-screenshot_2442597.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/17/660x290/b_160x130/catelynn-lowell-and-tyler-baltierra-of-teen-mom-og-are-in-some-serious-tax-trouble-photo-credittyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowellinstagram_2442983.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/6/30/660x290/b_1200x630/drake-is-reportedly-jealous-of-rihannas-new-boyfriend-wikimediathe-come-up-show_1416387.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic D.
