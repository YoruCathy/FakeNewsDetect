But why? \u2014 Check out her latest interview\u2026\n\nDid Gwen Stefani, 48, just reveal that she\u2019s quitting music after her Just a Girl Las Vegas residency? Well, not quite. But, she did admit that she\u2019s nearing the end of her music journey, and she\u2019s OK with that! \u201cI always think it\u2019s fine if I never do it again,\u201d she told OK magazine about performing. \u201cThen when I get on stage, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my gosh, I love this!\u2019 I love my music, I love being up there. It\u2019s my gift \u2014 it\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. I\u2019m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician,\u201d she continued.\n\nWhen asked why she said her Vegas residency, Gwen admitted, \u201cWell, because of my age, and I\u2019ve been doing it for thirty-something-years.\u201d She explained: \u201cA Las Vegas show is a way to express myself and do my whole catalog of music that defines every period in my life, all the crises and all the joys. Creatively, I couldn\u2019t have done it sooner; I have to have all these songs.\u201d\n\nThe mag\u2019s cover reads, \u201cGwen tells all: I\u2019m Quitting Music For Blake!\u201d However, that\u2019s not exactly the case. Gwen explained to the mag that she\u2019s had such a successful and long career, that she\u2019s satisfied where she\u2019s gotten within the business. In fact, she said that her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, 41, extremely supportive of her career.\n\nThe former No Doubt frontrunner\u2018s solo residency kicks off on June 27 at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. As for what fans can expect? \u2014 Definitely prepare for her old hits, but get ready to hear some new songs about her beau, Blake Shelton! \u201cObviously he\u2019s my best friend, so I\u2019m bouncing stuff off him all the time, Gwen said, adding that Blake is \u201csuper supportive\u201d of her career. \u201cHe gets me motivated. There are a bunch of songs about him in the show, that\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nGwen also revealed the meaning behind her \u201cJust a Girl\u201d residency moniker. \u201cIf you really know me or saw how I grew up, I am 100 percent the same person I\u2019ve always been,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen I wrote that song, I was 25, going to college, living at my parents\u2019. I guess I wanted to say, \u2018This is my DNA.\u2019 I\u2019m just a girl from Anaheim, CA and I\u2019ve never been anything else\u2026 And for a song to be relevant 20 years later? \u2026 It still works!\u201d", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2Fis-gwen-stefani-quitting-music-blake-shelton-relationship-settle-down%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3174118", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gwen-stefani-settling-down-with-blake-end-of-music-journey-ftr.jpg", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gwen-stefani-settling-down-with-blake-end-of-music-journey-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/gwen-stefani-settling-down-with-blake-end-of-music-journey-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/07/is-gwen-stefani-quitting-music-blake-shelton-relationship-settle-down/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Admits Vegas Residency Is The \u2018End\u2019 Of Her Musical \u2018Journey\u2019: Settling Down With Blake?", "meta_data": {"description": "Is Gwen Stefani quitting music to settle down with Blake Shelton? \u2014 A new report claims that's exactly what's happening and here's all the details!", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani Admits Vegas Residency Is The \u2018End\u2019 Of Her Musical \u2018Journey\u2019: Settling Down With Blake?", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/07/is-gwen-stefani-quitting-music-blake-shelton-relationship-settle-down/", "description": "You may want to cop your Gwen Stefani concert tickets right now, because her \u2018Just a Girl\u2019 Vegas residency could be her last run, ever!
