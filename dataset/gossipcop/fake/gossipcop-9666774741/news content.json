I am deeply saddened. And as horrifying as it is to say I can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m surprised. Our greatest challenges are ahead of us,\u201d the businessman, 36, wrote in a lengthy Twitter statement on Monday, October 2. \u201cWhat took place in Las Vegas last night should never happen. What took place in Manchester should never happen. What took place in Charlottesville should never happen. But they are all happening. And ALL of them are terrorist attacks. They strike fear in our ability to live our lives. They all make us question taking our children, our friends, our loved ones\u2026 to public events that are supposed to bring us joy\u2026 in fear of devastation. They are all attacks on our way of life and our way of love.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, at least 58 people were killed and 515 injured when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of country music festivalgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandala Bay Resort and Casino. The attack is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history and came just four months after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured 250 others at Grande\u2019s concert in Manchester, England.\n\n\u201cSo first let me say my heart breaks for all those affected in Las Vegas,\u201d Braun continued. \u201cNothing we do can bring back your loved ones and I am so sorry. For those in the hospital recovering we are with you. Keep fighting. And for all of us\u2026 who are we? What will we choose to do in response? Will we just instagram and move on? Will we think this is about a hashtag with the word #vegas in it? Or will we wait until the next one affects us? THIS ONE affects us. #LasVegas is ALL of us. This is an attack on your friends, your family, your kids, your way of life.\u201d\n\nThe talent manager continued, \u201cSo as we think about those lost and those hurting this morning\u2026 what do you and I owe them? We owe them our courage. We owe them our faith. We owe them our strength and our spirit to rise up and come together and demand not only better now but better Tomorrow.\u201d\n\nBraun then reflected upon the One Love Manchester benefit concert that was held in June. \u201cWhen I was in Manchester I witnessed something defiant,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt the end of the One Love Manchester show\u2026 only 2 weeks after the attack and less than 24 hours since the london attack\u2026when the cameras were off\u2026 the crowd of 55,000 brave souls started to sing. [They] echoed the words \u2018Manchester we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re strong. We\u2019ll keep singing our songs, our songs, our songs!\u2019 This repeated for 15 minutes as they exited. Defiance in the face of fear. Las Vegas we\u2019re strong. We\u2019re strong. We\u2019re strong. We\u2019ll keep singing our songs\u2026Together. RIP to those lost.\u201d\n\nGrande, 24, also reacted to the Las Vegas shooting, tweeting, \u201cMy heart is breaking for Las Vegas. We need love, unity, peace, gun control & for people to look at this & call this what it is = terrorism.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun-86e11ffa-8778-4c50-a4f2-28380dbc8bd4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1760px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun-3e22e49b-0916-47cb-a032-0e701965a1f0.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun-86e11ffa-8778-4c50-a4f2-28380dbc8bd4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1760px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ariana-grandes-manager-scooter-braun-talks-las-vegas-shooting-w506564/", "title": "Ariana Grande's Manager Scooter Braun Talks Las Vegas Shooting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun expressed his condolences on Twitter after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, October 1 \u2014 read his statement", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ariana Grande's Manager Scooter Braun Speaks Out After Vegas Shooting", "description": "Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun expressed his condolences on Twitter after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, October 1 \u2014 read his statement", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ariana-grandes-manager-scooter-braun-talks-las-vegas-shooting-w506564/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-31T18:35:14+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun-86e11ffa-8778-4c50-a4f2-28380dbc8bd4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1760px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun-86e11ffa-8778-4c50-a4f2-28380dbc8bd4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1760px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-10-02T16:04:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-31T18:35:14+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun expressed his condolences on Twitter after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, October 1 \u2014 read his statement", "title": "Ariana Grande's Manager Scooter Braun Speaks Out After Vegas Shooting", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ariana-grande-and-scooter-braun-86e11ffa-8778-4c50-a4f2-28380dbc8bd4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1760px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506960240.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
