Brad Pitt likes to drop by and play with her 5-year-old son Samson; wellness guru Deepak Chopra calls for advice. And Laura Day, the object of all this celebrity attention? \u201cI\u2019m not what you expect,\u201d she insists. \u201cI\u2019m just your basic, straitlaced Jewish woman.\u201d\n\nWho believes\u2014as do her fans\u2014that she has a highly accurate sense of intuition. \u201cIntuition allows us to predict events,\u201d claims Day, 38. She maintains that everyone has such abilities,, waiting to be developed; her 1996 how-to book, Practical Intuition, sold 133,000 hardcover copies, and her 1997 follow-up, Practical Intuition for Success, is the first part of a two-book, $3 million deal. Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). \u201cI don\u2019t see hallucinations, it\u2019s just a flash of something in my head,\u201d says Day, who\u2019s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. \u201cI\u2019m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There\u2019s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nSo how to explain all those A-list amigos? \u201cShe\u2019s very open and loving,\u201d says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. \u201cI had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,\u201d recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. \u201cLaura\u2019s information saved Zoe\u2019s life,\u201d says Arquette. \u201cIt was intense.\u201d\n\nDay\u2019s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn\u2019t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore\u2014or \u201cAunt Demi,\u201d as she\u2019s known to Samson\u2014worked with Day on the set of 199l\u2019s The Butcher\u2019s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. \u201cLaura has given me a trust in my own intuition,\u201d says the actress, who won\u2019t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day\u2019s intervention. \u201cI took a greater position of responsibility,\u201d says Moore. \u201cLaura put me back in the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\nDay says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. \u201cI wanted her to live,\u201d says Day, \u201cand I needed to know what to do.\u201d She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian\u2019s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.\n\nDay went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. \u201cAt the point when you\u2019re most lost,\u201d says Day, \u201cthat\u2019s when intuition kicks in.\u201d\n\nIntuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success\u2014she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate\u2014allows her to \u201cdo bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.\u201d A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. \u201cPeople are drawn to Laura,\u201d says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day\u2019s boyfriend of three years. \u201cShe makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. \u201cI don\u2019t want my environment perfect,\u201d she says. \u201cI work very hard to live in the moment. I\u2019m interested in how I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d\n\nALEX TRESNIOWSKI\n\n\n\nDEBBIE SEAMAN in New York City", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://people.com/img/misc/og-default.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Tresniowski"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/archive/basic-instinct-vol-49-no-5/", "title": "Basic Instinct", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brad Pitt,Demi Moore", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt,Demi Moore", "description": "Basic Instinct", "og": {"title": "Basic Instinct", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/archive/basic-instinct-vol-49-no-5/", "description": "DEMI MOORE SAYS SHE SAVED her from some major business mistakes.
