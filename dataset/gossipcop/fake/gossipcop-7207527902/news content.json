Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for WSJ Magazine\n\nYesterday, multiple outlets reported that Brad Pitt is under investigation for child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services after an incident that occurred on his family\u2019s private plane last Wednesday. More details have emerged about the incident that reportedly caused Angelina Jolie to file for divorce and request full custody of the couple\u2019s six children. Us Weekly is reporting that at least part of the alleged fight was caught on film, and TMZ and People are reporting that the fight involved Pitt and Jolie\u2019s 15-year-old son, Maddox.\n\nAccording to TMZ, \u201cthe details of precisely what happened\u201d are \u201cmurky,\u201d but the anonymous person who reported Pitt to the DCFS alleged that Pitt \u201cattacked\u201d Maddox on the family\u2019s flight home from Nice, France. From TMZ:\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s alleged \u2013 shortly after the plane took off, Brad and Angelina began arguing and Maddox jumped up to verbally defend his mom. We\u2019re told Brad then lunged at the boy and Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband. Brad connected in some fashion with his son.\n\nPeople, which has presented Pitt\u2019s side of the divorce story throughout the week, reports that Pitt \u201cdid not hit\u201d Maddox during the incident. A source close to Pitt provided People with the following account:\n\nPitt \u201cwas drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,\u201d says the source. \u201cThere was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe source says Pitt did not hurt his son. \u201cHe is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.\u201d\n\n\n\nA source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are \u201ca combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth \u2013 that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it \u2013 and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.\u201d\n\nLainey Lui of Lainey Gossip points out that, at some point last night, People removed the following sentence from the report: \u201cThe Pitt source adds that the star \u2018was not black-out drunk\u2019 and that \u2018he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.\u2019\u201d\n\nTMZ notes that Pitt\u2019s sources and Jolie\u2019s sources do not agree on whether or not Pitt was drunk during the incident, so that point remains unclear. TMZ reported yesterday that sometime after the incident, the plane landed in Minnesota to refuel, and \u201cthat\u2019s when eyewitnesses say Brad was \u2018out of control\u2019 on the tarmac and even tried to leave in a fuel truck.\u201d\n\nPitt has yet to release an official statement regarding the allegations. Us Weekly reports that, on the video of the incident, Pitt can be seen \u201clooking drunk\u201d and \u201cyelling.\u201d Us Weekly\u2019s source claims, however, that \u201cnothing physical\u201d happens on the tape.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Pitt still plans to fight for joint custody of his children.\n\nWe will update this post as more information becomes available.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2016/09/23/23-Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2016/09/23/23-Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2016/09/23/23-Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allie Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2016/09/everything-we-know-about-brad-pitts-plane-incident.html", "title": "Everything We Know About Brad Pitt\u2019s Plane Incident", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Everything We Know About Brad Pitt\u2019s Plane Incident", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2016/09/everything-we-know-about-brad-pitts-plane-incident.html", "description": "Multiple outlets report that it involved Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s 15-year-old son, Maddox.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2016/09/23/23-Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Everything We Know About Brad Pitt\u2019s Plane Incident", "description": "Multiple outlets report that it involved Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s 15-year-old son, Maddox.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2016/09/23/23-Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@allierileyjones", "site": "@TheCut"}, "description": "Multiple outlets report that it involved Pitt and Angelina Jolie\u2019s 15-year-old son, Maddox.", "article": {"tag": "brangelina divorce, brad pitt, angelina jolie, child abuse investigation, fame", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "sailthru.tags": "brangelina divorce, brad pitt, angelina jolie, child abuse investigation, fame", "author": "Allie Jones", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1474648620.0, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
