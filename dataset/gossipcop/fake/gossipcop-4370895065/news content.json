So you have to prepare and be ready for this.\n\n\u201cFor myself, I found it mentally and physically easier [during subsequent pregnancies] because I knew that I was going to have this and I knew what to expect from the treatment and what to expect generally.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Lia Toby/WENN\n\nOn the flip side, she notes, for some women the symptoms \u201cget worse each time.\u201d\n\nDean says that for women who have previously battled HG, there\u2019s a trepidation mixed in with the joy of anticipating a new baby.\n\n\u201cYou know it\u2019s coming, and it\u2019s quite a scary prospect knowing you\u2019re going to put yourself through that again. Certainly for me and my husband that was a huge decision. Not so much, \u2018Let\u2019s have a third kid,\u2019 but, \u2018Can we go through HG again?\u2019 It\u2019s certainly something that limits a lot of people who cannot go beyond two because of the condition.\n\n\u201cPreparing makes a huge amount of difference,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhat we suspect from experience is that if you prepare, you can start pre-emptive treatment and can prepare your household and your finances. The average woman doesn\u2019t have the life that Kate has with people to cook meals and people to do their cleaning for them and look\n\nafter their children. For regular women that preparation is absolutely key.\u201d\n\nSuch advance preparation, she adds, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily improve the sickness, although there is evidence that earlier treatment can reduce the overall impact of the symptoms. It isn\u2019t a cure, but it makes it easier to have done that preparation. Then, if you don\u2019t have HG on the third time, you haven\u2019t lost anything. [That scenario] would be brilliant. Very occasionally women don\u2019t get it again, but most of the time they do.\u201d\n\nPreparing also means keeping your younger children informed, says Dean, who wrote How To Be an HG Hero aimed at children of expectant moms.\n\nImage zoom Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\n\u201cThe idea with that is to help children understand why Mummy\u2019s not in the picture and why she\u2019s potentially in and out of hospital and how they can help,\u201d says Dean. \u201cMy key thing is honesty. A lot of people try to hide the fact they\u2019re pregnant in the first 12 weeks, because they\u2019re worried about having to explain a miscarriage if it happens. If you are going in and out of hospital and lying in bed day after day and not telling your kids the reason why, they\u2019re just going to worry about it and make up in their own heads why that is. Kids are resilient and they get on with that as long as you tell them the truth.\n\n\u201cIt is debilitating and miserable and hopefully [Kate\u2019s] children will not be worrying about it and understand that Mummy\u2019s poorly.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also tough on moms. \u201cYou have the fact that your other children are going to lose out on Mummy, and you have that guilt at not being able to spend so much time with them.\u201d\n\nAs for treatment, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include a first line of medication like Cyclizine, which is an anti-histamine and works to combat vomiting, and Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, it is IV fluids \u00adif she\u2019s not keeping food or fluids down,\u201d says Dean, who is not involved in Kate\u2019s treatment. \u201cThe main things is to keep her hydrated and able to eat. We know that malnutrition and dehydration can have a negative effect on the fetus. The idea that baby\u2019s fine with a starving mum just isn\u2019t true. It is important to keep mums hydrated so that they can eat as much as they need to or are able to.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2015%2F04%2Fkate-middleton-3-435-31.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fcharlotte-william-kate-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fgettyimages-545630546-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1582&h=828&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkate-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1582&h=828&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fkate-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Simon Perry"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/mom-of-3-who-suffered-same-morning-sickness-as-princess-kate-shares-her-survival-tips-its-miserable/", "title": "Expert on Kate Middleton's Severe Morning Sickness", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kate Middleton,Princess Kate,The Royals", "news_keywords": "Kate Middleton,Princess Kate,The Royals", "description": "Caitlin Dean, an expert on Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), or severe morning sickness, offers her advice to Kate Middleton for her third pregnancy", "og": {"title": "Expert on Kate Middleton's Severe Morning Sickness", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/royals/mom-of-3-who-suffered-same-morning-sickness-as-princess-kate-shares-her-survival-tips-its-miserable/", "description": "Princess Kate knew what was coming.
