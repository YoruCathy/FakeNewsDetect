Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.\n\n\u201cI do believe in marriage,\u201d the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. \u201cAnd I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I\u2019m not forcing anything right now.\u201d\n\nAs far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s good, it\u2019s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other\u2019s lives in a way that most other people couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.\u201d\n\nThe pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single \u201cUs\u201d written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for one year today. I don\u2019t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song\u2019s for you. I love you,\u201d she told the athlete while on stage.\n\nWhen talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: \u201cThey played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, \u2018Oh, this is relevant!\u2019 Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?\u2019\u201d\n\nLopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.\n\nA lot has changed in the \u201cDance Again\u201d songstress\u2019 life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. \u201cWhen I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cI know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I\u2019m glad I can do that now.\u201d\n\nLopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. \u201cBaseball is just like life,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you want to do is hit a home run.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-harpers-bazaar-2.jpg?w=245", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-marriage.jpg?w=226", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C1357px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-harpers-bazaar.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-harpers-bazaar-cover.jpg?w=245", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C1357px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-lopez-talks-marriage-and-alex-rodriguez/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Talks Marriage and Alex Rodriguez", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jennifer Lopez opened up in a new interview about her future with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez and shares whether marriage is in their plans \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Talks About Marriage and Alex Rodriguez", "description": "Jennifer Lopez opened up in a new interview about her future with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez and shares whether marriage is in their plans \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-lopez-talks-marriage-and-alex-rodriguez/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C1357px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C1357px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-15T16:09:31+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jennifer Lopez opened up in a new interview about her future with boyfriend Alex Rodriguez and shares whether marriage is in their plans \u2014 details", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Talks About Marriage and Alex Rodriguez", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C1357px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521130171.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
