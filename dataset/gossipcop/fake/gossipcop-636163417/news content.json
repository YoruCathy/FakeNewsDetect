After the Twilight hunk\u2019s anguish-filled years with ex Stewart, we really think that twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Barnett, is just that much better for him.\n\nHere are five reasons why we think twigs blows Stewart way out of the water, and is a far better match for the hunky actor.\n\ntwigs is way friendlier. The half-Jamaican, half-Spanish rising star is so much friendlier to fans both online and offline as well as to eager photographers. She has a much sweeter disposition and does not make your hair stand on end when giving interviews.\n\nShe makes him smile. Spotted on a recent shopping trip together, Pattinson and twigs were constantly smiling and laughing as they tried different outfits on. \u201cThey were trying things on, making suggestions to one another, and he seemed to be really having a good time,\u201d an onlooker told People. This is a far cry from Pattinson\u2019s appearances with Stewart, where both always sported mega-pouts on their faces and looked like someone died on a continuous basis.\n\nShe makes him feel relaxed. Every time RPatz and twigs are seen together, he seems very relaxed and comfortable with her. They were recently spotted in Paris walking hand in hand looking tr\u00e8s snug and cozy with each other. \u201cThey\u2019re very cute together,\u201d another insider added.\n\nShe sings. Pattinson loves him some music. So, \u2019nuff said on this one.\n\nShe\u2019s classy. No matter how hard Stewart tried, she just never seemed to pull the classy look together. Blame it on her perpetual grumpiness if you will, but the girl just lacks refinement, even while in the prettiest red carpet looks.", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.sheknows.com&path=%2Fentertainment%2Farticles%2F1053951%2Freasons-why-robert-pattinsons-new-love-leaves-kristen-stewart-in-the-dust%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1053951", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/judi-dench.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Elton-John-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kenneth-Armando.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/thequarry_6-h_2020.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sbujz5zs2pqyfm62ftma.jpeg?w=695&h=391&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?quality=98&w=330#038;ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kim-kardashian-north-saint-throwback-spl-ftr.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sam-Heughan-Caitriona-Balfe.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Reese-Witherspoon-2013-arrest.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=150&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sbujz5zs2pqyfm62ftma.jpeg", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/peel-keychain-touch-tool-featured-image.jpg?quality=98&w=330"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sbujz5zs2pqyfm62ftma.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Sanclement"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1053951/reasons-why-robert-pattinsons-new-love-leaves-kristen-stewart-in-the-dust/", "title": "5 Reasons Rob Pattinson\u2019s new love leaves Kristen Stewart in the dust \u2013 SheKnows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Robert Pattinson's new gf FKA twigs is way better for him than Kristen Stewart ever was.", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "author": "Anna Sanclement", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Why we think FKA twigs is way better for Robert Pattinson than KStew ever was", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1053951/reasons-why-robert-pattinsons-new-love-leaves-kristen-stewart-in-the-dust/", "description": "Robert Pattinson's new gf FKA twigs is way better for him than Kristen Stewart ever was.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sbujz5zs2pqyfm62ftma.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-15T17:39:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-10T01:38:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Why we think FKA twigs is way better for Robert Pattinson than KStew ever was"}, "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sbujz5zs2pqyfm62ftma.jpeg?w=1024", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SheKnows", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/MamaWrites13", "title": "Why we think FKA twigs is way better for Robert Pattinson than KStew ever was", "description": "Robert Pattinson's new gf FKA twigs is way better for him than Kristen Stewart ever was."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-sk-favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1413394740.0, "source": "http://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
