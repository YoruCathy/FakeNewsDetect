Both Rooney and Charlie's representatives had no comment when contacted by Page Six, and the pair have not been photographed together since August (16).\n\nDespite Page Six's report, Joaquin's representative has denied the actor and Rooney are anything apart from \"good friends\".\n\n\u201cThey worked on (2013 film) Her, Mary Magdalene and their next movie (Don\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot, due for release in 2018),\u201d his rep said. \u201cThey are and have been good friends for quite a long time.\u201d\n\nJoaquin has previously been romantically linked to actresses Liv Tyler and Anna Paquin, and DJ Allie Teilz. He hit headlines in 2014 when he announced he was engaged to a yoga instructor who had helped him \"harness his hog\", but it was later revealed to be an unusual joke.\n\n\u00a9 Cover Media\n\nOnline
