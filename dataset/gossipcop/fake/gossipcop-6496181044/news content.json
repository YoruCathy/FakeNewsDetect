You've had enough lessons. You've been patient long enough.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Kardashian-Jenner gang aren\u2019t exactly Tristan\u2019s number one fans, with an insider telling E!: \u201cKhloe just avoids talking about him and doesn't bring him up. She knows they don't approve and its extremely uncomfortable to bring anything up.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd while the same source said that Koko is \u201chappy\u201d in their relationship, a separate insider told Us Weekly that their romance is on shaky ground rn and that the pair are finding it difficult to leave the cheating ordeal in the past and move forwards as a couple.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sites/cosmopolitan/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucia Ennis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a20922251/khloe-kardashian-ditches-tristan-thompsons-name-from-anniversary-card/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian ditches Tristan Thompson\u2019s name from anniversary card", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Khloe Kardashian ditches Tristan Thompson\u2019s name from anniversary card", "description": "This doesn't look good", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a20922251/khloe-kardashian-ditches-tristan-thompsons-name-from-anniversary-card/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 211620818858710}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/cosmopolitanuk", "modified_time": "2018-05-26 09:32:55", "published_time": "2018-05-26 09:32:00", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CosmopolitanUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Khloe Kardashian ditches Tristan Thompson\u2019s name from anniversary card", "description": "This doesn't look good", "keywords": "khloe kardashian, tristan thompson, sign, relationship, over, ditch, name, anniversary card, kim kardashian, cheating, ordeal, true thompson, name, missing", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-26T09:32:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kiss-1527326753.png?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Khloe Kardashian ditches Tristan Thompson\u2019s name from anniversary card", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527298320.0, "source": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
