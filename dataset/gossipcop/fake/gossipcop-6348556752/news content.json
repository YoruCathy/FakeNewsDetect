But they are hoping she\u2019ll do one day, two days, one hour, fill in \u2019til Christmas. Anything.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUnless you get a superstar [on the show], it\u2019s always going to be, \u2018Charlie\u2019s missing,'\" an insider told the publication.\n\nA CBS representative declined to comment to Page Six.\n\nEarlier this year, Winfrey was hired by CBS to be a special contributor to \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nThe Page Six report comes after The Washington Post reported earlier this week that eight women are accusing Rose of sexual misconduct. On Wednesday, a CBS report said three CBS employees had also accused Rose of sexual harassment.\n\nCBS News and PBS fired Rose Tuesday in response to the allegations.\n\nRose said in a statement earlier this week he had behaved \"insensitively\" at times, but said some of the allegations against him were not accurate.\n\nDuring Tuesday's broadcast of \"CBS This Morning,\" co-host Norah O'Donnell said there's \"no excuse\" for Rose's behavior.\n\n\"This will be investigated. This has to end,\" she said. \"This behavior is wrong. Period.\"\n\nCo-host Gayle King also said Rose \"does not get a pass here.\"", "images": ["http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-big.png", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/ca_kristof_wudunn_tightrope.jpg?itok=imgzunVm", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/bidenjoe_022920gn24_lead.jpg?itok=WdXZePZS", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_small_article/public/article_images/oprah_013117getty.jpg?itok=7OPCsTuM", "http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-footer.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10314615&c3=&c4=https%3A//thehill.com/homenews/media/361544-cbs-this-morning-wants-oprah-to-fill-in-for-charlie-rose-after-firing-report&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/palihapitiyachamath_04172020_0.jpg?itok=98iKkeEX", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/oprah_013117getty.jpg"], "top_img": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/oprah_013117getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/media/361544-cbs-this-morning-wants-oprah-to-fill-in-for-charlie-rose-after-firing-report", "title": "'CBS This Morning' wants Oprah to fill in for fired Charlie Rose: report", "meta_data": {"author": "Rebecca Savransky", "description": "\"CBS This Morning\" is reportedly \"begging\" Oprah Winfrey to fill in for former co-host Charlie Rose, who was fired from the network after sexual harassment allegations.", "keywords": "Charlie Rose, CBS News, CBS, Oprah Winfrey, Television, Sexual harassment,,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "fb": {"admins": 1531470032, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": "7533944086, 2064147433830888"}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "type": "article", "title": "'CBS This Morning' wants Oprah to fill in for fired Charlie Rose: report", "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/media/361544-cbs-this-morning-wants-oprah-to-fill-in-for-charlie-rose-after-firing-report", "description": "\"CBS This Morning\" is reportedly \"begging\" Oprah Winfrey to fill in for former co-host Charlie Rose, who was fired from the network after sexual harassment allegations.", "updated_time": "2017-11-22T11:31:36-05:00", "image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/oprah_013117getty.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'CBS This Morning' wants Oprah to fill in for fired Charlie Rose:", "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/media/361544-cbs-this-morning-wants-oprah-to-fill-in-for-charlie-rose-after-firing-report", "description": "\"CBS This Morning\" is reportedly \"begging\" Oprah Winfrey to fill in for former co-host Charlie Rose, who was fired from the network after sexual harassment allegations.", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-22T10:58:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-22T11:31:36-05:00"}, "dcterms.title": "'CBS This Morning' wants Oprah to fill in for fired Charlie Rose: report", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Savransky", "dcterms.description": "\"CBS This Morning\" is reportedly \"begging\" Oprah Winfrey to fill in for former co-host Charlie Rose, who was fired from the network after sexual harassment allegations.", "dcterms.date": "2017-11-22T10:58-05:00", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.identifier": "https://thehill.com/homenews/media/361544-cbs-this-morning-wants-oprah-to-fill-in-for-charlie-rose-after-firing-report", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511366295.0, "source": "http://thehill.com", "summary": ""}
