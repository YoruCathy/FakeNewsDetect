Kris allegedly drafted up a iron clad contract with strict rules Travis has to follow!\n\nKris Jenner, 62, is the ultimate momager! The Kardashian/Jenner matriarch allegedly gave Travis Scott, 25, a massive pay day \u2014 aka $4 million \u2014 to stick around after Kylie Jenner, 20, gave birth to their baby daughter, Stormi Webster on February 1, according to Star magazine. \u201cKris doesn\u2019t trust Travis to be there fore Kylie \u2014 not without a cash incentive, anyway,\u201d a source tells the mag. Kris allegedly put the cash plan into action when Travis was caught at a strip club back in December 2017. At the time, \u201cKris asked him point-blank if he was going to be there for kylie, and he wouldn\u2019t give her an answer,\u201d the insider admits. \u201cSo, she made him an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d\n\nThe site goes on to report that Kris then drafted up a \u201ccontract\u201d with some pretty strict rules for Kylie\u2019s baby daddy. Per the alleged contract, Travis cannot date (or impregnate) anyone else, the mag claims. And, the rapper reportedly must spend a certain amount of hours a week with Stormi and Kylie, who apparently has no idea her mother took these drastic measure, according to the source. The insider even goes as far as to claim that Kylie\u2019s push present from Travis \u2014 a $1.4 million Ferrari \u2014 may have been purchased by her own family, instead of her man, as part of the \u201ccontract.\u201d The source continued, \u201cIf Kylie knew about this deal, she\u2019d be furious and beyond humiliated.\u201d\n\nWhile Kris Jenner is known to be a force when it comes to her kids, as well as a good business deal, this sounds a tad bit extreme. Kris, Travis and Kylie have yet to address this recent report.\n\nKylie and Travis were most recently spotted, without baby Stormi, spending some QT mom and dad time on a boat in Miami on Sunday, March 4. The new parents enjoyed a romantic lunch and cuddled up on a boat ride, where they were pictured together.\n\nThe makeup mogul revealed her pregnancy and the birth of her first child on February 4 in a 11-minute long video, which documented her entire pregnancy. She welcomed a healthy baby girl \u2014 who was 8 pounds, 9 ounces \u2014 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 1. Since giving birth, Kylie\u2019s returned to her normal social media use after taking a 9-month hiatus from the spotlight to enjoy her pregnancy in private. The news of Kylie\u2019s pregnancy broke in September 2017.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2F08%2Fdid-kris-jenner-pay-travis-scott-father-kylie-jenner-baby-millions%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3027748", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kris_travis-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kris_travis-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kris_travis-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/08/did-kris-jenner-pay-travis-scott-father-kylie-jenner-baby-millions/", "title": "Did Kris Jenner Pay Travis Scott $4 Million To Step Up For Kylie Jenner?
