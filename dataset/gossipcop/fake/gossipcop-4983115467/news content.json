Paris Jackson got cozy with Aussie model Tyler Green during the Melbourne Cup horse race in November, and her famous family isn\u2019t exactly moonwalking with delight. They fear the pairing could spell trouble for the 19-year-old model, who\u2019s struggled with sobriety in the past.\n\n\u201cParis\u2019 family worries she\u2019ll start partying again because of Tyler,\u201d an insider exclusively tells Life & Style. Tyler, 25, has bragged about his wild ways on Instagram, posting about months of \u201cfar too much drinking\u201d and praising \u201cbottomless red wine and pure debauchery.\u201d\n\n(Photo Credit: Splash)\n\nDespite those red flags, Paris \u2014 who\u2019s admitted to attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and who says she was suicidal after the death of dad Michael Jackson \u2014 is smitten. \u201cParis is trying to walk the straight and narrow, but she\u2019s also looking for fun,\u201d notes the insider. \u201cShe makes her own decisions, but her family wants her to make the right ones.\u201d\n\nParis\u2019 family\u2019s concerns about her latest romance come months after she finally called it quits with on-and-off boyfriend Michael Snoddy. Back in February, a source told Us Weekly that the duo broke up after less than a year of dating. Though the insider said that Paris could end up reconciling with Michael in the future, they also said that the aspiring actress was more focused on her career than her love life.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Paris and Michael have parted ways for now, but their future is uncertain,\u201d the source said, adding that Paris was very excited about her guest role on Fox\u2019s TV drama Star. \u201cShe is doing well, enjoying being on set with Lee Daniels and focusing her energy on the opportunities ahead.\u201d\n\nWhile she has yet to make her relationship with Tyler Instagram official, Paris did post a telling quote about love on Oct. 23: \u201cPeople say love ism blind because they do not know what love is. I say unto you, only love has eyes; other than love, everything is blind.\u201d\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/True-Thompson-Dream-Kardashian-Cute-Photos-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C125px%2C1080px%2C613px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Selfie.jpg?crop=199px%2C0px%2C810px%2C810px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Thompson-Already-Loves-Picking-Out-Her-Own-Clothes.jpg?crop=71px%2C393px%2C939px%2C531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/who-is-sophia-richie.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/paris-jackson.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-06-at-10-39-58-am.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Admits-She-Will-\u2018Never-Come-in-Between\u2019-Tristan-and-Daughter-True-After-Scandal-pp.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-06-at-10-39-58-am.png?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Khloe-Kardashians-Daughter-True-Thompson-Really-Lights-Up-When-Aunt-Kylie-Jenner-Comes-Over.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Skincare-Routine-Should-You-Try-It-Out-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10491194ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C179px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scott-Kourtney-Coparents.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/paris-jackson-wendy-williams.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scott-Disick-and-Sofia-Richie.jpg?crop=0px%2C62px%2C2280px%2C1294px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/paris-jackson-tyler-green.jpg?w=1180&h=985&crop=1", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-fat-jewish-emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-marriage-exclusive-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-06-at-10-39-58-am.png?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Magazine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/paris-jackson-boyfriend-tyler-green-148370/", "title": "Paris Jackson's Boyfriend Tyler Green Is Bad News, According to Her Family", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Uh-oh.
