The RadarOnline article alleges the MIT professor \u201chas been a great influence\u201d on the actor and is \u201cextremely supportive\u201d of his sobriety.\n\n\u201cShe is about as straight-laced as they come\u2026 Neri is a firm believer that people should not put anything into their bodies that does not belong,\u201d a \u201csource\u201d told the site.\n\nPitt first admitted he gave up alcohol during a 2017 interview with GQ. The actor revealed he was an avid drinker and smoker for more than half his life but was motivated to stop following his divorce.\n\n\u201cI mean I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year, you know\u2014things I wasn't dealing with. I was boozing too much. It\u2019s just become a problem. And I'm really happy it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again,\u201d he told the publication.\n\nWhile the false report alleges Oxman has been a key factor in keeping Pitt from falling off the wagon, Gossip Cop noted another publication had already reported that the actor had actually already worked out a strategy to maintain his sobriety.\n\n\u201cHe goes to therapy every week and is mostly interested in learning and bettering himself as a man and father,\u201d a source told Us Weekly in January.\n\nPitt continues to remain committed to the six children--Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9-- he shares with Jolie. The actor is reportedly expected to spend his summer in Los Angeles to be closer to them as he and the actress hammer out a divorce settlement.\n\nPhoto: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/facebook-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-combat-misinformation.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/01/23/coronavirus-pets.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/there-are-growing-global-doubts-about-the-transparency-AFP_1QN6F7.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/03/05/massachusetts-senator-elizabeth-warrens-withdrawal-makes-the-democratic.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/10/12/louis-rocha-president-of-the-uaw-local-5960.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2018/05/24/angelina-jolie.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/24/brad-pitt.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/golds-gym.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/03/convalescent-plasma-the-fluid-in-blood-teeming-with.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/kristi_l._noem_113th_congress.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/24/brad-pitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitts-rumored-girlfriend-not-assisting-actors-sobriety-amid-angelina-jolie-2684279", "title": "Brad Pitt\u2019s Rumored Girlfriend Not Assisting Actor\u2019s Sobriety Amid Angelina Jolie Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "brad pitt dating 2018, brad pitt girlfriend, brad pitt and angelina jolie 2018, brad pitt new girlfriend, brad pitt angelina jolie divorce, brad pitt new girlfriend neri oxman", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitts-rumored-girlfriend-not-assisting-actors-sobriety-amid-angelina-jolie-2684279", "title": "Brad Pitt\u2019s Rumored Girlfriend Not Assisting Actor\u2019s Sobriety Amid Angelina Jolie Divorce", "description": "Brad Pitt is not receiving sobriety support from his girlfriend Neri Oxman.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/24/brad-pitt.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/24/brad-pitt.jpg", "height": 663, "width": 1024, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Cortney Drakeford", "modified_time": "2018-05-24T15:56:40-04:00", "published_time": "2018-05-24T15:56:40-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt\u2019s Rumored Girlfriend Not Assisting Actor\u2019s Sobriety Amid Angelina Jolie Divorce", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitts-rumored-girlfriend-not-assisting-actors-sobriety-amid-angelina-jolie-2684279", "description": "Brad Pitt is not receiving sobriety support from his girlfriend Neri Oxman.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/24/brad-pitt.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "brad pitt dating 2018, brad pitt girlfriend, brad pitt and angelina jolie 2018, brad pitt new girlfriend, brad pitt angelina jolie divorce, brad pitt new girlfriend neri oxman", "author": "Cortney Drakeford", "description": "Brad Pitt is not receiving sobriety support from his girlfriend Neri Oxman."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527191800.0, "source": "http://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
