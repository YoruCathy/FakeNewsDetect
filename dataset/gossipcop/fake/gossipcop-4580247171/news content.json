The rumored couple even wore matching outfits for their excursion\u2026 so what gives? Are they dating?\n\nCara Delevingne, 25, and Paris Jackson, 20, have been stirring up romance rumors left and right and their latest outing is only fueling the fire. The pair were spotted hanging out together in New York City just a few hours after they each attended the Longchamp Fifth Avenue store opening on May 3. Paris wore a printed white t-shirt, jeans, and black booties, while the Paper Towns star rocked a strikingly similar ensemble: a white tank top, denim Bermuda shorts and black knee-high boots.\n\nWhile the two women have yet to confirm whether or not they\u2019re dating, fans are dying to know their relationship status. Fortunately, we\u2019ve heard that there\u2019s a unique bond between them. \u201cCara and Paris are crazy about each other,\u201d a source close to the British model tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThey have amazing chemistry and a super strong attraction. Whenever they\u2019re together they have an awesome time.\u201d\n\nHowever, their time together is often limited due to scheduling conflicts \u2013 as per most celebrity friendships and relationships. \u201cCara and Paris don\u2019t get to see each other as much as they would like to right now, as Cara\u2019s work schedule is insane, but when they do they really make the most of their time together,\u201d our insider adds. \u201cCara is totally smitten with Paris, she loves how smart and funny she is, and finds her sexy as hell.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this week that the two models had fans questioning if they were an item. Paris shared a pic of her rumored girlfriend\u2019s profile on Instagram. The image showed Cara blowing smoke from a cigarette out of her mouth and standing outside against a wall. What\u2019s most interesting about the photo, however, is that she also had a giant red lipstick mark on her cheek. The post wasn\u2019t accompanied with a caption, so jury\u2019s still out on what it means.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LSSC417.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10377013af.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F05%2Fparis-jackson-cara-delevingne-matching-outfits-night-out-nyc-dating-pic%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3113893", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/courteneylarocca2.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-enjoy-night-out-in-matching-outfits-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-enjoy-night-out-in-matching-outfits-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-enjoy-night-out-in-matching-outfits-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Claire Shaffer", "Tyler Hersko", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/05/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-matching-outfits-night-out-nyc-dating-pic/", "title": "Paris Jackson & Cara Delevingne Enjoy Night Out In Matching Outfits: They Have \u2018Amazing Chemistry\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Paris Jackson and Cara Delevingne stirred up romance rumors when they were spotted out together in matching outfits on May 3.", "news_keywords": "Cara Delevingne, Paris Jackson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Paris Jackson & Cara Delevingne Enjoy Night Out In Matching Outfits: They Have \u2018Amazing Chemistry\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/05/paris-jackson-cara-delevingne-matching-outfits-night-out-nyc-dating-pic/", "description": "Paris Jackson and Cara Delevingne were spotted out on the town in New York!
