(Meanwhile we have not been so intrigued by Lopez's phone activity since Leonardo DiCaprio called her \"boo-boo\" in a text conversation during \"Carpool Karaoke\" in 2016.)\n\nLopez did answer the phone and assured DeGeneres \"I always pick up when he calls,\" seemingly taking a shot at her man. How often does she answer calls from DeGeneres? \"Occasionally\" JLo cracked, getting a huge laugh from the audience.\n\nMore:Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez open up about hard times, including the years after 'Gigli'\n\nMore:Seth Rogen says Stormy Daniels told him about alleged Trump affair a decade ago", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?width=1418&height=801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5766961483001_5766958733001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?width=1418&height=801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/04/09/alex-rodriguez-facetimes-jennifer-lopez-ellen-degeneres/498248002/", "title": "Alex Rodriguez says if you want Jennifer Lopez's love, you have to answer her calls", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Alex Rodriguez says if you want Jennifer Lopez's love, you have to answer her calls", "description": "If you have Jennifer Lopez's love, you better pick up the phone.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/04/09/alex-rodriguez-facetimes-jennifer-lopez-ellen-degeneres/498248002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?width=1418&height=801&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1418, "height": 801}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen and Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "If you have Jennifer Lopez's love, you better pick up the phone.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?width=1418&height=709&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Alex Rodriguez says if you want Jennifer Lopez's love, you have to answer her calls", "description": "If you have Jennifer Lopez's love, you better pick up the phone."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523203200.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
