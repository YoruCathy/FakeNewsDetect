But she has noticeably begun to raise her profile, independent from the president\u2019s, and she has called a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, a public appearance that would have been almost unthinkable just a few months ago.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHer focus all along has been children, and this launch is meant to formalize what her role will be for the next three to seven years,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, Melania\u2019s spokeswoman. She said the first lady will devote the rest of the Trump presidency to the issues children face today and their well-being.\n\nIn recent weeks, the first lady has been at the center of more high-profile events than during the entire previous year \u2014 including attending the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush solo.\n\nAD\n\nPolitical marriages tend to be more complicated than most, but it\u2019s striking that the Trumps make so little effort to project a more united front. Although both are keenly aware of the power of visual images, some of their memorable moments together are awkward: Melania swatting his hand away on a tarmac, and several times caught on camera seeming to resist his outreach.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe is a dignified, private person, and she\u2019ll deal with her personal life in private and it\u2019s no one\u2019s business,\u201d said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a longtime friend of Melania\u2019s. \u201cThey are not that couple that holds hands just because; she is old-world European and it\u2019s not who she is.\u201d\n\nIt is unusual to see a candid shot of the president enjoying an unplanned moment with his wife, or even with Barron, the first young son in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1960s.\n\nAD\n\nThe Trumps are often apart even during their free time, according to several people who know the couple\u2019s schedules. At Mar-a-Lago on holidays and weekends, the president golfs or dines with politicians, business executives and media personalities on the patio, while Melania is often nowhere to be seen. According to several current and former aides, the president and first lady often do not eat together in the White House either.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey spend very little to no time together,\u201d said one longtime friend of the president.\n\nGrisham said the president and Melania do spend time with each other. \u201cAside from the president\u2019s solo trips, the family spends most evenings together.\u201d She also played down the headlines about Trump\u2019s alleged affairs and said Melania \u201cis focused on being a mom. She\u2019s focused on being a wife, and she\u2019s focused on her role as first lady. And that\u2019s it. The rest is just noise.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA senior West Wing official, when asked about the couple\u2019s separate schedules and bedrooms, declined to comment, saying it wasn\u2019t official business.\n\nMelania grants few interviews and declined to speak for this article, but during the campaign she told The Washington Post that she and her husband are \u201cvery independent,\u201d adding, \u201cWe give ourselves and each other space.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to several people who know the couple, that space appears to have grown wider under the White House roof \u2014 especially since Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, as well as Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, publicly talked about their alleged affairs with Trump during his marriage to Melania. Daniels was paid $130,000 during the campaign by a Trump attorney to stop talking about the affair.\n\nAD\n\nLast week, Trump tweeted that he repaid the attorney to \u201cstop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, told NBC News that payment was made \u201cto prevent personal embarrassment and heartache to [Trump\u2019s] wife.\u201d\n\nAnother awkward exchange happened April 26 with Trump calling into \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d announcing that it was Melania\u2019s birthday, and then suddenly talking about Daniels. Asked on the same TV show what he had gotten Melania for her birthday, he paused: \u201cMaybe, I didn\u2019t get her so much. I got her a beautiful card, you know I\u2019m very busy to be running out looking for presents.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAccording to several White House staff members, Melania has erected a de facto wall between the East Wing, where she is renovating her office and enjoying growing popularity, and the West Wing, where her husband and Ivanka Trump, her eldest stepdaughter, have offices.\n\nAD\n\nWhile she goes to the West Wing for official duties, she does not walk down the hall, pop her head in and see how the president\u2019s day is going.\n\n\u201cShe seldom sets foot in the West Wing,\u201d said one person with firsthand knowledge.\n\nYet, many political analysts believe that Trump will need Melania at his side if he wants to win again in 2020.\n\nThe Trumps have broken the traditional mold of a presidential family from the moment he was sworn in. While Melania stood beside the president at the Capitol, his two ex-wives, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples, sat in the crowd.\n\nAD\n\nTrump is the only president to be married three times. Melania is 48, and the president is 71.\n\nAD\n\nRather than move into the White House with her husband, Melania stayed in New York for six months to allow Barron to finish his school year there. That delay initially put Melania at a disadvantage, according to a friend who said the rhythm of the White House had already been established, and left her out of the mix. Some staff positions from the first lady\u2019s office were diverted to the West Wing \u2014 including to support Ivanka, who is a presidential adviser, according to a person close to the first lady.\n\nIvanka, 36, and Melania, both former models, do not have a close relationship and are very different from one another, several people who know them both said. Grisham said it was not only wrong to say Melania was not close to her stepdaughter but \u201churtful.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNoticeably, Melania\u2019s presence is growing as Ivanka\u2019s fades.\n\nAD\n\nLast year, an official White House statement described Ivanka as holding an \u201cunprecedented role for a first daughter\u201d and she has at times taken on the duties of a first lady. Ivanka acts as the president\u2019s policy adviser, has traveled the globe as her father\u2019s surrogate, and sat down with world leaders at the White House. But recently her public profile has been reduced.\n\nFirst ladies often have had considerable influence, as an informal adviser to the president and the person closest to him. They have been the hidden hand in policy decisions and hiring and firings. And, they can command attention for causes. Most recently, Laura Bush established the National Book Festival and used her foreign trips to focus concern on HIV/AIDS, and Michelle Obama promoted girls\u2019 education globally and started a movement here to get children exercising and eating healthier.\n\nAD\n\nMelania\u2019s staff is unusually small; with 10 people, it is about half the size of Michelle Obama\u2019s at its peak.\n\nMelania has borrowed books from the White House Historical Association to study the first lady\u2019s role and plans to outline on Monday a new initiative concerning children.\n\nSeveral polls have shown that as she becomes more visible, her popularity is rising. In many ways the image she projects is the least like Trump\u2019s of all the Trumps.\n\nThe president organizes big rallies; Melania often holds meetings with just a few people. Her husband rails against family-based \u201cchain migration\u201d; she is from Slovenia and now her parents, also immigrants, have become legal residents here, too.\n\nThe president mocks political enemies on Twitter with his derogatory nicknames such as \u201cCryin\u2019 Charles E. Schumer\u201d or \u201cCheatin\u2019 Obama\u201d; Melania calls cyberbullying an \u201cevil\u201d and organized a White House conference to try to stop it.\n\nMelania has complained that she doesn\u2019t deserve the mean comments she has read about herself online. She has been heard saying that she knows her husband has contributed to the combative nature of today\u2019s online chatter, and one associate said she has persisted with her anti-cyberbullying efforts despite White House advice that she pick any other issue to champion.\n\nIn March, Melania invited top executives from Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies, along with nonprofits working on Internet safety, to the White House to hold a meeting on the issue.\n\n\u201cI am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\u201d she told the group. \u201cI have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me for doing what I know is right,\u201d she said in opening remarks. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.\u201d\n\nStephen Balkam, the founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute, was seated at a table with the first lady. \u201cIt was a pretty remarkable opening,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pleased that she addressed the elephant in the room.\u201d\n\nMelania has not always been willing to go in a different direction from her husband. In 2011, when Trump was one of the leading \"birthers\" challenging the validity of President Obama's birth certificate and U.S. citizenship, Melania backed him up.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this with the birth certificate obsession? Did he ask to see yours when you met him?\u201d asked TV interviewer Joy Behar.\n\n\u201cDo you want to see President Obama\u2019s birth certificate or not?\u201d Melania responded. She also said what Obama had made public to date was \u201cdifferent\u201d from a birth certificate. \u201cIt would be very easy if President Obama would just show it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is not only Donald who wants to see it. It\u2019s the American people . . . they want to see that.\u201d\n\nBut as first lady, she has publicly praised Michelle Obama and laughed alongside President Obama, who sat beside her at Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral last month in Houston. She also shared the pew with Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 two favorite targets of her husband\u2019s criticism.\n\nMelania received a warm reception from the former presidents and first ladies. Photos of them all together \u2014 the Obamas, the Clintons, George W. Bush, Laura Bush and George H.W. Bush \u2014 show Melania beaming.\n\nShe has also traveled apart from her husband \u2014 even when they are going to the same destination. In February, hours after the New Yorker published a story about Trump\u2019s alleged affair with McDougal, the Playboy model, Melania did not walk with Trump across the White House\u2019s South Lawn to board Marine One.\n\nBoth Trumps were heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, but instead of making the very public walk across the White House lawn with her husband to the helicopter, she drove separately to the Maryland military airport to catch Air Force One. Grisham told reporters at the time that given the first lady\u2019s schedule, it was just easier for the couple to meet at the plane. When her motorcade pulled up, White House press aides shouted at journalists to get off the plane until she boarded. No photos were allowed of her arrival.\n\nAs first ladies often are, Melania is more popular than her husband. But two friends of the couple say the president, who pays close attention to his poll numbers, also fixates on hers. Her approval rating was 47 percent to his 40 percent in a January CNN poll.\n\nGrisham said Melania takes her role seriously and is careful to coordinate with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this out,\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019ll wait for you.\u2019 . . . We don\u2019t want to conflict with the president\u2019s message of the day, nor do we want him to do that to us.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cthe 24/7 social media-cable news cycle and a West Wing that\u2019s very active . . . perhaps overshadows some of the good work she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nTrump described Melania to supporters in a recent email as his \u201crock and foundation.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today without her by my side,\u201d he said. \u201cMy BEAUTIFUL, kindhearted and exceptional wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have an unspoken affinity,\u201d said Winston Wolkoff, whose official advisory arrangement in the first lady\u2019s office ended earlier this year amid headlines about inauguration spending and the White House\u2019s move to end informal contracts.\n\nAnother person close to the president said they had heard him call Melania when he travels and \u201cshe is someone he relies on and listens to.\u201d\n\nMelania has said she sometimes offers advice to her husband \u2014 including about his tweets \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean he takes it.\n\nDuring one dinner in the White House in late 2017, Melania told the president that he should be more concerned about the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and that his legal team wasn\u2019t protecting him, according to a person who attended the dinner. Trump disagreed, this person said, insisting that the investigation was going to exonerate him and that he had great lawyers. Grisham disputed this account, saying: \u201cYour anonymous sources are wrong.\u201d Since that dinner, two of three lawyers have left Trump\u2019s Russia team.\n\nSeveral people in the White House, who like others interviewed for this story did not want to be quoted by name discussing the first couple\u2019s relationship, said Melania does not trust some members of her husband\u2019s staff. Two people in a position to know said she particularly disliked former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and told her husband so, and she was upset about the abrupt dismissal of John McEntee, Trump\u2019s young personal assistant. He left over a security clearance issue but is now working on Trump\u2019s reelection effort.\n\nTrump insisted on a prenuptial agreement when he married Melania 13 years ago, just as he had with his two previous wives. The terms have never been made public. A person close to Melania noted that the prenuptial was signed before his political career, which forced her to take on a whole new role and one, as a friend said, that is \u201cunpaid.\u201d\n\n\"Free Melania!\" continues to be a popular meme. Late-night TV comedy skits portray her as trapped inside the White House, unhappy.\n\nFor months, a persistent rumor has floated around Washington that Melania doesn\u2019t really live in the White House and stays in a house with her parents and Barron near his suburban Washington school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1,000 percent false. We laugh at it all the time,\u201d Grisham said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an urban legend,\u201d said Rickie Niceta Lloyd, the White House social secretary.\n\nMelania is exceedingly close to her parents and her son, Barron, who also speaks Slovenian with his grandparents. When she is out of the public eye, she is often with her family, friends say.\n\nHer office declined to say where her parents live, or even whether they keep a room at the White House, as Michelle Obama\u2019s mother did.\n\nMelania does spend a lot of time in the White House, according to people who work there, and has a very good relationship with the permanent household staff of nearly 100 that includes chefs, florists and butlers, and she oversees the residence as well as the state floor.\n\nFriends say she is a perfectionist who oversees the tiniest details of events in which she is involved.\n\nShe enjoys putting her personal mark on the historic home and has redesigned the family living quarters. While her husband favors the lavish gold-and-glitz decor of their Trump Tower penthouse, Melania has picked neutral colors.\n\n\u201cIt is a very comfortable and calming place to be in,\u201d Winston Wolkoff said.\n\nStill, Trump often waves friends up to the residence after holiday parties or social gatherings and gives tours of the Lincoln Bedroom, where he remarks on how tall the former president was while showing off the Gettysburg Address and other features of the home. Melania has, however, told confidantes she wants to keep the residence private.\n\nAlthough English is not her first language, she is getting more used to public speaking. She has also begun releasing videos of her work.\n\nThe latest highly produced video shows her preparing for the recent state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron and has been viewed by nearly 1.5 million people.\n\nTwenty-two years after first coming to the United States to model, she is now one of the most-photographed women in the world.\n\nPaolo Zampolli, who helped arrange for Melania to work in the U.S. fashion industry and sees her in the White House, said Melania is blossoming.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/47129288-549e-43ef-88ef-932b32346185.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/dac07c79-53b6-4b3b-95da-7d79619a3263.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L9cp2Wm-9VFJrVMuonJ1F119uWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NW6NPFCXZEI6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NW6NPFCXZEI6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/91714749-fd0b-49b1-a2e5-6fa1578c490e.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L9cp2Wm-9VFJrVMuonJ1F119uWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NW6NPFCXZEI6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Jordan", "National Political Correspondent", "Emily Heil", "Co-Author Of The Reliable Source", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/inside-melania-trumps-complicated-white-house-life-separate-schedules-different-priorities/2018/05/06/60f6f07e-4703-11e8-9072-f6d4bc32f223_story.html", "title": "Inside Melania Trump\u2019s complicated White House life: Separate schedule, different priorities", "meta_data": {"description": "Amid the chaos of her husband\u2019s presidency, the first lady raises her profile and defines her role.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/inside-melania-trumps-complicated-white-house-life-separate-schedules-different-priorities/2018/05/06/60f6f07e-4703-11e8-9072-f6d4bc32f223_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L9cp2Wm-9VFJrVMuonJ1F119uWQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NW6NPFCXZEI6PBALKEQCMMM5U4.jpg", "title": "Inside Melania Trump\u2019s complicated White House life: Separate schedule, different priorities", "description": "Amid the chaos of her husband\u2019s presidency, the first lady raises her profile and defines her role."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Inside Melania Trump\u2019s complicated White House life: Separate schedule, different priorities", "description": "Amid the chaos of her husband\u2019s presidency, the first lady raises her profile and defines her role."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-05-21T16:39:10.990Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525536000.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
