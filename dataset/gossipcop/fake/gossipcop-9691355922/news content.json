{"url": "www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/11/katy-perry-interview-witness-album-glastonbury", "text": "In among the typical recording detritus of New York\u2019s Jungle City Studios \u2013 boxes of foam ear plugs, rolls of tape, untouched buttons on a soundboard the size of a London studio flat \u2013 sits a Febreze candle, its lime-green wax emitting a scent like sweetened detergent. It\u2019s the first thing Katy Perry notices as she suddenly appears behind me. \u201cIt\u2019s so chic,\u201d she says drolly, her immaculately constructed outfit of orange mesh top, cropped tartan trousers and Adidas sliders topped off by a shiny black pore strip stretched tight across the bridge of her nose. \u201cAt some point I\u2019m going to give myself the pleasure of peeling this off,\u201d she laughs, smoothing it down over her bulky nose ring.\n\nSuddenly the mise-en-scene makes perfect sense: surface glamour underpinned by a hint of down-to-earth realness is very much Katy Perry\u2019s MO, and has been since she emerged almost a decade ago with the global hit I Kissed a Girl. Perry is the girl-next-door-turned-megastar you want to hang out with, have a laugh with, possibly talk about blackheads with. If, on the superstar scale, Beyonc\u00e9 is almost superhuman then Perry prides herself on being, as she puts it later, \u201csuper human; like, really human\u201d.\n\nShe recognises me from a previous interview we did three years ago in Belfast, one in which she was hampered by a cold so violent I lost track of the amount of snot I saw her wipe on her sleeve. Today she apologises for being an hour late, and thanks me for pushing my flight back after our initial interview date was postponed by 24 hours. Her tardiness is understandable; she\u2019s just announced details of her fifth album, Witness, her first since 2013\u2019s Prism, a world tour of the same name, and has been busy preparing for that evening\u2019s (we meet in late May) performances on Saturday Night Live.\n\nShe\u2019s keen to make it clear nothing is off limits: \u201cI\u2019m going to give you everything and more,\u201d she beams. But before we start, she shows me her iPhone, which is already recording. \u201cWe all know that tone and context are everything, so this might be one of my last print interviews,\u201d she says, setting her phone down next to my Dictaphone. \u201cBecause. People. Do. Not. Get. It. These. Days,\u201d she adds, each word punctuated by a handclap. She settles into her chair, grey cardigan resting on crossed legs. While her persona in TV interviews and music videos is often hyperactive, goofy older sister, this afternoon she\u2019s earnest, bordering on businesslike. \u201cThis is my disclaimer: my intention is so pure these days,\u201d she states. \u201cI know nothing. All the thoughts and opinions I express are my own. Period, end of story.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Don\u2019t let them win\u2019: Perry performing at the One Love Manchester benefit concert at Old Trafford on 4 June. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/One Love Manchester\n\nLike all the best pop superstars, Katy Perry seemed to emerge fully formed \u2013 a riot of cartoonish exaggeration \u2013 when she bulldozed into the public consciousness in 2008. I Kissed a Girl \u2013 a stone-cold pop classic \u2013 expertly positioned her in the middle of a perfect storm of tabloid-baiting playfulness, knowing kitsch and just enough relatable charm to keep things family friendly (in 2015 she described her appeal as \u201csoft-serve sexiness\u201d). Alongside the more self-consciously outre Lady Gaga, who emerged the same year, and Single Ladies-era Beyonc\u00e9, Perry started to dominate the female-led pop landscape, following I Kissed a Girl with a clutch of sugar-coated hits, before enjoying a purple patch of record-breaking success with 2010\u2019s Teenage Dream. It was an album that defined the two sides of her musical personality \u2013 from the candyfloss swirl of California Gurls to the self-help sloganeering of Firework. By the summer of 2011, Perry had become the first woman in US chart history to have five No 1 singles from one album, equalling a record previously held by Michael Jackson in his 80s pomp.\n\nShe also started dominating a more modern popularity metric, becoming the most followed person on Twitter in 2016 (her follower count is steadily creeping towards 100m). In February 2015, in the middle of a gruelling world tour in support of the Prism album, which added Roar and Dark Horse to her growing pop canon, she performed at the Super Bowl halftime show with a stage set that included a gargantuan gold-plated mechanical lion and a beach scene complete with meme-ready dancing sharks. The 12-minute extravaganza garnered the highest Super Bowl ratings of all time, with 118 million people tuning in for Perry (4 million more than for the sports bit either side of it).\n\nHopefully there\u2019s a real change coming. We have to change. We have to shake some things up\n\nWith astute awareness of her position in the pop cosmos, Perry has always understood the power of reinvention, moving from vintage pin-up (One of the Boys) to kitsch vamp (Teenage Dream), to pick-yourself-up-and-carry-on warrior (the more spiritually minded Prism, released after her divorce from Russell Brand). Her current, more politicised iteration feels the boldest. Witness\u2019s first single, February\u2019s disco-pop confection Chained to the Rhythm, heralded what Perry \u2013 a long-term supporter of Hillary Clinton \u2013 referred to as the arrival of \u201cpurposeful pop\u201d, and was written in the aftermath of Donald Trump\u2019s victory. The lyric, rapped by Skip Marley, calls on people to wake up to the world\u2019s troubles: \u201cBreak down the walls to connect, inspire / Ay, up in your high place, liars / Time is ticking for the empire.\u201d During her performance of the song at that month\u2019s Brit awards, she was joined on stage by giant skeletal effigies of Donald Trump and Theresa May.\n\nThe song\u2019s intention, it seemed, was to connect the dots to her newly updated Twitter bio that read \u201cArtist. Activist. Conscious\u201d (it\u2019s recently been changed to \u201cI know nothing\u201d). So how does she feel about the election result now? \u201cListen, there\u2019s a time of mourning. I think with Hillary, it was something bigger than her, and she had to be the person to pull the sword out of the stone and wake up this movement, which is really important. What I started to realise was that it\u2019s not about one person: it\u2019s about the kingdom, it\u2019s not about the king. It\u2019s about us. We write the rules as a community, and so I\u2019m so grateful that Hillary was strong enough to withstand everything and also wake the sleeping giant. We are the sleeping giant.\u201d\n\nShe starts to pick at the pore strip, which ends up flapping at half-mast. \u201cI\u2019m a realist but I\u2019m definitely an optimist, and so hopefully there\u2019s a real change coming, there isn\u2019t just complacency coming. We have to change. We have to shake some things up.\u201d\n\nShe is keen to include those who voted for Donald Trump in her broad church. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m going to do on tour \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to meet those people. I just want to hear what they have to say, and hope they can hear what I have to say.\u201d\n\nIn April, Chained to the Rhythm was followed by Bon App\u00e9tit, an innuendo-heavy, nudge-nudge wink-wink ode to oral sex (\u201cgot me spread like a buffet\u201d) that featured Migos, the Georgia rap trio recently accused of homophobia following a Rolling Stone interview in which they expressed surprise at the support shown to recently out rapper iLoveMakonnen. That same week an Instagram livestream showed an apparently upset Perry, resulting in fans starting a WeLoveYouKaty hashtag. \u201cThey tried to make me out to be a victim,\u201d she says. \u201cI am not a victim. I never cried.\u201d On the day Bon App\u00e9tit entered the US chart at a lower-than-expected 76, Perry went on holiday. Again, in the hyper-scrutinised world of pop, fans picked up on it. \u201cI went on a vacation that I had planned weeks and weeks ago with my girlfriends. Everybody calm down. Why don\u2019t people ask me what my story is?\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s story is a unique take on the American dream. Born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson 32 years ago in Santa Barbara, California, she is the self-confessed \u201cblack sheep\u201d daughter of two born-again Christians, both Pentecostal pastors. It was a restrictive, regimented childhood dominated by censorship: secular music was banned (along with her family, she picketed concerts by both Marilyn Manson and Madonna); Lucky Charms cereal was verboten because luck was linked to the devil (devilled eggs became angel eggs), and Perry spent summers at youth groups, some of which, she said recently, were in favour of gay conversion camps. Singing became a form of escapism, both in church and alone with an acoustic guitar she was given at age 13. That same year she persuaded her parents to take her to Nashville to record a gospel album, and, two years later, aged 15, she discovered Queen, an epiphany that broadened her pop horizons. \u201cThat was my first perspective on that world, and I just loved it. I felt so free and accepted,\u201d she told Vogue last month.\n\nAt 17 she left school and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a music career. In 2001 an independently released gospel album sold roughly 200 copies, while subsequent record deals with Island and Columbia both came to nothing. \u201cPeople saw me as damaged goods,\u201d she has said of that time. By 2006, having had a pop/rock album she\u2019d been recording for years shelved, she found herself working for an independent A&R company and singing at open mic nights. A year later, however, those songs ended up with the head of Capitol Records, who promptly signed her. After swapping Hudson for her mother\u2019s maiden name, Katy Perry, the multi-platinum-selling (she\u2019s shifted around 81m singles globally), award-winning, apparently unstoppable hit machine was born.\n\nPart of Perry\u2019s early appeal was a sense of fantasy. The larger-than-life character she\u2019d created \u2013 sort of Betty Boop meets LA party girl with a heart \u2013 felt like the perfect encapsulation of every young girl\u2019s pop star dreams, with the determined, never-give-up-on-yourself backstory chiming with every TV talent show. (To bring it full circle, Perry has just signed up to be a judge on the returning American Idol.)\n\nI\u2019m not going to please everyone, and I\u2019m not trying to. If you run around pleasing everyone, you\u2019re done\n\nThe reality of Perry\u2019s construction, she says now, was more prosaic. \u201cA lot of people are living in fear from something that happened in their childhood, or some form of PTSD they picked up along the way, and I created this wonderful character called Katy Perry that I very much am, and can step into all the time, but I created that character out of protection,\u201d she says. \u201cI was scared that if you saw me, Katheryn Hudson, the girl wearing the Bior\u00e9 strip on my nose, you\u2019d be like, \u2018that\u2019s not glamorous\u2019. It was me going, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve been upset my whole childhood so I\u2019m going to show the world I am something, that I am going to do something and that I am enough\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to be Katheryn Hudson. I hated that, it was too scary for me, so I decided to be someone else.\u201d Finally, she yanks the gloopy strip clean off her nose. She looks at it and sighs. \u201cIt didn\u2019t really take enough stuff out.\u201d\n\nThe disadvantage of creating a character with such a broad appeal is that it can be difficult to remain all things to all people, especially when, as she puts it, \u201cliberating [yourself] from everything\u201d. Chained to the Rhythm, though painted with broad brushstrokes, was Perry\u2019s statement of intent, and one with implications, both personally and professionally. She\u2019s respectful of her Republican parents\u2019 political views but keen to engage them in debate. \u201cIf you can have patience and don\u2019t flip the table, then a healthy discourse is so important,\u201d she says.\n\nDid she worry about the commercial risks involved? \u201cI\u2019m not going to please everyone, and I\u2019m not trying to. If you run around pleasing everyone, you\u2019re done. If you stand for nothing then you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nHer words suddenly become more pointed. \u201cI think it\u2019s actually quite selfish: if you\u2019re all about \u2018the people\u2019 but you don\u2019t want to help \u2018the people\u2019, because you don\u2019t want to say things when things get tough, then what are you about? Protecting your brand? Making sure you don\u2019t lose zeros in your bank account?\u201d\n\nHave you lost money from speaking out? \u201cSome people said, \u2018look we can\u2019t do this thing with you any more because we\u2019ve gotten letters\u2019. Basically, corporations are like, \u2018don\u2019t have an opinion\u2019, and I\u2019m like, \u2018so if I was vocalising for the other side, you\u2019d still get letters, you know that right\u2019. What they\u2019re asking me to do is not to speak at all. So, God bless you on your journey.\u201d She unleashes a huge grin.\n\nGiven purposeful pop\u2019s statement of intent, there was a palpable sense of disappointment from some of Perry\u2019s fanbase in April when Bon App\u00e9tit returned to Carry On-style kitsch with its awkward buffet-based sexual metaphors. \u201c[Bon App\u00e9tit] is full-on sexual liberation!\u201d Perry insists, visibly annoyed. \u201cLiberation doesn\u2019t just come in the form of talking about politics. Some people will get turned on by it \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it happen.\u201d\n\nObviously me and her [Taylor Swift] have our stuff, and I have offered it up to her to work out\n\nWe talk about Migos, and how some of her gay fanbase were disappointed at their inclusion. \u201cFirst and foremost, I didn\u2019t know about [the Rolling Stone interview] when I met them. I didn\u2019t do a background check. Some people don\u2019t say the things you want them to say, because they don\u2019t know how to say them,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere\u2019s also a double standard \u2013 no one said anything about Frank Ocean, who worked with them on a track, or Liam Payne, who uses [Migos\u2019s] Quavo [on his new single]. Nobody\u2019s talking about that.\u201d\n\nThe conversation quickly escalates into a broader monologue about the dangers of online tribe wars. \u201cThe problem is that these fan groups think that everybody is in competition, and everybody needs to stop with that shit,\u201d she says. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to pit everyone against each other, especially with all this bullshit about women hating women. I am so disgusted by it and done with it. You can ask me that question, I can\u2019t speak for [Migos], but anything I do \u2013 let me reiterate \u2013 my intentions are pure. I don\u2019t know everything, and I\u2019m going to fumble, but don\u2019t fucking double standard me.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Perry with former husband Russell Brand at an event in Beverly Hills, 2010. Photograph: John Shearer/WireImage\n\nEven when angry, Perry\u2019s words are often delivered with a measured, Zen-like calm, something she ascribes partly to a new maturity (\u201cI left my 20s, I\u2019ve embraced and surrendered to my 30s, and I love it. I wouldn\u2019t go back at all\u201d) and partly to her passion for transcendental meditation. \u201cTM changed my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI studied it five years ago in India during my wedding [to Brand], and it was an incredible thing that I received from that time. Some people get very nervous about the spiritual connotations of things, but TM is very medical and scientific. This [she prods at her mobile] is the new form of sugar. It\u2019s the new dopamine, the new stimulant, and everybody has 20 minutes once a day to turn it off and meditate. When I do it, I can feel the cobwebs lifting and can feel this halo. I think that TM is a beautiful way to find real stillness. You should do it.\u201d\n\nIts calming influence is on display when talk turns to Taylor Swift and their fractured relationship, said to be the subject of Swift\u2019s song Bad Blood, although neither star is on record as to exactly how the feud began. Swish Swish, Witness\u2019 third single, has reopened old wounds. \u201cYou\u2019re calculated, I got your number,\u201d sings Perry over 90s-inspired house, before adding: \u201cDon\u2019t you come for me, no, not today.\u201d Does that song feel like exorcising some demons from your past, I ask. \u201cNo, I think the trolls come hard at me all the time,\u201d she says. So it\u2019s not about Taylor Swift? \u201cIt\u2019s a message to all of the people who have tried to tear me down. All the haters, the trolls, the negativity. It\u2019s liberation from all of the negativity. It could be liberation from\u201d \u2013 she pauses and lowers her voice to a whisper \u2013 \u201cthe biggest troll that\u2019s in office right now. Why is it one thing?\u201d Before I can answer, she adds: \u201cObviously me and her have our stuff, and I have offered it up to her to work out. In person. Over the phone. The whole bit. When she\u2019s ready to do that, then I\u2019m ready to do it. I\u2019m ready to just let that all go. We need to have a conversation about it, totally, and I love her, I really do. But this is something that\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nYou can see her point. It feels like a contradiction to, on the one hand, dismiss the constant pitting of women against each other (\u201cit\u2019s the spawn of Satan\u201d, she says), and then on the other to keep stoking the fires of an ongoing feud. Perry surrounds herself with a lot of women \u2013 does she prefer female energy right now? \u201cI love the female energy. Females in general are so beautiful and powerful. They\u2019re the ones that have enough power to bring life into this world. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re better, because everyone plays their role, and a good man is so beautiful. What I\u2019m saying is that women should really know their power and that\u2019s what power is about. It\u2019s about \u2018when did you decide to give away your power?\u2019\u201d\n\nWe chat about Perry\u2019s imminent Glastonbury debut; she\u2019s excited about bringing \u201cthe bells and whistles and the authenticity in between\u201d to Worthy Farm. \u201cI\u2019ve only been to the luxury of Coachella,\u201d she laughs, referring to the California desert-based festival, which this year hosted an afternoon brunch to help Perry launch her new shoe range. Given the curious decision to have her warming up on the Pyramid stage for beardy alt-rockers the National and default festival fodder Foo Fighters, would she like to one day come back and headline? \u201cSure, if they\u2019ll have me.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m happy with where I\u2019m at. The thing is, don\u2019t cry for me. I\u2019m all right. I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nAt one point, as the interview starts to unspool and our time together comes to an end, we get into a surreal discussion about ice-cream flavours, and an off-the-cuff comment about a song being \u201ctoo vanilla\u201d leads to raised voices and dodgy accents.\n\n\u201cDo you know what real, homemade Italian vanilla tastes like, with vanilla bean? It\u2019s the most luxurious taste in the world.\u201d\n\nI just see vanilla as a bit basic, I confess.\n\n\u201cPeople like vanilla!\u201d she screams in mock anger, her springy office chair bouncing up and down. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s one of the top three Neapolitan flavours, motherfucker! It\u2019s strawberry, chocolate and vanilla!\u201d\n\nThe word vanilla starts to roll around her mouth with a slight New York-Italian twang. \u201cWho the fuck said vanilla is the barometer for basic? People like vanilla!\u201d\n\nThe conversation ricochets back to Witness. \u201cThere are 15 flavours on the record!\u201d she says. \u201cGet your Rocky Road, get your vanilla, get your chocolate, get your strawberry, get your mint and chip \u2013 they\u2019re all there.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Gloriously anarchic\u2019: Katy Perry poses with fans as she leaves her intimate gig at the the Water Rats in King\u2019s Cross last month. Photograph: Ricky Vigil/GC Images\n\nFive days later, and those various flavours are being road-tested in the unlikeliest of environments. Nine years after she made her UK live debut at the Water Rats, a dingy, shoebox pub venue in London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, Perry\u2019s back there, performing at the launch of the new Capital Breakfast show. It\u2019s a gloriously anarchic, hit-stuffed hour that starts with Perry trying to connect to the internet so she can livestream the show to the millions who couldn\u2019t make it. \u201cYou know me, always doing the most, always trying to do it all,\u201d she laughs. At one point she gives her phone to a guy in the front row so he can film it, before kissing a female fan full on the lips during I Kissed a Girl. \u201cI love this because there\u2019s no format for tonight,\u201d she beams. \u201cIt could be anything!\u201d\n\nLater, before a stripped-back version of 2012\u2019s plaintive Part of Me, she refers to the Manchester terrorist attack, and the unifying power of music (she will go on to play at the One Love fundraiser alongside Ariana Grande, Liam Gallagher and Justin Bieber, among others). \u201cWhatever you can do to help, you should \u2013 and if you can\u2019t do anything, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she says through tears. \u201cBut what you should do is not let them win.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful moment, and one that seems to amplify the gig\u2019s back-to-basics catharsis for Perry. \u201cWhen I come to the UK, I\u2019m going to do a ton of these types of shows,\u201d she says later, eyebrow slightly raised as she adds the inevitable, \u201cI want to get intimate with you.\u201d\n\nBefore the closing self-empowerment treaty of Roar, the super-fans pressed at the front launch into an impromptu rendition of Fingerprints from 2008\u2019s One of the Boys, a rallying cry to overcome people\u2019s expectations. By the time the assembled chorus gets to \u201cI\u2019m leaving you my legacy, I got to make my mark,\u201d Perry joins in, screaming the lyrics she wrote all those years ago when she was still unknown. \u201cI got to run it hard,\u201d she sings, a huge grin smeared across her face, \u201cI want you to remember me.\u201d\n\nKaty Perry\u2019s Witness is out now (on Capitol). She plays Glastonbury\u2019s Pyramid stage on 24 June, returning to the UK on her world tour in June 2018", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab96eda37f262ed0ae945b808cda6f4ab0e93a5/0_140_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=75050d6c1e500075cf810163fa0d52de", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Katy+Perry%2CPop+and+rock%2CMusic%2CCulture", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da6700f71063220241fc3db86f3c76464804d532/0_51_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55dd14f150c9c2024559b1f99c54442e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e65f64b554dda5446e71277b1aade68ff9a1e30/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=2586d51738ce5e3849ed973dcb9f3232", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dedc4a73e80fbf9626de0e5570b11a94f7f11a6/25_0_773_464/master/773.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1338c4605d398f6647e6b380ff40510b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb37188e379d8c358732e4a9e7aa72ac95c42cad/0_110_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a3ea064b07cde3b6d293a8888cdcabb6", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c1ab9ea0a0e3cccaa708558918cdb300c126d2/0_635_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf71d17f58783d41b23c8f232791ef70", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c1ab9ea0a0e3cccaa708558918cdb300c126d2/0_635_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=093f64c5ce46266baf5cdde7fc7ded5d", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "http://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad5f19ab8bc523344a9a9e856672bb835582f8c/0_0_2019_1211/master/2019.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6cbb0411b7fa51c4b2862e333e1e4f2b", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6426b4ac9ba9a6ab461e1fd32b23e998f4b7c05d/0_0_2115_3000/master/2115.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=8e5930e505dbe0ac3993ef9e401d62a8"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5c1ab9ea0a0e3cccaa708558918cdb300c126d2/0_635_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf71d17f58783d41b23c8f232791ef70", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Cragg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/11/katy-perry-interview-witness-album-glastonbury", "title": "\u2018I created this character called Katy Perry.
