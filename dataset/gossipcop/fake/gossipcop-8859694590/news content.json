and \"The Voice\" coach couldn't be happier.\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, published on Wednesday, the country star dished about his decision to open a second Ole Red location after a succesful launch in Shelton\u2019s hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last September.\n\n\"'Ol\u2019 Red\u2018 was handed to me within the first week that I moved to Nashville,\u201d recalled Shelton of recording his breakout 2001 song, which helped his career take off.\n\n\u201cTwenty-four years later, it seems too good to be true how it\u2019s all come back around,\" admitted Shelton, 42, who enlisted the help of girlfriend, Gwen Stefani, this time.\n\n\"We went upstairs to the rooftop and Gwen\u2019s heel goes through the roof,\" Shelton said of the pair's visit to the venue, a vacant bank building.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m trying to get her leg back out and free and I\u2019m like, \u2018What the f--k is that?'\u201d shares Shelton.\n\nFast-forward, the restaurant is now filled with guests and performers, including a handful of the country singer's famous friends.\n\n\"This is a big deal for me,\u201d notes Shelton. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming.\u201d\n\nBut with Stefani and her sons rooting for him, Shelton, who hopes to eventually have Ole Red locations across the country, says life is great.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t change one thing about my life right now,\" he shares.",
