Getty images\n\nAccording to an outrageous report in US tabloid Star today, Kim is allegedly the subject of rumours that she's had ribs surgically removed in order to achieve an hourglass figure.\n\n'There's no end to Kim's quest for perfection, but even her family is telling her this is madness,' an insider allegedly told Star of family reaction to the ridiculous procedure.\n\n'Kim clearly enjoys the results - the procedure has given her the whittled middle she has always wanted - and considers it well worth the time and money spent.'\n\nRib removal - sometimes whispered about in celeb circles but never yet proven to actually occur - is seen by mainstream medicine as a dangerous and unethical procedure, as in theory it could potentially result in deadly injuries to internal organs in the case of an accident.\n\n'No reputable doctor would remove body parts that have a critical purpose,' says plastic surgeon Dr Matthew Shulman. 'Ribs are there to protect your organs.'\n\nKim has yet to comment on Star's outlandish allegations, but has in the past attributed her enviable figure to healthy eating and exercise.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/5947/161012-kim-k.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/5947/161012-kim-k.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Smails"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/kim-kardashian-has-rib-removed", "title": "Kim Kardashian 'has rib removed' to look thinner", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "According to a US report today, Kim Kardashian is the subject of rumours that she's had ribs surgically removed in order to achieve an hourglass figure.", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Kim Kardashian west, Kim Kardashian plastic surgery, Kim Kardashian rib removed, celebrity gossip, Celeb gossip, Entertainment news, News and gossip", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/kim-kardashian-has-rib-removed", "title": "Kim Kardashian 'has rib removed' to look thinner", "description": "According to a US report today, Kim Kardashian is the subject of rumours that she's had ribs surgically removed in order to achieve an hourglass figure.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/5947/161012-kim-k.jpg", "width": 823, "height": 444}}, "twitter": {"title": "Kim Kardashian 'has rib removed' to look thinner", "description": "According to a US report today, Kim Kardashian is the subject of rumours that she's had ribs surgically removed in order to achieve an hourglass figure.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/5947/161012-kim-k.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/kim-kardashian-has-rib-removed"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515022312.253, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
