{"url": "mixgulfcoast.iheart.com/content/2017-01-13-flo-rida-not-performing-at-donald-trump-inauguration-despite-report/", "text": "Flo Rida, however, is the same rapper that pulled out of performing at the 2015 Miss USA pageant after Trump made comments about Mexicans being \u201crapists.\u201d The site notes this in its piece, but then alleges that the rapper has accepted the supposed $1 million offer because he has tax problems.\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a rep for Flo Rida, who exclusively assures us the rapper simply won\u2019t be performing at Trump\u2019s inauguration, and this is a non-story. As of now, the only artists confirmed to be performing at the event later this month are \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d contestant Jackie Evancho, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and the Rockettes. Among the many musicians who have declined the offer to perform at the inauguration include Elton John, The Beach Boys, Charlotte Church, Andrea Bocelli, and David Foster.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images", "images": ["https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e0e51e11127fe24d87c59e2?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Shuster"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-01-13-flo-rida-not-performing-at-donald-trump-inauguration-despite-report/", "title": "Flo Rida Not Performing At Donald Trump Inauguration, Despite Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Rapper has not accepted the reported $1 million offer", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "mix, mix999, mix 999, variety, Flo Rida (58711), mix, mix999, mix 999, variety, Flo Rida (58711)", "og": {"title": "Flo Rida Not Performing At Donald Trump Inauguration, Despite Report | Mix 99.9", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://mixgulfcoast.iheart.com/content/2017-01-13-flo-rida-not-performing-at-donald-trump-inauguration-despite-report/", "description": "Rapper has not accepted the reported $1 million offer", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "Mix 99.9"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://mixgulfcoast.iheart.com/content/2017-01-13-flo-rida-not-performing-at-donald-trump-inauguration-despite-report/", "site": "@MixGulfCoast", "creator": "@MixGulfCoast", "title": "Flo Rida Not Performing At Donald Trump Inauguration, Despite Report | Mix 99.9", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "Rapper has not accepted the reported $1 million offer", "domain": "mixgulfcoast.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Flo Rida Not Performing At Donald Trump Inauguration, Despite Report | Mix 99.9", "parsely-link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-01-13-flo-rida-not-performing-at-donald-trump-inauguration-despite-report/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "mix, mix999, mix 999, variety, Flo Rida (58711), mix, mix999, mix 999, variety, Flo Rida (58711)", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5878e1e542f4678d8789fe76?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "Mix 99.9", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-01-13T14:15:00Z", "parsely-author": "Andrew Shuster", "parsely-section": "entertainment-news-national-gossip-celeb-etc", "fb": {"app_id": 165719898335}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484236800.0, "source": "http://mixgulfcoast.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
