The cover star opened up about her first marriage to Tom Cruise and what it\u2019s like celebrating a decade of marital bliss with her second husband, country singer Keith Urban.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re older, you\u2019ve been through things, you\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d Kidman said, adding that the first three months of marriage to the singer were tough. \u201cSo you come into it [a second marriage], still giddy, but wanting it to last. We always consider the \u2018us.\u2019 We say, \u2018Is this going to be good for us?\u2019 It\u2019s the simplest phrase, but it works.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress also opened up about her nearly 11-year marriage to \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d co-star Tom Cruise, saying that she was \u201cso young\u201d when the two wed.\n\n\u201cI look back now and I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019 You look at Taylor Swift, I mean how old is she? She\u2019s 26,\u201d Kidman said. \u201cI had two kids by the time I was 27 and I\u2019d been married for four years. But that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d\n\nMANAGEMENT ARISTS SYNDICATION Red So gorgeous.\n\nCruise and Kidman adopted two children, Isabella and Connor, when they were together. She and Urban also have two kids together, daughters Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret. Kidman made it clear in her interview with Red that being a mother is extremely important to her \u2015 and that she loves her kids with all her heart.\n\n\u201cMotherhood is about the journey,\u201d the actress said. \u201cThere are going to be incredible peaks and valleys, whether you are an adopting mother or a birth mother. What a child needs is love,\u201d Kidman said.\n\nThe full interview appears in the November issue of Red, available on U.K. newsstands Oct. 4.
