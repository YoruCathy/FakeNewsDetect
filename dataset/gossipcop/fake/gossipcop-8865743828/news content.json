Well, her exact words were, \u201cAs far as I know I'm only doing one show in 2017, and as far as I know, this is that show,\u201d spoken during a pre-Super Bowl concert in February. So that\u2019s maybe less of a vow and more of a calendar update. Regardless. In October 2015 she ventured this thought: \"I think I should take some time off. I think people might need a break from me.\u201d And then, off-the-record, she told Kanye West in the infamous call tapes, \u201cI\u2019m like this close to overexposure.\u201d\n\nLike many celebrities before her, Taylor recognized that it was possible to be too famous. But unlike many of them, she took action to fix it, and then actually kept her word.\n\nFourth of July came and went without her annual Rhode Island celebration, known colloquially as Taymerica. The only photos of the star released publicly since the February concert have been taken with new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, and they\u2019re grainy, as if taken with an incredibly long lens. (Unlike, say, the remarkably sharp paparazzi photos that first introduced Taylor and Tom Hiddleston to the world.) There\u2019s the one on a Nashville balcony and the one supposedly boarding her jet in the U.K. The only social media we\u2019ve seen from her is in service of her friends\u2019 music releases\u2014one Instagram for each, Selena Gomez, the sisters Haim, and Lorde, plus a small video shout-out to Russell Westbrook, this past N.B.A. season\u2019s M.V.P., and a word of support tweeted after the Manchester bombing.\n\nSo enamored were we with the idea that Swift has been acing the laying low directive that when a Splash News paparazzi claimed the singer was carried out of her Tribeca apartment in a big box, it didn\u2019t feel completely beyond the realm of possibility (the photo service since retracted the claim). And now, for further proof that Taylor Swift is still committed to giving the world a breather from Taylor Swift, compare what going to the gym in 2016 looks like to what going to the gym in 2017 looks like:\n\nFrom left, by Raymond Hall/GC Images, by NCP/Star Max/GC Images, by Josiah Kamau/BuzzFoto, from Backgrid.\n\nSwift is known for her creative paparazzi-avoidance tactics, like walking backward so they can\u2019t train their lens on her face. But all these hoodies and grainy photos just go to show that if the most famous people in the world don\u2019t wish to be seen, they won\u2019t be seen. Swift is no exception, and it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll see her until she ready for us to see her\u2014with an album in tow.", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978c23b7c67a060584ba975/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-taylor-swift-in-hiding.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/595644f2bd2a716067c82812/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-fourth-of-july.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54284d9d06f2391147574536/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58977ce1b9ae9c605ed18b33/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-only%252520concert-2017.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/594821a2e9423741a1f1780e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Lorde-Taylor-Swift.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978c23b7c67a060584ba975/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/t-taylor-swift-in-hiding.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54284daf06f23911475745d4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978c23b90225743bcad67d7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-in-hiding.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54284daf72bd5a4566c5a922/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978c23b7c67a060584ba975/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-taylor-swift-in-hiding.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kenzie Bryant", "Kenzie Bryan", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/07/taylor-swift-gym-paparazzi-pictures-laying-low-2017", "title": "Taylor Swift Is Really Committed to This Laying Low Thing, Huh?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kenzie Bryant", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The singer was photographed with her boyfriend Joe Alwyn\u2014allegedly.
