over the weekend.\n\nPhotographs of the pair strolling out of a restaurant late Sunday night sparked speculation, but a rep for the \u201cAvengers\u201d actress tells us that there\u2019s no romance happening.\n\n\u201cSimply put, they are friends as well as neighbors [in the Hamptons],\u201d says ScarJo\u2019s rep.\n\nFlay, who in 2015 had a publicly contentious split from his wife of 10 years, Stephanie March, was last linked to \u201cMasters of Sex\u201d actress Hel\u00e9ne Yorke.\n\nJohansson, who filed for divorce from French journalist Romain Dauriac in March, has been seeing \u201cSaturday Night Live: Weekend Update\u201d star Colin Jost since May, which was exclusively revealed by Page Six.\n\nThe cute couple was together on Sept. 30, when Johansson was spotted dropping Jost off at a star-studded \u201cSNL\u201d after-party at Tao Uptown that included guests like Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone and Dakota Johnson.\n\nThis article originally appeared in
