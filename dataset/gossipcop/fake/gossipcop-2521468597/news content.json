(It will also be live-streamed online for the first time.)\n\nThe annual event, which honors performances in both television and film, is considered one of Hollywood\u2019s most \u201cfun\u201d awards shows due to how early the awards fall in the season, the presence of alcohol (resulting in more celebrities letting loose), and general unpredictability about the winners. In other words, they\u2019re usually a pretty good time, as far as three-hour awards shows go.\n\nBut this year\u2019s event might take on a more somber tone, due to the recent wave of revelations regarding sexual harassment in the entertainment industry, and the rise of the #MeToo movement.\n\nMany actors and actresses have promised to wear black to raise awareness of the movement and protest sexual harassment in Hollywood. And the marketing for the ceremony has implied that it will offer a platform for speaking out; one promo even features Meyers declaring, \u201cHollywood, we\u2019ve got a lot to talk about.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the awards themselves, the film frontrunner appears to be The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro\u2019s grown-up fairy tale about a mute woman and a fish-man, which leads the nominations with seven. Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Post and Martin McDonagh\u2019s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri follow, with six nominations each.\n\nIn the TV categories, HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies leads the pack with six nods. Feud: Bette and Joan has four, while The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, This Is Us, and Fargo each have three nominations.\n\nYou\u2019ll find the full list of nominees below.
