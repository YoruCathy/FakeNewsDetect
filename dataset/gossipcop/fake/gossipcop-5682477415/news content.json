A week alone would\u2019ve been too strained,\u201d one insider says.\n\n\"Had they been alone, the insider suspects, they would\u2019ve been dealing with some uncomfortable conversations. They felt it would be easier and more relaxed to have some friends come along.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that Aniston and Theroux have basically come to terms with the fact that their marriage is coming to an end, but they're still trying to hide the truth from members of their inner circle.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the marriage has been crumbling,\u201d the insider adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not make-or-break time for them and their marriage.\u201d\n\nOf course, all of this couldn't come at a worse time, as Aniston has reportedly fallen back under Pitt's spell in recent months.\n\n\u201cBrad and Jen have bonded like never before over the past year,\u201d a friend of theirs tells In Touch.\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019ve been helping each other through their respective troubles.\u201d\n\nLook, we suppose there's a possibility this is really happening, but it all sounds a little too close to what magazines like In Touch and Life & Style would want to happen for it to be entirely believable.\n\nThe only thing this story is missing is Brad Ross-ing out on Jen and justifying banging Jolie with \"We were on a break!\"", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--Vu_LF2UU--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1374783633/justin-and-jen.png"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--Vu_LF2UU--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1374783633/justin-and-jen.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-headed-for-divorce-because-o/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux: Headed For Divorce Because of Brad Pitt?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-headed-for-divorce-because-o/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux: Headed For Divorce Because of Brad Pitt?!", "description": "Sources say Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are ready to call things off.
