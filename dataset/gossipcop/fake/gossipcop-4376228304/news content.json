It started out with Elon Musk and Grimes at the Met Gala, and we blame Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson.\n\nThe strange pairing of a Jonas brother with Meghan Markle\u2018s pal Priyanka Chopra is up there, and let\u2019s not forget Katherine Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt\u2018s totally not staged date. Even Kendall Jenner is apparently house hunting for a bigger Beverly Hills abode with her maybe-boyfriend Ben Simmons, shortly after that normal make out with Bella and Gigi Hadid\u2018s brother, Anwar.\n\nSo it\u2019s fitting that last year\u2019s odd pairing also known as the Kardashian-adjacent self-proclaimed lord Scott Disick and Lionel Richie\u2019s 19-year-old daughter Sofia are getting in on the action. The two are taking their relationship to the next level and moving in together, reports Us.\n\nDisick and Richie started hanging out in Cannes last year, right around the time the firestorm that was Disick dating Bella Thorne imploded. It became #official by September, when Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s 35-year-old ex took a break from exclusively posting snaps of fancy cars and interior design and shared a few photos of his new girlfriend on his Instagram Stories.\n\nThe months since have been filled with many a private jet and yacht, and even a vacation where Richie joined Disick and his three children with Kourtney. That is, until it seemed like it all (finally) went up in flames shortly after Memorial Day Weekend. Disick was attending Kanye West\u2018s album release party in Wyoming, and in a less than shocking turn of events, he was photographed with another woman there.\n\nA flurry of rumors came out about Disick and Richie\u2019s subsequent split\u2014that the teen queen was finished with the guy who once shoved money down a waiter\u2019s throat. Good riddance! But lo and behold: mere days later, the two reunited. As the Kardashian chronicle that is E! News reported, Disick \u201csaid he would make it up to her and show her how much he and cares for her.\u201d\n\nSure, some might take that as a warning sign, but who are we mere mortals to judge the actions of this healthy relationship? Instead, Richie will be unpacking her things at Disick\u2019s five-bedroom, $3.24 million Hidden Hills abode for good. Well, for now.\n\nDisick bought the 4,934-square-foot pad in April; it has formal dining and living rooms, a game room and hardwood floors throughout. The master suite has a stone fireplace and a very on-brand built-in wine fridge.\n\nThe 1.32-acre property is nice and all, with a pool, spa, fountains and a waterfall, but honestly Lionel Richie\u2019s 17,000-square-foot palace in Beverly Hills still seems preferable. To each her own, we suppose.\n\nOnce Richie is settled in, she\u2019ll probably meet the neighbors. It is, after all, Calabasas, where Kimye and the rest of the fam resides. Kourtney\u2019s home is right nearby, but she\u2019s currently living her best life on the Italian coast\u2014she\u2019s relaxing on a yacht with her 25-year-old boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, and her and Disick\u2019s three children.", "images": ["https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/gettyimages-887308502-e1530825905750.jpg?quality=80&w=970&strip", "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/gettyimages-887308502-e1530825905750.jpg?quality=80&strip", "https://observer-media.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/gettyimages-887308502-e1530825905750.jpg?quality=80&w=635", "https://observer.com/wp-content/themes/newyorkobserver-2014/images/observer-logo-2015.png", "https://observer-media.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/jedsmith-11.jpg?quality=80&w=635"], "top_img": "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/gettyimages-887308502-e1530825905750.jpg?quality=80&strip", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Morgan Halberg", "Morgan Is A Lifestyle Writer Who Covers Travel", "Design", "Real Estate", "Pop Culture.
