Another intriguing Kardashian storm brewing has to do with the reasons that the reality TV family is estranged from one-time parent Caitlyn Jenner Related Articles Caitlyn Jenner: Robert Kardashian defended O.J. Simpson because he was jealous of me\n\nKardashians call Caitlyn Jenner \u2018transgender traitor\u2019 for sticking with Trump after military ban\n\nCaitlyn Jenner to Trump during SF visit: Don\u2019t mess with my LGBT community\n\nAnd the reasons have nothing to do with Caitlyn coming out as a transgender woman in 2015.\n\nKim Kardashian, along with her sisters Kourtney and Khloe, are fed up with \u201cshady\u201d claims Caitlyn made in her memoir about their father Robert Kardashian and his friendship with O.J. Simpson, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nAs Kim explains in the upcoming premiere of Season 14 of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d she\u2019s upset that Caitlyn wrote that their attorney father knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of double murder but defended him anyway to get back at their mother Kris Jenner.\n\nIn her memoir \u201cSecrets of My Life,\u201d Caitlyn said Robert was jealous that Kris had moved on so quickly after their divorce by marrying the Olympic gold medalist then known as Bruce Jenner.\n\nAccording to Caitlyn\u2019s book, Robert knew it would upset Kris for him to join the defense team for Simpson in his trial on charges of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. That\u2019s because Kris had been close friends with Nicole and knew that O.J. had been violent towards her.\n\nIn a clip for Sunday night\u2019s \u201cKUWTK,\u201d Kim reads to Kourtney and Khloe excerpts from Caitlyn\u2019s memoir.

Simpson was guilty, but joined the defense team to get back at his remarried ex,'\u201d Kim Kardashian reads. \u201c\u2018Robert told Caitlyn in secret after the O.J. murder trial that he believed his friend was guilty.'\u201d\n\nKhloe cuts in: \u201cThat\u2019s not true! Like, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, to sell a book, you\u2019re gonna make something up?\u201d Kourtney says.\n\n\u201cDad so believed in him,\u201d Kim says. \u201cIt is so shady that Caitlyn came over and gave me the book, and then on the phone she said, \u2018Well, the final version has a few more things in it, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing about you.\u2019 So, she lied to me, \u2018cause that is about me, if it\u2019s about our dad.\u201d\n\nKardashian also admits in a confessional interview that she and the newly self-styled transgender activist have a \u201cstrained\u201d relationship. As Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn was the patriarch of the Kardashian reality TV show. Caitlyn\u2019s coming out was featured on the show in a way that was praised as being respectful and informative on transgender issues.\n\n\u201cI have always had Caitlyn\u2019s back,\u201d Kardashian says to her sisters in the clip. \u201cbut she is a liar. She is not a good person.\u201d\n\nNicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman were found stabbed to death outside Nicole\u2019s condominium in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles on June 12, 1994.\n\nSimpson, the San Francisco-reared Heisman Trophy winner, former NFL star and celebrity pitchman, immediately became a person of their interest in their murders. On June 17, after the infamous low-speed pursuit of his white Ford Bronco SUV, he was arrested and charged with his killings. But he was acquitted in 1995.\n\nRobert was an original member of Simpson\u2019s \u201cdream team\u201d of high-priced, high-profile attorneys. Throughout Simpson\u2019s arrest and trial, Robert remained a steady and loyal presence.\n\nBut Caitlyn believes a jealous love triangle motivated Robert\u2019s interest in helping his friend.\n\nRobert and Kris were married in 1978 and had four children together, future realty TV stars Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Robert Jr. They divorced in 1991 and Kris immediately turned around and married Jenner, then a handsome, successful male athlete.\n\nIn her memoir Caitlyn wrote about Robert\u2019s sticking by Simpson: \u201cI wonder if it was (Robert\u2019s) way of saying to her what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big (expletive) you.\u201d Reading this on your phone?

Robert, who died of cancer in 2003, confessed his knowledge of O.J.\u2019s guilt during a car ride the two shared, Caitlyn claims. This would have been after O.J. was found liable for the deaths of Nicole and Ron Goldman in a 1998 civil trial.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial,\u201d Robert said, according to Caitlyn.\n\n\u201cThe implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty,\u201d Caitlyn wrote.\n\nKris and Caitlyn divorced in 2015 after Caitlyn went public with news she\u2019s transgender. Meanwhile, Simpson will be leaving a Nevada prison on parole next month after serving time for an unrelated robbery in Las Vegas.\n\nCaitlyn has acknowledged in interviews that she has a strained relationship with her ex-wife Kris Jenner and former Kardashian stepdaughters, though she maintains a connection with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, her daughters with Kris.\n\n\u201cThe relationship on the Kardashian side has been strained recently,\u201d she admitted in an interview in August.\n\n\u201cTo be honest with you, I don\u2019t really talk to them. I haven\u2019t talked to them in months and months and months.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming episode of \u201cKUWTK\u201d won\u2019t be the first time Kim has spoken out against Caitlyn in recent weeks.
