Get EXCLUSIVE details.\n\nJames Franco, 39, is so surprised that Scarlett Johansson, 33, decided to call him out in her powerful speech at the 2018 Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles on Jan. 20 that he\u2019s not sure if or when he will respond. \u201cJames was pretty stunned that Scarlett called him out\u2014albeit not by name, but pretty obviously,\u201d a source close to James EXCLUSIVELY revealed to HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to respond though because he feels that by doing so he just adds fuel to the fire. James is stuck between a rock and a hard place\u2014if he responds then it\u2019s like he\u2019s disparaging those women who are speaking out, and if he doesn\u2019t then some may think he assumes a level of guilt.\u201d Although five women have come forward to accuse the actor of alleged sexual misconduct since Ally Sheedy cryptically tweeted about him during the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, he has denied the accusations. Check out some of the best pics from the 2018 Women\u2019s March here!\n\nDespite the claims, James has been supporting the Time\u2019s Up movement and doesn\u2019t want to be stereotyped from the recent headlines about him. \u201cJames was horrified that he was branded as some kind of sexual aggressor\u2014as far as he\u2019s concerned that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d the source continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a big supporter of the movement, and he\u2019s really happy that women are finally being given a voice\u2014if he has to take a hit, for something he swears he hasn\u2019t done, then so be it. James knows what\u2019s in his heart, and he knows that he\u2019s a good person.\u201d\n\nWith James claiming to have his own story about his past, there\u2019s been high anticipation about where the accusations toward him will lead. Only time will tell with this situation but one thing remains in tact: women in the entertainment industry and beyond are fighting back hard to stand up for what they believe in! In addition to Scarlett, high profile actresses such as Natalie Portman, 36, Eva Longoria, 42, and Alyssa Milano, 45, spoke out about their own personal stories at the Women\u2019s March in LA and Atlanta.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did you think of Scarlett\u2019s speech about James?
