Please don't sue us!\n\nAnyway, sources say that in the years after her split from Cruise, Katie pretty much holed up and devoted herself thoroughly to being a mom.\n\nThese days, she's loosening up a bit, and her loved ones credit Foxx with teaching her how to relax and have fun.\n\n\u201cShe was a homebody,\u201d says one insider.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see her out and having fun, and I bet Jamie has played a big part in that.\u201d\n\nHopefully, the knowledge that everyone will now be scrutinizing her midsection in search of a baby bump won't stop Katie from continuing to go out and enjoy herself.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--JjhPEgXR--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1505500765/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-split.png"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--JjhPEgXR--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1505500765/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-split.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/katie-holmes-pregnant-with-jamie-foxxs-baby/", "title": "Katie Holmes: PREGNANT With Jamie Foxx's Baby?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/katie-holmes-pregnant-with-jamie-foxxs-baby/", "title": "Katie Holmes: PREGNANT With Jamie Foxx's Baby?!", "description": "Katie Holmes is reportedly pregnant!
