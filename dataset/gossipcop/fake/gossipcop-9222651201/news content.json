On the first two nights of their 2016 tour, they covered songs by the late David Bowie and Glenn Frey.\n\nIt struck us that, since he's been doing this since the early '70s, Springsteen has often been on the road when a friend or influence has passed. We poured over set lists from previous tours and found several examples where Springsteen has referenced another musician's death from the stage, either at the beginning of the concert or the at the start of the encore. In addition to the three mentioned above, we discovered that Springsteen has performed post-mortem covers of two giants of 20th century American music -- country icon Johnny Cash and folk legend Pete Seeger -- as well songs by Joe Strummer, George Harrison, Brill Building songwriter Ellie Greenwich, Warren Zevon and, in the earliest clip we could find, John Lennon.\n\nBut the most poignant tributes came when two founding members of the E Street Band -- keyboardist Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons -- died. In both cases, Springsteen dedicated entire tours as an opportunity to allow himself, his band and the audience to come together and mourn the loss of friends and bandmates.\n\nAs one of the most bootlegged artists in rock history, Springsteen's acts of respect have made their way to YouTube. We've gathered them here, so take a look below at how he has musically eulogized some of those he loved and admired.", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2016/04/SpringsteenTribute.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2018/12/UCR-2018D.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2016/04/SpringsteenTribute.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Lifton"], "canonical_link": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-springsteen-tribute-covers/", "title": "The Video History of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Tributes to Departed Friends and Influences", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "ultimateclassicrock", "description": "We've assembled a list of times when Bruce Springsteen covered the work of an artist who had recently died.", "keywords": "bruce springsteen tribute covers", "fb": {"app_id": 226845640664064, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 107710719302307}, "og": {"title": "The Video History of Bruce Springsteen's Tributes to Departed Friends and Influences", "description": "We've assembled a list of times when Bruce Springsteen covered the work of an artist who had recently died.", "url": "https://ultimateclassicrock.com/bruce-springsteen-tribute-covers/", "site_name": "Ultimate Classic Rock", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2016/04/SpringsteenTribute.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UltClassicRock"}, "sailthru.description": "We've assembled a list of times when Bruce Springsteen covered the work of an artist who had recently died.", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-26 13:38:25", "sailthru.title": "The Video History of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Tributes to Departed Friends and Influences", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-ultimateclassicrock, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, bruce-springsteen, original-features", "sailthru.author": "daveliftongmail-com", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2016/04/SpringsteenTribute.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2016/04/SpringsteenTribute.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "mHzGtBvgdEAFQoCsEn2YyUBU3ZdbNEUiiBX-zfiLLA0", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461649105.0, "source": "http://ultimateclassicrock.com", "summary": ""}
