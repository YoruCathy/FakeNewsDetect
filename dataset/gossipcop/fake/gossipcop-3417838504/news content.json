Lindsay and I have plans. I already bought the rings and everything.\n\nAnyway, the most interesting part of all this is the fact that Ben and Lindsay are reportedly expecting a child together.\n\n\u201cPeople suspect the sense of urgency is because Lindsay\u2019s pregnant,\u201d the informant claims.\n\n\u201cAnd nothing hides a bump better than a muumuu dress.\u201d\n\nWell, if the speculation is based on nothing other than the fact that these two seem to be in a hurry and some traditional Hawaiian attire is baggy, then we're gonna have to go ahead and call BS.\n\nBut who knows?\n\nMaybe Lindsay really is pregnant with Ben's baby, as the tabloids have been claiming for most of the past year.\n\nIf so, our sincere congrats go out to a couple that most folks didn't give much of a chance to.\n\nJust keep Ben away from those mai-tais at the wedding!", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--hz--X36W--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1501096308/attachment/ben-and-shookus.png"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--hz--X36W--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1501096308/attachment/ben-and-shookus.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/07/ben-affleck-and-lindsay-shookus-engaged-and-expecting-a-child/", "title": "Ben Affleck & Lindsay Shookus: Engaged and Expecting a Child?!?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/07/ben-affleck-and-lindsay-shookus-engaged-and-expecting-a-child/", "title": "Ben Affleck & Lindsay Shookus: Engaged and Expecting a Child?!?!", "description": "Are Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus soon to get hitched in a shotgun wedding?
