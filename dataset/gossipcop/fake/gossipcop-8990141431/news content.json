Mandatory Credit: Jeff Swinger-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Moment Dave Chappelle, Talib Kwali and Common Knew Kanye West Would Be Famous by Ryan Brennan\n\nReports are saying that Kanye West is so paranoid that he wears a bulletproof vest everywhere. I don\u2019t buy it one bit.\n\nIf so, then Kanye West is a lot skinnier than I thought he was.\n\nThe report I am talking about comes from the National Enquirer, which stated that Kanye West is \u201cso paranoid he is going to be assassinated he\u2019s made a bulletproof vest part of his everyday attire.\u201d I wasn\u2019t buying it the second I saw it, mostly because their source was cited as a \u201csnitch.\u201d\n\nAccording to this \u2018snitch,\u2019 Yeezus fears that his wealth has made him, his wife Kim Kardashian and his children susceptible to people that mean harm. As evidence, he now wears a bulletproof vest anytime he leaves the house.\n\nWhen he married Kim Kardashian and had two children with her, he created quite the household. It\u2019s a household that gets a crazy amount of attention and doesn\u2019t get much privacy. With Kanye\u2019s recent nervous breakdown, it\u2019s understandable to assume he might be paranoid of bad things happening to his family.\n\nBut a bulletproof vest everytime he leaves the house? I don\u2019t buy it all.\n\nFirst off, Kanye West can\u2019t leave the house without a photo of him being taken \u2014 whether it\u2019s the media or one of Kim K\u2019s selfies. With that being said, don\u2019t you think people would\u2019ve noticed him wearing a bulletproof vest \u2014 and asked why he\u2019s wearing one.\n\nA random report that says he does it everyday isn\u2019t exactly believable when we see pictures of him.. everyday. Keep in mind, the report said \u2014 word for word \u2014 that he \u201cwears the bulky gear even when it\u2019s just out for dinner.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, the report suggests that he is \u201ctortured\u201d by thoughts of what happened to Kim in Paris last October \u2014 the robbery. If you don\u2019t know Kanye West, he\u2019s a family person. He loves his family, loves his wife and loves his children. With that being said, why would he only put a bulletproof vest on himself?\n\nIf he was that paranoid, we would see Kim Kardashian wearing a bulletproof vest out to dinner, too. As well as the children.\n\nWhen I see photos of Kanye, Kim, North and Saint, I see no bulletproof vests.\n\nObviously, these reports of Kanye wearing a bulletproof vest are not true and are aimed to hurt his image. In fact, the only people really targeting Kanye and his family are media outlets like National Enquirer and others that have picked up the story as true.\n\nLet\u2019s just take one last look at a quote from this so-called \u2018snitch,\u2019 according to National Enquirer:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fearful of being followed \u2014 but it\u2019s really all in his mind. He really has taken a massive hit to his confidence since his breakdown, and he hasn\u2019t felt this vulnerable since his mother died. He\u2019s paranoid beyond help and is convinced people are out to get him \u2014 it\u2019s sad!\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Kanye West. Don\u2019t forget, his life is dope and he does dope s**t.\n\nWhat do you think of the reports saying that Kanye wears a bulletproof vest everywhere?
