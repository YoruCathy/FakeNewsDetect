During the same conversation, Post Malone labeled the mega-church \u201ca total cult\u201d while praising the Purpose singer as a \u201cfucking awesome, great dude\u201d and \u201cgenuine friend.\u201d", "images": ["http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.rollingstone.com&path=%2Fmusic%2Fmusic-news%2Fhillsong-church-pastor-refutes-post-malones-claims-about-justin-bieber-200471%2F&ct=article&lob=rollingstone&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=200471", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/justin-bieber-post-malone-eb560c80-8ac4-4fd6-8ec0-c012dcdb52fd.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RS-Get-The-Magazine-Free-Tote.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/justin-bieber-post-malone-eb560c80-8ac4-4fd6-8ec0-c012dcdb52fd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Reed", "Ryan Reed'S Most Recent Stories", "The Best Audio Sequencers", "Peter Gabriel Revives Two Rare Concert Films Online", "Watch Paul Simon", "Edie Brickell Cover The Everly Brothers", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hillsong-church-pastor-refutes-post-malones-claims-about-justin-bieber-200471/", "title": "Hillsong Church Pastor Refutes Post Malone\u2019s Claims About Justin Bieber", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#df3535", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Rolling Stone", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2018/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cropped-rs-favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "application-name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "Pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong New York City refuted Post Malone's claim that Justin Bieber has donated around $10 million to the church.", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Hillsong Church Pastor Refutes Post Malone's Claims About Justin Bieber", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hillsong-church-pastor-refutes-post-malones-claims-about-justin-bieber-200471/", "description": "\u201cJustin has not given our church $10 million, and we do not have gold ceilings.
