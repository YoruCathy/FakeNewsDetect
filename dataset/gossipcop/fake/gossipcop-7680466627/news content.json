This is a photo of an oversize suitcase, and people think glossy pop icon goddess Taylor Swift could be inside. That is, if you believe the caption that was posted to a paparazzi photo database (which was first spotted by radio station Spin1038). \"Taylor Swift being transported in a huge suitcase from her Tribeca apartment...almost a dozen of Taylor Swift['s] security guards were present to move this package carefully as Taylor Swift remains to be unseen for a long time,\" it reads.\n\nCheck it out for yourself, below:\n\nAs you'd expect, people on Twitter have been rejoicing over this news. But whether or not this story is true, it does hilariously highlight how weird it is to be a celebrity. I mean, we live in a world where they sell their used tissues on eBay for $5,000. And straight-up stop government elections because of their concerts. Hell, they put leeches on their bodies \u2014 for health reasons! So it's not that surprising that your favorite stars occasionally travel in unconventional ways, like private planes, tour buses, and...getting stuffed into suitcases.\n\nIs traveling in a suitcase strange? Sure. Unabashedly extra? Absolutely. The opening scene of a future T. Swift music video called \"My Love Is in a Suitcase?\" Probably. But it's actually not that far-fetched: After all, Adele was frequently wheeled to the stage in an equipment box on her last tour. Lady Gaga arrived to the 2011 Grammy Awards in a giant egg. Sometimes the outside world is just too hard, and the only way to escape is by hopping into a box.\n\nOf course, it's also possible this is complete rubbish or a misprint. The caption that started the mania in the first place spells Swift's name wrong in one place \u2014 so how reliable is it, actually? (And honestly, does it really matter? We wrote about it, so the joke's on us.)\n\nRegardless, I hope somewhere right now Swift is curled up in her carry-on and cackling.\n\nUPDATE: According to Spin, Splash News (the photo outlet responsible for this hoopla) is retracting its report that Taylor Swift was carried out of her New York City apartment in a suitcase. \u201cI literally just put the phone down from someone on Taylor\u2019s camp,\u201d a Splash representative told Spin. \u201cWe\u2019re having to actually retract that.\u201d The representative says the photographer who originally made the claim didn't verify it. \"The report stated it as a fact, which we actually don\u2019t know,\u201d the representative said. \u201cHow could we?\u201d Womp.\n\nRELATED: Taylor Swift Made a Super-Brief Cameo in an Episode of 13 Reasons Why", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/596ceaf23e140d377babba9f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-GETTY.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596ceaf23e140d377babba9f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-GETTY.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596cebec3e140d377babbaa1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/CAPTION.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596cebf408b17d5517ae32e4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-suitcase.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1499294085/glamour_women-answer-what-makes-good-dirty-talk.jpg", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/596ceaf23e140d377babba9f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor-swift-GETTY.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-carried-out-of-her-apartment-in-a-huge-suitcase", "title": "Was Taylor Swift Carried Out of Her Apartment in a Huge Suitcase?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "In weird celebrity news, Taylor Swift was allegedly carried out of her New York City apartment in a huge suitcase.
