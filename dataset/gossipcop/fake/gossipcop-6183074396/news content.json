Rapper and pro-Trump commentator 'looked more than friends,' claims source.\n\nWhile everyone was listening, he was flirting!\n\nKanye West threw a party and invited everybody who was somebody to listen to his new \u201cYe\u201d album in Jackson Hole, Wyoming last week. And despite wifey Kim Kardashian being in attendance, Kanye\u2019s attention was on a different woman, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.\n\nInsider claim Kanye, 40, has a thing for Trump supporter and conservative activist Candace Owens. The \u201cNew Slaves\u201d rapper boldly professed how much he loves the way she thinks in a Twitter post on Apr. 21 and at his listening party, which he invited her to, his actions showed he loved much more her intelligence.\n\nI love the way Candace Owens thinks \u2014 ye (@kanyewest) April 21, 2018\n\n\u201cThey were touchy feeling and it looked like they\u2019re more than friends,\u201d an onlooker told Radar of their interaction. \u201c\u2018Ye was showing Candace off to everybody, introducing her as his best friend.\n\n\u201cHe complemented her on her beauty and brains, telling people she could be our first female president,\u201d the source claimed. \u201cThey were flirting, laughing and smiling in each other\u2019s face. They had crazy chemistry.\u201d\n\nThe source indicated that Kim, 37, was oblivious to her husband swooning over Candace and thinks the reality television star should pay closer attention.\n\n\u201cWhen \u2018Ye wasn\u2019t with her, he was with Candace,\u201d the source added. \u201cIf Kim knew what\u2019s best, she\u2019d keep Kanye away from Candace.\u201d\n\nAs Radar previously reported exclusively, there\u2019s some serious tension between the A-List couple. Kanye\u2019s erratic behavior as of late is driving Kim insane.\n\n\u201cKim thinks that divorce may be her only option to save herself and her children right now,\u201d another source told Radar. \u201cShe\u2019s been having a breakdown herself over all of this, and has been crying to her mom and her sisters all week long!\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
