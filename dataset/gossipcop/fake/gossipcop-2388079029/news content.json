Here\u2019s how the A-lister is reacting to the controversy.\n\nMatt Damon, 47, has completely stepped in it! After the leading man decided to try and point out the difference between sexual harassment and sexual assault on ABC News\u2019 Popcorn with Peter Travers, he was lambasted by the likes of Alyssa Milano, 44, and Minnie Driver, 47, for his poor choice of words! Now, we\u2019re hearing how Matt is reacting to the backlash. \u201cMatt does not want to get dragged into yet another controversy, he\u2019s only just recovered from the Project Greenlight diversity fiasco,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe does truly believe what he said though, and, like many other men, he can\u2019t help feeling like there\u2019s a witch hunt mentality right now.\u201d Head here to see more photos of Matt through the years.\n\nThe source added that Matt\u2019s tone-deaf response says more about his loose tongue than defending Hollywood\u2019s alleged sexual predators. \u201cMatt\u2019s problem is that he doesn\u2019t have much of a filter, he speaks his mind and it often lands him in hot water. Matt\u2019s got four daughters of his own, and he really believes he\u2019s not got an ounce of misogyny in him. The point he was trying to make was that there\u2019s different degrees of harassment and assault, and he thinks some of the allegations that have been made over the past few months were in response to what he believes to be nothing more than some harmless horseplay. That said, he\u2019s really taken Alyssa\u2019s comments on board, and if more people take offence at what he said then he will definitely come out with an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatt really doesn\u2019t want to be seen to be condoning, or excusing, sexual harassment and assault, because it\u2019s an issue that he takes very seriously\u2014he just really needs to learn when to keep his private thoughts private, and not make statements about controversial subjects before he\u2019s fully thought through what the potential reaction could be,\u201d the insider said. Words to live by!\n\n\u201cI do believe that there\u2019s a spectrum of behavior, right?\u201d Matt said in the ABC News interview. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have to figure \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right?\u201d Something tells this isn\u2019t the end of this discussion!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do YOU think of Matt\u2019s response?
