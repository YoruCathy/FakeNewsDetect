On \u201cGMA,\u201d Miranda explained the song, which samples \u201cMaria\u201d from West Side Story, was inspired by the 78 cities of Puerto Rico, which were cut off from communication following the storm. Of getting fellow celebrities on board, \u201cYou burn up your Rolodex and tweet the people whose numbers you don\u2019t know, and really, every artist made miracles happen\u201d to take part, he said. As for the title, \u201cAlmost Like Praying,\u201d Miranda said, \u201cThoughts and prayers are great, but thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need more. We need action. We need the government\u2019s response to be equal of that of the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the government can step up to where our people are, we can be on the road to recovery a lot faster,\u201d Miranda said. Asked about tweeting that Trump is going \u201cstraight to hell\u201d after he ripped Puerto Ricans and the mayor of San Juan on Twitter, the composer said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a sitting president attack the victims of a natural disaster before.\u201d He repeated that on the \u201cToday\u201d show, and further said, \u201cThose were the only words I had to express my feelings on that\u2026 That was not an impulsive tweet. Those were the only words I had left and I\u2019m a guy who puts words together for a living.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201cGMA\u201d and \u201cToday, Miranda was on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d and \u201cDespierta America.\u201d He also appeared on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d on Thursday night for the announcement that Colbert and Nick Kroll\u2019s viral #PuberMe campaign raised $1 million.
