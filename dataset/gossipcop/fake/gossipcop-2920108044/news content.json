Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy \u201cSick Note,\u201d in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.\n\nThe Mykonos beach club is Lohan\u2019s third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.", "images": ["https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8", "http://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/CKB-22938-b44/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-lindsay-lohan-idUSKBN1KK27E", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "entertainmentNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "entertainmentNews;everythingNews", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,PEOPLE,LINDSAY,LOHAN,Living / Lifestyle,Picture available,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Greece,Personalities / People,Television,Video,Europe,Celebrities,Pictures,United States", "news_keywords": "US;PEOPLE;LINDSAY;LOHAN;Living / Lifestyle;Picture available;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;Greece;Personalities / People;Television;Video;Europe;Celebrities;Pictures;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Jul 31 13:00:04 UTC 2018", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2018-07-31T13:00:04+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-lindsay-lohan-idUSKBN1KK27E", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,PEOPLE,LINDSAY,LOHAN,Living / Lifestyle,Picture available,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Greece,Personalities / People,Television,Video,Europe,Celebrities,Pictures,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-PEOPLE-LINDSAY-LOHAN", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Video", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-31T13:00:04+0000", "sailthru.title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-lindsay-lohan-idUSKBN1KK27E", "type": "article", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.", "image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8", "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-31T13:00:04+0000", "modified_time": "2018-07-31T13:00:04+0000", "section": "Life", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,PEOPLE,LINDSAY,LOHAN,Living / Lifestyle,Picture available,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Greece,Personalities / People,Television,Video,Europe,Celebrities,Pictures,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8", "src": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/life/entertainment/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
