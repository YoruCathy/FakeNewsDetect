She announced the end of her second marriage. And while the 49-year-old actress and Justin Theroux, 46, said in their joint statement that \u201cWhatever else is printed about us\u201d beyond their own comment \u201cis someone else\u2019s fictional narrative,\u201d the mags \u2014 from the gold standard People to kitty litter box liner OK! \u2014 had no problem crafting those narratives. And crafty they are. Here are the most ridiculous/sensational/silly stories of the lot\u2026\n\n1. Justin found Jen\u2019s Post-it notes collection from Brad Pitt, and the impact was \u201chuge.\u201d We feel dumber by the second even typing this, but Us Weekly reports that Justin \u201cstumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written\u201d back when they were together. (They divorced in 2005, after he left her for Angelina Jolie, thus giving birth to the whole \u201cLonely Jen\u201d tabloid storyline.) The mag described them as \u201csweet little Post-its that said things like, \u2018You looked nice tonight,\u2019 or, \u2018Miss you already.\u2019\u201d (Not exactly sonnets, but\u2026) While Jen assured Justin that the \u201clove notes\u201d really \u201cweren\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Theroux \u201cwasn\u2019t thrilled.\u201d The Leftovers actor \u201chad moments of insecurity like that\u201d in their relationship in which he was \u201cfrequently out of his element.\u201d\n\n2. Jen dumped Justin for Brad because it was \u201cpointless\u201d to fight their attraction \u201cany longer.\u201d OK! magazine just went for it, claiming \u201cJen dumped Justin for Brad,\u201d using italics and everything. Even though People magazine has said that Jen and Brad straight up \u201chaven\u2019t seen each other for ages\u201d and \u201cfor well over a decade now they have lived totally separate lives,\u201d OK! insists that Aniston ended her marriage to reunite with Pitt. \u201cThey never stopped loving each other, and realized it\u2019s pointless to fight it any longer. They\u2019re soul mates and \u2026 the stars are aligning for them to get back together,\u201d read the breathless copy.\n\n3. Justin dumped Jen after Brad texted her to congratulate her on the Architectural Digest cover. Jen and Brad have maintained that they text now and then, and In Touch used that factoid to push its narrative. The tab wrote that, despite Jen and Justin saying they split in December, it was really after Jen appeared on the February cover of AD. That is when Brad texted her to extend his \u201cbest wishes,\u201d as someone who has also covered the magazine. \u201cDesign is so important to them,\u201d a source said of exes Jen and Brad. Brad\u2019s text didn\u2019t go over well with Justin, according to In Touch. \u201cHe saw the message on Jen\u2019s phone and was annoyed his wife was texting with her ex over their love of design.\u201d And that caused their final split.\n\n4. Jen and Brad have been having \u201csecret sleepovers.\u201d Which brings us here. The same mag reports that after Justin got mad that Brad texted Jen, \u201cJen showed up at Brad\u2019s door.\u201d The exes know that they\u2019re \u201cmeant to be back together\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019ve been having \u2018secret sleepovers.\u2019\u201d The story went on to say that Angelina would \u201chit the roof\u201d if she heard about the secret trysts.\n\n5. Justin has a mistress. But don\u2019t worry, y\u2019all \u2014 Justin\u2019s got his own side piece. Life & Style said that it was Jen\u2019s jealousy that did them in and \u201cnow she believes he\u2019s dumped her for another woman.\u201d The story paints him as \u201ca classic ladies\u2019 man,\u201d adding that \u201cit has always driven her up the wall\u201d because \u201cJen\u2019s got a jealous streak a mile wide.\u201d In Touch also claims Justin has a mistress, but their evidence is an anonymous comment on one of Justin\u2019s Instagram photos featuring Jen and Justin that said, \u201cI know a few people who saw him with his mistress in N.Y.\u201d Solid reporting.\n\n6. Jen\u2019s been hanging out with Brad\u2019s kids. Yet another claim by In Touch is that \u2014 while Brad\u2019s custody agreement is vague and the kids mostly seem to be with Jolie \u2014 during one of Jen and Brad\u2019s \u201cmore intimate moments\u201d since they reconciled, he \u201cintroduced Jen to several of his children.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0dwXRK33jMQRsH6_QIQJ4A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO2ZpPWZpbGw7dz04NDtoPTg0O2lsPXBsYW5l/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-17/711f88c0-b37f-11e7-8353-c582c6383d28_oath_suzybyrne_03_7589.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/egHnf6VRRnebkiCSxmtxlQ--~B/aD0xNTM2O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/704d5100eb70dd0245a7dde7454d984a", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iNPX1_r38HgqaHptWTN3kg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/704d5100eb70dd0245a7dde7454d984a", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/egHnf6VRRnebkiCSxmtxlQ--~B/aD0xNTM2O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/704d5100eb70dd0245a7dde7454d984a", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fights-post-notes-secret-sleepovers-brad-jennifer-anistons-separation-leads-creative-tabloid-tales-194445753.html", "title": "Fights over Post-it notes?
