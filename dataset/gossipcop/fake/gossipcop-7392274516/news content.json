Weddings are always fraught, even if they are not your own, and especially when they are as public and imbued with metaphor and meaning as this one.\n\nMs. Markle, who in a span of an hour was transformed from a Ms. to Duchess, successfully made her way down the aisle to meet her very-soon-to-be husband, Prince Harry.\n\nThey both looked so happy, and so relaxed. They were beaming as they said their vows, and luckily, no one came forward to provide any reason that they might not be married. (This is always an exciting moment in a ceremony.)\n\nIt was an extraordinary mix of tradition and modernity, of centuries of history and up-to-the moment flourishes. Oprah was here, and so was Meghan\u2019s mother, an African-American social worker who wore a conventional mother-of-the-bride outfit and also a nose stud.\n\nIt somehow looked charming and just right.\n\nThe entire royal family was here, along with a complement of English aristocrats and important personages. The music was stately and beautiful. The setting was awe-inspiring.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/world/20royal-briefing-carriage/merlin_138385428_92949476-6182-418e-96f2-f90411862900-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/world/20royal-briefing-promo3/20royal-briefing-promo3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/19/style/Royal-Wedding-Slideshow-slide-SZ42/Royal-Wedding-Slideshow-slide-SZ42-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/world/20vid-royalwedding-highlights-alt/20vid-royalwedding-highlights-alt-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/world/20royal-briefing-promo3/20royal-briefing-promo3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Lyall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/world/europe/royal-wedding-live.html", "title": "\u2018Stand by Me\u2019: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Are Married", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-05-19T06:30:08.000Z", "modified": "2018-05-21T19:45:23.000Z", "section": "World", "tag": "Charles, Prince of Wales", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005903977, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/05806c5e-8384-5a8d-9c2d-20c7f8d0b728", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/079ae49d448a46849f8bc412de357d57", "description": "He\u2019s a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.
