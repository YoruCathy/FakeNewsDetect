So I decided I should spend my week off work wisely (because I can\u2019t drive and do the stuff I used to) and binge watch the lot from start to finish \u2013 2007 to 2017.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve bullet pointed the main points that contradicted what I thought I knew below and thought it might open the eyes of some other people too (unless you don\u2019t care, because that\u2019s okay lol);\n\nRobert Kardashian was a music agent and not just a lawyer \u2013 I\u2019m assuming this is where the name and money started rolling in from, but I\u2019d always believed he was just a famous lawyer because of the OJ Simpson case\n\nBruce Jenner was a gold-winning Olympian and he made a lot of money through motivational speaking \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a clue!\n\nThe series started the year that Kim\u2019s world famous sex tape with Ray J was released to the world \u2013 I\u2019m with a lot of theorists in that this was a PR stunt to get their name in the media\n\nThey\u2019re a lot more charitable than the media makes out \u2013 yeah, they\u2019re extremely spoiled and materialistic most of the time, but they\u2019ve done a lot for those less fortunate than them\n\nI\u2019m into season 7 at the moment, so there\u2019s a lot more surgery, divorces, sex changes and tabloid scandals to come \u2013 but I\u2019m hooked!\n\nAlthough they have more money than sense at times, I can\u2019t help but see at times they\u2019re just a normal family that rips the shit out of each other, playfights and argues just like my own!\n\nI still find it difficult to comprehend that they\u2019re famous for \u2026 well not a lot really, but do admire how they\u2019ve used their platform to grow their own empires.\n\nAlthough Kim takes the limelight the majority of the time, each family member has their quirks which makes them amusing to watch. I find Scott Disick hilarious, Kourtney\u2019s snap back comments always make me chuckle and Khloe\u2019s bluntness refreshing. I think the most genuinely famous member of the family is Kendall; she hasn\u2019t used the show to explode her career (although I\u2019m sure it\u2019s helped!) and has bagged herself an amazing modelling career which you can see growing throughout the years of the show.\n\n\n\nLove em or hate em, the Kardashians will be here for the long run (10 years of Keeping up with the Kardashians this year people!) and I\u2019ll continue keeping my eyes glued to my screen!\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments below!\n\n\n\nShare this: Share\n\nFacebook\n\nTelegram\n\n\n\nSkype\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\nReddit\n\n\n\n\n\nbloggerBruce JennerCaitlyn Jennerfashionfashion blogfashion bloggerfbloggerKendall JennerKhloe KardashianKim kardashianKourtney Kardashiankris JennerKylie JennerScott Disickthe Kardashianstrends", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_09742.png?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0883fc812bc1e2af7e54115893d93292?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png", "https://i0.wp.com/thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0045.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/77.104.149.118/~thefash0/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0140.jpg?resize=727%2C519", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c6dcaa2c81a411d33d9c47896b928f95?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/77.104.149.118/~thefash0/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_1969-2.png?resize=542%2C623", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b411778a4a820fcded4c4818be6869e7?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/65e53a1db6c527a099886564c71d9d6f?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_3423.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/77.104.149.118/~thefash0/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0045.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024", "https://thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Fashion-Faux-Pas-Of-4.png", "https://i0.wp.com/thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_1116.jpg?resize=400%2C600&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/thefashionfauxpasofgabrielle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_0045.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["It'S Karla Ivonne", "Gabrielle Banner", "Her Vs.
