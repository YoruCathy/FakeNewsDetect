She wants to trademark the name because it will be her name when she gets married and she wants to protect it. It\u2019s also her daughter\u2019s last name and she wants to share a last name with her daughter.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time\n\nChyna\u2019s lawyer Walter Mosley told PEOPLE in December that of the \u201cmany trademarks\u201d he\u2019s filed for her, \u201cthis is the first one that\u2019s ever been opposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kardashians, like Angela and my other clients, are very protective of our marks, I think for us this is going to be a clear case win, because it\u2019s actually her name, it\u2019s not a poaching,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s just a big misunderstanding but I\u2019m just proceeding as if it\u2019s not and am going to do the best work I can for my client,\u201d Mosley added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Are Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian Back Together?\n\nLarry Zerner, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer specializing in trademark litigation, told PEOPLE at the time of the filing that even if Chyna does marry into the Kardashian family, her legal name may be blocked from being trademarked.\n\n\u201cA lot of name trademarks are worth a lot of money. For example, Martha Stewart is trademarked and Calvin Klein \u2013 those are all names of people, that\u2019s the brand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose of the trademark is to tell the consumer that the source of the goods is what it is.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cTo go back to my Martha Stewart analogy, if someone wanted to register \u2018Martha Stewart\u2019 they would probably get opposed. If someone wants to register \u2018Angela Stewart\u2019 that might be okay. Of course, Stewart is a much more common name than Kardashian, so the analogy is not perfect.\u201d\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE that the couple had split earlier in the year, but Chyna and Kardashian shared sultry shots of each other \u2014 including a video of Kardashian kissing Chyna \u2014 on Saturday.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fblac-chyna2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fblac-chyna2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fblac-chyna2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/celebrity/blac-chyna-request-trademark-kardashian-name-denied/", "title": "Blac Chyna Request to Trademark Kardashian Name Denied", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Blac Chyna,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Blac Chyna,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,News,TV", "description": "The sisters\u2019 companies claimed they\u2019ll \u201csuffer damage including irreparable injury to their reputation and goodwill\u201d if Chyna takes the Kardashian name", "og": {"title": "Blac Chyna Request to Trademark Kardashian Name Denied", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/celebrity/blac-chyna-request-trademark-kardashian-name-denied/", "description": "Blac Chyna\u2018s request to&nbsp;trademark the name \u201cAngela Ren\u00e9e Kardashian\u201d has officially been denied, according to TMZ.
