Kim Kardashian's Stolen Gems Funding Evil Terrorists! How her missing bling is being converted to black market cash.\n\nKim Kardashian is trapped in a terrorism nightmare after RadarOnline.com learned cops have linked her stolen gems to the coffers of Islamic jihadists!\n\nIn a bombshell world exclusive, a top Interpol source claimed they have connected the diamonds snatched from Kardashian\u2019s Paris hotel suite during a brazen Oct. 3 robbery to shady moneymen with ties to radical Islamic terrorists.\n\nFrench police have busted 17 suspects allegedly involved in the heist, and authorities have connected that gang to black-market dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.\n\nMost of the world\u2019s diamonds pass through the city, where underground brokers are notorious for mixing \u201cdirty\u201d stolen stones with \u201cclean\u201d gems for resale.\n\nAntwerp\u2019s illicit marketplace is a hotbed for devious money-laundering schemes \u2014 with profits going to fund violent terrorists around the globe, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an elite band of bean counters that tracks terrorist funds.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups,\u201d said a European official involved in tracking terror groups\u2019 funding.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, David Levine, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who\u2019s published works on terrorism, confirmed, \u201cViolent groups are funded by black-market gems.\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s nightmare unfolded last fall, when robbers forced their way into the private Paris residence where she was staying.\n\nThey tied her up, held her at gunpoint and then locked her in a bathroom before making off with $10 million worth of jewelry, including her 20-carat emerald-cut diamond engagement ring.\n\nMixing 36-year-old Kardashian\u2019s stolen jewels with fair-trade diamonds makes them almost impossible to trace, and it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll ever get them back, our sources said.\n\nTo make matters worse, Kardashian has taken a political stand on behalf of her ancestral homeland of Armenia. Now, she must live with the knowledge her stolen swag could be used to harm her people.\n\n\u201cWho knows what horrors Kim\u2019s bling will end up funding,\u201d said the source.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
