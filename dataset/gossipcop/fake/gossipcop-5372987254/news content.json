The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support.\n\nChrissy Teigen, who has previously criticized Trump on Twitter, commented on the prayer portion of the inauguration. \"What a beautiful prayer. makes me wanna grab my p\u2014,\" she tweeted, alluding to Trump's infamous comment in his and Billy Bush's leaked tape.\n\nTeigen soon commented on the attention her prayer tweet was receiving. \"Oh. it's offensive when I say it though. hm,\" she wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Shonda Rhimes praised Hillary Clinton and retweeted a list with 45 things to do other than watch the inauguration.\n\nKaty Perry, who was very vocal in her support of Clinton during the campaign, told her her 95 million Twitter followers that she'd be sleeping in instead of watching Trump's inauguration. She also made note that she'd be attending Saturday's Women's March on Washington, alongside other celebrities like Chelsea Handler, Cher, and America Ferrera.\n\nPatton Oswalt also offered up several suggestions via Facebook on Thursday as to what to do or watch instead of the inauguration, which included watching National Geographic, powering down your phone, and going to see an indie film. <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpattonoswalt%2Fposts%2F10154565362887655&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" resize=\"0\" replace_attributes=\"1\" name=\"\"></iframe>\u00f5\u00b7\u00da\u00ed\u00c6\u00f5i\u00bf}\u00de\u00f4o\u00df\u00d9\u00fe;{\u20219\u00dd\u00de\u00db\u00f5\u00dd\u00dcov\u00f7\n\nSee below for more stars addressing the inauguration on social media.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/", "title": "Celebrities react to Trump inauguration on Twitter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Donald Trump,EW News Flash,George Lopez,Katy Perry,Patton Oswalt", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump,EW News Flash,George Lopez,Katy Perry,Patton Oswalt", "description": "Katy Perry, Shonda Rhimes, and George Lopez are among the stars tweeting about Donald Trump's inauguration.", "og": {"title": "Celebrities React to Trump Inauguration on Twitter", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/", "description": "Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th president of the United States on Friday, but not everyone will be tuning in.
