While other undercover operatives tend to lay low and draw as little attention to themselves as possible, Garcia used his massive 6-foot 4-inch, 300-pound frame to muscle his way into the ranks of several different crime families and into the circles of corrupt cops, often overlapping his investigations with numerous identities.\n\nFor more than two years, Garcia posed as \"Jack Falcone,\" an associate to the Gambino crime family of La Cosa Nostra in New York City. His investigation resulted in the conviction of 32 gangsters, including several key members of the family. Concurrently, Garcia posed as a different New York-based mobster and concluded a three-year FBI sting in Florida that brought down four dirty cops.\n\nDuring the same time frames as his New York and Florida operations, Garcia participated in two separate undercover operations in Atlantic City that targeted corrupt politicians and a Boston sting targeting corrupt cops. According to a veteran law enforcement official who worked with him, Garcia is \"the best undercover agent the Bureau has ever had.\"\n\nWhile undercover, Garcia posed as a jewel thief mobster who also sold drugs. He played his part so well members of the gamed Gambino crime family took him in and made him a top member in their administration. In 2008, he released an autobiography which was adapted into a film that as of April 2017 has not been released.", "images": ["https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001311122/original/fbi-super-agent-takes-down-mobsters-dirty-cops-and-corrupt-politicians-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001307168/original/faux-mobster-crushes-a-mafia-family-single-handedly-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001307262/original/neo-nazi-investigation-reveals-racist-cop-photo-u2?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_img/5655/28272231/original/brent-sprecher-u6?w=56&h=56&q=60&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces", "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1?w=817&h=427&fm=jpg&q=50&fit=crop?fm=pjpg&q=80", "http://prd.rnkr-static.com/140/dist/img/app/blank.png", "https://imgix.ranker.com/collection_img/1/1502/original/police-the-boys-in-blue-u4?w=751&h=271&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&q=50", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001311150/original/cops-and-their-dogs-infiltrate-the-violent-world-of-dogfighting-photo-u1?w=650&q=50&fm=pjpg&fit=crop&crop=faces"], "top_img": "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1?w=817&h=427&fm=jpg&q=50&fit=crop?fm=pjpg&q=80", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Sprecher"], "canonical_link": "//www.ranker.com/list/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories/brent-sprecher", "title": "14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time", "meta_data": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=1200", "msapplication-TileColor": "#1E3E66", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/msapplication-square150x150logo.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "These crazy stories from undercover cops are true and often had huge impacts for all those involved.
