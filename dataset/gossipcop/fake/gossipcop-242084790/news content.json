She\u2019s made it clear that anyone listening or supporting Taylor will be banned from her circle instantly, and the likes of Gigi, Bella and Cara are all doing as they\u2019re told.\u201d\n\nBut one of their mutual friends is caught in the middle, and it\u2019s none other than Selena Gomez. The beauty \u201crefuses\u201d to distance herself from Taylor, which could spell t-r-o-u-b-l-e. No one wants to get one a Kardashian\u2019s bad side!", "images": ["https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jwoww-coparenting-roger-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/becca-kufrin-ben-higgins-phone-probe-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-21-at-11.37.31-AM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-13-at-2.18.36-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AG_147748_005.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/jax-taylor-tom-sandoval-wedding-regret-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/BGUS_972963_002.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AG_026942_008.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-fight-marriage-boot-camp-drama-hero.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-ok/assets/build/images/icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kendall-nyc5.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_news.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kevin-dobson-rhylee-gerber-video-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://okmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ben-higgins-engagement-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kevin-dobson-cheap-or-chic-pp.jpg?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/heroe.jpg?fit=1200%2C593&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/menu_couples.png?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-drama-tension-ok-pp-1.jpg?resize=178%2C124&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AG_148262_003.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AG_147748_001.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/heroe.jpg?resize=800%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screen-Shot-2020-02-17-at-2.57.44-PM.png?resize=540%2C270&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/BGUS_937881_001.jpg?fit=1380%2C880&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/okmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/heroe.jpg?fit=1200%2C593&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["September"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/kendall-jenner-tells-friends-ban-taylor-swift-music/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Tells Friends: Ban Taylor Swift Music Or Else!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "If you want to remain Kendall Jenner\u2019s friend, you better stick to the program!
