And, Bieber isn\u2019t cool with Sel\u2019s ex bringing up her near death experience.\n\nJustin Bieber, 24, isn\u2019t too fond of \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d \u2014 The Weeknd\u2018s new track which seems to suggest that he [The Weeknd] almost donated his own kidney to Selena Gomez, 25, when she need one the most. \u201cJustin thinks The Weeknd\u2019s new song is petty, weak and makes him look bitter,\u201d a source close to Justin tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, adding that Justin is the one who has \u201creal love\u201d for Selena. \u201cWhether they are together or not, in the past, present or in the future, Justin will always be there for Selena and he would gladly hand over one of his kidneys to save her life,\u201d the source adds.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cJustin feels like it would be an honor to help Selena with something major like that,\u201d the insider says. Therefore, when Justin caught wind of The Weeknd\u2019s new track, he thought it was distasteful that Abel, 28, had the nerve to hash up Selena\u2019s traumatic experience. \u201cHe was disgusted,\u201d the source admits. Although he\u2019s not with Selena, for now, we hear JB will always has her back, and this time, The Weeknd didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cCall Out My Name\u201d features more cryptic lyrics, which fans obviously decoded, claiming they too are about Selena. \u201cWe found each other / I helped you out of a broken place,\u201d part of the lyrics read, which fans believe is The Weeknd implying that he helped Selena finally get over Justin. The Weeknd goes on to sing about a relationship, and then seems to point out that he still has feelings for this person.\n\n\u201cYou gave me comfort / But falling for you was my mistake / I put you on top, I put you on top / I claimed you so proud and openly / And when times were rough, when times were rough / I made sure I held you close to me\u2026 I said I didn\u2019t feel nothing, baby, but I lied,\u201d the lyrics say.\n\nSelena and The Weeknd split in October 2017, after they first got together around January of that year. She then got back together with Bieber following the breakup. However, Jelena then ended things in early March 2018.", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/justin-bieber-would-give-his-kidney-hates-the-weeknd-ftr.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F02%2Fjustin-bieber-response-the-weeknd-song-selena-gomez-kidney-donor%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3062500", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/justin-bieber-would-give-his-kidney-hates-the-weeknd-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/02/justin-bieber-response-the-weeknd-song-selena-gomez-kidney-donor/", "title": "Justin Bieber Would Gladly Give A Kidney To Selena: He Think\u2019s The Weeknd\u2019s Song Is Petty", "meta_data": {"description": "Justin Bieber's got a few thoughts about The Weeknd's new song, 'Call Out My Name' which seems to suggest that he almost gave up a kidney to save Selena Gomez's life!
