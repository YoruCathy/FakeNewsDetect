The highly attended ceremony celebrates a 250-year-old British tradition where military troops show off their flags (or colours) and march throughout the Buckingham Palace square, Fox News reports.\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE\u2019S BEST FRIEND HAS 'PIPPA MOMENT' IN FITTED DRESS\n\nQueen Elizabeth, whose real birthday is on April 21, turned 92 this year.\n\nFor the special event, the 36-year-old former actress wore a pale pink, bespoke Carolina Herrera dress with matching Philip Treacy hat, which she evidently recycled from her first royal engagement in her new role, just three days after her May 19 wedding.\n\nThough the royal newlywed appeared perfectly content riding in a carriage alongside Prince Harry and mingling with the royal family on the iconic balcony of Buckingham Palace, some detractors on social media felt that the look was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for the regal occasion.\n\n\u201cOff the shoulder is inappropriate day wear at the Trooping or any official engagement,\u201d one critic clapped.\n\n\u201cI do feel her choice of an off the shoulder dress was pushing it for HRH Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday celebration. I have a feeling she\u2019s going to push the limits a little too much?!\u201d another agreed of the look another dubbed as \"wholly inappropriate.\"\n\nNevertheless, fans were quick to rush to Markle's defense.\n\n\u201cMeghan Markle broke protocol by wearing an off the shoulder dress. Keep doing you boo!\u201d one fan applauded.\n\n\u201cOh the humanity!! The crown is experiencing such unrest with two barely visible shoulders. Stop it!!\u201d another exclaimed.\n\n\u201cThe American Princess is the epitome of class, beauty and style. We love Meghan Markle,\u201d one chimed in.\n\nMeanwhile, another supporter cheekily pointed out that Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Diana and even Queen Elizabeth have all worn off the shoulder outfits, too.\n\nIn other style news, the Duchess of Cambridge, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and the Queen all wore long sleeved, blue ensembles for the Trooping of the Colour commencement.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThough it remains unclear if Markle\u2019s off the shoulder look truly broke royal protocol, perhaps the newest member of the royal family will find time to chat about the topic with her 92-year-old grandmother-in-law next week, when they embark on their first solo outing in Cheshire, England.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/e2045eeb-a.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/12550077-x.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/trooping-4.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/tiger-cow-2-Jam-Press.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/trooping-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/fox-news-lifestyle_fox-news-lifestyle.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/ap18142576507790.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/823750a2-b.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Tunnel2Towers-on-2020-04-15-at-10.21.00_05_58_13.Still001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/fashion-nova.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/823750a2-b.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/blockdown-photo-504027.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/823750a2-b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janine Puhak", "Janine Puhak Is An Editor For Fox News Lifestyle.
