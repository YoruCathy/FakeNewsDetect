This year that is perhaps even more true as The Emmy\u2019s made history when Laverne Cox became the first transgender* actor to receive an Emmy nomination (Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series) for her portrayal of Sophia Burset on the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. This is certainly cause for a celebration \u2013 we\u2019re celebrating, celebrate with us.\n\nWe\u2019re happy for Laverne Cox despite The ViP team (it\u2019s unanimous) holding the unpopular opinion that Cox\u2019s nomination is more political than earned. We\u2019re here for it! Don\u2019t get us wrong, we just also have to be honest. We don\u2019t feel she beat out other potential candidates on OITNB for this category \u2013 not with screen time and not with her performance. You\u2019ll also note that while we love, adore and admire (a couple of us are even obsessed with) Kerry Washington just the same \u2013 she didn\u2019t make our list either.\n\nThose aren\u2019t the only changes we made to this year\u2019s Emmy\u2019s nod list. Before we get into what should\u2019ve happened let\u2019s talk about what actually happened.\n\nOrange is the New Black dominated the comedy category and helped offer some color to a very white ballot. The binge-watch favorite earned 12 nominations in all, including a nomination for Best Comedy Series. Uzo Aduba (Suzanne \u201cCrazy Eyes\u201d Warren) and Natasha Lyonne (Nicky Nichols) joined Cox in the Outstanding Guest Actress category (the only category with more than one person of color in it), while Taylor Schilling (Piper Kerman) and Kate Mulgrew (Galina \u201cRed\u201d Reznikov) got nods in Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively.\n\nIn the past few years, nominations have crept away from networks and toward cable television, which allows for gritty dramas, edgy comedies and a lower season episode count, which means overall less work for writers and production teams and some network folks aren\u2019t happy about it. Netflix has recently joined cable as an outlet for intense storytelling. Between its critically acclaimed series Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, Netflix garnered a total of 31 nominations, impressive for a network only in its second year at the Emmy\u2019s. Cable provider HBO led the networks with a whopping 99 nominations, including 19 for the top-nominated program Game of Thrones.\n\nEven critics\u2019 staple favorites like CBS\u2019s The Good Wife came away with fewer nominations than expected. While nods were secured for Best Actress category frequenter Julianna Margulies (Alicia Florrick), supporting actor Josh Charles (Will Gardner, whose on-screen death came as one of the biggest television shockers of the season), supporting actress Christine Baranski (Diane Lockhart) and guest actor Dylan Baker (cringe-worthy client Colin Sweeney), the program was noticeably missing from the Best Drama Series category. Also noticeably absent from the list was Fox\u2019s new breakout hit, Sleepy Hollow.\n\nSome traditional network shows, however, managed to make the cut. Shonda Rhimes\u2019 fast-paced fan favorite Scandal came away with a Best Actress nod for Kerry Washington\u2019s Olivia Pope and guest actor nods for Joe Morton (Rowan \u201cPapa\u201d Pope) and Kate Burton (Sally Langston).\n\nWhile Canada hasn\u2019t seemed to have much luck with the Emmy\u2019s (Orphan Black\u2019s Tatiana Maslany), British programs like Sherlock, Downton Abbey and Luther (Idris Elba\u2019s Best Actor in a Miniseries nomination makes his fourth Emmy nod overall) have all made more than one appearance in this year\u2019s Emmy nominations.\n\nTheater apparently also makes good television, as screen adaptations of the plays The Normal Heart and The Trip Bountiful earned Emmy nods. The Normal Heart, which aired on HBO, dominated the Best Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie category, with Jim Parsons, Joe Mantello, Alfred Molina and Matt Bomer taking up four of the six available spots. Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts earned nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Cicely Tyson earned a Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie nod for her work in The Trip Bountiful, impressive since the movie aired on Lifetime, which does not traditionally do well in the Emmy race.\n\nEmmy nominations often belong to a closed group (check the lists for best comedy and drama series\u2019 actors for the past five years \u2014 the same names come up a lot). And so often the Emmy\u2019s get it wrong. Actually we couldn\u2019t remember the last time The Emmy\u2019s got it right. So, The Visibility Project staff sat down, brainstormed and got to work on fixing the 2014 Emmy\u2019s nomination list. We\u2019ve done a little bit of category shifting in some places, based on quality of performance and the fact that British shows count as shows and not miniseries in our minds.\n\nAs our staff writer, Kylee pointed out during our decision-making process, #wethegods, we\u2019ve fixed the list our way and how we see fit. We stuck to the main categories so we added an honorable mentions list of actors that would definitely make the cut if we\u2019d fixed the full list.
