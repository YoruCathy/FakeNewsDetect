Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year!\u201d\n\nHadid, who is dating former One Direction star Zayn Malik, was warned not to take part in the show after she was filmed squinting her eyes as she held up a Buddha cookie and appeared to impersonate the face. The video was posted online by her sister.\n\nIn September, critics warned Hadid not to attend this year\u2019s show beneath her Instagram post announcing that she had been selected to take part again.\n\nOne person commented: \u201cWe like some people who respects us, not you. What you have done made us unhappy. And Chinese do not welcome you.
