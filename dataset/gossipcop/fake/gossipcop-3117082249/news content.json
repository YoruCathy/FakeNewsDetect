Watch JB\u2019s sneaky exit from a club while his \u2018Despacito\u2019 collaborators were performing!\n\nThe 2018 Grammy Awards were almost perfect, but there was someone huge missing: Justin Bieber! The \u201cSorry\u201d singer, 23, skipped the Grammys on January 28 and opted to stay back home in Los Angeles during Music\u2019s Biggest Night. He wasn\u2019t having a quiet night in Netflix and Chilling with Selena Gomez, though. Biebs hit the town with his guys, instead. TMZ caught up with him while he was leaving Mr. Chow in LA instead of hitting the stage in NYC to sing the \u201cDespacito\u201d remix with Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee. Uh oh!\n\nNow, don\u2019t get it wrong. Justin loves himself some Luis and Daddy, but he\u2019s got bigger fish to fry at home. JB\u2019s allegedly working on a new album, and, according to TMZ, he doesn\u2019t want to make any major appearances until it\u2019s finished. Well, that\u2019s exciting! Hopefully, that\u2019s true. Justin\u2019s also skipped the Grammys in the past just for kicks, though, so it could just be a case of simply not wanting to go. After all, he clearly didn\u2019t even watch the show since he was out with his friends.\n\nSelena wasn\u2019t with the crew, even though she also wasn\u2019t at the Grammys. As HollywoodLife.com told you EXCLUSIVELY, Selena doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about when Justin hangs without her! When he was partying it up at Poppy Nightclub in LA just a couple days before the Grammys, an eyewitness told us that he looked happy and relaxed, and that there was no funny business going on. Justin never \u201cflirted or danced or carried on with any girls,\u201d the eyewitness told us.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Justin should have gone to the Grammys and performed the \u201cDespacito\u201d remix?
