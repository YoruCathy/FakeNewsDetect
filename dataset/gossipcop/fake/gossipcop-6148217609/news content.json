It has been over a year since Jolie and Pitt announced their split after a 12-year relationship that included two years of marriage, but the divorce proceedings continue to drag on without resolution. Is it possible that the breakup is causing some severe sibling rivalry between oldest sons Maddox and Pax Jolie-Pitt?\n\nIn the latest issue of National Enquirer, the tabloid is claiming that 16-year-old Maddox and 13-year-old Pax are locked in a feud, causing non-stop fighting between the two brothers. The source in the story says that Maddox is bossy and Pax has had enough; and with the younger brother being taller and stronger, Maddox could \u201chave that smug smile knocked off his face.\u201d However, Gossip Cop has looked into the story and has discovered that it is inaccurate.\n\nTeenage boys do have disagreements, but that doesn\u2019t mean there is any battle between the brothers. According to Gossip Cop\u2019s source, Maddox and Pax are close, and they get along just fine. The divorce has been difficult for the family, but they are all getting through it as best they can.\n\nLoung Ung, Vivienne, Maddox, Pax, Angelina Jolie, Kimhak Mun, Knox, Shiloh, Zahara and Sareum Srey Moch attend the Toronto International Film Festival.

Maddox received an Executive Producer credit and Pax worked as a photographer.\n\nOn top of working with Jolie, they are also attending red carpet premieres and after-parties. She Knows revealed that the boys wore designer clothes while posing for pictures outside an exclusive New York party with their mom.\n\nBut, the kids don\u2019t just join Jolie at glamorous events. Yahoo! is reporting that Maddox and his sisters Zahara, 12, and Vivienne, 9, were spotted shopping for Halloween costumes this past week with the Tomb Raider actress, while she attempted to keep a low profile by wearing sunglasses with a long dress and cardigan.\n\nBrad Pitt poses with Pax, Maddox, and Shiloh Jolie-Pitt.

In an email to The New York Times, Jolie wrote that behavior like that against women is unacceptable.\n\nTell us!
