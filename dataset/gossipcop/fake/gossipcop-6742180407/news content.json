The former Real Housewife of New York, ran around the grounds in an A-line Carolina Herrera dress, posing on the step-and-repeat, taking photos with fans, and catching up with old friends. Trying to track her down for an interview turned into a scavenger hunt.\n\nScattered around the lawn were tables for vendors selling everything from wine to sex toys. There was a station for guests to get a vitamin infusion, with seats in the direct line of the sun transforming the spot into an inescapable sauna-I.V. drip hybrid. Housewives from across the country flew into town for the occasion (Vicki Gunvalson of Orange County and LeeAnne Locken of Dallas), which also served as a benefit for Thyroid Cancer Research in honor of Zarin\u2019s late husband, Bobby, who died of the disease in January.\n\nUpon first try to flag Zarin down for a couple of questions, she sent over her daughter, Ally Shapiro, in her stead. Shapiro reflected on last year\u2019s luncheon, when her stepfather was still struggling with cancer, but encouraged her and her mother to party on.\n\n\u201cHe loved drinking and partying. This was the highlight of his year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was this time last year that we were told he wasn\u2019t gonna make it another week, and he pushed us and he said, \u2018Go to the party. Maybe I won\u2019t be here when you come back, but go.\u2019\u201d\n\nShapiro, who now lives in London while she works on her master\u2019s degree, admits that she can\u2019t watch old episodes of Real Housewives, which showed her as 14-year-old struggling to get close to her stepfather. \u201cYou want to think that it\u2019s like a home movie, but it\u2019s not. That\u2019s not what our relationship was like,\u201d she said, adding that the reruns play constantly in the U.K. \u201cI\u2019m walking down the street and someone\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I just saw you trying on a prom dress!\u2019\u201d\n\nShe also said that her mother is dabbling with dating, specifically with a man she plays tennis with. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, and I live in London so it\u2019s good for her to have a distraction.\u201d\n\nDina Lohan, dressed in a metallic green blazer and shorts set and a pair of oversized aviators, arrived fashionably late to the affair, but was immediately greeted by hoards of people trying to chat her up or get a photo. Eventually secured in the same spot for more than a few seconds, she was willing to talk about her daughter Lindsay\u2019s upcoming project for MTV, a Vanderpump Rules\u2013inspired reality show that follows Lindsay and the employees of her new Lohan Beach Club. Bunim/Murray Productions is producing the series, the same company that produced Lohan\u2019s E! reality show Living Lohan a decade ago.\n\n\u201cThese kids were like, babies, and now they\u2019re running the show,\u201d she said of the crew. \u201cThey lived in my house! And now they\u2019re all corporate. . . . We\u2019re home. It\u2019s cyclical, you know.\u201d\n\nLohan also revealed that the upcoming series is a bit of a family affair with Lindsay\u2019s younger sister, 24-year-old Ali, providing the theme song.\n\nA friend of Lohan\u2019s interjected, asking if Ali, like her older sister over a decade ago, had moved out to L.A. for work.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s in New York with me,\u201d the matriarch answered. \u201cI keep them close! I\u2019m not going to lose someone to L.A., no. Not again!\u201d\n\nFinally, the woman of the hour managed to stop and take a breath. While Zarin may no longer be a Bravo housewife, she still knows how to schmooze like one. She\u2019s been keeping up with the latest season of the show here and there, and even received a good-luck message from Luann de Lesseps, who checked into rehab earlier in the month, wishing her good luck on the event. Having brought me up to speed, Zarin closed our conversation with a plug for her new line of \u201cpet-proof, gorgeous, and inexpensive\u201d rugs, aptly titled Jill Zarin Rugs. Because once a housewife, always a housewife.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5744a66674802aa17a5331/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Lohan-New-Boss.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58750b45ee2328491208665a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/off-duty-actress-evolution-audrey-hepburn.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e489dd6970cb826d088/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/l-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58750b4658cef9ab303409cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/off-duty-actress-evolution-bette-davis.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e433368540bfc7d26fe/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ac6843a3ac8ef302e712ab3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/embed-Real-Housewives-NYC.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b0d717397a2dc739c87c946/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Lohan-Latest-Nightclub.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58750b4558cef9ab303409cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/off-duty-actress-evolution-marlene-dietrich.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e433368540bfc7d26fe/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood", "Erika Harwoo", "Emma Stefansk", "Kenzie Bryan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/dina-lohan-drops-more-details-on-lindsays-upcoming-reality-show", "title": "Dina Lohan Drops More Details on Lindsay\u2019s Upcoming Reality Show", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The tentatively titled Lohan Beach Club will be a family affair.", "id": "5b5f5d448544340c1874eb4f", "keywords": "style,celebrity", "news_keywords": "style,celebrity", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b5f5d448544340c1874eb4f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The tentatively titled Lohan Beach Club will be a family affair.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e433368540bfc7d26fe/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e433368540bfc7d26fe/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The tentatively titled Lohan Beach Club will be a family affair.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e433368540bfc7d26fe/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Dina Lohan Drops More Details on Lindsay\u2019s Upcoming Reality Show", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/dina-lohan-drops-more-details-on-lindsays-upcoming-reality-show"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The tentatively titled Lohan Beach Club will be a family affair.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b5f5e433368540bfc7d26fe/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Dina-Jill-Lohan-Affair.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Dina Lohan Drops More Details on Lindsay\u2019s Upcoming Reality Show"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
