In fact, the Dubai concert at the Autism Rocks arena was not a charity event but part of Sir Elton\u2019s Wonderful Crazy Night Tour. It was cancelled on doctor\u2019s orders because of an unavoidable medical procedure which prevented international travel. We did not intend to suggest that he had misled people about his reasons for the cancellation. We apologise for any such impression and have agreed a payment to charity and costs.\"\n\nWatch the legendary Sir Elton performing live below:", "images": ["https://www.pressparty.com/assets/usericon/londonnewsdesk/small/1481911707.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/mod/mobile_theme/graphics/facebook_link_alt_3.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209497/1587131705", "https://www.pressparty.com/action/newsdesk/iconoverride?post_guid=164195&lastcached=1487334832", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209698/1587130820", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209377/1586949324", "https://www.pressparty.com/mod/mobile_theme/graphics/email_link_alt_3.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209670/1587114314", "https://www.pressparty.com/mod/pressparty_theme/graphics/logo_hr.png", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/usericon/eltonjohn/medium/1529509201.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/usericon/londonnewsdesk/medium/1481911707.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209461/1587039284", "https://www.pressparty.com/mod/epk/graphics/rightbutton.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209204/1587116333", "https://www.pressparty.com/mod/mobile_theme/graphics/twitter_link_alt_3.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209651/1587112393", "https://www.pressparty.com/_graphics/spacer.gif", "https://www.pressparty.com/mod/epk/graphics/leftbutton.jpg", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209683/1587116052", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209386/1586970245", "https://www.pressparty.com/assets/epk/newsdesk/209383/1586969613"], "top_img": "https://www.pressparty.com/action/newsdesk/iconoverride?post_guid=164195&lastcached=1487334832", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/eltonjohn/view/164195/", "title": "The Daily Mail publishes apology to Sir Elton John for misleading public: Pressparty", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Pressparty 2009-2020", "robots": "noimageindex", "bitly-verification": "6ea23ad60de9", "og": {"title": "The Daily Mail publishes apology to Sir Elton John for misleading public: Pressparty", "type": "website", "url": "https://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/eltonjohn/view/164195/", "image": "https://www.pressparty.com/action/newsdesk/iconoverride?post_guid=164195&lastcached=1487334832", "site_name": "Pressparty"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "HawniPT9I6i9sLg_OSoxpX2SDz1IgIw5XZXaslkQwKo", "description": "Britain's Daily Mail newspaper has published a public apology to music icon Sir Elton John for insinuating in a previous article that he had", "keywords": "music,news,pressparty,music news,london,united kingdom,uk,elton,john,sir elton john,charity,concert,the daily mail,2017,interview", "canonical": "https://www.pressparty.com/pg/newsdesk/eltonjohn/view/164195/", "twitter": {"site": "@pressparty"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.pressparty.com", "summary": ""}
