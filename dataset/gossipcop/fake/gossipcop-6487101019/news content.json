She was taking shots backstage last night and drinking at the afterparty.\u201d\n\nAnother source spoke to Hollywood Life and added: \u201cAt this point, Rihanna feels like all she can do is laugh off all the pregnancy rumors, in addition to just ignoring them now. She is not pregnant, and she is not even trying to get pregnant either at this point.\u201d\n\nRihanna on her way to 1OAK nightclub ? A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalririr8) on Jan 29, 2018 at 4:15am PST\n\nHowever, there will be little Riri or Hassan in the future.\n\nThe insider shared: \u201cWould she like children in the future? Yes, but definitely in the future, she is simply not ready to start a family\u2026 just yet. Rihanna loves children though, she is a natural mom, and she thinks Hassan will make an amazing father \u2014 he is really kind and patient, and a very loving person \u2014 but right now she is focused on her career first and foremost.

If RiRi thick, I\u2019m thick too, darnnit. Is Rihanna Pregnant? Asking for a friend! She looks great thick.Waiting for her to announce that she is pregnant.\u201d\n\nAnother commenter wrote: \u201cSo we just gonna ignore that fact that Riri looked a little thicker than usual in that skin tight dress she performed with DJ Khaled. She looks pregnantWhy does she keep holding her tummy??? Is she pregnant???\u201d\n\nRihanna\u2019s ex-boyfriend, Chris Brown, had an odd reaction to the rumors: \u201cChris always had high hopes for their future together, and even though there are only rumors that she could be pregnant with some other guy\u2019s baby, he is still pretty upset and sad to hear about it. He feels like that should be his baby.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommenters say that Brown should move on.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tamar-Braxton-The-Real-Interview-Rumors-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mel-Walker-60x60.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kaitlynn-Carter-BoxClue.com_-300x199.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-aeko-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chris-Brown-Ammika-5-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Pregnancy-Rumors.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/corey-feldman-and-corey-haim-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-vz.cnwimg.com--300x237.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Rihanna-Chris-Brown-Pregnancy-Rumors.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mel Walker", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/rihanna-is-laughing-at-those-pesky-pregnancy-rumors-but-chris-brown-is-hurt-110176/", "title": "Rihanna Is Laughing At Those Pesky Pregnancy Rumors, But Chris Brown Is Hurt", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Mel Walker", "news_keywords": "chris brown, rihanna,", "keywords": "celebrity news, chris brown, rihanna,", "description": "It seems that Rihanna has decided to respond to the rumors that she is expecting a baby with boyfriend Hassan Jameel.
