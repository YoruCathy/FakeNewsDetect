The Duchess of Cambridge has made it no secret that she\u2019s unhappy with her current situation at home.\n\nIn a new Heads Together clip with Prince William and Prince Harry, Kate Middleton hints that she\u2019s done having children. She struggled so much after the birth of her first child, Prince George. Kate recalled how she wasn\u2019t prepared for all the life changes that come after having your first child. During Kate\u2019s heartfelt confession, William sat next to her in silence.\n\n\u201cHaving a child, particularly your first child, is such a life-changing moment,\u201d Kate said in the clip. \u201cNothing can really prepare you for that. Remember the first few days with little George, you have no idea what really you are doing, no matter how many books you read, nothing can prepare you for it.\u201d\n\nKate Middleton has made it no secret that she often feels lonely and isolated at home. Clearly, she doesn\u2019t have many close friends to turn to. And, it doesn\u2019t look like Prince William is helping their situation, either. Kate\u2019s supposedly been using a secret account on the popular mom forum Mumset for advice on how to parent her two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, at home.\n\nOften times she finds herself butting heads with her husband simply because of their different backgrounds and upbringings. Simply put, Kate Middleton doesn\u2019t want her children to have the same, stiff royal upbringing that Prince William experienced. She wants to be more hands-on with her children.\n\nBut if Kate can\u2019t handle raising two kids on her own, there\u2019s simply no way that she\u2019ll manage three small children under the age of 5. That might be the reason why she\u2019s saying no to a third pregnancy. She doesn\u2019t want to be left alone, angry and frustrated with the struggles of raising small children while her husband goes off on one of his ski trips with his pals.\n\nThen again, the only two people who really know what\u2019s going on behind closed doors are of course the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge themselves. So far Buckingham Palace has not made any comments about Kate Middleton\u2019s future plans.
