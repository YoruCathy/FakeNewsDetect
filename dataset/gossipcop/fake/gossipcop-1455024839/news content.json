Clooney and her husband George were our favorite couple from the evening, and she stunned in a shiny floral print strapless gown with a long flowing train and trousers.\n\nAmal Clooney at the 2018 Met Gala on May 7, wowing everyone. But she wasn't done yet.

She sat at the table next to Rihanna, who took our breath away in her beaded gown.\n\nAmal Clooney (with husband George) in her second Met Gala dress, a red Tom Ford creation that evoked stained glass. Backgrid\n\n\"You sell this at the gift shop?\" Colbert wondered incredulously. \"I thought it was just astronaut ice cream and paperweights.\"\n\nApparently not. As Wintour noted, there's just one way you can get away with doing that.\n\n\"Only if you're Amal Clooney,\" she said.\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201805/tdy_style_jenna_met_gala_180508_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510_fd212d0e0564a868fdc46a2cbe24d51a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510_fd212d0e0564a868fdc46a2cbe24d51a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/amal-clooney-changed-dresses-during-met-gala-museum-gift-shop-t128704", "title": "Amal Clooney changed dresses during the Met Gala in the museum gift shop", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/style/amal-clooney-changed-dresses-during-met-gala-museum-gift-shop-t128704", "title": "You'll never guess where Amal Clooney changed dresses at the Met Gala", "description": "It's not just \"astronaut ice cream and paperweights\" in there.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510_fd212d0e0564a868fdc46a2cbe24d51a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510_fd212d0e0564a868fdc46a2cbe24d51a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510_fd212d0e0564a868fdc46a2cbe24d51a.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "You'll never guess where Amal Clooney changed dresses at the Met Gala", "description": "It's not just \"astronaut ice cream and paperweights\" in there.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Our favorite couple at the 2018 Met Gala was George and Amal Clooney.
