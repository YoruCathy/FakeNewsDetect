To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx\u2019s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they\u2019re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors \u201cone hundred percent not true.\u201d Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned about society today is that they\u2019re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they\u2019re so thirsty to find any story\u2026 Sometimes when you read the stuff you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow! That\u2019s so not true!\u2019\u201d Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not something I want to answer.\u201d\n\nDespite JamKat\u2019s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they\u2019ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx\u2019s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx \u201cis very happy with [Holmes].\u201d Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, \u201cI have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them together. He\u2019s never told me he\u2019s dating her.\u201d\n\nStill, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie\u2019s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston\u2019s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That\u2019s because Foxx and Holmes\u2019 intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes\u2019 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.\n\nLong before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior\u2014the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.\n\nOne of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney\u2019s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise\u2019s second marriage: \u201cI was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.\u201d\n\nAccording to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige\u2014a good friend of Cruise\u2019s\u2014became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney\u2019s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige\u2019s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, \u201cauditing\u201d Cruise, and \u201cre-educating\u201d the couple\u2019s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.\n\nA 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, \u201cThe organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: \u2018What do you think of Tom Cruise?\u2019\u201d The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: \u201cIn a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.\u201d\n\nWhen Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement \u201cspecifically about Cruise,\u201d claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: \u201cBy the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology\u2019s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise \u2018wants someone with her own power\u2014like Nicole.\u2019 When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.\u201d (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment prior to publication.)\n\nBy April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s couch.\n\nAccording to journalist Tony Ortega, who\u2019s covered the church since 1995, \u201cKatie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.\u201d Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress\u2019 Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, \u201cJessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.\u201d Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples\u2019 six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise\u2019s best man at his and Holmes\u2019 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that \u201chis wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,\u201d in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.\n\nAs The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise\u2019s young daughter, Suri: \u201cWhen Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org\u2014an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a \u2018billion-year contract.\u2019\u201d Cruise and Holmes\u2019 hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri\u2019s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn\u2019t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in \u201cmore than 1,381 days.\u201d This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church\u2019s practice of \u201cdisconnecting\u201d congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.\n\nA RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx\u2019s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, \u201cKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she\u2019s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,\u201d the source continued. \u201cKatie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms\u2014and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.\u201d\n\nAnd the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes\u2019 bizarre ex.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504827191/170907-zimmerman-holmes-cruise-tease_xjskrn", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504827191/170907-zimmerman-holmes-cruise-tease_xjskrn"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504827191/170907-zimmerman-holmes-cruise-tease_xjskrn", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-holmes-long-road-to-freedom-from-tom-cruise", "title": "Tom Cruise\u2019s Strange Hold Over Katie Holmes: From Scientology Minders to the \u2018Dating Ban\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Tom Cruise\u2019s Strange Hold Over Katie Holmes: From Scientology Minders to the \u2018Dating Ban\u2019", "keywords": "Church of Scientology, Nicole Kidman, Scientology, Tom Cruise, David Miscavige, Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx", "og": {"title": "Tom Cruise\u2019s Strange Hold Over Katie Holmes: From Scientology Minders to the \u2018Dating Ban\u2019", "description": "Rumors have surfaced that a five-year \u2018dating ban\u2019 has finally ended, allowing Holmes and beau Jamie Foxx to date publicly.
