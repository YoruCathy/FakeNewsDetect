{"url": "time.com/5017724/taylor-swift-reputation-explained/", "text": "Taylor Swift\u2019s sixth studio album Reputation finally dropped, after months of hype. With 15 tracks, produced with pop hitmakers Max Martin, Shellback and Jack Antonoff, Swift\u2019s latest addition to her catalogue appears to mine her past and her present for material, switching moods between unapologetic love letter and defiant clapback. It\u2019s all sung over a series of synth-heavy beats, and sprinkled with tinges of 80s pop, catchy dubstep drops and dance-ready hooks. Read on for our analysis of each song of the new Reputation era.\n\n1. \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d: Starting things off with a thumping bass line and rallying cry, \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d also offers one of Swift\u2019s prettiest melodies. \u201cIn the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do,\u201d she sings sweetly before switching into her new-era rap-singing. \u201cHe can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor,\u201d she insists, name-checking a famous \u2014 and drama-filled \u2014 pairing, and setting the scene for the rest of the album\u2019s investigation of the perils of stardom.\n\n2. \u201cEnd Game\u201d (featuring Ed Sheeran and Future): Swift tapped her good friend Sheeran for this slow-jam-style track, a self-reflective \u2014 and self-aware \u2014 plea to both the listener and a lover. \u201cI wanna be your end game,\u201d Swift sings off the top, allowing in a little vulnerability \u2014 before jumping into a rap-sung chorus. \u201cBig reputation, you and me we got big reputations,\u201d she chants, recognizing the baggage that her stardom brings (and name-checking the album\u2019s title, of course). Of-the-moment rapper Future of \u201cMask Off\u201d success adds in a slick verse, sticking to the love-against-the-odds theme. Swift goes on to sing she doesn\u2019t want to be an \u201cex-love\u201d and that she isn\u2019t into the drama; it\u2019s just her burden to bear.\n\nThis is peak Swift: emotionally open, but ready and willing to have some fun with the hype around her own persona. Sheeran\u2019s contribution comes in the form of another rap-sung verse in the same vein, seeming to reference his own relationship and the pitfalls that fame has placed in his path to love. His advice? Ignore the rumors.\n\n3. \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d: Swift knows that her critics have strong opinions about her; after all, the album is called Reputation. And in the bombastic \u201cI Did Something Bad,\u201d she appears to address some of the narratives that have surrounded her. \u201cI never trust a narcissist, but they love me / So I play them like a violin, and I make it look oh so easy,\u201d she opens this one over a sharp string pluck. \u201cIf a man talks s\u2013t then I owe him nothing.\u201d Here is new-era Swift: holding her head high, unapologetic and fiercely protective of her own success.\n\nThen, a funky dubstep drop brings shades of her mega-hit \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d into the mix. Heavily electronically manipulated, and punctuated with a strong beat, it\u2019s a banger of a track \u2014 and her defiant response to her detractors. \u201cI never trust a playboy, but they love me,\u201d she insists, stating matter of-factly that it\u2019s best to \u201cleave before you get left,\u201d and hinting that maybe her splashy former relationships weren\u2019t all they might have seemed. And then there\u2019s the kicker: \u201cThey\u2019re burning all the witches, even if you aren\u2019t one,\u201d she croons on an auto-tuned bridge. \u201cGo ahead and light me up.\u201d Of all the quotable lines in Swift\u2019s oeuvre, this one is right up there at the top for its blazing imagery.\n\n4. \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d: If you\u2019re a fan of Avicii or Kygo\u2019s brand of un-rushed atmospheric electro-pop, you might like the rich, vibey notes Swift brings together in \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me,\u201d a moody, dark song that starts out swinging and pretty, and builds into a gospel-backed EDM anthem. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me, love made me crazy / if it doesn\u2019t you ain\u2019t doin\u2019 it right,\u201d she sings emphatically. \u201cLord save me, my drug is my baby, I be using for the rest of my life.\u201d Swift has endured criticism for her relationships: the fact that she\u2019s in them, the fact that she sings about them. \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d could be a clapback to that criticism, reminding listeners that the heart simply wants what it wants, as her friend Selena Gomez once said.\n\n5. \u201cDelicate\u201d: Swift is, appropriately enough, at her most fragile on \u201cDelicate.\u201d Refreshingly honest, it\u2019s a melodic electro-ballad with a resonant refrain. \u201cMy reputation\u2019s never been worse so, you must like me for me,\u201d she muses, her voice a light wisp, in a wry nod to her year in the spotlight before breaking down her insecurities: \u201cIs it cool that I said all that? Is it too soon to do this yet?\u201d Like pretty much anyone dealing with a new crush, Swift sings of moments of doubt. Perhaps even superstars have their sore spots. She couches this sweetly uncertain song in snippets of dates \u2014 at a dive bar, in her apartment \u2014 but keeps it about her circular internal monologue, always questioning just how much her feelings are being reciprocated.\n\n6. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d: Swift\u2019s lead single \u2014 and immediate chart-topper following its release \u2014 \u201cLWYMMD\u201d was a shocking reintroduction to the Swift of Reputation: hard, unapologetic, focused on retribution. Step aside, \u201cBad Blood,\u201d this song is much more cutting. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined,\u201d she reminded her haters over a Right Said Fred sample. The propulsive beat and insistence that the old Taylor was \u201cdead\u201d only sharpened her point.\n\n7. \u201cSo It Goes\u2026\u201d: Here, she switches things back to romance, reflecting on just how a new love interest might help her out of her fixations: \u201cyou make everyone disappear,\u201d she explains in the moody, murky opening segment, which opens into a trap-lite chorus about getting caught up in the moment (and, of course, leaving some signature lipstick \u201con your face\u201d). But for life with Swift, that\u2019s just how it goes. \u201cI\u2019m yours to keep, and yours to lose. You know I\u2019m not a bad girl, but I\u2019ll do bad things with you,\u201d she adds with a wink; this version of Swift has made a marked departure from her squeaky-clean roots as America\u2019s Nashville sweetheart.\n\n8. \u201cGorgeous\u201d: Yes, that\u2019s Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\u2019s baby daughter James opening up \u201cGorgeous\u201d with a gurgle. But the rest of the song deals with adult topics. Over a bubbling, chime-like beat, Swift sings about the irresistible power of attraction \u2014 even when it\u2019s not the best idea. \u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous, it actually hurts,\u201d she sings with frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I hate more than what I can\u2019t have.\u201d Despondent, she talks of heading home to hang out with her cats \u2014 and then, with a wink, invites her object of attention to join her.\n\n9. \u201cGetaway Car\u201d: Told as a dramatic story of a heist and an ill-fated love adventure over shimmering 80s-style production, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d is one of Swift\u2019s most metaphor-driven tracks on the album. \u201cWe never had a shotgun shot in the dark,\u201d she sings with a rebellious twang. \u201cNothing good starts in a getaway car.\u201d Swift\u2019s has often had its fair share of melodrama; remember \u201cInto the Woods\u201d? In \u201cGetaway Car,\u201d though, she calls herself a \u201ctraitor\u201d who turns in her erstwhile partner in crime. Looks like Swift might be willing to flirt with the dark side, but she\u2019s no good at following through with crimes \u2014 of the legal kind, or of the heart. Instead, she says, she takes the keys and leaves the guy stranded at a motel. It\u2019s no happy ending, but it\u2019s a reminder that Swift isn\u2019t afraid to assert her independence.\n\n10. \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d: Taylor Swift has always been good at love songs. In \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d she hits her sweet spot, over a synth-heavy track and strategic auto-tune assist. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine, I live on my own, I made up my mind I\u2019m better off bein\u2019 alone,\u201d she starts off. But it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long; after meeting a (evidently non-American) paramour who pursues her, the story (and the song) go straight into the romance. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I have been waiting for,\u201d she gushes, dissing some other guys with \u201ctheir fancy cars\u201d who didn\u2019t quite measure up to this new interest. And yes, the character in the title is indeed the king of her heart \u2014 and body, and soul.\n\n11. \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied\u201d: Although it starts off as a down-tempo, melancholy kind of tune, \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied\u201d adds in Swift\u2019s now-rote trap-lite drop to amp up the drama on this will-we-won\u2019t-we tale of star-crossed lovers separated by an unkind fate. \u201cI had a bad feeling,\u201d she suggests about the romantic interest, but she goes on to dance with him anyway; some chemistry just can\u2019t be denied.\n\n12. \u201cDress\u201d: \u201cI only bought this dress so you could take it off,\u201d Swift sings slyly on \u201cDress,\u201d her most overtly sexual work yet. She wants her lover to carve his name into her bedpost; her hands shake in anticipation. A breathy, synth-y track with lots of whispery vocals, Swift is unequivocal about her interest in this person as much more than a friend. \u201cMade your mark on me; a golden tattoo,\u201d she sings cryptically. It\u2019s a departure from her usually PG approach to love songs, emblematic of a Swift who\u2019s claiming her maturity more than ever.\n\n13. \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d: Kicking things off with a siren sound, Swift strips it back to a stomping call-out of the haters, a giddy sister of sorts to dark lead single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to rain on my parade?\u201d she asks, her voice petulant, sneering with humor and attitude. \u201cThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things, darling: because you break them, I have to take them away.\u201d When she tries to go diplomatic \u2014 \u201cforgiveness is a nice thing to do\u201d goes one line, sung in an angelic lilt \u2014 she breaks the fourth wall with a burst of sharp laughter. Swift is no longer willing to \u201cShake It Off,\u201d as she once tried to do.\n\n14. \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d: Maybe the most by-the-book Swift song on Reputation, \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d is a slow-burning meditation on the transformative power of relationships, filled with lyrical puns: \u201cAll the liars are calling me one,\u201d she sighs at one point. \u201cAll my flowers grew back as thorns.\u201d But this is still a love letter, and a reminder that Swift has moved on from the fray around her so-called \u201creputation.\u201d \u201cMy baby\u2019s fly like a jetstream, high above the whole scene,\u201d she sings proudly, making it clear that the baby in question has taken her along for the ride.\n\n15. \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d: Her one acoustic piano ballad on the album, \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d is a tender and intimate love song. The snapshots are sweet and evocative: glitter on the floor after a party, candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor, holding hands in the backseat of a taxi. \u201cHold on to the memories,\u201d she repeats in the chorus, \u201cand I will hold on to you.\u201d Nostalgic for the moment even as it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a lovely, effecting closer, letting Swift\u2019s voice and earnest message shine without the complications of over-production. She may get her kicks with big pop anthems, but vulnerable ballads like this one are just as much a part of her musical DNA.\n\nGet The Brief.
