Social media compared Meghan to Julia Roberts\u2018s character in Pretty Woman and according to the Daily Mail, the entire ensemble was sold out in two days.\n\nPrior to royal life, the duchess embodied a breezy style \u2014 even for her first public appearance with Harry, she wore torn blue jeans from Mother (which the brand reissued due to the \u201cinsanely high demand\u201c) and a white button-down shirt from Misha Nonoo.\n\nHowever, since her wedding, she\u2019s been side-eyed by some fashionistas. Social media dismissed her two wedding dresses by Givenchy and Stella McCartney as \u201cbaggy.\u201d And they called the blue-and-white Oscar de la Renta dress she wore to the June wedding of Harry\u2019s cousin Celia McCorquodale \u201cfrumpy.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Meghan is still honing her wardrobe. \u201cOver the next year, Meghan will have more designers throwing themselves at her, and she will adapt her style,\u201d British designer Caroline Castigliano told the publication. \u201cIt will be fabulous when she takes everything she learns and \u2018Meghan-izes\u2019 it.\u201d\n\n102 PHOTOS Meghan Markle's style transformation See Gallery Meghan Markle's style transformation DEAL OR NO DEAL Season 2 Pictured: Meghan Markle (Photo by Paul Drinkwater/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank) Meghan Markle attends COACH Legacy Photo Exhibit by REED KRAKOFF at Coach on August 26, 2006 in East Hampton, NY.
