Chelsea Handler and Jennifer Aniston were long time BFFs and did everything that best friends would do, including hate each others ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, and ex-husbands\u2019 new partners.\n\nIn fact, Handler has been especially vitriolic towards Angelina Jolie in the past, publicly speaking out against Jolie for \u2018stealing\u2019 Brad Pitt away from Jennifer Aniston. Yes, it takes two people to break up a marriage, but Handler always reserved her vitriol for Angelina Jolie, much like the rest of Jennifer Aniston\u2019s close-knit BFF crew (albeit none as vocally as Chelsea Handler).\n\nHowever, Chelsea and Jennifer have allegedly had a falling out recently, as they\u2019ve barely spent any time together and are clearly (and visibly) on the outs with each other. Some reports claim that this is because Chelsea has been spilling secrets about Jennifer\u2019s marriage to Justin Theroux, and others claim that it was just them naturally growing apart. Regardless, Chelsea\u2019s already gone as far as to find a new BFF in Charlize Theron, and Jennifer? Well, she\u2019s busy with her new husband and working hard to reboot her TV career.\n\nAs this has all been happening, a new report from Radar Online claims that Chelsea has been in the process of replacing her friendship with Jennifer Aniston with another relationship \u2013 this time with Jennifer\u2019s ex, Brad Pitt! Radar\u2019s source explains, \u201cChelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer; she always blamed Angelina Jolie for the nasty split. But now that she isn\u2019t friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad. Chelsea has long been a fan of Brad\u2019s Plan B production company and is talking with them about a few projects.\u201d\n\nPlan B is one of the most prolific production companies in town, and has won several Oscars over the past few years. As such, any working actor or actress would jump at the chance to work with them, ex-best friends and ex-grudges aside. It\u2019s likely that Chelsea Handler cozying up to Brad Pitt has little to do with getting back at Jennifer Aniston for cutting off their friendship, and more to do with her own career movement.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Will Chelsea Handler forget all about her ex-best friend Jennifer Aniston to work with Jennifer\u2019s ex-husband and the man that she spent years dumping on, Brad Pitt? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images", "images":
