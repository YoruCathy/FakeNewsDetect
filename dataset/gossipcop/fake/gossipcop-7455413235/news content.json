hit show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nKim and Khloe\u2019s younger half-sister Kylie Jenner is also reportedly pregnant, due in January with boyfriend Travis Scott\u2019s baby.\n\nKim (L) is

child\u2019s arrival, including a pregnancy coach to help her make sure she\u2019s eating right and staying healthy, but also a whole new team to help expand her empire.\n\nThe Kardashian could soon be expanding (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\nThis is in addition to extra security, according to Radar Online. \u2018Kylie hired a pregnancy coach too, who will help her with nutrition and exercise, as well as
