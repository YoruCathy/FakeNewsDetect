Tweeters started posting photos of famous TV and movie characters who also dealt with evil (or at least misguided) fathers. The caption? \"Why I Disagree With My Dad.\"\n\nFrom Luke Skywalker to Sally Draper, take a look at the hilarious responses below.\n\nWHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD pic.twitter.com/XWsCpCB0Re \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) June 7, 2017\n\nWHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD pic.twitter.com/gGZlK2FmlQ \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) June 7, 2017\n\nWHY WE DISAGREE WITH OUR DAD pic.twitter.com/A0B1dcv73y \u2014 Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) June 7, 2017\n\nFine, I'll do it, too:\n\n\n\nWhy I Disagree With My Dad pic.twitter.com/BGslhNFCo6 \u2014 Mike Sacks (@MikeSacksEsq) June 7, 2017\n\nWHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD pic.twitter.com/WrEYUKMhbE \u2014 Timmy Metzner (@timmymetzner) June 7, 2017\n\nWHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD @laurenduca pic.twitter.com/rsSai80q3s \u2014 Ask Jeeves (@DominicLeFevre) June 7, 2017\n\nWHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD\n\n\n\n(yes, I know some of them support him \ud83d\ude44) pic.twitter.com/NBDoDlh9XI \u2014 Anais Galang (@AnaGalang) June 7, 2017\n\nWHY I DISAGREE WITH MY DAD pic.twitter.com/LsufTaiBTT \u2014 Daily Trix (@DailyTrix) June 7, 2017\n\nWhy I disagree with my dad pic.twitter.com/xtSellMJl4 \u2014 Meg (@meganflockhart) June 7, 2017\n\nWhy I disagree with My Dad pic.twitter.com/TT47mJwdPY \u2014 Kyle S \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@ktsthegame) June 7, 2017\n\n\"Why I Disagree With My Dad\" pic.twitter.com/xDzZjPg7ZJ \u2014 Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) June 7, 2017\n\n'Why I Disagree With My Dad' pic.twitter.com/lqoJCjKHKX \u2014 seiZedd tesla & spacex to mass produce ventilators (@Zeddary) June 7, 2017\n\nWhy I Disagree With My Dad pic.twitter.com/tkJKbsP50f \u2014 Mallory Huntington (@mallegory) June 7, 2017\n\nWhy I Disagree With My Dad pic.twitter.com/ByOXRo6Rxj \u2014 Paul F.
