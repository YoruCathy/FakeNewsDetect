But, is ex mentioned him in TWO tracks! Here\u2019s what he thinks \u2026\n\nTom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, \u201cReputation\u201c. But, come on, Tom; anyone\u2019s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks \u2014 \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d and \u201cGetaway Car\u201d. And, since the pair didn\u2019t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would\u2019ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.\n\n\u201cTom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor\u2019s album,\u201d a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe thought they were on good terms,\u201d our insider says, adding, \u201cAfter their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone\u2019s saying she did and he\u2019s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.\u201d Well, maybe next time, Tom.\n\nAs soon as Taylor\u2019s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here\u2019s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201ctalks sh-t.\u201d Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a \u201cplayboy\u201d who she flew \u201caround the world\u201d with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.\n\nThe second Tom reference on \u201cReputation\u201d came on the track, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn\u2019t have a \u201creason.\u201d Then, when she goes to an event where \u201cthe ties were black and the lights were white,\u201d she found her reason \u2014 a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala\u2026 the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn\u2019t work out, and that the person [Tom] should\u2019ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.\n\nTaylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue\u2018s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.\n\nHollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor\u2019s new album?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F11%2F10%2Ftom-hiddleston-taylor-swift-album-song-ex-relationship-reputation-lyrics%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2865129&comment_count=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tom-hiddleston-song-about-him-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tom-hiddleston-song-about-him-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/10/tom-hiddleston-taylor-swift-album-song-ex-relationship-reputation-lyrics/", "title": "Tom Hiddleston Stunned Taylor Swift Referenced Him On New Album: Here\u2019s Why", "meta_data": {"description": "Tom Hiddleston didn't expect to be referenced on Taylor Swift's new album, and when he was, he was stunned!
