I would NEVER pay my boyfriend ANY sort of allowance, nor would he EVER accept if I offered.\"\n\n\"He BUYS his own stuff whether it's for me or himself, and he more than pulls his weight for our life,\" she continued. \"I HATE fake news, but I guess that's what our world has come to. Get your sh*t straight. I don't support anyone, and I don't need anyone to support me.\"\n\n\"He's got a full career (including something huge that's new) and works hard for it. He's not just someone's boyfriend,\" Winter concluded. \"So if you don't know us, don't comment. Xoxo.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Winter has found herself defending her relationship with Meaden. Last month, the 19-year-old actress opened up about those criticizing her relationship with the actor, who is 10 years her senior.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Ariel Winter Clarifies Recent Quotes About Boyfriend Levi Meaden: 'I Don't Need to Defend Anything'\n\n\"I don\u2019t understand why someone would even comment on our situation at all,\" she told Refinery 29. \"There are tons of people of all ages that live with their boyfriend. There are tons of people that live with their girlfriends, [and] tons of people that don\u2019t live together and are super happy. But I\u2019m super happy in the arrangement that we have. We love living together. It\u2019s just great.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-01/1280_Ariel_Winter_levi_meaden_Getty_AlbertoRodriguez_633034626.jpg?itok=AbW-YdQM", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_Ariel_Winter_levi_meaden_Getty_AlbertoRodriguez_633034626.jpg?itok=3PrC2Z6x", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/gettyimages-692085362.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=TnqSx9El"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_Ariel_Winter_levi_meaden_Getty_AlbertoRodriguez_633034626.jpg?itok=3PrC2Z6x", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220093_ariel_winter_slams_tabloid_reports_that_she_gives_her_boyfriend_an_allowance", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Tabloid Reports That She Gives Her Boyfriend an Allowance", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Tabloid Reports That She Gives Her Boyfriend an Allowance | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220093_ariel_winter_slams_tabloid_reports_that_she_gives_her_boyfriend_an_allowance", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Tabloid Reports That She Gives Her Boyfriend an Allowance", "description": "The 19-year-old actress says her boyfriend, Levi Meaden, 'works hard' for his own money.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_Ariel_Winter_levi_meaden_Getty_AlbertoRodriguez_633034626.jpg?itok=3PrC2Z6x", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 19-year-old actress says her boyfriend, Levi Meaden, 'works hard' for his own money.", "title": "Ariel Winter Slams Tabloid Reports That She Gives Her Boyfriend an Allowance", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220093_ariel_winter_slams_tabloid_reports_that_she_gives_her_boyfriend_an_allowance", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_Ariel_Winter_levi_meaden_Getty_AlbertoRodriguez_633034626.jpg?itok=3PrC2Z6x"}, "description": "The 19-year-old actress says her boyfriend, Levi Meaden, 'works hard' for his own money.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Ariel Winter", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
