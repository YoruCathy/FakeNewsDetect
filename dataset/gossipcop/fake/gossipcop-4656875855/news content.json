{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "text": "English association football player and model\n\nDavid Robert Joseph Beckham [4] ( ;[5] born 2 May 1975) is an English former professional footballer, the current president of Inter Miami CF and co-owner of Salford City.[6] He played for Manchester United, Preston North End, Real Madrid, Milan, LA Galaxy, Paris Saint-Germain and the England national team, for which he held the appearance record for an outfield player until 2016. He is the first English player to win league titles in four countries: England, Spain, the United States and France. He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career, during which he won 19 major trophies.[7][8]\n\nBeckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.[9] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[9] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[10] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[11] In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[12] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with Milan in 2009 and 2010. He was the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[9] In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996 at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[13][14] He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cup tournaments, in 1998, 2002 and 2006, and two UEFA European Championship tournaments, in 2000 and 2004.\n\nKnown for his range of passing, crossing ability and bending free-kicks as a right winger, Beckham has been hailed as one of the greatest and most recognisable midfielders of his generation, as well as one of the best set-piece specialists of all time.[15][16] He was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or in 1999, twice runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year and in 2004 was named by Pel\u00e9 in the FIFA 100 list of the world's greatest living players.[17][18][19] He was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2008. A global ambassador for the sport, Beckham is regarded as a British cultural icon.[20][21]\n\nBeckham has consistently ranked among the highest earners in football, and in 2013 was listed as the highest-paid player in the world, having earned over $50 million in the previous 12 months.[22] He has been married to Victoria Beckham since 1999 and they have four children.[23] He has been a UNICEF UK ambassador since 2005, and in 2015 he launched 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund.[24] In 2014, MLS announced that Beckham and a group of investors would own Inter Miami CF, which began play in 2020.[25]\n\nEarly life\n\nBeckham was born at Whipps Cross University Hospital in Leytonstone, London, England.[26] He is the son of Sandra Georgina (n\u00e9e West; b. 1949), a hairdresser, and David Edward Alan \"Ted\" Beckham (b. Edmonton, London, 1948), a kitchen fitter, who married in the London Borough of Hackney in 1969.[27] He has an older sister, Lynne Georgina, and a younger sister, Joanne Louise. He regularly played football in Ridgeway Park, Chingford, as a child, and attended Chase Lane Primary School and Chingford County High School.[28] In a 2007 interview, Beckham said that, \"At school whenever the teachers asked, 'What do you want to do when you're older?' I'd say, 'I want to be a footballer.' And they'd say, 'No, what do you really want to do, for a job?' But that was the only thing I ever wanted to do.\"[29] Beckham's maternal grandfather was Jewish,[30] and Beckham has referred to himself as \"half Jewish\"[31] and wrote in his autobiography \"I've probably had more contact with Judaism than with any other religion\".[32] In his book Both Feet on the Ground, he stated that growing up he attended church every week with his parents, because that was the only way he could play football for their team.[33]\n\nHis parents were fanatical Manchester United supporters who frequently travelled to Old Trafford from London to attend the team's home matches. David inherited his parents' love of Manchester United, and his main sporting passion was football. He attended one of Bobby Charlton's football schools in Manchester and won the chance to take part in a training session with Barcelona, as part of a talent competition. He played for a local youth team called Ridgeway Rovers, which was coached by his father, Stuart Underwood, and Steve Kirby. Beckham was a Manchester United mascot for a match against West Ham United in 1986. Young Beckham had trials with his local club Leyton Orient, Norwich City and attended Tottenham Hotspur's school of excellence. Tottenham Hotspur was the first club he played for. During a two-year period in which Beckham played for Brimsdown Rovers' youth team, he was named Under-15 Player of the Year in 1990.[34] He also attended Bradenton Preparatory Academy, but signed schoolboy forms at Manchester United on his 14th birthday, and subsequently signed a Youth Training Scheme contract on 8 July 1991.[35]\n\nClub career\n\nManchester United\n\n1991\u20131994: Youth and early career\n\nHaving signed for Manchester United as a trainee on 8 July 1991,[36] Beckham was part of a group of young players, including Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who were coached by Eric Harrison, and helped the club win the FA Youth Cup in May 1992. Beckham scored Manchester United's second goal in the 30th minute of their 3\u20131 first-leg win of the final against Crystal Palace on 14 April 1992. In the second leg on 15 May, Beckham played a full 90-minutes of the fixture which ended 3\u20132 in favour of Manchester United and 6\u20133 on aggregate. Beckham's impact led to a first-team debut on 23 September 1992, as a substitute for Andrei Kanchelskis in a League Cup match against Brighton & Hove Albion. Shortly afterwards, Beckham signed as a professional on 23 January 1993.[36]\n\nManchester United again reached the final of the FA Youth Cup, where they faced Leeds United. The first leg was played on 10 May 1993, where Beckham started in Manchester United's 2\u20130 home loss but was replaced by substitute Robbie Savage. In the second leg on 13 May 1993, Beckham played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United's 2\u20131 defeat, which gave Leeds United a 4\u20131 aggregate score. Beckham also received honours with the club's reserve team when the squad won the league in 1994. In September 1994, Beckham made his first full appearance in the club's first team against Port Vale in a League Cup fixture. On 7 December 1994, Beckham made his UEFA Champions League debut, scoring a goal in a 4\u20130 victory at home to Galatasaray in the final game of the group stage. Despite the victory, however, they finished third out of four in their group, behind Barcelona.[37]\n\n1994\u20131995: Loan to Preston North End\n\nBeckham then went to Preston North End on loan for part of the 1994\u201395 season to get some first team experience. He impressed, scoring two goals in five appearances, notably scoring directly from a corner kick.[38]\n\n1995\u20131996: Return to United and first Championship\n\nBeckham returned to Manchester and made his Premier League debut for Manchester United on 2 April 1995, in a goalless draw against Leeds United. He played four times for United in the league that season, as they finished second behind Blackburn Rovers, missing out on a third successive Premier League title by a single point. He was not in the squad for the FA Cup final with Everton on 20 May, which United lost 1\u20130, leaving the club without a major trophy for the first time since 1989.[39]\n\nUnited manager Sir Alex Ferguson had a great deal of confidence in the club's young players. Beckham was part of a group of young talents Ferguson brought into United in the 1990s (known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\"), which included Nicky Butt and Gary and Phil Neville. When experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis left the club after the end of the 1994\u201395 season, his decision to let youth team players replace them instead of buying star players from other clubs (United had been linked with moves for players including Darren Anderton, Marc Overmars and Roberto Baggio, but no major signings were made that summer), drew a great deal of criticism. The criticism increased when United started the season with a 3\u20131 defeat at Aston Villa,[40] with Beckham scoring United's only goal of the game. However, United recovered from this early season defeat and the young players performed well.[41]\n\nBeckham swiftly established himself as United's right-sided midfielder (rather than a right-winger in the style of his predecessor Andrei Kanchelskis) and helped them to win the Premier League title and FA Cup double that season, scoring the winner in the semi-final against Chelsea and also providing the corner from which Eric Cantona scored in the FA Cup Final. Beckham's first title medal had, for a while, looked like it would not be coming that season, as United were still 10 points adrift of leaders Newcastle United at the turn of the new year, but Beckham and his teammates had overhauled the Tynesiders at the top of the league by mid March and they remained top until the end of the season. Despite playing regularly and to a consistently high standard for Manchester United, Beckham did not break into the England squad before Euro 1996.[42]\n\n1996\u20131998: First-choice and inheriting No. 7 shirt\n\n\"It changed my life. The ball seemed to be in the air for hours and it all went quiet. Then the ball went in and it just erupted. I was on cloud nine.\" \u2014Beckham on the goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon in August 1996 that made him a household name.[43] It was ranked number 18 on Channel 4\u2019s poll of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[44]\n\nAt the beginning of the 1996\u201397 season, Beckham was given the number 10 shirt that had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With United leading 2\u20130, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line \u2013 60 yards out \u2013 that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.[45]\n\nHis goal celebration for the 60-yard strike saw him raise his arms and walk away smiling rather than run as he often would.[46] In a UK poll conducted by Channel 4 in 2002, the British public voted the goal No.18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[44] In a 2016 Sky Sports poll it was ranked the best opening day goal in Premier League history.[46] During the 1996\u201397 season, Beckham became an automatic first-choice player at Manchester United, helping them to retain the Premier League title, and was voted PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers.[47] Prior to the 1997\u201398 season, Beckham inherited the number 7 shirt, a number previously worn by such United legends as George Best and Eric Cantona.[48] Manchester United started the season well but erratic performances in the second half of the season saw United finish second behind Arsenal.[49]\n\n1998\u20131999: Treble\n\nIn the 1998\u201399 season, he was part of the United team that won the treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League, a unique feat in English football.[50] There had been speculation that the criticism that he had received after being sent off in the World Cup would lead to him leaving England, but Beckham decided to stay at Manchester United.[51]\n\nTo ensure they would win the Premier League title, United needed to win their final league match of the season, at home to Tottenham. There were reports suggesting that the opposition would allow themselves to be beaten to prevent their local rivals Arsenal from retaining the title, but Tottenham took an early lead in the match.[50] Beckham scored the equaliser with a curling strike from 25 yards out into the top left corner of the goal and United went on to win the match and the league.[50]\n\nBeckham played in central midfield in United's win over Bayern Munich in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final, since United's first string centre-midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane were suspended for the match.[50] United were losing the match 1\u20130 at the end of normal time, but won the trophy by scoring two goals in injury time. Both of the goals came from corners taken by Beckham.[50] Those crucial assists, coupled with great performances over the rest of the season, led to him finishing runner up to Rivaldo for 1999's European Footballer of the Year and FIFA World Player of the Year awards.[52]\n\n1999\u20132000: Another Championship\n\nDespite Beckham's achievements in the 1998\u201399 season, he was still unpopular among some opposition fans and journalists, and he was criticised after being sent off for a deliberate foul in Manchester United's World Club Championship match against Necaxa. It was suggested in the press that his wife was a bad influence on him, and that it might be in United's interests to sell him,[53] but his manager publicly backed him and he stayed at the club. During the 1999\u20132000 season, there was a talk of a transfer to Juventus in Italy, but this never happened. Beckham helped United retain the Premier League title in 1999\u20132000 by an 18-point margin, after being pushed by Arsenal and Leeds United for much of the season. United won their final 11 league games of the season, with Beckham scoring five goals during this run, with his last goal coming from a swerving shot from the edge of the penalty area in their final home game against Tottenham Hotspur.[54]\n\n2000\u20132001: Troubled relationship with Ferguson\n\nBy the early 2000s, the relationship between Ferguson and Beckham had begun to deteriorate, possibly as a result of Beckham's fame and commitments away from football. In 2000, Beckham was given permission to miss training to look after his son Brooklyn, who had gastroenteritis, but Ferguson was furious when Victoria Beckham was photographed at a London Fashion Week event on the same night, claiming that Beckham would have been able to train if Victoria had looked after Brooklyn that day. He responded by fining Beckham the maximum amount that was permitted (two weeks' wages \u2013 then \u00a350,000) and dropping him for a crucial match against United's rivals Leeds United. He later criticised Beckham for this in his autobiography, claiming he had not been \"fair to his teammates\"[55] Beckham had a good season for his club, though, and helped United to win the Premier League by a record margin.\n\n\"He was never a problem until he got married. He used to go into work with the academy coaches at night time, he was a fantastic young lad. Getting married into that entertainment scene was a difficult thing \u2013 from that moment, his life was never going to be the same. He is such a big celebrity, football is only a small part.\"' \u2013 Alex Ferguson speaking about Beckham's marriage in 2007.[56]\n\nHe was a key player in United's third successive league title in 2000\u201301, only the fourth time that any club had achieved three league titles in a row. He scored nine goals that season, all in the Premier League.\n\n2001\u20132002: Contract extension\n\nOn 10 April 2002, Beckham was injured during a Champions League match against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, breaking the second metatarsal bone in his left foot. There was speculation in the British media that the injury might have been caused deliberately, as the player who had injured Beckham was Argentine Aldo Duscher, and England and Argentina were due to meet in that year's World Cup.[57] The injury prevented Beckham from playing for United for the rest of the season and they missed out on the Premier League title to Arsenal (also being knocked out of the Champions League by Bayer Leverkusen on away goals in the semi-finals), but he signed a three-year contract in May, following months of negotiations with the club, mostly concerning extra payments for his image rights. The income from his new contract, and his many endorsement deals, made him the highest-paid player in the world at the time.[58] Despite the injury, 2001\u201302 was arguably Beckham's best season as a United player; he scored 11 goals in 28 league games, and a total of 16 goals in 42 games in all competitions, the best of his career.\n\n2002\u20132003: Boot incident and United exit\n\nFollowing an injury early in the 2002\u201303 season, Beckham was unable to regain his place on the Manchester United team, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r having replaced him on the right side of midfield. His relationship with his manager deteriorated further on 15 February 2003 when, in the changing room following an FA Cup defeat to Arsenal, a furious Alex Ferguson threw[59][60][61][62][63][64] or kicked a boot that struck Beckham over the eye, causing a cut that required stitches. The incident led to a great deal of transfer speculation involving Beckham, with bookmakers offering odds on whether he or Ferguson would be first to leave the club.[65] Although the team had started the season badly, their results improved greatly from December onwards and they won the league, with Beckham managing a total of 11 goals in 52 games in all competitions. He was still a first-choice player for England, however, and was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to football on 13 June 2003.[66]\n\nBeckham had made 265 Premier league appearances for United and scored 61 goals. He also made 81 Champions league appearances, scoring 15 goals. Beckham won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups, one European Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FA Youth Cup in the space of 12 years. By this stage, he was their joint second longest serving player behind Ryan Giggs (having joined them at the same time as Nicky Butt, Gary Neville and Paul Scholes).\n\nReal Madrid\n\n2003\u20132004: Becoming a Gal\u00e1ctico\n\n\"He is a great player who is going to become part of the club's great history. He is a man of our times and a symbol of modern-day stardom and what is certain is Real Madrid have signed Beckham because he's a great footballer and a very dedicated professional. His team spirit is unsurpassed and he is one of the best English players of all-time and if only because of that he is with us.\" \u2014Real Madrid President Florentino P\u00e9rez during Beckham's unveiling.[67]\n\nAs the summer 2003 transfer window approached, Manchester United appeared keen to sell Beckham to Barcelona[68] and the two clubs even announced that they reached a deal for Beckham's transfer,[69] but instead he joined reigning Spanish champions Real Madrid for \u20ac37 million on a four-year contract.[70] Beckham was the latest signing in the Gal\u00e1cticos era of global stars signed by club president Florentino P\u00e9rez every summer.[71] The news came as a bitter blow to the newly elected Barcelona president Joan Laporta, who based much of his presidential campaign on signing Beckham.[72] Though announced in mid-June, the transfer was completed on 1 July 2003, making him the third Englishman to play for the club, after Laurie Cunningham and Steve McManaman. Following a successful medical on 2 July, Beckham was unveiled in front of 500 accredited journalists from 25 countries at Real's basketball facility, where he was handed the famous white shirt by club legend Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[73] Although Beckham had worn the number seven shirt for Manchester United and England, he was unable to wear it at Madrid as it was assigned to club captain Ra\u00fal. He decided to wear number 23 instead, citing his admiration of basketball player Michael Jordan, who also wore the number 23 shirt, as the reason behind his decision.[74]\n\nBeckham (top) and Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid in August 2003\n\nIn the week before Beckham's presentation, Real named Carlos Queiroz as their new head coach, meaning that Beckham was reunited with a familiar face upon arriving to Madrid, since Queiroz had spent the previous season as Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United. In late July 2003, the club went on a tour of the Far East as part of pre-season training, but also to cash in on Beckham's huge marketing appeal in Asia, where he enjoyed tremendous following. Real's brand recognition in that part of the globe was already well established as the club made financially successful trips to Asia during previous off-seasons. The presence of a global marketing icon such as Beckham, however, made this particular tour a financial smash for los Merengues.[75]\n\nShortly after his transfer to Real, Beckham also ended his relationship with agent Tony Stephens of SFX Europe, who had guided him through his career until that point, including helping to engineer Beckham's move from Manchester to Madrid. Beckham signed on with Simon Fuller and his company 19 Entertainment, which already managed the career of Victoria.[76] Beckham also appointed close friend Terry Byrne to be his personal manager.[77][78]\n\n\"We knew before he was a good player, but we did not expect him to be such an influential player, to show such commitment to the team spirit. The way he runs for everything, the way he tries his best. He has everyone's respect.\" \u2014Ronaldo speaking about Beckham in October 2003.[79]\n\nIn late August 2003, Real Madrid won the Spanish Super Cup over two legs versus RCD Mallorca, with Beckham scoring the final goal in a 3\u20130 return leg win at home, thus setting the stage for the start of the league season. Playing in a star-laden team which included three former FIFA World Player of the Year recipients, Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and Lu\u00eds Figo, in addition to Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal and Iker Casillas, Beckham did not require much time to settle in, scoring five times in his first 16 matches (including a goal less than three minutes into his La Liga debut). Queiroz mostly favoured the adaptable 5\u20133\u20132 formation, with two fullbacks M\u00edchel Salgado and Roberto Carlos, often joining the attack down the wings, while Beckham played on the right of the three-man midfield, alongside Zidane and Figo.[80]\n\nReal Madrid were runners-up in the Copa del Rey, were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League at the quarter-final stage and finished the league season in fourth place, meaning the team, whose president P\u00e9rez expected them to win either the Spanish league or the Champions League each season, did not match expectations. In July 2004, while Beckham was in pre-season training in Spain, an intruder scaled a wall at the Beckham home while carrying a can of petrol. Victoria and their children were in the house at the time, but security guards apprehended the man before he reached the house.[81]\n\n2004\u20132005: Managerial changes\n\nThe league season began with new head coach Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho at the helm, but he ended up lasting only three matches, handing in his resignation as Real dropped to eighth spot in the La Liga standings. Camacho's assistant Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n took over on temporary basis as Real's leadership scrambled to find a permanent replacement. Beckham made more headlines on 9 October 2004 when he admitted intentionally fouling Ben Thatcher in an England match against Wales to get himself booked. Beckham was due to receive a one-match suspension for his next caution, and had picked up an injury which he knew would keep him out of England's next match, so he deliberately fouled Thatcher to serve his suspension in a match that he would have had to miss anyway. The Football Association asked Beckham for an explanation of his actions and he admitted that he had \"made a mistake\" and apologised.[82] He was sent off shortly afterwards, this time in a league match for Real Madrid against Valencia. Having received a yellow card, he was judged to have sarcastically applauded the referee and was given a second yellow card, causing an automatic dismissal, although the suspension was cancelled on appeal.\n\nBy Christmas 2004, with the team sitting in second position in the league, Garc\u00eda Rem\u00f3n was dismissed, and Vanderlei Luxemburgo became the new head coach. However, the well-travelled Brazilian failed to inspire the team to the title as Real again finished the season in second position. On 3 December 2005, Beckham was sent off for the third time that season in a league match against Getafe CF. A day later Luxemburgo was sacked and was replaced by Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro. By the end of that season, Beckham led La Liga in number of assists.\n\n2005\u20132006: Another unsuccessful season\n\nBeckham warming up with Real Madrid in August 2006\n\nDuring the season, Beckham established football academies in Los Angeles and east London and was named a judge for the 2006 British Book Awards.[83] Real Madrid finished second to Barcelona in the 2005\u201306 La Liga, albeit with a large 12-point gap, and only reached the last 16 in the Champions League after losing to Arsenal. The season also marked the end of an era for the club as P\u00e9rez resigned his post as president in January 2006, with Vicente Boluda named as replacement on an interim basis until the end of the season.\n\n2006\u20132007: Real Madrid exit\n\nThe summer 2006 off-season marked a turbulent time as the club's presidential elections were held. Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n became the new Real president. As expected, none of the club officials who served under the previous president was kept, including head coach L\u00f3pez Caro. Initially out of favour with newly arrived head coach Fabio Capello, Beckham started only a few games at the beginning of the season, as the speedier Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes was normally preferred on the right wing. Of the first nine matches Beckham started, Real lost seven. On 10 January 2007, after prolonged contractual negotiations, Real Madrid's sporting director Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 announced that Beckham would not remain at Real Madrid after the end of the season. However, he later claimed that he was mistranslated and that he actually said that Beckham's contract had not yet been renewed.[84]\n\nOn 11 January 2007, Beckham announced that he had signed a five-year deal to play for the LA Galaxy beginning 1 July 2007. On 13 January 2007, Fabio Capello said that Beckham had played his last game for Real Madrid, although he continued to train with the team.[85] A few days later, while speaking to the students at Villanueva University Center in Madrid, Calder\u00f3n said that Beckham is \"going to Hollywood to be half a film star\", adding \"our technical staff were right not to extend his contract, which has been proved by the fact that no other technical staff in the world wanted him except Los Angeles\".[86]\n\nAbout a month later, however, Capello backtracked on his earlier statement, allowing Beckham to rejoin the team for the match against Real Sociedad on 10 February 2007. The player immediately repaid his head coach's trust by scoring the equalising goal from a 27-yard free kick, as Real Madrid eventually recorded a 2\u20131 victory.[87] In his final UEFA Champions League appearance for the club, Real Madrid were knocked out of the competition by Bayern Munich at the round-of-16 stage (on the away goals rule) on 7 March 2007. Beckham played a pivotal role in all three Madrid goals in the home game, with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn describing his performance as \"world class\".[88]\n\nBeckham during his last season with Real Madrid\n\nOn 17 June 2007, the last day of the La Liga season, Beckham started in his final match for the club, a 3\u20131 win over Mallorca which saw them clinch the title from Barcelona. With Real down 0\u20131, Beckham limped off the field and was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, who scored two goals, leading the team to that season's La Liga title, their first since Beckham had signed with them and 30th overall in the club's history. Although Real and Bar\u00e7elona both finished level on points, Madrid took the title because of their superior head-to-head record, capping a remarkable six-month turnaround for Beckham.[89] With his wife and children, along with celebrity friends Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, watching from a luxury box at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium, it was only Beckham's second piece of silverware since he joined the famous club.[89]\n\nTowards the end of the season, as Beckham was getting back into Capello's good books after successfully fighting his way back into the first team, Real Madrid announced they would try to untie his transfer to LA Galaxy, but were ultimately unsuccessful.[90] Several weeks before Beckham's scheduled arrival in the United States, Real's management contacted LA Galaxy's ownership group about reacquiring the player, but were quickly turned down.[91]\n\nA month after the conclusion of Beckham's Real career, Forbes magazine reported that he had been the party primarily responsible for the team's huge increase in merchandise sales, a total reported to top US$600 million during Beckham's four years at the club.[92]\n\nLA Galaxy\n\n2007: The American Dream\n\nI'm coming there not to be a superstar. I'm coming there to be part of the team, to work hard and to hopefully win things. With me, it's about football. I'm coming there to make a difference. I'm coming there to play football ... I'm not saying me coming over to the States is going to make soccer the biggest sport in America. That would be difficult to achieve. Baseball, basketball, American football, they've been around. But I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't think I could make a difference.[93] Beckham on going to America\n\n\n\nBeckham's involvement with Major League Soccer (MLS) began while he was still a Real Madrid player when it was confirmed on 11 January 2007 that he would be leaving Madrid in six months to join MLS side LA Galaxy. The speculation about his new contract in Madrid was thus put to an end and the following day Beckham's official press conference was held in conjunction with the 2007 MLS SuperDraft.[94]\n\nBeckham scores his first goal for LA Galaxy with a trademark free-kick.\n\nThe announcement made global headlines and elevated the league's profile. Though many worldwide media outlets reported the deal to be worth US$250 million,[95] the astronomical figure was soon revealed to be something of a PR stunt engineered by Beckham's media handlers (British representative agency 19 Entertainment).[96] To maximise the media effect, in the press release they decided to list the potential sum that Beckham could make over the five-year period from all his revenue sources, which in addition to his Galaxy pay also include his personal endorsements. Beckham's actual deal with the Galaxy was a five-year contract worth US$32.5 million in total or $6.5 million per year.[77][97]\n\nThe high-profile acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy long before Beckham joined the team. On the strength of the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20 million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home stadium, the Home Depot Center).[98] LA Galaxy owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) also reported an immediate spike in business. Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as Shanghai and Beijing, where the company had been working aggressively for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums. The company's CEO Tim Leiweke put it as follows: \"Suddenly, we're known as the company that owns the team that David Beckham is going to play for, so our world changed\".[99]\n\nIn the months following the announcement, the additional terms of Beckham's contract became public knowledge. One unique contract provision was giving him the option of buying an MLS expansion franchise in any market except New York City at the fixed price of $25 million whenever he stopped playing in the league[100] \u2013 an allowance that the league's owners had never given to a player before. Another provision was the opt-out clause after the 2009 season, meaning that should he decide so, Beckham was free to leave the club after completing year three of his five-year contract.[98] The league had a salary cap in place, requiring the creation of the Designated Player Rule for Beckham to bypass the cap; the rule was later nicknamed in his honor. In April 2007, he and wife Victoria bought an $18.2 million home on San Ysidro Drive in Beverly Hills.[101]\n\nBeckham (with a blue captain's armband) became LA Galaxy captain immediately upon joining the team\n\nBeckham's contract with LA Galaxy took effect on 11 July, and on 13 July, the Englishman was officially unveiled as a Galaxy player at the Home Depot Center to much fanfare and world media interest in front of more than 5,000 gathered fans and some 700 accredited media members.[102] Beckham chose to wear number 23. It was announced that Galaxy jersey sales had already reached a record figure of over 250,000 prior to this formal introduction.[103]\n\nIn parallel, Beckham's handlers at 19 Entertainment succeeded in putting together an unprecedented US media rollout designed to expand his carefully crafted personal brand in America. He made the cover of Sports Illustrated, a few weeks earlier Adidas launched the extensive 13-part ad campaign \"F\u00fatbol meets Football\" starring Beckham and NFL running back Reggie Bush, and W magazine published a racy photo spread featuring David and wife Victoria photographed by Steven Klein. Meanwhile, ESPN sports network was running a promotional campaign and it also agreed to air David Beckham: New Beginnings documentary produced by 19 Entertainment before the friendly match versus Chelsea, which was expected to be Beckham's American debut. In addition to popularising soccer, Beckham's arrival was used as platform for entertainment industry endeavours. Since both Beckham's and his wife's often overlapping careers were handled by 19 Entertainment, which is owned by Simon Fuller, who in turn has a business relationship with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA), one of Hollywood's most powerful talent agencies, it was important also for CAA that the Beckhams made as big an impact as possible upon their arrival in the United States. On 16 July, CAA had hosted a welcoming bash for David at its new eight-storey, $400 million headquarters in Century City with CAA employees reportedly instructed beforehand to line the staircase and clap for Beckham upon his arrival.[104] That night Victoria's reality show prime-time special Victoria Beckham: Coming to America aired on NBC, drawing negative reviews in the press and poor viewership ratings.[105]\n\nBeckham during a LA Galaxy game in November 2007\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, 21 July, despite still nursing the injured left ankle that he picked up a month earlier during the final match of La Liga's season, Beckham made his Galaxy debut, coming on for Alan Gordon in the 78th minute of a 0\u20131 friendly loss to Chelsea as part of the World Series of Soccer.[106] With a capacity crowd, along with a long Hollywood celebrity list featuring Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Eva Longoria, Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Drew Carey among others, present at the Home Depot Center, the match was broadcast live on ESPN's main network. However, the proceedings on the field of play took a back seat to the Beckham spectacle, and despite the presence of worldwide football stars such as Andriy Shevchenko, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, and Frank Lampard, the US television cameras were firmly focused on Beckham who spent most of the match on the bench. The match's added time featured a scare for already injured Beckham when he got tackled by Steve Sidwell whose cleats struck Beckham's right foot, sending him airborne before he crumpled hard to the ground. Though the existing injury was not aggravated too much, Beckham's recovery process was set back by about a week. ESPN's presentation of Beckham's debut earned a 1.0 TV rating, meaning it was seen in an average of 947,000 television homes in the US \u2013 a disappointing figure given the national media buzz and two weeks of constant promotion by ESPN.[101] As far as sporting events that were televised that weekend in the United States, Beckham's much publicised debut drew fewer TV viewers than British Open golf tournament, a regular-season national baseball game, and even the Indy Racing League's Honda 200 motor race.[101]\n\nThe day after the made-for-TV debut was reserved for the welcoming party for the Beckhams at LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, formally billed as being hosted by Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, and Jada Pinkett Smith though in actuality a CAA-organized event. Attended by many Hollywood A-listers, the lavish bash was big news in the US celebrity tabloid media, including daily entertainment TV magazines such as Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[107]\n\nBeckham missed the next four LA Galaxy matches \u2013 three in the North American SuperLiga and an MLS game away at Toronto FC though he still made the trip with his teammates, sitting on the bench in street clothes. It was in Toronto on 5 August that the team got its first taste of what life would be like on the road with Beckham on the roster. Due to security concerns, it was the first time the team flew on a charter for a road match, rather than flying commercial (MLS normally forbids charter flights for away matches, claiming they provide competitive advantage, but in this case they made an exception due to the frenzy created around Beckham and resulting security issues). Also, instead of the usual MLS-mandated modest hotels, LA Galaxy stayed at the five-star Le M\u00e9ridien King Edward in downtown Toronto (an expense paid for by the local Toronto promoter), while the glitz and glamour continued with the velvet rope, red carpet party at the Ultra Supper Club with Beckham as the centerpiece guest.[108]\n\nBeckham playing for LA Galaxy in March 2008\n\nTwo weeks after his 12-minute appearance against Chelsea, Beckham made his league debut as a substitute on 9 August away versus D.C. United in front of the sellout crowd of 46,686 (nearly three times the average D.C. United home crowd) at the RFK Stadium, coming on for Quavas Kirk in the 71st minute.[109] Coming into the nationally televised match on ESPN, played under a heavy downpour with his team down a man and down a goal, Beckham left a mark during the remaining 20-plus minutes. He hit a long free kick that Carlos Pav\u00f3n failed to finish on for the equaliser, and then in the final minutes Beckham served a weighted through ball into Landon Donovan's path that United's keeper Troy Perkins managed to break up in the last moment \u2013 the Galaxy lost 1\u20130. The next match on the road trip was at New England Revolution and Beckham decided to sit it out, fearing further aggravating his ankle injury on the Gillette Stadium's artificial surface.\n\nBeckham returned to the pitch the following week, again facing D.C. United, in the SuperLiga semi-final on 15 August. During this game he had many firsts with the Galaxy; his first start, first yellow card and first game as team captain.[110] He also scored his first goal for the team, from a free kick, and also made his first assist, for Landon Donovan in the second half. These goals gave the team a 2\u20130 victory, and a place in the North American SuperLiga final versus Pachuca on 29 August.\n\nDuring the SuperLiga final against Pachuca, Beckham injured his right knee, with an MRI scan revealing that he had sprained his medial collateral ligament and would be out for six weeks. He returned to play in the final home match of the season. The Galaxy were eliminated from playoff contention on 21 October, in the final MLS match of the season, a 1\u20130 loss to the Chicago Fire. Beckham played as a substitute in the match, bringing his season totals to eight matches played (5 league); one goal scored (0 league); and three assists (2 league).\n\n2008\n\nBeckham trained with Arsenal from 4 January 2008 for three weeks until he returned to the Galaxy for pre-season training.[111] Beckham scored his first league goal with the Galaxy on 3 April against the San Jose Earthquakes in the ninth minute.[112] On 24 May 2008, the Galaxy defeated the Kansas City Wizards 3\u20131, giving the Galaxy their first winning record in two years and moving the club into first place in the Western Conference. In the match, Beckham scored an empty-net goal from 70 yards out. The goal marked the second time in Beckham's career that he had scored from his own half, the other being a 1996-goal from the half-way line against Wimbledon at Selhurst Park.[113] Overall, however, the Galaxy had a disappointing year, failing to qualify for the end-of-season play-offs.\n\n2009: Loan to A.C. Milan\n\nIn 2008, Beckham's success in the England national team under Fabio Capello led to speculation that he might return to Europe to retain match fitness for the World Cup qualifying matches in 2009. On 30 October 2008, Milan announced that Beckham was to join them on loan from 7 January 2009.[114] Despite this and other speculation, Beckham made it clear that the move in no way signalled his intent to leave MLS and announced his intent to return to the Galaxy in time for the start of the 2009 season in March.[115] Many at Milan both within and outside of the club expressed serious reservations about the transfer, with it considered by some players no more than a marketing move.[116]\n\nBeckham was unveiled at Milan's training facility by the club's chief executive Adriano Galliani on 20 December 2008. The player chose the number 32 shirt previously worn by Christian Vieri, as both the number 7 and 23 shirts were already used by Alexandre Pato and club vice captain Massimo Ambrosini, respectively. The day after his unveiling, Beckham was brought to San Siro where he got introduced to home fans by walking out on the pitch before the league match versus Udinese and proclaiming \"Forza Milan\" over the public address system.[117] Afterwards, he and wife Victoria watched from a luxury box as Milan won 5\u20131.[118]\n\n\"On the pitch, Beckham sees everything before everyone else. His vision of play is better now than during his time in Manchester. He is slower but much stronger tactically and technically. He is very intelligent and works a lot.\" \u2014A.C. Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti on Beckham's condition at 33 years old.[119]\n\nPlaying on the squad led by the 26-year-old superstar Kak\u00e1 in addition to several other world-class players at or near the peak of their careers \u2013 28-year-old Ronaldinho, and 29-year-old Andrea Pirlo \u2013 as well as club veterans Paolo Maldini, Clarence Seedorf, Massimo Ambrosini, Giuseppe Favalli, Gianluca Zambrotta, Filippo Inzaghi and Andriy Shevchenko, Beckham made his competitive debut for the rossoneri in Serie A as a starter away at Roma on 11 January 2009, playing 89 minutes of the 2\u20132 draw in front of 53,444 at the Stadio Olimpico.[120] Playing his first competitive match in almost three months, Beckham gave a decent performance in right midfield alongside Pirlo. Though clearly lacking match fitness, occasionally struggling to keep up in a high-tempo match, Beckham put in enough useful crosses and corners to justify the coach Carlo Ancelotti's decision to play him from the start.[121] In Beckham's home debut against Fiorentina a week later, he turned in another understated performance on the right side of midfield before advancing into a more active central role in the second half thus effectively taking over Seedorf's role after the Dutchman was subbed off. Milan won 1\u20130 courtesy of Pato, but the 65,000+ San Siro crowd mostly focused on Kak\u00e1, imploring him to stay.[122]\n\nA noticeably older team, Ancelotti-coached Milan was proving a good fit for the 33-year-old Englishman. He scored his first goal in Serie A for Milan in a 4\u20131 victory over Bologna on 25 January, his third appearance for the club.[123] Though Beckham was expected to return to Los Angeles in March, after impressing at the Italian club, scoring two goals in his first four matches and assisting on several more, rumours began to swirl that Beckham would stay in Milan, with the Italian club reportedly offering to pay a multimillion-dollar fee for him. The rumours were confirmed on 4 February, when Beckham stated that he was seeking a permanent transfer to Milan in a bid to sustain his England career through the 2010 World Cup. Milan, however, failed to match Galaxy's valuation of Beckham, in the US$10\u201315 million range.[124]\n\nStill, negotiations continued during a month of speculation.[125] On 2 March, the Los Angeles Times reported that Beckham's loan had been extended through mid-July.[126] This was later confirmed by Beckham, revealing what was described as a unique \"timeshare\" deal, in which Beckham would play with L.A. from mid-July until the end of the 2009 MLS season.[127]\n\n2009: Return to Galaxy\n\nAfter his return from Milan, many LA fans showed dislike and anger towards him as he missed the first half of the season and several held up signs saying \"Go home fraud\", and \"Part-time player\".[128] The Galaxy, however, had a much more successful season than in previous years, rising from third to first in the Western Conference during Beckham's time with them. He remained a key part of the squad which saw Galaxy win the 2009 Western Conference final after a 2\u20130 overtime victory over the Houston Dynamo.[129] In the final on 22 November 2009, the Galaxy lost to Real Salt Lake by 5\u20134 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1\u20131 draw. Beckham also scored in the shootout.[130]\n\n2010: Return to Milan (loan)\n\nIn November 2009, after the end of 2009 MLS season, it was confirmed that Beckham would return to Milan for a second loan period beginning in January 2010.[131] On 6 January 2010, Beckham made a winning return in a Milan shirt, playing 75 minutes of a 5\u20132 victory over Genoa.[132] On 16 February 2010, Beckham played against Manchester United for the first time since he left the club in 2003. He played 76 minutes of the match at the San Siro \u2013 which ended 3\u20132 to Manchester United \u2013 before being substituted for Clarence Seedorf.[133]\n\nBeckham returned to Old Trafford for the second leg of the tie on 10 March 2010; he did not start the match, but was brought on for Ignazio Abate in the 64th minute to a positive reception from the Manchester United fans. The score was 3\u20130 for United at that point and the tie was all but decided. The match was the first time Beckham had played against Manchester United at Old Trafford and saw him create several scoring opportunities via crosses and corner kicks, but Manchester United dominated Milan and beat them 4\u20130, winning the tie 7\u20132.[134] Following the final whistle, he aroused a bit of controversy by draping the green-and-gold scarf around his neck that was given to him by the Manchester United supporters protesting against club owner Malcolm Glazer. As the fan protests against Glazer by the people gathered around Manchester United Supporters' Trust gained steam in 2010, the green-and-gold scarf had come to be seen as an anti-Glazer symbol, and by extension many saw Beckham's decision to publicly put it on as gesture of support. When asked about it later, however, Beckham responded that protests are not his business.[135]\n\nIn Milan's next game, against Chievo, Beckham suffered a torn left Achilles tendon,[136] causing him to miss the World Cup as well as the MLS season due to the injury, which took him out of action for the next five months. Doctor Sakari Orava performed surgery on Beckham's tendon in Turku, Finland, on 15 March 2010.[137] After the operation, Orava affirmed that, \"it went quite fine. The prognosis is he needs a rehabilitation for the next few months, and the plaster cast is the next six to eight weeks. I would say that [it will be] maybe four months before he's running, but six months before he's jumping and kicking.\"[138]\n\n2010: Second return to Galaxy\n\nBeckham in 2010\n\nOn 11 September 2010, after recovering from his Achilles tendon injury, Beckham returned to the game as a substitute in the 70th minute in the Galaxy's 3\u20131 win over Columbus Crew.[139] On 4 October, Beckham scored a trademark free kick in a 2\u20131 win over Chivas USA to mark his first goal in 2010.[140] On 24 October, Beckham scored his second goal of the season in the Galaxy's 2\u20131 win over FC Dallas which secured them their second successive Western Conference title and first MLS Supporters' Shield since 2002.[141]\n\n2011: MLS Cup champion\n\nDuring January and February 2011, ahead of the 2011 MLS season, Beckham trained with Tottenham Hotspur. Rumours in the media claimed that the club were in talks with the Galaxy to sign the player on loan, but, according to Spurs manager Harry Redknapp, the move was blocked by Galaxy, who wanted a full final season from their number 23.[142] As a result, he ended up only training with the club as he had done with Arsenal three years earlier. With Beckham playing in the centre of midfield, the Galaxy won the 2011 MLS cup.[143]\n\nBeckham with LA Galaxy in 2012\n\nOn 15 May, Beckham scored his first goal of the season for the Galaxy from a 30-yard free kick, in a 4\u20131 victory over Sporting Kansas City.[144] On 9 July, Beckham scored directly from a corner in a 2\u20131 win over Chicago Fire, repeating a feat he also achieved while playing for Preston North End.[145]\n\nAfter having his best season with the Galaxy to date and finishing second in the league in assists, Beckham finished his fifth MLS season on a high. On 20 November 2011, he joined an elite group of players to have won league titles in three countries, when Los Angeles won their third MLS Cup against the Houston Dynamo, winning 1\u20130 on a goal by captain Landon Donovan, with assists from Beckham and fellow designated player Robbie Keane.[143][146]\n\n2012: Second successive cup victory\n\nFollowing the 2011 season, in which the Galaxy won their second consecutive Supporters' Shield, having the second most points in MLS history, Beckham's five-year contract with the Galaxy expired on 31 December 2011. Despite being 36, he stated that he did not intend to retire. Beckham was heavily linked with Paris Saint-Germain, but on 18 January 2012, Galaxy announced Beckham had signed a new two-year contract to remain in Los Angeles.[147][148][149][150] In May 2012, Beckham and his victorious teammates were received by President of the United States Barack Obama at the White House.[151]\n\nBeckham helped the Galaxy to a fourth-place finish in the MLS Western Conference 2012 regular season with Beckham scoring seven goals and adding nine assists. The Galaxy defeated Vancouver Whitecaps FC, the San Jose Earthquakes, and Seattle Sounders FC on their way to the MLS Cup final, where they defeated the Houston Dynamo 3\u20131 to retain the cup.[152] He was subbed off in the 89th minute for Marcelo Sarvas and was given a standing ovation at their home venue.[153] Beckham had earlier announced that the 2012 MLS Cup Final would be his final game with the Galaxy despite having another year remaining on his contract.[154][155]\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\n2013: League champion and retirement\n\nOn 31 January 2013, ahead of the transfer deadline it was announced that Beckham would be undergoing a medical with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of a potential move to the Ligue 1 side.[156] Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club later that afternoon and confirmed that his entire salary during his time in Paris would be donated to a local children's charity.[157] His PSG debut came on 24 February 2013, when he came off the bench in the 76th minute in a Ligue 1 home match against Marseille. This made him the 400th player in the history of the club.[158] On 12 May 2013, Beckham won a fourth different top flight winners' medal after PSG beat Lyon 1\u20130 to claim the Ligue 1 title.[159]\n\nOn 16 May 2013, Beckham announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of that year's French football season.[160][161] Following his decision to retire at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, Beckham was given specially designed boots in the colours of the Union Jack to wear in his final game. These boots had the names of his wife and children stitched on to them. On 18 May 2013, Beckham was made captain in his final home game against Brest.[162] In this game, Beckham assisted a goal by Matuidi from a corner. Beckham was subbed after 80 minutes, receiving hugs from his fellow players and manager, as well as a standing ovation from fans.[162] PSG went on to win the game 3\u20131.[162]\n\nInternational career\n\nBeckham made his first appearance for the England national team on 1 September 1996, in a World Cup qualifying match against Moldova.[164] In June 1997, he participated in the Tournoi de France, the friendly international football tournament held in France as a warm-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup.[165]\n\n1998 FIFA World Cup\n\nBeckham had played in all of England's qualifying matches for the 1998 World Cup and was part of the England squad at the World Cup finals in France,[166] but the team's manager Glenn Hoddle publicly accused him of not concentrating on the tournament,[167] and he did not start in either of England's first two games. He was picked for the third game against Colombia and scored with a bending 30-yard free kick in a 2\u20130 victory, which was his first goal for England.[168]\n\nIn the second round (last 16) of that competition, he received a red card in England's match against Argentina.[169] Beckham, after having been fouled by Diego Simeone, kicked Simeone while lying on the floor, striking him on the calf muscle.[169] Sports Illustrated was critical of the Argentinians' theatrics in that incident, stating that Simeone first delivered a \"heavy-handed challenge\" on Beckham and then \"fell like a ton of bricks\" when Beckham retaliated.[170] Simeone later admitted to trying to get Beckham sent off by over-reacting to the kick and then, along with other members of his team, urging the referee to send Beckham off.[171] The match finished in a draw and England were eliminated in a penalty shootout. Many supporters and journalists blamed him for England's elimination and he became the target of criticism and abuse, including the hanging of an effigy outside a London pub, and the Daily Mirror printing a dartboard with a picture of him centred on the bullseye. Beckham also received death threats after the World Cup.[172]\n\nEuro 2000, and England captaincy\n\nThe abuse that Beckham was receiving from English supporters peaked during England's 3\u20132 defeat by Portugal in Euro 2000, a match where Beckham set up two goals, when a group of England supporters taunted him throughout the match.[173] Beckham responded by raising his middle finger and, while the gesture attracted some criticism, many of the newspapers that had previously encouraged his vilification asked their readers to stop abusing him.[174]\n\n\"We've played two and a half minutes of stoppage time. England trail by 2 goals to 1. Beckham could raise the roof here with a goal ... I don't believe it! David Beckham scores the goal to take England all the way to the World Cup Finals! ... Give that man a Knighthood!\" \u2014Television commentary on Beckham's stoppage time 30-yard curling free-kick against Greece in the 2002 World Cup qualifying game in October 2001.[175]\n\nOn 15 November 2000, following Kevin Keegan's resignation as England manager in October, Beckham was promoted to team captain by the caretaker manager Peter Taylor, and then kept the role under new manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson.[176]\n\nBeckham played a major role in helping England qualify for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, starring in an impressive 5\u20131 victory over Germany in Munich. The final step in Beckham's conversion from villain to national hero happened in England's final qualifying game against Greece on 6 October 2001.[177] England needed to win or draw the match to qualify outright for the World Cup, but were losing 2\u20131 with little time remaining. When Teddy Sheringham was fouled eight yards outside the Greek penalty area, England were awarded a free-kick and Beckham ensured England's qualification with a curling strike of the kind that had become his trademark.[177] Beckham was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2001, and finished runner-up, to Lu\u00eds Figo of Portugal, for the FIFA World Player of the Year award.[178]\n\n2002 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2004\n\nBeckham scoring a penalty against Argentina at the 2002 World Cup\n\nBeckham was partially fit by the time of the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea, and played in the first match against Sweden. After the events of four years earlier, Beckham achieved a degree of revenge over Argentina by scoring the winning goal with a penalty, causing Argentina to fail to qualify for the knockout stage.[179] England defeated Denmark in the second round with Beckham providing an assist in a 3\u20130 win. England were knocked out in the quarter-finals by eventual winners Brazil after Ronaldinho scored the winner.[180]\n\nThe following month, at the opening ceremony of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Beckham escorted Kirsty Howard as she presented the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. Beckham played in all of England's matches at Euro 2004. He had a penalty saved in England's 2\u20131 defeat to France and missed another in a penalty shootout in the quarter-final match against Portugal.[181] England lost the shootout thus going out of the competition.[181]\n\nBeckham became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in January 2005 and was involved in promoting London's successful bid for the 2012 Olympic Games.[182] In October 2005, Beckham's sending off against Austria made him the first England captain to be sent off and the first player to be sent off twice while playing for England. He captained England for the 50th time in a friendly international against Argentina the following month.[176]\n\n2006 FIFA World Cup\n\nIn England's opening game at the 2006 World Cup, against Paraguay on 10 June 2006, Beckham's free kick led to an own-goal by Carlos Gamarra as England won 1\u20130. In England's next match, played against Trinidad and Tobago on 15 June 2006, Beckham's cross in the 83rd minute led to a Peter Crouch goal, which put England into the lead 1\u20130. Beckham gave another assist to Steven Gerrard. In the end they won 2\u20130. He was named Man of the Match by tournament sponsor Budweiser.\n\nDuring England's second round match against Ecuador, Beckham scored from a free kick in the 59th minute, becoming the first English player to score in three separate World Cups,[183] and giving England a 1\u20130 victory and a place in the quarter-finals. He was sick before the game and vomited several times as a result of dehydration and illness that he got after having scored the winning goal for England.[183] In the quarter-final against Portugal, Beckham was substituted following an injury shortly after half time and the England team went on to lose the match on penalties (3\u20131), the score having been 0\u20130 after extra time.[184] After his substitution, Beckham was visibly shaken and emotional for not being able to play, being in tears at one point.[185]\n\nA day after England were knocked out of the World Cup, an emotional Beckham made a statement in a news conference that he had stepped down as England captain,[176] stating, \"It has been an honour and privilege to captain my country but, having been captain for 58 of my 95[186] games, I feel the time is right to pass on the armband as we enter a new era under Steve McClaren.\" (Beckham had won 94 caps up to that point.) He was succeeded by Chelsea captain John Terry.[187]\n\nHaving stepped down as captain after the World Cup, Beckham was dropped completely from the England national team selected by new coach Steve McClaren on 11 August 2006. McClaren claimed that he was \"looking to go in a different direction\" with the team, and that Beckham \"wasn't included within that.\"[188] McClaren said Beckham could be recalled in future. Shaun Wright-Phillips, Kieran Richardson, and the World Cup alternative to Beckham, Aaron Lennon, were all included, although McClaren eventually opted to employ Steven Gerrard in that role.\n\nPost 2006 World Cup\n\nOn 26 May 2007, McClaren announced that Beckham would be recalled to the England squad for the first time since stepping down as their captain. Beckham started against Brazil in England's first match at the new Wembley Stadium and put in a positive performance. In the second half, he set up England's goal converted by captain John Terry. It looked as though England would claim victory over Brazil, but newcomer Diego equalised in the dying seconds. In England's next match, a Euro 2008 qualifier against Estonia, Beckham sent two trademark assists for Michael Owen and Peter Crouch, helping England to prevail 3\u20130. Beckham had assisted in three of England's four total goals in those two games,[189] and he stated his desire to continue to play for England after his move to Major League Soccer.\n\nOn 22 August 2007, Beckham played in a friendly for England against Germany, becoming the first to play for England while with a non-European club team.[190] On 21 November 2007, Beckham earned his 99th cap against Croatia, setting up a goal for Peter Crouch to tie the game at 2\u20132. Following the 2\u20133 loss, England failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 Finals. Despite this, Beckham said that he has no plans to retire from international football and wanted to continue playing for the national team.[191] After being passed over by new England coach and Beckham's former manager at Real Madrid, Fabio Capello, for a friendly against Switzerland which would have given him his hundredth cap; Beckham admitted that he was not in shape at the time, as he had not played a competitive match in three months.[192]\n\n100 England caps, final appearance\n\nBeckham lining up a free kick for England in June 2008\n\nOn 20 March 2008, Beckham was recalled to the England squad by Capello for the friendly against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future in his side ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup.[193]\n\nOn 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham \u2013 who wore a pair of golden boots to mark the occasion \u2013 was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision.[194][195] In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match was the first time since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham. In two years, he had gone from being dropped completely from the England squad to being reinstated (though temporarily) as England captain.[196]\n\nDuring the 2010 World Cup Qualifier against Belarus in which England won 3\u20131 in Minsk, Beckham came off the bench in the 87th minute to earn his 107th cap making him England's third-most-capped player in history, overtaking Bobby Charlton in the process. On 11 February 2009, Beckham drew level with Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an English outfield player, coming on as a substitute for Stewart Downing in a friendly match against Spain.[197] On 28 March 2009, Beckham surpassed Moore to hold the record outright when he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Slovakia, providing the assist for a goal from Wayne Rooney in the process.[198] In all, Beckham had made 16 appearances out of a possible 20 for England under Capello until his ruptured Achilles tendon of March 2010 ruled him out of selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[199] His last game for England before injury had been on 14 October 2009 as a substitute in England's last World Cup qualifying game, which ended England 3 \u2013 0 Belarus.[199]\n\nAfter a poor performance from England at the World Cup, Capello remained as manager but was under pressure to revamp the England squad for the imminent UEFA Euro 2012 qualification campaign. He unveiled a new team at the next England match, a home friendly game against Hungary on 11 August 2010, with Beckham still unavailable for selection but aiming for a return to playing in MLS by the following month.[199] In the post-match interview, Capello said of the prospect of the now 35-year-old Beckham playing any future competitive matches for England, that \"I need to change it. David is a fantastic player but I think we need new players for the future\", referring to the new players that play in Beckham's right midfield position, including Theo Walcott and Adam Johnson, adding \"This is the future of the team under Fabio Capello or another manager.\"[199] He said that Beckham may be selected for one last friendly game, stating, \"If he is fit, I hope we will play one more game here at Wembley so the fans can say goodbye.\" In response to the comments, Beckham's agent released a statement reiterating Beckham's position that he had no desire to retire from international football, and would always make himself available for selection for England if fit and if needed.[199] He remained 10 caps short of the record number of 125 caps by goalkeeper Peter Shilton, for a player of any position.[199] Beckham was named in the provisional squad to represent the Great Britain Olympic football team at the 2012 Olympics.[200] He was not included in the final selection by manager Stuart Pearce.[201]\n\nPlayer profile\n\nStyle of play\n\n\"David Beckham is Britain's finest striker of a football not because of God-given talent but because he practises with a relentless application that the vast majority of less gifted players wouldn't contemplate.\" \u2014Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[202]\n\nThroughout his career, Beckham was considered one of the best and most recognisable players of his generation, as well as one of the greatest free kick takers of all time,[15][16] largely due to his range of passing (in particular his ability to produce accurate long balls to his teammates), vision, crossing ability, and bending free-kicks, which enabled him to create chances for teammates or score goals, and allowed him to excel as a right winger, despite his lack of significant pace and his preference for using his stronger right foot.[203][204][205][206][207][208] Although Beckham primarily played on the right flank, he was also used as a central midfielder throughout his career (occasionally with Manchester United, but in particular with Real Madrid and A.C. Milan),[50][80][122][209][210] and on rare instances as a deep-lying playmaker, in particular in his later career, in order to compensate for his physical decline with his advancing age.[211][212] Beckham felt that his best role was on the right, although he personally preferred playing in the centre.[213] In addition to his passing, crossing, and prowess from set-pieces, Beckham also stood out for his stamina and defensive work-rate on the pitch, having played both as an attacking midfielder and as a box-to-box midfielder in his youth;[210][214][215] moreover, he was also an accurate volleyer and striker of the ball from distance,[210][216] as well as being a competent penalty taker.[216][217] He also drew praise in the media for his ball control[218] and ability to create space for himself on the pitch,[219] as well as his anticipation, composure, determination, and intelligence as a footballer.[207][208]\n\nApproach to training and praise from managers\n\nBeckham was a product of Sir Alex Ferguson's hard-working approach at Manchester United. Ferguson noted that Beckham \"practised with a discipline to achieve an accuracy that other players wouldn't care about.\"[203][204][205][206] Beckham reportedly spent hours practising his free kicks after training sessions had ended.[202]\n\n\"What remains in your memory is his genuine commitment and dedication, his natural humility which he always had, that will stay forever.\" \u2014Former Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger.[220]\n\nBeckham maintained his training routine at Real Madrid and even when his relationship with management was strained in early 2007, Real Madrid president Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n and manager Fabio Capello praised Beckham for maintaining his professionalism and commitment to the club.[221][222] Beckham's Real Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos regarded Beckham to be the best free-kick exponent he had ever seen.[223] Two of the best free kick exponents of their generation, Roberto Carlos commented on the dilemma the team faced when they won a free kick on the edge of the penalty area: \"I would stand on one side and Beckham on the other but I wanted to see Beckham take the free-kick because it's beautiful how he hits the ball.\"[223] During Beckham's time with Milan, his manager Ancelotti praised the Englishman for his intelligence and work-rate, in particular the improvements he demonstrated to the technical and tactical aspects of his game, which allowed him to compensate for his loss of pace.[119]\n\nIn May 2013, asked about how he wanted to be remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, \"I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that \u2013 every time I stepped on the pitch \u2013 I've given everything that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I look back on it and hope people will see me.\"[202]\n\nDiscipline\n\nEarlier in his career, Beckham's discipline during matches was brought into question on occasion in the media, due to his temper, as well as his tendency to commit rash challenges and pick up unnecessary bookings.[224][225] Beckham was the first England player ever to collect two red cards, and the first England captain to be sent off.[226] Beckham's most notorious red card was during the 1998 World Cup after Argentina's Diego Simeone had fouled him: Beckham, lying face down on the pitch, kicked out at the Argentine midfielder, who fell dramatically.[169] Along with Wayne Rooney, he holds the record for the most red cards for England at international level.[227] His second red card for England came on 8 October 2005, in a 2006 World Cup qualifier against Austria in Manchester.[228]\n\nHis only red card with Manchester United came on 6 January 2000, in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship against Necaxa.[228] During his time at Real Madrid, he amassed 41 yellow cards and four red cards in La Liga; he also received a red card in a Copa del Rey match against Valencia on 21 January 2004, in Madrid.[228][229] His only red card with LA Galaxy came on 15 August 2009, in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Seattle Sounders in the MLS.[230][231] He received one red card while at Paris Saint-Germain \u2013 picked up in injury time \u2013 in a match against Evian on 28 April 2013.[232] Between 2000 and 2013, Beckham played 572 competitive games for England, Milan, LA Galaxy, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG, and he received nine red cards \u2014 one every 63\u201364 matches, on average.[229]\n\nReception\n\nDespite his success, popularity, and playing ability, critical reception of Beckham was often divided among sporting figures and fans throughout his career, in part \u2013 as Subhankar Mondal of Goal.com notes \u2013 due to his ventures off the pitch and the widespread coverage that his personal life received.[233] His former Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, speculated in 2007 that Beckham's increasing celebrity status, in particular following his highly publicised relationship with his future wife Victoria, had actually had a negative impact on his playing career.[234] In 2015, moreover, he claimed he had only coached four world class players throughout his time at United, excluding Beckham from the list, commenting: \"I don't mean to demean or criticise any of the great or very good footballers who played for me during my 26-year career at United, but there were only four who were world class: Cantona, Giggs, Ronaldo and Scholes.\"[235] Graham Taylor's point of view differed from Ferguson's, however, as he opined: \"[Beckham's] football does not seem to suffer by all of this going on around him. You look at his passing and he makes it look so simple. When he passes the ball, it always seems to go where he wants it to go. That sounds simple, but believe me, it is not.\"[234] A 2010 Bleacher Report article dismissed the notion that Beckham was a world class player, describing him as \"one\u2013dimensional\" and \"overrated.\"[236] Among his critics was Diego Maradona, who praised Beckham for his passing ability in 2000, but also remarked that the Englishman was \"too beautiful to go on to the field.\"[237] In 2008, he expanded on his previous criticism: \"Beckham [...] is just a good player, nothing more. He has a good long-range shot, but he's not a great player. He doesn't belong to the superior group of players. There are hundreds of Beckham's playing football all over the world.\"[238] Frank Leboeuf echoed Maradona's critical views, stating in 2009 that Beckham was \"overrated,\" and credited his \"nice face\" as the reason for his success as a footballer.[239] When asked about Beckham, former Manchester United player George Best once quipped: \"He can\u2019t kick with his left foot, he can\u2019t head, he can\u2019t tackle, and he doesn\u2019t score many goals. Apart from that, he\u2019s alright.\"[234] In a 2013 interview with BBC Radio 5 live, Chris Waddle stated that Beckham was not among the greatest ever players of the English football league system, commenting: \"I would say he has been a good player, I wouldn't put him down as a great. You can go down a list of players from the Premier League or the 70s or 80s, whatever you want to do. I'll be honest, Beckham probably wouldn't be in the first 1,000.\"[240] Prior to Beckham's departure from Real Madrid to the MLS in 2007, the club's president labelled him as a \"half-baked actor, going to Hollywood.\"[241] Upon his departure to LA Galaxy, El Pa\u00eds reflected on the dichotomy of Beckham's playing career and his status off the pitch, describing him as \"the great paradox of world football,\" also adding: \"He is the greatest icon on the planet and the cause of such delirium in the media and on the streets, the greatest catwalk model there is. And yet he has been an anti-diva. He was the most galactic of the galacticos off the pitch, but the greatest of earthlings when he walked on to the field.\"[242]\n\nHowever, Beckham's abilities also earned him numerous plaudits from pundits, players, managers, and other footballing figures alike. Following his arrival at Real Madrid in 2003, the club's president at the time \u2013 Florentino P\u00e9rez \u2013 described Beckham as a \"symbol of modern-day stardom,\" a \"great footballer,\" and as \"a very dedicated professional,\" also lauding him as \"one of the best English players of all-time.\"[67] The following year, Pel\u00e9 included Beckham in his list of the 125 greatest living football players in the world.[18] In 2010, Craig Farrell of Bleacher Report described Beckham as \"one of the best passers of the ball in world football,\" and as \"one of the world's best dead-ball specialists.\" Regarding Beckham's ability from free kicks, Sebastian Larsson said in 2019: \"For me, still to this day, I think David Beckham, when you talk about set pieces, was and is the best I\u2019ve ever seen.\"[244] Regarding Beckham's crossing ability, Rob Smyth of The Guardian said in 2014: \"he was a great crosser and perhaps the greatest of all time,\" also noting that \"He was a dead-ball specialist and also a dying-ball specialist: [...] his signature crosses in open play involved a ball that was barely moving, which allowed him to use the same technique as with corners and free-kicks.\"[245] Upon his retirement in 2013, Tim Daniels of Bleacher Report described Beckham as \"[o]ne of the best playmaking midfielders of his generation.\"[246] His former Real Madrid teammate, Zidane, described Beckham as \"a tremendous player\" who \"contributed so much to the success of Manchester United,\" also labelling him as \"a world-class performer.\" Former Real Madrid player and manager Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano said that \"[Beckham] is a player that doesn't only kick a ball perfectly, he is the first player in the side that goes to pressure his opponents in their side of the pitch \u2013 he was an excellent pressing player. That's what we had the chance to see from him when he played in England. He is a player that has had success playing football, not just selling clothes.\" His former A.C. Milan teammate Paolo Maldini described Beckham as \"a great champion,\" and as \"one of the best players in the world.\" His former PSG teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 instead lauded Beckham's elegance on the pitch, noting that he \"has a quality,\" and \"a touch that I haven't seen many players have.\"[247] Nigel Reed of CBC Sports commented on Beckham's career and celebrity status, stating: \"His brand is global, his appeal universal. He sparked debate and polarized opinion. But underneath the gloss he was, first and foremost, a very good footballer.\" He also added that while he felt that \"Beckham was not the greatest player of his generation,\" he believed that he did have the ability to change games, describing him as \"master of his art and a deadly opponent,\" whose \"talent was only topped by his passion.\"[207] Chris Bascombe of The Telegraph stated in 2013: \"David Beckham will not be remembered as the greatest English footballer of all time, but he may well be this country\u2019s greatest football ambassador,\" also adding: \"He was a very good, often exceptional player. His highlights are plentiful. But since Beckham\u2019s career was strategically constructed to create the ultimate corporate footballer, he has only himself to blame for the cynicism through significant chunks of his career and ho-hum feeling many will have now he has retired.\"[248] In 2017, Gareth Southgate labelled Beckham as one of the group of England's past players who were \"very good,\" but below the likes of the nation's past \"top players,\" such as Gascoigne, Scholes, and Rooney, commenting: \"You've got very good players and then there are top players. In my time in the England setup, Paul Gascoigne, Paul Scholes and Rooney just had that little bit more than all the others. And we are talking high\u2011level people there, players like Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and David Beckham.\"[249] One of England's most decorated players ever, and a member of England's \"golden generation,\"[250] in 2009, Goal.com placed Beckham at number 13 in their list of England's 50 greatest players ever,[251] while in February 2020, Beckham was ranked 29th in FourFourTwo magazine's list of the 100 greatest Premier League players;[252] The Independent instead ranked Beckham at number 21 in their list of the 100 greatest Premier League players.[253] In July 2019, FourFourTwo also ranked Beckham at number 35 in their list of the \"101 greatest football players of the last 25 years.\"[254]\n\nIn addition to his footballing abilities, Beckham has also drawn praise in the media for his leadership, with his former England manager Steve McClaren stating: \"I've been very fortunate to work with some great players and he [Beckham] was one of them. He was a great player, he made the very most of his talents and that was through sheer hard work, professionalism, always doing extra on the training field. He inspired his team-mates through his performances, he was a winner. He was a leader, people followed him.\"[255]\n\nDavid Beckham Academy\n\nBeckham Academy in London\n\nIn 2005, Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy football school, operating from two sites, in London and Los Angeles. It was announced in late 2009 that both would close.[256] A mobile academy is being developed by Beckham, to travel around the UK and further afield.[257]\n\nInter Miami CF\n\nOn 5 February 2014, MLS announced that Beckham had exercised his option to buy a MLS expansion team for $25 million, which he had received as part of the contract he signed with the LA Galaxy in 2007.[100] The ownership group, led by Beckham, originally hoped the Miami-based team would begin play in 2016 or 2017.[25] After delays getting a stadium deal completed, MLS announced in January 2018 that the team had been approved and would likely begin play in 2020.[258] The team name and crest were revealed on 5 September. Club Internacional de Futbol Miami \u2013 more commonly known as, Inter Miami \u2013 is represented by a black crest with neon pink trimmings and herons whose legs clasp to form an \"M\" for Miami.[259][260] In February 2020, David Beckham signed a \u00a3180 million sponsorship deal with Qatar, for Inter Miami CF, which outstripped all the previous sponsorship deals.[261]\n\nThe club made its MLS debut on 1 March 2020 in a 0-1 away loss to Los Angeles FC.[262]\n\nSalford City\n\nIn January 2019 it was announced that Beckham was set to join his Class of '92 teammates as part owner of English non-league club Salford City, taking 10% of the club previously held by Peter Lim,[263] with the deal being subject to Football Association approval. On 31 January, the club announced that the FA had approved him to become a director of the club.[264]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 1997, Beckham started dating Victoria Adams, after she attended a Manchester United match.[265][266][267] She was famously known as \"Posh Spice\" of the pop music group Spice Girls, one of the world's top pop groups at the time, and his team was also enjoying a great run of success. Therefore, their relationship instantly attracted a great deal of media attention. The couple were dubbed \"Posh and Becks\" by the media.[268] He proposed to her on 24 January 1998 in a restaurant in Cheshunt, England.\n\nOn 4 July 1999, they married at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland. Beckham's teammate Gary Neville was the best man,[265] and the couple's infant son, Brooklyn, was the ring bearer.[269] The media were kept away from the ceremony, as the Beckhams had an exclusive deal with OK! Magazine, but newspapers were still able to obtain photographs showing them sitting on golden thrones.[270] 437 staff were employed for the wedding reception, which was estimated to have cost \u00a3500,000.[271]\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham have four children: sons Brooklyn Joseph (born 4 March 1999 at Portland Hospital, London),[272] Romeo James (born 1 September 2002 at Portland Hospital, London),[273] Cruz David (born 20 February 2005 at Ruber International Hospital, Madrid),[274] and daughter Harper Seven (born 10 July 2011 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles).[275] Elton John is godfather to Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham; their godmother is Elizabeth Hurley.[276] Beckham's three sons have all played football in the Arsenal Academy.[277] Like their father, Brooklyn and Romeo have both done modelling work and been named among GQ's best dressed British men.[278] Brooklyn previously played football for Arsenal U16,[277] but was released at the end of the 2014\u201315 season.[279]\n\nIn his early Manchester United career, Beckham lived in a four-bedroom house in Worsley that he bought directly from the property developer as a 20-year-old in 1995.[280] In 1999, shortly after his wedding he and Victoria bought a country house set in 24 acres in Sawbridgeworth, Hertfordshire, which the media nicknamed \"Beckingham Palace\".[281][282]\n\nKnown by the nickname \"Golden Balls\",[283][284] Beckham acquired the name from Victoria, who revealed it on national TV in 2008 while praising him for rebuilding his reputation after the 1998 World Cup.[284][285]\n\nBeckham suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), which he says makes him \"have everything in a straight line or everything has to be in pairs.\" Victoria Beckham claims, \"If you open our fridge, it's all co-ordinated down either side. We've got three fridges \u2013 food in one, salad in another and drinks in the third. In the drinks one, everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans, he'll throw one away because it has to be an even number.\"[286]\n\nIn April 2004, the British tabloid News of the World carried claims by Beckham's former personal assistant Rebecca Loos that he and Loos had an extramarital affair.[287][288] A week later, the Malaysian-born Australian model Sarah Marbeck claimed that she had slept with Beckham on two occasions. Beckham dismissed both claims as \"ludicrous\".[289]\n\nLegal issues\n\nIn September 2010, Beckham announced that he was making a court application against prostitute Irma Nici and several others over claims in the magazine In Touch that he had sex with her.[290] His court application was dismissed under US freedom of speech laws and the magazine later accepted that the allegations against Beckham were untrue.[291][292]\n\nOn 9 May 2019, at Bromley Magistrates Court, Beckham was banned from driving for six months. He previously pleaded guilty to using a mobile phone while driving his Bentley in central London on 21 November 2018. The court heard he was photographed by a member of the public holding a phone as he drove in \"slowly moving\" traffic. Beckham received 6 points on his licence to add to the 6 he already had for previous speeding matters. He was also fined \u00a3750, and ordered to pay \u00a3100 in prosecution costs and a \u00a375 surcharge fee within seven days.[293]\n\nTattoos\n\nAs of 2017 , Beckham had more than 50 tattoos.[294] There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in Sanskrit script because Beckham thought it would be \"tacky\" to have it in English. However, this was misspelt as the equivalent of \"Vihctoria\".[295] In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: \"When you see me, you see the tattoos. You see an expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me.\"[296]\n\nHe has also added several tattoos that pay tribute to his daughter, Harper, as well as several tattoos with religious significance.[297]\n\nIn 2018, Beckham added to his collection with a tattoo of a solar system covering the left side of his scalp.[298]\n\nMany of Beckham's tattoos were completed by renown Manchester-based tattoo artist Louis Molloy, who has claimed that Beckham is the ultimate tattoo customer because he \"picks good stuff, he's got great skin, he feels absolutely no pain.\"[299]\n\nBeckham's fame extends beyond the pitch; in much of the world his name is \"as instantly recognisable as that of multinational companies like Coca-Cola and IBM.\"[300] Beckham's relationship and marriage to Victoria, who has been famous in her own right as part of the Spice Girls, contributed to his celebrity beyond football.\n\nBeckham became known as a fashion icon, and together with Victoria, the couple became lucrative spokespeople sought after by clothing designers, health and fitness specialists, fashion magazines, perfume and cosmetics manufacturers, hair stylists, exercise promoters, and spa and recreation companies. One example is a line of aftershave and fragrances called David Beckham Instinct.[301] In 2002, Beckham was hailed as the ultimate \"metrosexual\" by the man who invented the term[302] and has been described as such by numerous other articles since.[303] The various iconic hairstyles he sported throughout his career \u2013 including a buzz cut, a Mowhawk, and a ponytail \u2013 were widely covered in the media.[304][305]\n\nThe Beckhams were paid $13.7 million in 2007 to launch his fragrance line in the United States[306] In the world of fashion, David has already appeared on the covers of many magazines. United States covers have included the men's magazine Details, and with his wife for the August 2007 issue of W.[307] According to Google, \"David Beckham\" was searched for more than any other sports topic on their site in 2003 and 2004.[308][309] According to Ask Jeeves, Beckham ranked third, after Britney Spears and Osama bin Laden, among subjects most searched for by British users of that site in the first decade of the 2000s.[310]\n\nBeckham with United States First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House, March 2012\n\nUpon their arrival in Los Angeles on 12 July 2007, the night before Beckham's formal introduction, Los Angeles International Airport was filled with paparazzi and news reporters.[311] On the next night, Victoria appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno to talk about their move to LA, and presented Leno with a number 23 Galaxy jersey with his own name on the back. Victoria also talked about her NBC TV show Victoria Beckham: Coming to America.[312] On 22 July, a private welcoming party was held for the couple at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. A-list celebrities attending included Steven Spielberg, Jim Carrey, George Clooney, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Oprah Winfrey.[313]\n\nBeckham's many endorsement deals make him one of the most recognisable athletes throughout the world. Having worn Adidas football boots from the start of his career (notably Adidas Predator), in 2003 he signed a $160 million lifetime contract with Adidas, earning nearly half the money upfront, and will continue to earn percentages of profits on all of his branded Adidas products.[314] He had a 10-year collaboration with PepsiCo that expired in 2009.[315] He has also promoted The Walt Disney Company theme parks.[316]\n\nBeckham has several eponymous video games, including Go! Go! Beckham!

Harmer also doubled for him in the party scene.[353] Beckham himself appears in the sequel Goal II: Living the Dream in a larger role, when the film's lead character gets transferred to Real Madrid.[354] This time, the story centres on the Real Madrid team, with other Madrid players also appearing on and off the pitch, alongside the fictional characters. Though the use of stock footage from the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Beckham appeared in Goal III: Taking on the World, which was released straight to DVD on 15 June 2009.[355]\n\nBeckham has expressed no interest in pursuit of acting roles, saying he is too \"stiff\".[356] However, due to his friendship with Guy Ritchie, he has made two cameo appearances in Ritchie's films: as a projectionist in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.
