She then had an on-camera meltdown that had her friends and family worried she had become \u201cunhinged.\u201d\n\nAs for Barr, she\u2019s still threatening to release emails of \u201csupport\u201d by ABC and her co-stars, as Radar reported exclusively.\n\n\u201cRoseanne thinks her career is over and she\u2019s never going to work again,\u201d said the insider. \u201cShe\u2019s being told by close friends and family not to release emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut others are telling her from a PR perspective that when Kathy went scorched earth she only ended up being exiled for nine months.\u201d\n\nThough she recently tweeted about gaining \u201cinsight\u201d after her offensive tweets, the 65-year-old former TV star doesn\u2019t really understand the gravity of her controversial comments that compared Valerie Jarrett, one of Barack Obama\u2019s top advisers, to an ape.\n\n\u201cShe still has no self-awareness about what she did, and is rationalizing everything,\u201d added the insider.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying to explain that it was all a joke, and she didn\u2019t know it would hit so close to home.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s miserable and ranting and raving to friends, who are sick of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s angry and paralyzed about what to do.\u201d\n\nOn the brighter side for her now unemployed costars, execs are planning a spinoff that will center around Sara Gilbert, who plays Darlene \u2014 Roseanne\u2019s daughter \u2014 on the show.\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
