We\u2019ve done it. We\u2019ve been there. Let\u2019s move on.\u201d\n\nJennifer Aniston More\n\nAnd while Aniston is likely around a size 4 herself, she is still frequently body shamed \u2014 she had to explain in 2016 that she wasn\u2019t pregnant, she just ate a burger, after photos of her in a bikini led to internet speculation. Aniston told InStyle that she dealt with body insecurities as a kid, too.\n\n\u201cI was one of the kids who the others would decide to make fun of. It was an odd period of time during fifth, sixth, seventh grades. I was a little on the chubby side, so I was just that kid,\u201d she said. \u201cChildhood is such a vulnerable time, and I\u2019m sure a part of me believed all that they teased me about.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Behind the Cover: Jennifer Aniston\n\nNow, when her frustrations build up \u2014 whether it\u2019s about body image or assumptions about her post-break up mental state \u2014 Aniston turns to boxing.\n\n\u201cBoxing is a great way to get aggression out. You get a mental release of all this crap you\u2019re taking into your ears and eyes every day and have little fantasy moments imagining who you\u2019re actually punching,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful it\u2019s not actually the person, even though there\u2019s one person. You know what I mean. It\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nJennifer Aniston More\n\nAniston said that she discovered her \u201clove\u201d of boxing last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the longest workout I\u2019ve actually stayed with consistently other than yoga,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the mental aspect of boxing \u2014 the drills, your brain has to work, you\u2019re not just sitting on a bike. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xaxB9mDB9RPkV0tBljF15A--~B/aD0yMDkyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/baff8f3cb145df5414ca3c18d11b4b2e", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/utMmC73rYc97.UKzNp5nug--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NA--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2018-12/1a2678d0-ffe6-11e8-bfff-a0df48e415cb", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gphNS9jmSQlqQZ8n_iG2cQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/f33e1bad3147080b3c45044810acf317", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/np3IXgIo0x0CovQo6zSoPQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/3e8c9e6cdc9e9669e1968f8bf1a0be3f"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xaxB9mDB9RPkV0tBljF15A--~B/aD0yMDkyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/baff8f3cb145df5414ca3c18d11b4b2e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-says-apos-stop-165050097.html", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Says We Need to 'Stop Thinking Beauty Is in the Shape of a Size 4'", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "player": {"identifier": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-celebrates-end-miss-143706717.html?format=embed", "height": 281, "width": 500}, "card": "player", "description": "Jennifer Aniston Wants Society to Accept Bodies Over a 'Size 4'", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xaxB9mDB9RPkV0tBljF15A--~B/aD0yMDkyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/baff8f3cb145df5414ca3c18d11b4b2e", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xaxB9mDB9RPkV0tBljF15A--~B/aD0yMDkyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/baff8f3cb145df5414ca3c18d11b4b2e"}, "title": "Jennifer Aniston Says We Need to 'Stop Thinking Beauty Is in the Shape of a Size 4'"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Aniston, Miss America pageant, swimsuit competition", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=41d9c091-fa8e-3d89-a562-8f3545f70193&src=web", "description": "Jennifer Aniston Wants Society to Accept Bodies Over a 'Size 4'", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xaxB9mDB9RPkV0tBljF15A--~B/aD0yMDkyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/baff8f3cb145df5414ca3c18d11b4b2e", "description": "Jennifer Aniston Wants Society to Accept Bodies Over a 'Size 4'", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Says We Need to 'Stop Thinking Beauty Is in the Shape of a Size 4'", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-says-apos-stop-165050097.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 73756409831, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=41d9c091-fa8e-3d89-a562-8f3545f70193&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=41d9c091-fa8e-3d89-a562-8f3545f70193&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533142250.0, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
