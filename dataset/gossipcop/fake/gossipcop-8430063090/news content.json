No. First comes money, then comes marriage, according to a new report, which claims Rihanna and Hassan Jameel headed to the alter! But, they\u2019re reportedly protecting their massive fortunes first.\n\nThe first sign of true love and trust is an iron-clad prenup, right? Well, according to a new report, both Rihanna, 29, and her new rumored boyfriend, Hassan Jameel, 29, are in the midst of planning a wedding! However, business is business. \u201cEverything is moving so fast, but right now the priority is working out their individual assets with their attorneys in order to write up an ironclad contract,\u201d a source tells Life & Style magazine. So, what numbers are we exactly working with, here? Rihanna and Hassan are reportedly hashing out a prenup worth more than $1 billion; you know, nine zeros\u2026\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re crazy about each other, but they both know that a prenup is a good idea,\u201d the insider says. So, here\u2019s the alleged understanding \u2014 \u201cBoth parties agree that what they bring into the marriage, financially speaking, is what they\u2019ll leave with.\u201d Ultimately, Rihanna and Hassan have reportedly agreed to keep the contract as simple as possible. Basically a what\u2019s mine is mine, and what\u2019s yours is yours, type of situation; because, again, this is what love is all about.\n\nOnce the alleged prenup is dealt with, the couple reportedly plans to get married, outside of the U.S. \u201cThey want to exchange vows to be special to who they are and where they come from, which means Barbados for her and Saudi Arabia for him, probably in Riyadh,\u201d the source says. And, get this \u2014 \u201cHaving two weddings is a big possibility.\u201d Wow.\n\nAnd, there\u2019s no price tag too high for everlasting love. \u201cThey obviously aren\u2019t concerned about money,\u201d according to the mag. \u201cWhat they both want is to be in a gorgeous location, surrounded by family and friends. They can\u2019t wait to get married.\u201d This is cute. However, neither Rihanna and Hassan have addressed the marriage reports. Not to mention, they don\u2019t even have more than a few photos together at this point.\n\nOne person who did confirm their romance? \u2014 Rihanna\u2019s father, Ronald Fenty. \u201cShe told me she had a new boyfriend. But, I didn\u2019t know who he was,\u201d Fenty tells the mag. And, he even offered up a stern warning to Ri\u2019s new man. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to buckle up,\u201d Ronald says, because Rihanna\u2019s \u201cvery independent and ambitious. Nobody can tell her what to do.\u201d Father knows best!\n\nRihanna and Hassan were first romantically linked on June 27, when they were spotted kissing in a private pool in Spain. The pair vacationed at an exclusive villa and looked smitten with each other in steamy, PDA photos. Rihanna\u2019s romantic getaway was the first time she was spotted with a new man since she and Drake, 30, split in Oct. 2016.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Rihanna and Hassan are the real deal?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F07%2F12%2Fare-rihanna-hassan-jameel-getting-married-prenup-1-billion-dollars-relationship%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2688292&comment_count=4", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/jenna_lemoncelli.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rihanna-protect-boyfriend-vetical.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/katie-holmes-suri-cruise.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rihanna-protect-boyfriend-vetical.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/rihanna-protect-boyfriend-vetical.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Louisa Ballhaus", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "News Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/12/are-rihanna-hassan-jameel-getting-married-prenup-1-billion-dollars-relationship/", "title": "Are Rihanna & BF Hassan Jameel Talking Marriage & An Ironclad Prenup?", "meta_data": {"description": "Rihanna and her new billionaire boyfriend, Hassan Jameel are reportedly skipping the whole getting to know one another stage and racing right to the alter!
