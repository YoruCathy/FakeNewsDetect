'So, he's really spruced up the pool area, the skateboard ramp and the bike track.'\n\nSpending time with his kids over the summer could give the actor the leverage he needs to get joint custody once and for all.\n\n'He's been patient long enough,' says the friend. 'Something's got to give. Angelina can't control everything forever.'\n\nNeither Brad or Angelina have responded to In Touch's report.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/28470/untitled-design-1.png", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/28470/untitled-design-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Georgia Mars", "Georgia Mars Is A Digital Content Editor At New Idea Magazine.
