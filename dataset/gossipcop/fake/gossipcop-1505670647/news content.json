Khloe's fertility concerns? Scott and Courtney's frighteningly dysfunctional relationship?\n\nWell, if you've shed the odd tear for the Ks over the years, you aren't alone.\n\nIn the family's celebratory Hollywood Reporter cover story, Kendall explained to the magazine that members of the crew can't help sobbing when one of the girls opens up.\n\nShe said, 'We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying'\n\nKim added, 'It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing.'\n\nThe crew can go from anything from one iPhone to a 30-strong team, all watching their every move.\n\nWhoever was on set would have also been privy to Kendall's reaction to the politically insensitive Pepsi advert she was must-lambasted for. Though we as a public have received no evidence of how Kendall reacted to the onslaught of criticism (she has deleted all evidence of it on her social media and has never made a statement), Kim explains that Kendall would never let herself be shown on camera crying.\n\nShe told the magazine:\n\nWe're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and Pepsi, where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, 'This is wrong. You need to speak up.' She was like, 'I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.' She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.\n\nWe suppose the only non-family members who know the truth are those blubbering crew members then.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/34/2048x1024/1503476965-landscape-1503398530-gettyimages-133643872.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/34/2048x1024/landscape-1503394280-gettyimages-493524432.jpg?resize=300:*", "http://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/34/3200x1600/landscape-1503311179-kylie-j-pastel-hair.jpg?resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daisy Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a38002/kendall-jenner-makes-kuwtk-cameramen-cry/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Can't Help But Make The KUWTK Cameramen Cry", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Kendall Jenner Can't Help Making The 'KUWTK' Cameramen Cry", "description": "Reality TV is so emosh", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a38002/kendall-jenner-makes-kuwtk-cameramen-cry/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-21 09:20:23", "published_time": "2017-08-23 09:18:56", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Kendall Jenner Can't Help But Make The KUWTK Cameramen Cry", "description": "Reality TV is so emosh", "keywords": "KUWTK, Pepsi advert, 10 years of Keeping up with the kardashians", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/980x980/square-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,Kendall Jenner,kim kardashian", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-23T09:18:56Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/980x980/square-1502185978-kendall-jenner-pose.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kendall Jenner Can't Help Making The 'KUWTK' Cameramen Cry", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503451136.0, "source": "http://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
