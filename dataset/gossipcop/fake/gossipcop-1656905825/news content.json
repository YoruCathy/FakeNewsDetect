He doesn't want to do anything drastic. Brad just wants to make sure he looks his absolute best for this next movie role.\"\n\nIn case it isn't clear, we're not quite buying this report.\n\nGiving Brad a facelift would be like power-washing the Mona Lisa.\n\nAny surgeon who would agree to do it should immediately have his license revoked.\n\nBesides, what would Pitt's motivation be?\n\nHe's still working as much as ever, and something tells us he's not having a hard time in the female department.\n\nThe man's not exactly your typical divorced, 54-year-old father of six.", "images": ["https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/assets/logo-white-beee066818238b0eb075767349f71cae.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--Me72ovUb--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1496858856/brad-pitt-is-so-cute.jpg"], "top_img": "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--Me72ovUb--/t_full/cs_srgb,f_auto,fl_strip_profile.lossy,q_auto:420/v1496858856/brad-pitt-is-so-cute.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/12/brad-pitt-did-he-get-plastic-surgery-after-his-divorce/", "title": "Brad Pitt: Did He Get Plastic Surgery After His Divorce?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 277650442346327}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/12/brad-pitt-did-he-get-plastic-surgery-after-his-divorce/", "title": "Brad Pitt: Did He Get Plastic Surgery After His Divorce?!", "description": "Has Brad Pitt gone under the knife to improve his looks?
