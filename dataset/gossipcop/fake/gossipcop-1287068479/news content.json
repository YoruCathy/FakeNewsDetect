Keeping the secret of who would design the royal wedding gown under wraps was no easy task, according to ABC News' royal contributor Omid Scobie.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on the steps of St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle after their wedding, May 19, 2018. Reuters\n\nMarkle, who already had a stash of bridal dress \"inspo\" pictures saved on her phone from Instagram, Pinterest and elsewhere online, began her search for a designer at the urging of her best friend, Jessica Mulroney, according to Scobie, who revealed details of the dress selection process in a Harper's Bazaar article.\n\nMarkle, now the Duchess of Sussex, already knew what she wanted in her wedding dress: something timeless, elegant and appropriate, Scobie added.\n\nWhile many designers threw their names in the running to be picked by Markle to design her dress, Waight Keller had been a favorite since the beginning. The designer and bride to be met just before Christmas, Scobie said, and Markle immediately liked what she saw.\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex emerge from the West Door of St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in Windsor, on May 19, 2018 after their wedding ceremony.

She looks absolutely stunning,'\" Waight Keller recalled. \"Well, I think everybody saw on television -- he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/royal-wedding-harry-meghan-stairs-train-gty-thg-180519_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Catherine Thorbecke", "Carolyn Durand", "May", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/secret-making-meghan-markles-royal-wedding-gown-55397129", "title": "The 'secret' making of Meghan Markle's royal wedding gown", "meta_data": {"description": "The custom gown was designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, wedding dress, untold story", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
