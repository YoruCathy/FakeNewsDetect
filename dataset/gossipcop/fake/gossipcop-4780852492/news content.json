He does not need to get me anything. Honestly, do you, baby? He is good at giving gifts and making surprises. That is the best gift ever. That is amazing. Do I get to do that four-hour workout with you? No, thank you. That is my gift, no I do not have to do that workout with you.\u201d\n\nMcGraw beamed over his wife\u2019s talent by stating: \u201cFor me, it is hearing her sing every night, that is the best part about [the tour]. Cause she is not out there singing much, to see her up on stage, having a great time and just belting it out? I mean, I always say it: when I am on stage with her, it is like NASCAR trying to keep up with an Indy car. She is just that good. So, to me, to watch her sing and see what she does is pretty inspiring.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed the secret about having a long and healthy relationship \u2014 let his wife drive.\n\nThe \u201cHumble And Kind\u201d singer shared: \u201cMy hot wife, man. Well, the car I drive, the relationship she drives. It is pretty even. We make big decisions about things in different ways, but we always talk about it before we do it. And you know, having three daughters, we acquiesced to mom quite a bit on those decisions.\u201d\n\nHe concluded by: \u201cBut I think the key is. You can go into an argument, and your first thought should not always be \u2018Should I be in this relationship?\u2019 That should be the last thought when you argue.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy the looks of things, these will be making sweet music together for many years to come.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dc742738ee29dd6e530a07f7bbbd9132?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Top-Gun-Maverick-NPR.org_-300x201.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/santana-deelishis-23-300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Tim-McGraws-Drastic-Weight-Loss-To-Blame-For-Recent-On-Stage-Collapse-700x466.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6c6f9d3cacdeff1507d4563527fe62c1?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8f3f2a9d3c7dc180881ca52546f25405?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Tim-McGraw-Reveals-Faith-Hill-Gave-Him-An-Ultimatum-To-Get-Healthy-Partying-Or-Family-Take-Your-Pi-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3873c05807df34190ffd6dab6342e7f1?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9ef623154fa35937ce1510cb5a2aa345?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Porsha-Williams-Pregnant-RHOA-Baby-Bump-300x206.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Heiress-Harris-3-Shows-Off-Her-Dance-Moves-For-The-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Denise-Richards-BravoTV.com_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DylanFisher-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/faith_hill_tim_mcgraw-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gabourey-Sidibe-Hair-Comment-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1bde87d9281be078de4e8acf311481c2?s=60&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tim-McGraw-Faith-Hill.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dylan Fisher", "Elliot James", "De Tonya"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/faith-hill-wants-a-divorce-and-is-tired-of-tim-mcgraws-cheating-ways-report-106905/", "title": "Faith Hill Wants A Divorce And Is Tired Of Tim McGraw\u2019s Cheating Ways: Report", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Dylan Fisher", "news_keywords": "faith hill, tim mcgraw,", "keywords": "celebrity news, faith hill, tim mcgraw,", "description": "Country stars Tim McGraw and his wife, Faith Hill, are the subjects of a divorce rumor.
