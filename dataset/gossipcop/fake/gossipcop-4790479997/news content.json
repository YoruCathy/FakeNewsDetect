Co-stars Will Ferrell And Amy Poehler 'Can't Stand Each Other!'\n\n'House' Divided! Co-stars Will Ferrell And Amy Poehler 'Can't Stand Each Other!'\n\n'House' Divided! Co-stars Will Ferrell And Amy Poehler 'Can't Stand Each Other!' The competitive comedians are butting heads on the set of their new movie.\n\nWill Ferrell and Amy Poehler may seem all smiles as they promote their eagerly awaited rom-com The House, but sources tell RadarOnline.com there\u2019s no love lost between the comedy heavyweights.\n\n\u201cThey wrapped this movie in less than four weeks \u2013 because they can\u2019t stand each other,\u201d says an insider. \u201cThey play a suburban couple who open an illegal casino in their basement, but any on-screen affection between their characters is acting at the highest level.\u201d\n\nFerrell and Poehler have a long history of trying to upstage each other on Saturday Night Live, and that apparently hasn\u2019t changed in their blossoming movie careers.\n\n\u201cThey were always very competitive with each other, even after 20 years,\u201d our source said. \u201cThey agreed to work 20-hour days to make the film together as quickly as possible, and hardly ever spoke to each other when the cameras were not rolling.\u201d\n\nIn the new comedy, Ferrell and Poehler play a couple who can\u2019t afford to send their daughter to college. But pretending to be happily married was apparently award-winning acting.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t friends and the competition between them is as intense as ever.\u201d\n\nNow the two are out promoting the movie together, but our insider says each can\u2019t wait for their forced confinement to be over.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re under strict orders from Paramount to play nice on the red carpet,\u201d the source revealed. \u201cBut the irony is the film\u2019s been getting rave reviews from early screenings and if it does as well as expected, they\u2019ll be pressured to pair up again for a sequel.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info!
