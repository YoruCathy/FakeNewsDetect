According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating.\n\nThis is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato\u2019s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality\u2013 despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Demi Lovato\u2019s sexuality:\n\n1.

She\u2019s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities\n\nLovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song \u201cCatch Me\u201d on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley\u2019s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed \u201cBFF,\u201d in 2010.\n\nHer most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70\u2019s Show actor:\n\nWhen I dated white guys, it wasn\u2019t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that\u2019s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He\u2019s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he\u2019s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I\u2019ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend.\n\nSince her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato\u2019s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme \u201cBomba\u201d Vasconcelos and Abedini.\n\n3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato \u2018Hooked Up\u2019 in 2013\n\nDemi Lovato Lesbian Hookup with Australian DJ?Australian DJ Ruby Rose claims to have had a fling with Demi Lovato! http://bit.ly/SubClevverNews \u2013 Subscribe Now! Is Demi Lovato's new Glee role imitating real life- OMG?! This is ClevverNews. X Factor judge Demi Lovato has been caught in the line of fire from an Australian DJ named Ruby Rose who says she slept with Demi. And the timing of this new report is quite ironic. Just Thursday Demi made her debut on Fox's show Glee as a lesbian named Dani and even shared a smooch with Santana, played by Naya Rivera. So who is Ruby Rose? A cute blonde 27-year-old DJ. The rumors started flying when Ruby tweeted October 6th that she was taking a break from social media after being attacked by Demi's friends. Ruby tweeted, \"Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato's friends attack me for being a 'scorned ex-lover' get over it!! I liked the hair\". What does that even mean, she only likes girls for their hair? And that's impressive if she's an ex-lover and we are just now finding out about it. And Ruby wasn't done there she then posted on Instagram, \"the only person demi has slept with that didn't sell on naked photos of her\". So where are these other naked photos? Did we miss something? Of course there has been no response from Demi just yet, but her fans are apparently unhappy by these rumors. Next, Ruby posted on Twitter, \"What just happened to me on [Instagram] wasn't very nice and I retaliated because I stood up for myself. It's all sorted now Back to business\u2026\" According to RadarOnline their friendship goes back to 2011 when Ruby tweeted, \"On a plus side I met Demi Lovato today at lunch and she is just magnificent.\" Lovatics, what do you make of all this? Do you think Ruby was looking for some attention or are her claims true?

She went on to say \u201cThink ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato\u2019s friends attack me for being a \u2018scorned ex-lover\u2019 get over it! I liked the hair.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama.\n\nLovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. \u201cRumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.\u201d\n\nThe singer added \u201cWhether there\u2019s been rumours with one specific person or not, that\u2019s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.\u201d\n\n4.

You can do it!\u201d Watch the full speech above.\n\n5.
