Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia. pic.twitter.com/JP0c2wtrJ6 \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 28, 2017\n\nAs you may recall, the former vice president made a madcap \"Veep\"-themed video with Louis-Dreyfus in 2014 for the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and the duo shared a meal or two along the way. So of course Louis-Dreyfus made sure to tweet him back:\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\n.@JoeBiden yes we do.

Inspired but not surprised to see you using your platform for good in this difficult moment. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 28, 2017\n\nAnd Meghan McCain, the newly-announced \"View\" co-host and daughter of Senator John McCain, wrote: \"Sending so much love and strength to Julia Louis-Dreyfus @OfficialJLD and her family.\"\n\nOf course, her co-workers past and present stepped up with condolences and good wishes:\n\n@OfficialJLD so sorry you have to go thru this, pal, but I know you will prevail. We are here if/when you need and we love you. \ufe0f \u2014 jason alexander (@IJasonAlexander) September 29, 2017\n\nWhile fellow former \"Seinfeld\" star Michael Richards told People magazine, \"I wish Julia godspeed and a full recovery.\"\n\nWe love this woman. pic.twitter.com/EqvF6HXpj0 \u2014 Tony Hale (@MrTonyHale) September 28, 2017\n\nShe is one of the strongest and caring people I know.

Love her more for speaking up for others in this moment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at least one fan has visited Louis-Dreyfus' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, only to find it decorated with kind words and stickers, which we heartily endorse:\n\nStopped by to add these to @OfficialJLD Hollywood Star.
