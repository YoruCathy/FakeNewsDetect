Photo credit: BACKGRID\n\nOn Wednesday the Keeping up with the Kardashian star posted a cryptic photo to her Instagram account that appears to be hinting at the name of her daughter\u2014 and based on these indications we believe the baby\u2019s name is Elle V. West.\n\nClue 1: The reality star posted a picture of the Louis Vuitton logo\u2014LV. \u201cL\u201d which sounds like \u201cElle\u201d and \u201cV\u201d which is the roman numeral number for five. This seems like a strong possibility because the new addition makes five at the West household as she joins big brother Saint, 2, and big Sister North, 4.\n\nClue 2: As some may know, Elle also means \u201cShe\u201d in French and Kim confirmed that she was having a girl on the Ellen DeGeneres show earlier this month as well as on her website when she announced the arrival of their daughter saying \u201cShe is here.\u201d Was this a double entendre?\n\nClue 3: Fans may also recall that when Kim made an appearance on the show, Ellen had fans scream out suggestion for KKW beauty founder and at one point someone screamed out \u201cElle\u201d and Ellen agreed saying, \u201cElle that\u2019s a good one! E-L-L-E!\u201d\n\nClue 4: During that same appearance, Ellen also suggested that she name the baby \u201cThree\u201d for baby number three, which may have sparked the train of thought to consider the numeral symbolism \u201cV\u201d in her family tree.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kim-kardashian-yeezy-season-6-pp.jpg?resize=690%2C430&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kuwtk-season-18-trailer-kim-kourtney-kardashian-fight.jpg?resize=151%2C110&ssl=1", "https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-starmagazine/images/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kim-kardashian-tristan-thompson-booed-nba-game-kuwtk-season-18.jpg?resize=151%2C110&ssl=1", "https://cdn-star0.heartyhosting.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-starmagazine/images/star-logo.png?9067122fa57259cbe04dfb40ebcd2b15\n", "https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kim-kardashian-yeezy-season-6-pp.jpg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hp-star.jpg?resize=300%2C250&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kanye-west-kim-kardashian-elevator-makeout-video-.jpg?resize=151%2C110&ssl=1", "https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-starmagazine/images/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kim-kardashian-yeezy-season-6-pp.jpg?fit=1200%2C873&ssl=1", "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kim-kardashian-naomi-campbell-cher-photos-cr-fashion-book-.jpg?resize=151%2C110&ssl=1", "https://cdn-star0.heartyhosting.com/wp-content/themes/vip/am-starmagazine/images/star-logo.svg", "https://starmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "https://i0.heartyhosting.com/starmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kim-kardashian-yeezy-season-6-pp.jpg?fit=1200%2C873&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stacy Pierre-Louis"], "canonical_link": "https://starmagazine.com/photos/kim-kardashian-named-daughter-elle-v-west-heres/", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Named Their Daughter Elle V.
