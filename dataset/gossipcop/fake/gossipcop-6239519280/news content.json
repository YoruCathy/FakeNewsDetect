Mom of six Angelina Jolie revealed in a new interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, February 17, that she never envisioned herself raising children.\n\nBut in 2000, she was shooting her blockbuster action flick Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in Cambodia, and something shifted. \u201cWhen I first came to Cambodia, it changed me,\u201d the superstar, 40, told the AP. \u201cIt changed my perspective. I realized there was so much about history that I had not been taught in school, and so much about life that I needed to understand, and I was very humbled by it.\u201d\n\nThe daughter of actor Jon Voight and late actress Marcheline Bertrand recalled how shooting in Cambodia was so different from L.A., where she felt \u201ca real emptiness\u201d growing up. \u201cThat trip triggered my realization of how little I knew and the beginning of my search for that knowledge,\u201d she disclosed.\n\nIt also awakened her desire to be a mom. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, I never wanted to have a baby,\u201d she reflected. \u201cI never wanted to be pregnant. I never babysat. I never thought of myself as a mother.\u201d That changed when she was playing with kids at a local school in Cambodia. \u201cIt was suddenly very clear to me that my son was in the country, somewhere,\u201d she recalled.\n\nIn 2002, Jolie adopted her eldest, Maddox, now 14. A few years later, she brought home her daughter Zahara, now 11, from Ethiopia. In 2007, she and her then-future husband, Brad Pitt, adopted Pax, now 12, from Vietnam.\n\nThe couple, who married in August 2014, also share three biological children: Daughter Shiloh, 9, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 7.\n\nJolie\u2019s love for Cambodia will be expressed in her upcoming work. The actress-turned-director is currently shooting an upcoming Netflix original, First They Killed My Father, which is based on Loung Ung\u2019s memoir. The movie will detail, from a child\u2019s perspective, the brutal Khmer Rouge regime that claimed over 2 million lives back in the 1970s.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angie-kids-zoom-1ae154b7-e000-4395-bc58-619dc06d789d.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-brad-zoom-ce3e4415-db07-42e5-9ab0-01330e0339ec.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-zoom-3121bf85-4892-4243-a38c-72a88bdc3242.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1672px%2C878px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-zoom-3121bf85-4892-4243-a38c-72a88bdc3242.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1672px%2C940px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-zoom-3121bf85-4892-4243-a38c-72a88bdc3242.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1672px%2C878px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/angelina-jolie-its-strange-i-never-wanted-to-have-a-baby-w164701/", "title": "Angelina Jolie: \u2018It\u2019s Strange, I Never Wanted to Have a Baby\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Mom of six Angelina Jolie revealed in a new interview that she 'never wanted to have a baby' \u2014 find out why she changed her mind", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie: 'It's Strange, I Never Wanted to Have a Baby'", "description": "Mom of six Angelina Jolie revealed in a new interview that she 'never wanted to have a baby' \u2014 find out why she changed her mind", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/angelina-jolie-its-strange-i-never-wanted-to-have-a-baby-w164701/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:54:38+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-zoom-3121bf85-4892-4243-a38c-72a88bdc3242.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1672px%2C878px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-zoom-3121bf85-4892-4243-a38c-72a88bdc3242.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1672px%2C878px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2016-02-17T22:45:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:54:38+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Mom of six Angelina Jolie revealed in a new interview that she 'never wanted to have a baby' \u2014 find out why she changed her mind", "title": "Angelina Jolie: 'It's Strange, I Never Wanted to Have a Baby'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/angelina-jolie-zoom-3121bf85-4892-4243-a38c-72a88bdc3242.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1672px%2C878px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1455749121.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
