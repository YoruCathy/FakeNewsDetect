Jolie believes \u201cAmal has stolen her identity\u201d as the world\u2019s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.\n\nBut breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency\u2019s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.\n\nThe timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.\n\nBut as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.\n\nIn any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children \u2014 girls especially \u2014 whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.\n\nJolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can\u2019t read or write and has been \u201crobbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.\u201d\n\nThe other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university \u2014 while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,\u201d Jolie wrote. \u201cThere are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.\u201d\n\nJolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: \u201cNot with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.\u201d\n\nJolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.\n\n\u201cHardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,\u201d Jolie wrote. \u201cIt is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.\u201d\n\nBut Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a \u201cpatient, long-term manner, guided by our values.\u201d She concluded her piece by writing: \u201cIf we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JolieRefugee6.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JolieRefugee2.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JolieRefugee3.jpg?w=1024&h=668"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/JolieRefugee3.jpg?w=1024&h=668", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
