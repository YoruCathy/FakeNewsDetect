Jennifer Lopez, who stars as NYPD detective Harlee Santos on the NBC crime drama Shades of Blue, hired a private investigator to tail her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cHe found out and they had a huge fight,\u201d the insider tells Us. \u201cBut they\u2019re working through it.\u201d\n\nJennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez\u2019s Ridiculously Chic Couple Style\n\nIn June, the former New York Yankees third baseman, 41, was plagued by cheating rumors after the National Enquirer published an interview with his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter.\n\nWorried that her four-month romance with Rodriguez was too good to be true, the \u201cAin\u2019t Your Mama\u201d singer, 47, resorted to subterfuge. \u201cShe\u2019s really into Alex and wants it to work,\u201d the source adds. \u201cSo she\u2019s trying to control as much as she can.\u201d\n\nDespite the brief setback, the couple have had no problem gushing over each other in recent interviews. Earlier this month, J. Lo told Extra that her beau is \u201ca beautiful person\u201d and a \u201cloving father\u201d to his daughters, Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9, whom he shares with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a generous human being with his family, with his friends, with me,\u201d Lopez told the outlet. \u201cHe\u2019s caring and sweet and capable and responsible and just all the beautiful things you would want a man to be. I feel really lucky right now, so I\u2019m excited about life, but I\u2019m more excited for people to get to see who he really is.\u201d\n\nAnd the feeling is mutual. \u201cWe\u2019re having a great time,\u201d A-Rod said of his budding romance with the entertainer, who shares 9-year-old twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Marc Anthony, during a March appearance on The View. \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing, amazing girl. One of the smartest human beings I\u2019ve ever met and also an incredible mother.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-4604322c-df06-4108-813c-acbe993cab53.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-41af86c4-d75e-4e39-80a2-46b8d797b54e.jpg?crop=41px%2C1px%2C1127px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-41af86c4-d75e-4e39-80a2-46b8d797b54e.jpg?crop=41px%2C1px%2C1127px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-lopez-hired-private-investigator-to-tail-alex-rodriguez-w491973/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Hired Private Investigator to Tail Alex Rodriguez", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jennifer Lopez hired a private investigator to tail her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Hired Private Investigator to Tail Alex Rodriguez", "description": "Jennifer Lopez hired a private investigator to tail her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jennifer-lopez-hired-private-investigator-to-tail-alex-rodriguez-w491973/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:51:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-41af86c4-d75e-4e39-80a2-46b8d797b54e.jpg?crop=41px%2C1px%2C1127px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-41af86c4-d75e-4e39-80a2-46b8d797b54e.jpg?crop=41px%2C1px%2C1127px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-07-13T12:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:51:50+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jennifer Lopez hired a private investigator to tail her boyfriend, Alex Rodriguez, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Hired Private Investigator to Tail Alex Rodriguez", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-41af86c4-d75e-4e39-80a2-46b8d797b54e.jpg?crop=41px%2C1px%2C1127px%2C591px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499947200.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
