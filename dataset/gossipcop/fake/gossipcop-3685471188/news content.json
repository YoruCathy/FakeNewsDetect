But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. \u201cHaving children is definitely a priority,\u201d a source close to Markle told Us. \u201cShe and Harry want to start a family right away\u2014and she\u2019ll start trying as soon as she can.\u201d\n\nA second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less \"this'll happen ASAP.\" \u201cThey both can\u2019t wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won\u2019t rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They\u2019ll make fantastic parents.\u201d\n\nA third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. \u201cDoria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She\u2019s very excited for Meghan to become a mother.\u201d\n\nHarry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday. They have a trip planned to Australia this fall for the Sydney Invictus Games and are said to have a busy second half of the year coming with work engagements. Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.\n\nIn their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, \"No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we\u2019ll start a family in the near future.\"\n\nAt an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, \"I\u2019m sure at some point we\u2019ll need the whole thing.\u201d\n\nRoyal baby alert! \ud83d\udc76 #PrinceHarry and #MeghanMarkle met a husband and wife team who make innovative baby products today in #Belfast. Meghan pointed to the product range and said: \"I'm sure at some point we'll need the whole (lot).\"!!! \ud83c\udf7c\ud83c\udf7c\ud83c\udf7c\ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc76\ud83d\udc76 \u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) March 23, 2018", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-harry-gettyimages-883563584-1528290159.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-harry-gettyimages-883563584-1528290159.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey", "News", "Strategy Editor", "Alyssa Bailey Is The News", "Strategy Editor At Elle.Com", "Where She Oversees Coverage Of Celebrities", "Royals", "Particularly Meghan Markle", "Kate Middleton ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a21094079/meghan-markle-prince-harry-baby-plans-report/", "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Will Reportedly Have a Baby as Soon as They Can", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Will Reportedly Have a Baby as Soon as They Can", "description": "\"She and Harry want to start a family right away...\"", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a21094079/meghan-markle-prince-harry-baby-plans-report/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-harry-gettyimages-883563584-1528290159.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-06-06 01:24:34", "published_time": "2018-06-06 01:11:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2020", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-harry-gettyimages-883563584-1528290159.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry to Start Trying to Have a Baby Soon - Meghan Harry Family Plans", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been pretty clear about their desire to start a family eventually.
