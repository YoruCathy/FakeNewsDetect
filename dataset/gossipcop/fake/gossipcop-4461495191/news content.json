Conspiracy theories abound that the wardrobe \u201cmalfunction\u201d was secretly planned by Jackson and Timberlake, but Jackson sources say that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThey admit, however, that there was great mystery in the run-up to that halftime show.\n\n\u201cWhen some of us went to Houston, we were told they were doing rehearsals,\u201d said a relative. \u201cPeople from the NFL and MTV were there so [we] thought we would get a preview of the performance.\u201d\n\nInstead, security advised that final rehearsals were closed to everyone.\n\n\u201cWe had heard that they were experimenting on some sort of elaborate production,\u201d the relative added.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that Jackson and Timberlake were not the only acts that night. Produced by MTV \u2014 who had previously organized the 2001 halftime event \u2014 the show first featured performances by Jessica Simpson, Diddy, Nelly and Kid Rock. Jackson took the stage with a marching band for her 1989 hit \u201cRhythm Nation,\u201d then was joined by Timberlake for his \u201cRock Your Body.\u201d\n\nThe two had a sexy, playful chemistry and had previously been rumored to have been hooking up. Jackson was in the early throes of a romance with producer Jermaine Dupri, but \u201ceveryone \u2014 including [her mother] Katherine knew the chemistry was there,\u201d a Jackson insider said.\n\nYou could practically feel the heat as the two gyrated against each other onstage. At the end of the number, while singing \u201cI\u2019m gonna have you naked by the end of this song,\u201d Timberlake reached across Jackson\u2019s chest, grabbing her right breast and ripping off part of her top \u2014 exposing her bare breast, the nipple completely covered by a large silver sun attached by a piercing.\n\nLooking back at video of the incident, it\u2019s hard to make out Jackson\u2019s expression immediately after, as her face was mostly obscured by her hair, but she quickly covered herself with her hand. In photos from the event, Timberlake looks shell-shocked.\n\nJackson later explained to her mother that the cups of her top had been attached with a Velcro-like fabric that could easily be manipulated or opened to reveal a red lace bra underneath, according to the family source.\n\nThe source confirmed that Jackson and Timberlake had hatched a plan for him to rip off the top\u2019s cup, but didn\u2019t alert MTV, CBS, the NFL or even their backup dancers.\n\n\u201cThey were like, let\u2019s make this real and show the meaning behind [the song],\u201d the Jackson insider said.\n\n\u201cHer red bra was all that was supposed to show, no nipple, no exposure,\u201d the insider said. \u201cIt was meant to be a little racy, but nobody meant for her breast to show. It became a big deal because Justin grabbed the costume much too hard and, instead of pulling the one small part, he tore the bra part, too.\u201d (Representatives for Timberlake did not return calls for comment.)\n\nBehind the scenes, there was confusion, as MTV executive producer Salli Frattini, recalled to ESPN The Magazine in 2014: \u201cThere was lots of chaos in the [production truck, and we played it back and we were like, \u2018Oh, s \u2013 \u2013 t. What just happened?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt first, Jackson \u2014 who flew out of Houston that night \u2014 had no idea just how big the fallout would be. \u201cAt that point, she was just a little upset \u2014 a little troubled that her breast was seen in front of the biggest audience in history,\u201d the family member recalled.\n\nBut when she exited the stage, no one \u2014 including reps from AOL and the NFL, as well as Nelly \u2014 would look at her.\n\n\u201cNo one said anything when she left the stage,\u201d the family member added. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Uh-oh, we\u2019ve got trouble.\u2019\u201d\n\nBefore the game was over and the Patriots had beaten the Panthers, 32-29, Jackson\u2019s representative had issued the first statement, explaining that Timberlake was supposed to have pulled off the bustier cup only, not the bra itself.\n\nThe NFL responded quickly to the incident, making clear it was \u201cdisappointed.\u201d The league\u2019s then executive vice president, Joe Browne, said \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.\u201d (Indeed, the network has not.)\n\nMTV released a statement claiming that \u201cthe tearing of Janet Jackson\u2019s costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance.\u201d The network\u2019s then CEO, Tom Freston, alleged that Jackson alone had \u201cengineered\u201d the stunt.\n\nOver the next week, some 200,000 viewers reportedly complained to the FCC, which later fined CBS $550,000; the decision was tied up in the court system for eight years before finally being tossed out in favor of CBS.\n\nAOL, which had sponsored the halftime event, asked for a refund on its $10 million investment. Advertiser McDonald\u2019s called the incident \u201cinappropriate\u201d \u2014 but did not drop Timberlake as its \u201cI\u2019m lovin\u2019 it\u201d spokesman.\n\nAt first, Timberlake was flippant about Nipplegate, telling Access Hollywood that, \u201cWe love giving you all something to talk about.\u201d But he changed his tune shortly after that, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if anyone was offended.\u201d\n\nJackson meanwhile, issued both written and taped statements, absolving MTV, CBS and the NFL and saying, \u201cIt was not my intention that it go as far as it did.\u201d\n\nBut the damage was already done.\n\nThe weekend after the Super Bowl, Timberlake and Jackson had been scheduled to appear at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards on CBS, where both were slated to perform. Timberlake\u2019s performance happened. Jackson, who was supposed to lead a tribute to Luther Vandross, was allegedly uninvited.\n\nHer punishment didn\u2019t end there.\n\nWhen Jackson\u2019s \u201cDamita Jo\u201d album came out two months after the 2004 Super Bowl, she was facing a mountain of obstacles. As Rolling Stone reported, Viacom \u2014 the parent company then of both CBS and MTV \u2014 [hit] back . . . by essentially blacklisting her, keeping her music videos off their properties MTV, VH1 and radio stations under their umbrella. The blacklist [spread] to include non-Viacom media entities as well.\u201d\n\nJackson told relatives that she was embarrassed and feared she\u2019d never perform again.\n\n\u201cRadio stations wouldn\u2019t play her music. Her album, which was great, suffered,\u201d the family member recalled. Billboard reported that \u201cDamita Jo\u201d was her worst-selling album over a 20-year span, despite receiving largely favorable reviews.\n\nSo devastating was the backlash, Jackson stopped attending family gatherings and shut out those closest to her. \u201cShe\u2019d drive by [the family\u2019s Encino estate] in her bright yellow Jeep. We\u2019d see her but she\u2019d keep going,\u201d a second relative said. \u201cIt was like she didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nLoved ones and friends, including filmmaker Tyler Perry, became concerned about Jackson\u2019s health.\n\n\u2018MTV ought to be ashamed, my family helped build MTV . . . and this is the thanks we get.\u2019 - Jermaine Jackson\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going into depression, she\u2019s not herself,\u201d her brother Jermaine said at the time. \u201cJustin needs to hold a press conference and condemn CBS, MTV and everyone else for what they\u2019re doing to Janet. MTV ought to be ashamed, my family helped build MTV . . . and this is the thanks we get.\u201d\n\nIt took two years before Timberlake would tell MTV News: \u201cIf you consider it 50-50, then I probably got 10 percent of the blame. I think America is harsher on women. I think America is unfairly harsh on ethnic people.\u201d\n\nNot long after that, Jackson admitted to Oprah Winfrey that while Timberlake had reached out to her, she wasn\u2019t ready to reply.\n\n\u201cFriendship is very important to me, and certain things you just don\u2019t do to friends,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my own time, I\u2019ll give him a call.\u201d\n\nWhen Winfrey asked if Timberlake had \u201cleft [her] out there hanging,\u201d Jackson replied, \u201cTo a certain degree.\u201d She added that all the blame had been put on \u201cme, as opposed to us.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Jackson issued a statement saying there would be no halftime reunion.\n\n\u201cTo put to rest any speculation or rumors as to whether I will be performing at the Super Bowl tomorrow, I will not,\u201d she said.\n\nTo this day, Jackson\u2019s Waterloo has shaped the culture in unexpected ways.\n\nAs a result of the incident, the FCC instituted a five-second tape delay on Super Bowl performances, allowing censors time to catch offensive material.\n\nCoincidentally or not, no women appeared again at the halftime show until 2011 when the Black Eyed Peas \u2014 including Fergie \u2014 took the stage.\n\nMost remarkably, we have Nipplegate to thank for YouTube. Co-founder Jawed Karim told USA Today that he was inspired to create the video site in 2005 after not being able to find any footage of the incident online.\n\nSome who condemned Jackson have finally admitted it was too much.\n\nIn 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell told ESPN the Magazine that the committee had acted \u201cunfairly\u201d toward the singer. \u201cIt all turned into being about her,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIn reality, if you slow the thing down, it\u2019s Justin ripping off her breastplate.\u201d\n\nAs for Timberlake, he recently said that he \u201cstumbled through\u201d his handling of the situation. Jackson family insiders reveal he had to ask a few times before Jackson finally agreed to quietly meet up with him a few years ago in Los Angeles. After talking for a while, the two patched up their differences and sealed their friendship with a kiss and a long embrace.\n\nThat said, however, the Jackson insider explained that, \u201cPublicly, Janet will tell everyone she\u2019s forgiven Justin, but privately, she\u2019s reluctant to trust him. He\u2019s reached out to her about doing some things together but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready for that. Is she still angry? No. She doesn\u2019t wish him any ill will. Does she still think about it? Not all of the time, but certainly since he\u2019s doing the halftime show again, it\u2019s definitely been a dinner table topic.\u201d\n\nThe insider said that more than anything, Jackson is disappointed. \u201c[Timberlake] used to dig her but when it came to supporting her after what happened, he disappeared. That\u2019s not too manly and she didn\u2019t deserve that. Even if she\u2019s chosen to forgive him, it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s gotten past how he didn\u2019t man up.\n\n\u201cWe believe [the Super Bowl is a chance for him to] show her . . . and the world that he was wrong. He should insist that she come out and do something even if it\u2019s just him apologizing publicly in front of the whole stadium. It\u2019s not too late.\u201d", "images": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/superbowl1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/online-piano-class.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/superbowl1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/superbowl1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["February"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/02/03/janet-jacksons-family-is-still-mad-at-justin-timberlake/", "title": "Janet Jackson\u2019s family is still mad at Justin Timberlake", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
