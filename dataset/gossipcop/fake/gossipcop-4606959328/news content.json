He was offered free legal services,\u201d asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Needled for Tearful NY Times Interview About Having to Work Through His Birthday\n\nAttorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk \u201cshould check his mail before tweeting.\u201d\n\nMusk originally called Unsworth \u2014 a diver that criticized Musk\u2019s attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a \u201cPR stunt\u201d \u2014 a \u201cpedo guy\u201d in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was \u201cspoken in anger.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Elon Musk Says He Won't Take Tesla Private After All\n\n\u201cYou published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,\u201d Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. \u201cYou did so without any basis.\u201d\n\nWood added that he\u2019s prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.\n\nA representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\n\nEven without a potential civil suit on his hands, it\u2019s already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur. Musk is under the regulatory microscope after bringing Wall Street to a halt earlier this summer, tweeting he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private. Musk announced last Friday, after talking to shareholders, to keep Tesla a publicly traded company. Tesla shares have dropped about 20 percent to $305 a share since Musk tweeted about going private.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Los-Angeles-Times-building-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Musk1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1058973418.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vox-Media-logo-160x105.jpeg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Roku.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/laura-1-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Disney-Family-Singalong-160x105.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Conan-and-Julia-Louis-Dreyfus-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Musk1-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/movie.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ElonMusk18-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/InstagramReadyforHillaryMeme.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-2_copy-h_2020.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/MuskTesla-160x105.png"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Musk1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sean Burch", "Ross A.
