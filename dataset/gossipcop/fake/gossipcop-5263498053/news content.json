Citing multiple sources close to the star, Ian Halperin told The Wrap that Jenner is considering transitioning back to male \u201cin the next couple years.\u201d However, the 66-year-old's rep denied the author's claims in an email to FOX411.\n\nHalperin said while doing research for his book \u201cKardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America\u2019s Royal Family,\u201d several sources indicated Jenner is unhappy.\n\n\u201cOne source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of \u2018sex change regret,\u2019 hinting she might go back to being Bruce Jenner,\u201d Halperin told the entertainment website.\n\nThe biographer said Jenner is allegedly interested in transitioning back for relationship reasons.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still into women and wants to meet the right one,\u201d Halperin stated.\n\nJenner's rep told FOX411 regarding Halperin's claims, \"it is not true.\" The rep added Halperin \"is a moron.\"\n\nThe idea that Jenner has had apprehensions over the life change is nothing new. Back when Jenner graced the cover of Vanity Fair, the former Olympian described a panic attack following the transition.\n\nThe Vanity Fair profile detailed: \u201cDuring the first full day of recuperation\u2026 She was undergoing something that had never happened before in 65 years of life: a panic attack\u2026 The panic attack lasted about 15 seconds, but a single thought continued to course through her mind: \u2018What did I just do? What did I just do to myself?\u2019\u201d\n\nHalperin the transition has been \u201cvery hard\u201d for the star.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s thrilled she has raised awareness about how transgender people have long been discriminated against but I think there\u2019s a chance she\u2019ll de-transition in the next couple years,\u201d the writer said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would surprise anybody in her inner circle. It has been much harder than she anticipated. My heart goes out to her and I know her true friends will be there to support her on whatever path she chooses.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/jim-edmonds-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/02/270/152/Carey-Harwick.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/caitlyn-happy-ap660.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Crenshaw-Maher-FOX-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/03/270/152/bill-maher-HBO.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/caitlyn-happy-ap660.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/caitlyn-happy-ap660.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/caitlyn-jenner-considering-de-transitioning-in-the-next-couple-years-author-claims", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner considering \u2018de-transitioning\u2019 \u2018in the next couple years,\u2019 author claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A Kardashian family biographer claims Caitlyn Jenner is experiencing regret over transitioning from male to female.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Caitlyn Jenner considering \u2018de-transitioning\u2019 \u2018in the next couple years,\u2019 author claims", "dcterms.abstract": "A Kardashian family biographer claims Caitlyn Jenner is experiencing regret over transitioning from male to female.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "A Kardashian family biographer claims Caitlyn Jenner is experiencing regret over transitioning from male to female.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:4e11eb94-2978-54f1-ab50-afa96ad6f24d", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2016-05-12", "dcterms.created": "2016-05-12T08:25:09-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2016-05-12T13:20:35-04:00", "og": {"title": "Caitlyn Jenner considering \u2018de-transitioning\u2019 \u2018in the next couple years,\u2019 author claims", "description": "A Kardashian family biographer claims Caitlyn Jenner is experiencing regret over transitioning from male to female.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/caitlyn-happy-ap660.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/caitlyn-jenner-considering-de-transitioning-in-the-next-couple-years-author-claims", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner considering \u2018de-transitioning\u2019 \u2018in the next couple years,\u2019 author claims", "description": "A Kardashian family biographer claims Caitlyn Jenner is experiencing regret over transitioning from male to female.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/caitlyn-happy-ap660.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/caitlyn-jenner-considering-de-transitioning-in-the-next-couple-years-author-claims"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Reality,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "reality,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1462982400.0, "source": "http://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
