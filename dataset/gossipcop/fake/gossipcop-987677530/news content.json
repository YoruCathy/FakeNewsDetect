Producers have offered to have Joaquin home-schooled or provide a tutor for him, but she won\u2019t pull him out of school.\u201d\n\nProducers are trying to convince Ripa to get on board \u2014 even if it\u2019s just during the period when Idol goes live, the source said.\n\nBesides that, ratings have been tanking since Seacrest signed on, and \u201cbosses are telling Kelly [the move] will help the ratings because they\u2019ll have access to all the stars in Hollywood,\u201d spilled the source.\n\n\u201cBut Kelly feels once again the show that bears her name is being hijacked from her \u2014 which is what happened with Michael Strahan!\u201d\n\nSince Live launched in 1983, it\u2019s always been filmed in New York City \u2014 although the hosts have changed, with Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford, Strahan and guest hosts playing musical chairs.\n\nThe source added: \u201cKelly\u2019s fuming that ABC would even consider it! All of her family and friends are on the East Coast \u2014 and now she has to pack up and move for Ryan\u2019s sake? That\u2019s got to make her steaming mad!\n\n\u201cShe promised not to let this happen again to her and the show after Strahan jumped to Good Morning America. Now history seems to be repeating itself \u2014 and she won\u2019t have it!\u201d\n\nAnother insider on Live told Radar: \u201cKelly quit the show once before and she\u2019d do it again! When she was angry with ABC for favoring Michael, she refused to come to work for a week. Now that ABC is treating Ryan like royalty, Kelly could be gone for good. She\u2019s very emotional and thinks with her heart, not her head. Kelly needs to think she\u2019s the top priority.\u201d\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
