Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Pregnant Kylie Jenner. Yet \u2014 Kylie Jenner, 20, has not actually confirmed she is pregnant.\n\nFor some celebrities, this would not be a big deal \u2014 some stars get pregnant and do not say a word, even as \u201csources\u201d and \u201cinsiders\u201d dish to the tabloids, as illustrated above. For someone in the Kardashian-Jenner family, this is especially confusing.\n\nAD\n\nAfter all, these family members have become international superstars because they share nearly every detail of their lives, even the painful or uncomfortable moments. As a result, people have become inexplicably fascinated by all of them (Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Rob Kardashian), which has fueled their multimillion-dollar franchise of reality shows and sponsorships.\n\nAD\n\nSo the decision to keep Kylie\u2019s apparent pregnancy under wraps is very off-brand for the family. This month, speculation will probably hit even more of a fever pitch, as February is the oft-reported due date for her baby, reportedly a girl.\n\nThe non-confirmation of the news \u2014 reported by the tabloids in September and described as a \u201chappy\u201d surprise for Kylie and her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott \u2014 has sent some fans into a spiral. On Christmas Day, fans melted down when Kylie did not appear on the family\u2019s annual Christmas card. Starting Dec. 1, Kim released a new part of the photo every day, and many expected Kylie\u2019s announcement to be included in the final photo shoot. No dice.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, people keep searching for information. TMZ posted blurry footage of Kylie\u2019s first public appearance since the fall, although she\u2019s wearing baggy clothes. Kylie recently posed for a magazine shoot, but is strategically holding a baby lamb in front of her. Meanwhile, some think the announcement will be part of an episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d which wraps its current season in a few weeks: The website HelloGiggles reported Wikipedia briefly listed the season finale title as \u201cWe\u2019re Expecting!\u201d (The title is no longer listed on the Wikipedia page.)\n\nAD\n\nToday in Creative Ways Kylie Jenner Has Hidden Her Pregnancy for Fashion Jobs: a baby lamb in @THELOVEMAGAZINE! pic.twitter.com/vyu7vmgIdu \u2014 Alyssa Vingan Klein (@alyssavingan) January 29, 2018\n\nShould Kylie\u2019s baby arrive this month, it will join new cousin Chicago West, Kim and Kanye West\u2019s daughter who was born via surrogate last month. Khloe and her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson, are also expecting a baby in March. Although according to the tabloids, you might not see Kylie\u2019s baby\u2019s debut for quite some time.\n\n\u201cShe very much enjoys being out of the spotlight and can\u2019t wait to spend quiet time with the baby,\u201d a \u201csource\u201d told People, adding Kylie does not plan to sell any photos of her child. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t seem in any rush to get back to a more public life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRead more:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WJPDVFVQ5E7RDJ6YELCL3KPOY4.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NK_tNggvqvUHNCXNi4zQfFAW4rA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ACEJRXHXDA2EHF2TVIKLLJJXGQ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NK_tNggvqvUHNCXNi4zQfFAW4rA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ACEJRXHXDA2EHF2TVIKLLJJXGQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/02/02/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever/", "title": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever", "meta_data": {"description": "The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/02/02/kylie-jenners-mystery-pregnancy-might-be-the-most-confusing-kardashian-situation-ever/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NK_tNggvqvUHNCXNi4zQfFAW4rA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ACEJRXHXDA2EHF2TVIKLLJJXGQ.jpg", "title": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever", "description": "The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s mystery pregnancy might be the most confusing Kardashian situation ever", "description": "The decision to keep any personal news under wraps is very off-brand for the family."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-26T00:15:46.284Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517500800.0, "source": "http://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
