The pair previously collaborated on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle\u2019s debut, Shallow Grave.\n\nThe Bond script was reportedly a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2012 before returning (having previously quit) for 2015\u2019s Spectre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Craig in the most recent James Bond film, Spectre.

Purvis and Wade have previously written six Bond films, including all four Craig outings, as well as the final two starring his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan.\n\nHodge and Boyle\u2019s script \u2013 which is different in all respects \u2013 was thought to have been a work-in-progress until recently, and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a Bond film.\n\nA leaked casting-call sheet indicated that the key villain would be Russian, and Boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era.\n\n\u201cYou write in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world \u2013 but you also write in the modern world as well.\u201d\n\nBoyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a great idea so hopefully it will work\u201d \u2013 which some speculated could involve a high-concept plot in which Bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time \u2013 or, potentially, die.\n\nThe high-stakes nature of such a twist, and the controversial real-life issues the film may have explored, may well have proved a sticking point with producers. Bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality, with Spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage. However, grappling with issues such as sexual assault and Russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble.\n\nAlthough Mendes and Craig\u2019s tenure has put Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m (\u00a3232m), little compromise for the film\u2019s commercial prospects can be countenanced.\n\nBoyle and Hodge\u2019s script is unlikely to survive the director\u2019s exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade\u2019s draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest.\n\nProducers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Although there were four years between Craig\u2019s second outing, Quantum of Solace (2008) and his third, Skyfall (2012), the longest break between Bond films is only six years \u2013 between Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) \u2013 and that involved a change of actor in the leading role.\n\nThis makes it yet more likely that Craig, 50, will call it a day. Until there was confirmation he would return alongside Boyle, speculation had been rife that the actor, a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer, would move on, with Idris Elba and Tom Hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him.\n\nPromoting Spectre in 2015, Craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role; months later, his departure seemed all but certain following that of Mendes.\n\nIn 2016, Craig was reportedly offered $150m to star in another two Bond movies by Broccoli, and this year he was confirmed for at least one more.\n\nCraig and Boyle have worked together once before: when the former appeared as Bond, alongside the Queen, in a brief film that featured in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, which Boyle directed.\n\nMark Tildesley, Boyle\u2019s favoured production designer, was also recruited to the Bond film this year. His future on the project is now unknown.\n\nBoyle\u2019s latest film, a romcom scripted by Richard Curtis, is scheduled for release in September 2019 \u2013 just a month before the Bond movie was due to come out. It is distributed by Universal Pictures, which recently took on UK distribution rights to the Bond films from Sony Pictures, which was responsible for getting Boyle\u2019s most recent big screen release, T2: Trainspotting, into cinemas.\n\nPossible replacements for Boyle include Christopher Nolan, Christopher McQuarrie and Susanne Bier. McQuarrie\u2019s latest film, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, was widely praised for its Bond-style plot and stunts. The film, which stars Tom Cruise, has so far made $500m at the box office.", "images":
