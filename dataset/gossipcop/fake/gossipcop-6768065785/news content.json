She\u2019s also not allowed to read their text messages with their father.\n\nThe court also laid out a summer schedule for each of the children except Maddox, who is old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with Pitt, the documents read.\n\nPitt will have custody from June 8 to June 17 for four hours per day while he stays in London, where Jolie is renting a house. Pitt has to designate one or two of the minor children to spend time with at a time. The \u201cOcean\u2019s 13\u201d star also has to spend time with each child at least twice during this 10-day period.\n\nJolie is barred from being present during or interfering with Pitt\u2019s custodial time, the documents said.\n\nPitt will also have custody of his kids from July 8 through July 14, when a doctor will be required to be present and will meet with the kids before and after each two-day period. Pitt was once accused of child abuse but was ultimately cleared.\n\nFrom July 21 through July 29, Pitt will resume custody of the kids when he\u2019s back in California.\n\n\u201cIf the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with [Jolie] and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to [Pitt],\u201d the documents read.\n\n\u201cThis misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children,\u201d a spokesperson for Angelina Jolie told Page Six in a statement. \u201cFrom the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It\u2019s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/angelina-children.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/angelina-children.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/angelina-children.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/06/13/angelina-jolie-at-risk-of-losing-primary-custody-of-kids/", "title": "Angelina Jolie at risk of losing primary custody of kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
