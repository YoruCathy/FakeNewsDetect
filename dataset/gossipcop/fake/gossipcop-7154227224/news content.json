Gossip Cop summarizes a fabricated story that was in the print edition of OK!\n\n\u201cJolie, of course, starred in the original 2001 film and its 2003 sequel, but now [Alicia] Vikander will take over the actress\u2019s role for a new installment. A so-called \u2018source,\u2019 however, tells OK! that Jolie made her disapproval of the choice clear, hours after Alicia was cast last spring.\u201d\n\nOK! adds that the outlet\u2019s \u201cinsider\u201d says Jolie told the studio she was backing out of a planned cameo to make it seem like she\u2019s just looking out for the franchise, but the reality is that Jolie is jealous about Alicia\u2019s current success. However, in the same article, Gossip Cop claims the rumor is bogus.\n\n\u201cAngelina Jolie did NOT drop out of a cameo in the upcoming Tomb Raider reboot because she\u2019s upset about Alicia Vikander being cast as Lara Croft, despite a late and wrong tabloid report. Gossip Cop can once again debunk this claim. We\u2019re told it\u2019s not true,\u201d says columnist Andrew Shuster, who adds that Gossip Cop had already busted Star for a similar story last month.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first fabricated story this past week about Angelina Jolie that Gossip Cop had to bust. The site noted that the cover story of Star stated that Angelina Jolie and Kate Hudson were having a \u201cshowdown\u201d at the Golden Globes. The tabloid claims that there has been tension growing ever since Angelina Jolie found out that her ex Brad Pitt is \u201cromancing\u201d Kate Hudson.\n\nAngelina Jolie and Kate Hudson are not fighting.

I\u2019ve heard that Angie is out of her mind with jealousy, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she actually seeks Kate out and angrily confronts her behind the scenes. But Kate is nothing if not feisty, and she could give Angie a real piece of her mind if she\u2019s pushed!\u201d an insider claims.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has busted this story before it has the chance to go viral.\n\n\u201cAngelina Jolie and Kate Hudson are NOT having a \u2018showdown\u2019 at the Golden Globes, despite a tabloid cover story. Gossip Cop can bust the wholly fabricated report,\u201d says the gossip busting maven Shari Weiss, noting that Star has fabricated stories about an alleged showdown between Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston in the past \u2014 something which never happened.\n\nThere is one story that is true: Angelina Jolie has responded to Brad Pitt\u2019s request that all their divorce documents become sealed. People has the news.\n\nAngelina Jolie has finally approved the sealing of divorce documents. [Image by Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images]\n\n\u201cAngelina Jolie has agreed to Brad Pitt\u2019s request to have divorce documents pertaining to custody sealed \u2014 but she slams him in her new court filing\u2026While Jolie, 41, has agreed to keep documents sealed, she strongly disputes his claims that she freely publicized sensitive information \u2014 saying that he only made such accusations because he\u2019s \u2018terrified that the public will learn the truth.'\u201d\n\nAs People notes, a source close to the situation says that it\u2019s nice that Angelina has finally supported the sealing of the documents weeks after Pitt\u2019s request. However, considering that both the FBI and child services thoroughly investigated the matter and cleared Pitt, the source believes Angelina\u2019s line of attack doesn\u2019t make much sense.\n\nHowever, somebody on Angelina Jolie\u2019s PR team says that while Pitt may have been cleared in the investigations that he was abusive towards Maddox, his actions have hurt the children in the long term. You can bet that somebody from Brad Pitt\u2019s PR team will be firing back with a statement soon. There is little hope Jolie and Pitt can be civil with each other for the sake of their children.\n\n[Featured Image by Milos Bicanski/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/97a93d1391b1fd07c8523ce129a3c562?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angelina-jolie-kate-hudson-1.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/angelina-jolie-tomb-raider.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daryl Deino"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3862390/angelina-jolie-rumored-to-have-canceled-tomb-raider-reboot-cameo-debunked/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Has Not Canceled \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 Reboot Cameo [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/0kYK64cDAqk?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
