Tom Cruise is not quitting Scientology to reunite with his estranged daughter Suri Cruise, despite an inaccurate tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this story. We\u2019re told it\u2019s not true.\n\nCruise hasn\u2019t been seen with his 11-year-old daughter in more than four years, but according to the latest cover of Star, the actor is ready to cut ties with his religion in order to repair their relationship. A supposed \u201csource\u201d tells the magazine, \u201cIf he wants her back, he\u2019ll have to walk away from the church, which has been a huge part of his life, to say the least. Leaving Scientology would be the toughest decision he\u2019ll ever have to make.\u201d \u00a9 (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) Tom Cruise attends a special screening of \"The Mummy\" at AMC Loews Lincoln Square on Tuesday, June 6, 2017, in New York.\n\nThe outlet\u2019s questionable insider goes on to say that Cruise is nervous about defecting from the organization because he fears they\u2019ll set out to destroy him. \u201cIf Scientology declared open season on Tom, they could bury him, since they\u2019ve probably got all sorts of dirt on him from his audition sessions,\u201d says the alleged source. \u00a9 Gossip Cop (Star)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unspoken threat, but Tom has to be aware that the church would do everything in its power to keep him from leaving,\u201d adds the suspicious source, who further contends that in order to leave the religion without repercussions, Cruise may try to cut a deal \u201cwhere he would be left in peace as long as he doesn\u2019t speak out against Scientology. That way, both sides win.\u201d\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the situation, who exclusively assures us that the movie star has no plans to quit the church. Cruise, who\u2019s been a committed member of Scientology for more than 30 years, recently described it as a \u201cbeautiful religion.\u201d He added, \u201cWithout it, I wouldn\u2019t be where I am. I\u2019m incredibly proud.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting, Star has published several false stories about Cruise\u2019s complicated relationship with his daughter. Gossip Cop has previously busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that the young girl has made secret phone calls to her dad behind Katie Holmes\u2019 back. We also shot down a phony story about Suri begging her dad via Skype to spend time with her. This latest article on the subject is similarly fabricated.\n\nFor more tabloid tales debunked, click on: Debunking the week's tabloid stories: Jan. 26, 2018", "images":
