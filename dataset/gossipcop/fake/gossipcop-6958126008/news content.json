However, after being spotted holding hands with 90210 actor Trevor Donovan in Los Angeles, the 19 year-old model and actress took to Twitter to dispel relationship rumors.\n\n\"Y'all need to chill lol hand-holding is a very common thing,\" she posted in a since-deleted tweet along with pictures of her holding hands with her female friends, including Sofia Richie.\n\nTrevor, who is 38, also denied the relationship in a statement provided to Just Jared Jr.\n\n\u201cThey are just friends,\u201d a rep for the actor said. \"Both are big animal lovers and advocates and are working on a \u2018Be Pawsome, Adopt!\u2019 campaign for local L.A. shelters.... They are friends who want to help the helpless.\u201d\n\nThe starlet broke up with her then-boyfriend Michael Snoody last year, so while she is single, that doesn't mean she has to be cool about speculation on her love life. That said, we're glad to see that she\u2019s not afraid to clap back.\n\nRelated: Paris Jackson Explains Why She Embraced a Life in the Spotlight", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524d40c31d97e71555ec4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524ddb596906a6f6e8a98/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/facebook.jpg", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524d40c31d97e71555ec4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Paul Brammer", "John Paul Bramme"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/paris-jackson-denies-relationship-trevor-donovan", "title": "Paris Jackson Denies Relationship With Trevor Donovan", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "John Paul Brammer", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "After photos of them holding hands surfaced, Paris Jackson took to Twitter in a since-deleted tweet refuting the claim.", "id": "5964f60314b7b375cd34f3a8", "keywords": "culture,paris jackson", "news_keywords": "culture,paris jackson", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5964f60314b7b375cd34f3a8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After photos of them holding hands surfaced, Paris Jackson took to Twitter in a since-deleted tweet refuting the claim.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524df0c31d97e71555ec6/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524df0c31d97e71555ec6/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She denied being involved with the 38-year-old actor.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524d40c31d97e71555ec4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Paris Jackson Is Clapping Back at Rumors She's Dating Trevor Donovan", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/paris-jackson-denies-relationship-trevor-donovan"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "She denied being involved with the 38-year-old actor.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/596524d40c31d97e71555ec4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Paris Jackson Is Clapping Back at Rumors She's Dating Trevor Donovan"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
