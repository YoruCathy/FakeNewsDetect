HL learned, Maddox is \u2018the man of the house,\u2019 so he was caring for Shiloh!\n\nAngelina Jolie, 42, had her son Pax Jolie-Pitt, 14, accompany her to the 2018 Golden Globes on Jan. 7. But while some may have been surprised she didn\u2019t bring her eldest, son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, 16, Maddox wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way! In fact, the teen is now apparently \u201cthe man of the house\u201d since Angie\u2019s split from Brad Pitt, 54, and he was put in charge of taking care of his injured sister, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, 11. After all, Shiloh reportedly broke her collarbone this past week during a family vacation to Lake Tahoe. Click here to see pics of Maddox.\n\n\u201cMaddox has taken on the role of caretaker in the family, and just like his mom, he\u2019s not a huge fan of awards shows and the red carpet, so he preferred to stay home and look after his little sister Shiloh rather than go to the Golden Globes with Angelina,\u201d a source close to Angie told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cPax loves dressing up and hitting the carpet, and he\u2019s much more naturally sociable and comfortable in the spotlight than his brother.\u201d Pax looked super dapper in his black tux as he smiled and posed for the cameras alongside his famous mom. There\u2019s no question the teen fit right in! Meanwhile, Maddox has never been a fan of the limelight.\n\n\u201cMaddox views life much more seriously than Pax, and already has a great passion for philanthropy and human rights,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cHe finds the glamor and glitz of Hollywood a little distasteful, so he was more than happy to skip the Globes and allow his brother to bask in the spotlight.\u201d On top of that, Maddox\u2019s new role has given him responsibilities that he doesn\u2019t take lightly. In fact, the 16-year-old enjoys helping his mom out by watching his younger siblings.\n\n\u201cMaddox has totally assumed the role of \u2018man of the house\u2019 since his mom and dad split. He\u2019s really stepped up to the plate and loves to take some of the pressure of looking after the younger kids off of the shoulders of his mom,\u201d our source revealed. How sweet is THAT? Clearly Angie has some very helpful children on her hands!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 were you surprised to see Pax at the Golden Globes rather than Maddox?", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nomad-pipe-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F08%2Fangelina-jolie-maddox-golden-globes-date-why-she-brought-pax%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2939183", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kenya-moore-expose-nene-leakes-rhoa-reunion-bravo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/drag-race-recap-2.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kylie-jenner-skims-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/angelina_maddox-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-charlie-sheen-daughters-backgrid-mega-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Home_Photo_010102.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/angelina_maddox-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/angelina_maddox-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Kristyn Burtt", "Lana Parker", "Andy Swift", "Brandt Ranj", "Tyler Hersko", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/08/angelina-jolie-maddox-golden-globes-date-why-she-brought-pax/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Had Maddox Watch Hurt Shiloh While She Went To Globes: He\u2019s \u2018The Man\u2019 At Home", "meta_data": {"description": "Instead of bringing her oldest child, Maddox, to the Golden Globes, Angelina Jolie took son Pax.
