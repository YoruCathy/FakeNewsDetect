Seven months after welcoming daughter Chicago, the couple are planning to have a fourth child, multiple sources reveal exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly.\n\n\u201c[They] have one last embryo left,\u201d one insider says, adding that the sex is male.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, and the Grammy winner, 41, plan to have the embryo implanted in a gestational carrier \u201csoon,\u201d a second insider tells Us.\n\nThis will not be the first time Kardashian and West, who wed in May 2014, turn to surrogacy. They hired a gestational carrier for Chicago after the social media mogul suffered high-risk pregnancies with daughter North, 5, and son Saint, 2, due to preeclampsia and placenta accreta.\n\n\u201cDoctors said that it wasn\u2019t safe for my \u2014 or the baby\u2019s \u2014 health to carry on my own,\u201d Kardashian wrote on her website in January, just three days after Chicago was born. \u201cAfter exploring many options, Kanye and I decided to use a gestational carrier. Although I have used the term surrogate in the past, a gestational carrier is actually the technical term for a woman who carries a baby that she has no biological relationship to. A traditional surrogate donates her egg, is artificially inseminated with the father\u2019s sperm and then carries the baby to term. Since we implanted my fertilized egg in our gestational carrier, our baby is biologically mine and Kanye\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe reality star has long expressed her desire to have a big family. That said, she\u2019ll likely draw the line at four kids. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle more than that,\u201d she told Elle in April. \u201cMy time is spread really thin. And I think it\u2019s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.\u201d\n\nFor more on Kimye\u2019s plans for baby No. 4, including whether they plan to hire the same surrogate, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d below!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kim-Kardashian-and-Kanye-West-Are-Expecting-Baby.jpg?w=252", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kim-Kardashian-and-Kanye-West-Are-Expecting-Baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1512px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Kim-Kardashian-and-Kanye-West-Are-Expecting-Baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1512px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kim-kardashian-kanye-wests-last-embryo-for-baby-no-4-is-a-boy/", "title": "Kim Kardashian, Kanye West\u2019s \u2018Last Embryo\u2019 for Baby No. 4 Is a Boy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are planning to have a fourth child via surrogate, and it\u2019s a boy, multiple sources tell Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Boy or Girl?
