We\u2019re hearing exclusively the two may be ready to take the next step, sooner rather than later!\n\nAriel Winter, 20, and Levi Meaden, 30, have made their relationship work and thrive through busy acting careers and the craziness of Hollywood. Now, HollywoodLife is hearing exclusively that the two are almost ready to get married and start a family! \u201cAriel would like to start a family young and since she is financially stable, she wants to take a little bit of a break from acting and pursue marriage and have some kids after Modern Family is officially done,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cLevi is a little older than her and he is down and on the same wavelength as her, as well. They have a pretty great relationship and they both plan on being with each other forever, so why not start forever sooner than later.\u201d The pair have been together since November 2016, and have proved they are the most normal couple in Hollywood \u2014 grocery shopping, walking dogs and support each other in their careers!\n\nAriel is preparing to film the final season of Modern Family, which she has starred in since 2009. Levi, on the other hand, just celebrated the opening of his film with Gabrielle Union, Breaking In. Ariel supported him at the movie\u2019s premiere, and gave him a shout out in a sweet Instagram post. \u201cCan\u2019t believe @breakinginmovie finally opens in theaters tomorrow!!! @gabunion kicks ass & @levi_meaden is absolutely amazing along with the rest of the cast! Proud of you my love,\u201d the actress wrote with a clip from the film.\n\nLevi admitted to People that the couple helps each other out when it comes to acting world. \u201cIt helps when it\u2019s somebody else who is in the industry,\u201d he said of dating Ariel. \u201cIt helps when you get a role and run it past each other and see what they think and read the script and try things. It\u2019s really helpful.\u201d Still, he added, he\u2019s trying to navigate his new fame, saying, \u201cWe also try to, in our private life, keep it separate from the industry and try to keep it grounded and normal and about us.\u201d We think these two are absolutely couple goals!", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/ali_stagnitta.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ariel-winter-levi-meaden-kids-in-future-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mw-mtmh-newsong.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ariel-winter-levi-meaden-kids-in-future-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/better-butt-workout.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://i2.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/NHIE_102_Unit_00153R-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/htgawm-6x12-1.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/emrata-brushing-teeth-in-crop-top-splash-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/heiress-harris-dance-moves-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/julianne-derek-hough-be-our-guest-abc-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-air-purifier-amazon.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F15%2Fariel-winter-levi-meaden-ready-for-marriage-kids-soon%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3143134"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ariel-winter-levi-meaden-kids-in-future-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ali Stagnitta", "Julia Guerra", "Lana Parker", "Rebecca Iannucci", "Jon Freeman", "Kristen Lopez", "On-Air Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/15/ariel-winter-levi-meaden-ready-for-marriage-kids-soon/", "title": "Ariel Winter Ready To Marry Levi Meaden & Have Kids \u2018Sooner Than Later\u2019: Her Plans Revealed", "meta_data": {"description": "There's no denying Ariel Winter and Levi Meaden are so in love.
