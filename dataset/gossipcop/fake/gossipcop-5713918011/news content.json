People are having a bad time \u2014 that's horrible.\"\n\nTheroux continued, saying he believes it's \"nonsense\" that Aniston is being talked about in relation to Pitt and Jolie's divorce.\n\n\"There's an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don't have that appetite,\" Theroux said.\n\n\"But I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to b*tch about. It's shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.\"\n\nAlmost as soon as news broke that Angelina Jolie had filed for divorce from her husband of two years (and partner of 12), Jennifer Aniston was brought into the conversation, even though she and Pitt divorced in 2005 after five years of marriage.\n\nBrad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in 2001.\n\nBut rumours have persisted to this day that Pitt allegedly cheated on Aniston with Jolie while they were filming \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" making Aniston a sympathetic character in the media.\n\nEven BFF Courteney Cox came to her friend's defence, saying she should be left out of the divorce conversation. \"It's not about [Jennifer],\" Cox told Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday. \"I feel like we're exacerbating it by even talking about it.\"\n\nJen and Justin on Sept. 26, 20216.\n\nAnd Theroux has nothing but love for his wife of one year. \"We appreciate each other's sense of humour, we respect each other and we get along,\" the 45-year-old actor told Entertainment Tonight on the secret behind his successful marriage. \"I know it sounds simple, but it's true!\"\n\nAs of press time, Aniston has not commented on Pitt and Jolie's divorce, however she has been photographed out and about in New York with Theroux.\n\nTheroux and Aniston have been together since 2011 and married in 2015.\n\nAlso on HuffPost", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e9a2d442500005706eafd90.jpeg?cache=mUes4Li2K0&ops=434_244",
