It\u2019s not for public consumption.\u201d\n\nPierce was one of the few \u201cSuits\u201d stars who didn\u2019t attend Meghan\u2019s wedding to Prince Harry, but he reminisced about a sweet moment he shared with Meghan when they were filming her on-screen wedding for the series.\n\n\u201cWe had a moment I cherish,\u201d said the 54-year-old, who played Robert Zane. \u201cI was sitting with Meghan in her wedding dress, as we waited for a set-up. We were alone. I said to her, \u2018Your life is going to change. It\u2019s going to be amazing and I\u2019m very happy for you, but I want you to know that I\u2019m your friend, and no matter where you are or what\u2019s going on \u2014 if the fishbowl that you\u2019re in ever starts getting to you \u2014 you can call me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThomas claims he hasn\u2019t spoken to Meghan, 37, since he was busted for staging paparazzi photos ahead of her wedding in May \u2014 which he missed due to a reported heart attack.\n\nLast week, Thomas compared the secrecy of Kensington Palace to that of the Church of Scientology.\n\nHe previously claimed that Meghan was \u201cfaking her smile\u201d in public outings with the royal family and admitted to hanging up on Harry when the ginger prince reportedly warned him that the press would \u201ceat him alive.\u201d\n\nThomas then lamented that he has no way of getting in touch with Meghan and that she changed her phone number.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/meghan-markle1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/meghan-markle1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/meghan-markle1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/08/28/meghan-markles-onscreen-dad-puts-her-real-one-to-shame/", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s on-screen dad shades her real father", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
