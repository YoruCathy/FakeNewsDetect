Well, at least no one is criticizing the stunning images that ran with it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

Problem is, the accompanying article has definitely rankled a lot of folks, including Robbie's fellow Australians:\n\nCohen has also been savaged on Twitter for the way he writes about Robbie, which some say overly sexualizes the admittedly very sexy Wolf of Wall Street star.\n\nBut clearly, some comments are being wrongly criticized for being \u201ccreepy,\u201d when they actually aren't all that horrifying.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what she was wearing, but it was simple, her hair combed around those painfully blue eyes. We sat in the corner. She looked at me and smiled.\u201d\n\nThis? Totally normal. Was she supposed to frown?\n\n\u201cWe sat for a moment in silence. She was thinking of something; I was thinking of something else.\u201d\n\nOK, it's perhaps not the most delicate way to phrase it, but this doesn't necessarily mean he's thinking about something sexual. But then again maybe Cohen was thinking about how sexy Margot Robbie looked sitting in front of him. Can you really blame him?\n\nThen again, some comments actually were a little strange.\n\n\u201cShe can be sexy and composed even while naked but only in character.\u201d\n\n???\n\n\u201cAs I said, she is from Australia. To understand her, you should think about what that means.\u201d\n\nIs Cohen saying he can\u2019t understand her because of her accent? Maybe hasn\u2019t watched that oddly riveting video where she explains Aussie slang.\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that the story struck a nerve, it\u2019s also not the most offensive celebrity interview of recent times. It's not even that offensive, if you think about it.\n\nLet's not forget that Margot Robbie is an absolute babe, and Cohen, who recently wrote for HBO's now-canceled Vinyl, was just a guy trying to keep his shit together in the presence of her undeniable greatness. (Though he's on his own with the Australian stuff).\n\nMoral of the story? There's really no need to collectively lose our minds over the Vanity Fair story on Margot Robbie.
