CNN\u2019s Don Lemon is \u201cperhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting\u201d and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a \u201cno-talent guy\u201d who talks \u201cfilthy.\u201d\n\nThose were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I\u2019ve been able not to watch or read things that aren\u2019t pleasant,\u201d he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. \u201cAnd it keeps you young.\u201d\n\nThere was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.\n\n\u201cWashington Post, New York Times, they\u2019re really, really dishonest,\u201d he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. \u201cYou people are quite dishonest in all fairness.\u201d He said he used to watch MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.\n\nThe one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.\n\nSpokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president\u2019s criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, \u201cHis comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.\u201d Trump\u2019s claims about CNN\u2019s Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.\n\nHere\u2019s an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:\n\nFor instance I don\u2019t watch CNN. I don\u2019t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don\u2019t do interviews and stuff and want to \u2026 He went the other way. Which is fine. He\u2019s got some problems. But I don\u2019t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don\u2019t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I\u2019m watching Fox. But they\u2019re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don\u2019t mean they \u2013 if I do something wrong. But it\u2019s really, honestly it\u2019s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he\u2019s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He\u2019s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who\u2019s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it\u2019s like \u2013 sometimes they\u2019ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they\u2019ll start screaming, we\u2019re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I\u2019ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he\u2019s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They\u2019re all doing well because of me. But it\u2019s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It\u2019s just bad. It\u2019s an ability I never thought I\u2019d have. I never thought I\u2019d have the ability to say, they\u2019re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won\u2019t watch it. And it\u2019s amazing, it doesn\u2019t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They\u2019re really dishonest. I mean they\u2019re really dishonest.\n\nTrump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert\u2019s blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:\n\nYou see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There\u2019s nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying. I\u2019ve done his show. \u2026 But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high\u2014highest rating. The highest rating he\u2019s ever had.\n\nGet our Politics Newsletter. Sign up to receive the day's most important political stories from Washington and beyond. Please enter a valid email address.
