But if NBC paid such a high price for the political commentator-turned-perky-morning-host, why is she nowhere to be found on this year\u2019s list of top-paid TV hosts?\n\nWell it turns out Kelly\u2019s salary, which is about $18 million per year, is not all that abnormal compared to her morning show counterparts, and without many side projects, her earnings did not make the $21 million cut.\n\nKelly\u2019s Today earnings line up with those of other morning stars, most of whom also didn\u2019t make the list. Matt Lauer earns $20 million for his longstanding role as a Today anchor, and Robin Roberts of Good Morning America makes $18 million annually, while her cohost George Stephanopoulos makes about $15 million. (Michael Strahan, who actually made the Top-Earning TV Host List, makes closer to $13 million for Good Morning America, but has a number of other revenue streams.) Kelly Ripa earned about $18 million last year from Live!, but will see her salary increase next year to over $20 million.\n\nNetworks are willing to pay top dollar to these morning show hosts, as the competitive time slot is one of the most lucrative on television.\n\n\u201cThe profits come from the morning shows,\u201d says one industry insider. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple equation of math; that\u2019s where advertisers shell out.\u201d\n\nThe A.M. hours attract one of the few remaining consistent and targetable audiences for advertisers, plus the promise of being surrounded by trusted content. This means high revenues at little cost, seeing that besides the hosts and crews, these shows have few production expenditures for the networks.\n\n\u201cBecause there is so much fragmentation, finding places where there is this sort of concentration is hugely efficient, effective and attractive to advertisers,\u201d says Adam Klein, an adjunct professor at Columbia Journalism School, adding that morning show audiences are often quite homogeneous in terms of product interests.\n\nA popular morning show can also secure audiences for later hours. \u201cIt sets the dial for the rest of the day,\u201d says Les Rose, a professor of practice in broadcast and digital journalism at Syracuse\u2019s Newhouse school, explaining why popular hosts are worth their paychecks.\n\nThe World's Highest-Paid TV Hosts: Dr. Phil, Ellen DeGeneres And Ryan Seacrest Lead\n\nThus Kelly\u2019s salary is not considerably higher than those of her peers. But she came close enough to the cut-off that she could have made the list had she had a few revenue streams beyond her television paycheck. While she was paid a hefty multi-million dollar advance for her book Settle For More in early 2016, she did not sell enough copies to earn more on top of that, meaning her earnings for Forbes' scoring period (the 12 months leading up to June 1, 2017) were not effected. Additionally, she had no product endorsements or licensing deals, as some non-news show hosts, such as Ryan Seacrest and Ellen DeGeneres, do.\n\nPerhaps the most noteworthy part of Kelly\u2019s payday, then, is that she achieved her eight-figure salary without putting in the legwork to prove herself on morning television--something that took years for anchors like Lauer, Roberts and Stephanopoulos.\n\n\u201cShe was brought in knowing they\u2019d have to invest some time on her,\u201d explains Klein.\n\nIt\u2019s true: The sharp commentator of Fox News is finding her footing as a bubbly morning host who actively avoids talking her former bread and butter--politics. The transition has not been an easy one. Her Sunday night newsmagazine, which aired over the summer, got off to a bumpy start both in terms of ratings and content, including a softball interview with Vladimir Putin and controversial one with Alex Jones.\n\nEven With The $32 Million Settlement, Bill O'Reilly Made Millions Last Year\n\nHer Today debut has been similarly off, though it has seen improvements more recently as she has discussed the various Hollywood sexual harassment and assault scandals--something which she allegedly experienced first-hand at Fox News. In her first week, NBC ratings were down over 12% from the year prior, and they declined by double digit percentages throughout October. The reviews were also rough: She upset guests Jane Fonda and Debra Messing, and reportedly is having a hard time booking celebrities.\n\nIt is likely too soon to tell, then, if the $18 million salary--one that may be reasonable for seasoned and beloved morning show anchors--is worth it for her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like horse racing,\u201d says Rose. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to bet on the right pony, and NBC bet on her.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/files/2015/02/maddieberg_avatar_1425069302-136x136.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F7c9c8673c88e42b9a6248e716cd52066%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/7c9c8673c88e42b9a6248e716cd52066/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/168674866/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F7c9c8673c88e42b9a6248e716cd52066%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeline Berg"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/11/07/why-megyn-kelly-didnt-make-the-list-of-top-earning-tv-hosts/", "title": "Why Megyn Kelly Didn't Make The List Of Highest-Paid TV Hosts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Why Megyn Kelly Didn't Make The List Of Highest-Paid TV Hosts", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F7c9c8673c88e42b9a6248e716cd52066%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2017-11-07T10:17:11-05:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2017/11/07/why-megyn-kelly-didnt-make-the-list-of-top-earning-tv-hosts/", "description": "Despite the hype surrounding Megyn Kelly's 'Today' salary, she is not out-earning her morning show peers.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Megyn Kelly Didn't Make The List Of Highest-Paid TV Hosts", "description": "Despite the hype surrounding Megyn Kelly's 'Today' salary, she is not out-earning her morning show peers.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107225820im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F7c9c8673c88e42b9a6248e716cd52066%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "creator": "@maddieberg"}, "description": "Despite the hype surrounding Megyn Kelly's 'Today' salary, she is not out-earning her morning show peers.", "author": "Madeline Berg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Madeline Berg", "section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/business/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/3609-4953", "published": "2017-11-07", "modified": "2017-11-07"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509984000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
