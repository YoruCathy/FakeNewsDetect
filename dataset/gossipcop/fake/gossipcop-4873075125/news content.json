The magazine says the couple have been in therapy to fix their alleged marriage problems, but Gossip Cop looked into the report and we can exclusively set the record straight.\n\nTeigen opened up earlier this year about suffering postpartum depression after giving birth to daughter Luna last year, as well as her struggle with drinking too much. The model has since taken steps to work through both issues, but the latest issue of In Touch insists her marriage is falling apart over the situation.\n\n\u201cThey are fighting nonstop,\u201d a so-called \u201cinsider\u201d tells the magazine. \u201cThey have been in marriage counseling for the last six months. They\u2019re trying very hard to make their marriage work.\u201d\n\nThe outlet\u2019s questionable source further alleges there\u2019s \u201ca terrible atmosphere\u201d in Teigen and Legend\u2019s home because she\u2019s \u201cbeen acting paranoid and jealous\u201d and \u201cthey end up fighting about it all the time.\u201d The supposed insider continues, \u201cJohn has tried to be patient because he realizes this is a difficult time for Chrissy, but he is getting wiped out\u2026 It seems like they are trying to get through the day.\u201d The dubious source concludes, \u201cJohn and Chrissy\u2019s friends worry the marriage just won\u2019t survive.\u201d\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the couple about their alleged marital woes, and we\u2019re exclusively assured the tabloid\u2019s account of events is simply \u201cnot true.\u201d We\u2019re told Legend and Teigen\u2019s relationship is going strong, and the claim otherwise is entirely inaccurate. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had to debunk a phony article about the happy spouses being at odds.\n\nGossip Cop busted MediaTakeOut two years ago when it wrongly alleged Legend and Teigen were \u201cheaded for divorce\u201d over constant arguments. Obviously, the couple is still very much together, and this latest story regarding their supposed marriage problems is equally bogus.\n\nKim K. supposedly replacing Kelly Ripa and more tabloid tales debunked:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=bf643cbcd2f34362843bac68f34933f3&rnd=636412444441889129&rf=&tp=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmusic%252Fcelebrity%252Fjohn-legend-chrissy-teigen-not-on-verge-of-splitting-despite-report%252Far-AArVunc&di=509&lng=en-us&cv.product=prime&pn=article&activityId=bf643cbcd2f34362843bac68f34933f3&d.dgk=tmx.pc.webkit&d.imd=0&st.dpt=music-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=music", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&rn=636412444441889129&c7=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmusic%252Fcelebrity%252Fjohn-legend-chrissy-teigen-not-on-verge-of-splitting-despite-report%252Far-AArVunc&c8=&c9=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AArVwWv.img", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/9b/e151e5.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=509&pi=&ps=&su=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmusic%252Fcelebrity%252Fjohn-legend-chrissy-teigen-not-on-verge-of-splitting-despite-report%252Far-AArVunc&pageid=articlevnext&mkt=en-us&pn=article&pp=False&cv.product=prime&cv.partner=Gossip%2BCop&cv.publcat=Gossip%2BCop%2BMedia&st.dpt=music-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636412444441889129&rf=&rid=bf643cbcd2f34362843bac68f34933f3&cvs=Browser&subcvs=music&cv.entityId=AArVunc&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AAdsRm7&ar=0&d.dgk=tmx.pc.webkit&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=bf643cbcd2f34362843bac68f34933f3&pm="], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AArVwWv.img", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724/https://www.gossipcop.com/john-legend-split-chrissy-teigen-marriage-problems/", "title": "John Legend, Chrissy Teigen not 'on verge of splitting,' despite report", "meta_data": {"application-name": "John Legend, Chrissy Teigen not 'on verge of splitting,' despite report", "cq": "passed", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ab1142", "msapplication-TileImage": "//static-entertainment-eus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/1f/08ced4.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "description": "One of this week\u2019s new tabloids claims John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are \u201con the verge of splitting,\u201d but there\u2019s no truth to the breakup tale.&nbsp;", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "sharing_url": "http://a.msn.com/0B/en-us/AArVunc", "og": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724/http://www.msn.com/en-us/music/celebrity/john-legend-chrissy-teigen-not-on-verge-of-splitting-despite-report/ar-AArVunc", "title": "John Legend, Chrissy Teigen not 'on verge of splitting,' despite report", "description": "One of this week\u2019s new tabloids claims John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are \u201con the verge of splitting,\u201d but there\u2019s no truth to the breakup tale.&nbsp;", "type": "article", "site_name": "MSN", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170917112724im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AArVwWv.img"}, "fb": {"app_id": 125117174535490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
