Is it because of Zooey\u2019s pregnancy mood swings? Share this\n\nActors Zooey Deschanel and Jake Johnson are feuding on the sets of the TV series New Girl. The show had to pay the price because of their fight.\n\nZooey and Jake\u2019s quarrel gets heavy for the show\n\nOne of their co-stars says that,\n\n\u201ccan\u2019t stand each other\u201d\n\nSo Jake and Zooey are not in good terms with each other and because of their behavior, it is affecting in the drama series as well. Thus the TRP of the show is going low. The producers of the show are having a headache because of the actors.\n\nRelationship between Jess and Nick also lead the show to suffer\n\nIn the finale of the fourth season of New Girl, there is a reunion between the characters of Jake Johnson and Zooey Deschanel. But the actors\u2019 are not ready to patch up.\n\nSources say,\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re just good friends right now. I know a lot of fans want more, but personally I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the cards right now. What I personally think, is that I really like the Nick and Jess dynamic together, but I think Season 3 it was just too much. I don\u2019t think the show was ready for them to be together for an entire season.\u201d\n\nReason for their feud?\n\nThe main reason for their fight is said to be Jake\u2019s attitude after he got other roles. He makes her feel junior and inferior to her. He has been starred in Jurassic World and Let\u2019s Be Cops.\n\nMoreover, he believes that he is more superior than Jake and his this attitude is causing the war between the starts,\n\n\u201cHer attitude is: This is my show, and Jake is just jealous. The tension is palpable on set, it\u2019s amazing they hide it as well as they do.\u201d\n\nYou may like to read Actress Rachel McAdams and Jamie Linden welcome a baby boy!
