The outside is decorated with frog planters, \u00adbutterfly chairs, a hot-pink pig-shaped grill, \u00adsunflowers and daisies. This is Rainbow Land, the boho recording studio whose owner, Miley Cyrus, is on this sunny April afternoon sitting cross-legged in a swivel chair before a sound board, dressed way down with unruly long hair, cutoffs and a vintage tee that reads \u201cMalibu\u201d on the front.\n\nCyrus -- who\u2019s about to play me 10 songs off a new album that promises to (yet again) transform one of the most inimitable, unpredictable careers in recent pop \u00adhistory -- is somehow animated and serene at the same time. It\u2019s clear from the way her words tumble forth that she\u2019s \u00adbreaking a months long self-imposed \u201cmedia blackout\u201d and eager to unpack her latest thinking on everything from her alienation from hip-hop to engaging with Donald Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d she says with her \u00adsignature raspy-voiced charm, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t smoked weed in three weeks!\u201d Cyrus -- who\u2019s sitting across from a lighted wall plaque that reads \u201cIt\u2019s 4:20 Somewhere\u201d -- elaborates on why she decided to quit \u201cfor a second\u201d: \u201cI like to surround myself with people that make me want to get better, more evolved, open. And I was noticing, it\u2019s not the people that are stoned. I want to be super clear and sharp, because I know exactly where I want to be.\u201d\n\nWhere is that, exactly? It is, among other things, on her leafy Malibu compound that includes Rainbow Land. Cyrus, 24, shares the property with seven dogs, two pigs, two miniature horses and one Australian: fiance Liam Hemsworth, the actor with whom Cyrus reunited last year after a 2013 breakup. Hemsworth bought the property in 2014, but Cyrus moved in and has left her mark on it. (She also keeps a home with her mom, Tish, in Studio City.) In Malibu, when she\u2019s not making music or doing two hours of Ashtanga yoga daily, Cyrus says she likes nothing better than walking her dogs or grocery shopping, where she\u2019s generally unbothered. \u201cI love talking to people, and I approach them in a normal, \u2018Don\u2019t treat me different, \u2019cause I\u2019m not\u2019 way. That\u2019s what started this evolution for me, getting out of my Dead Petz phase,\u201d she says, referring to her 2015 album, the tour for which featured her in a unicorn outfit with a strap-on phallus. \u201cPeople stare at me anyway, but people stare at me a lot when I\u2019m dressed as a \u00adfucking cat.\u201d\n\nOn May 11, fans and haters alike will get a dose of New Miley with \u201cMalibu,\u201d the first single off an as-yet-untitled album coming later this year. It\u2019s a breezy love song about Hemsworth -- gimmick-free pop-rock unlike anything she has recorded before, whether as Hannah Montana, the punky Disney princess who scored three Billboard 200 No. 1s in the \u201900s; or as herself, on 2013\u2019s daring Bangerz (another No. 1); or the straight-to-SoundCloud experiment Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz. When Cyrus sings, \u201cI never would\u2019ve believed you if three years ago you told me I\u2019d be here writing this song,\u201d she could as easily be referring to her music as to her relationship.\n\nWhile Bangerz and Petz bore the unmistakable stamps of their respective collaborators, Mike Will Made-It and Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, the new album will be Cyrus\u2019 most DIY to date. She wrote the lyrics and melodies \u00adherself, and producer-writer Oren Yoel (who co-wrote the Bangerz track \u201cAdore You,\u201d which hit No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100) plays all the \u00adinstruments. Cyrus wrote one song for Hillary Clinton and another for women in the workplace, but overall, the album\u2019s less explicitly political than it is personal. That extends to the music, which adds an unprecedented dose of twang to a mix that includes quiet acoustic turns and epic pop. \u201cThis is Miley leaning into her roots more than I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d says her father, country singer and actor Billy Ray Cyrus, who tells a story of Waylon Jennings teaching a young Miley guitar chords at the kitchen table. \u201cFor her, this is honest.\u201d It\u2019s also a showcase for her voice, one of the most expressive in music. \u201cMy main concern isn\u2019t radio,\u201d says Cyrus, whose \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d spent three weeks at No. 1 in 2013. \u201cI truly don\u2019t even listen to it.\u201d\n\nCyrus was first inspired to reach beyond her circle of \u201coutspoken liberals\u201d and \u00adcultivate \u00adcountry fans and red staters in 2016, when she began as a coach on NBC\u2019s stalwart talent competition The Voice. (She will rejoin for season 13 this fall.) \u201cI like talking to people that don\u2019t agree with me, but I don\u2019t think I can do that in an aggressive way,\u201d says Cyrus. \u201cI don\u2019t think those people are going to listen to me when I\u2019m sitting there in nipple pasties, you know?\u201d\n\nAfter Trump was elected \u00adpresident, Cyrus -- who first \u00adsupported Bernie Sanders and, when she won the Democratic \u00adnomination, Clinton -- launched #HopefulHippies, an initiative of her Happy Hippie youth-activism nonprofit that \u00adencourages people to \u201cturn emotion into action.\u201d \u201cI have to ask myself, \u2018How am I going to create real change?\u2019\u201d she says, \u201cand not just \u00adfucking preach to the choir anymore.\u201d With the new album, Cyrus hopes to reach the other side of the aisle. \u201cThis record is a reflection of the fact that yes, I don\u2019t give a fuck, but right now is not a time to not give a fuck about people,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m \u00adgiving the world a hug and saying, \u2018Hey, look. We\u2019re good -- I love you.\u2019 And I hope you can say you love me back.\u201d\n\nWhere exactly did you write \u00ad\u201cMalibu\u201d?\n\nOn the way to The Voice. I drive myself everywhere, but that day I decided to Uber, and I was trying not to sing out loud because someone else was in the car.\n\nPeople might call it sentimental.\n\nThey\u2019re going to talk about me if I come out of a restaurant with Liam. So why not put the power back in my relationship and say, \u201cThis is how I feel\u201d?\n\nAfter you guys broke up, you said something like, \u201cI\u2019m so immersed in work, I can\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\n\nYeah, but also \u2019cause I needed to change so much. And changing with someone else not changing like that is too hard. Suddenly you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t recognize you anymore.\u201d We had to refall for each other.\n\nThe new album is pretty singer-\u00adsongwriter-y, no?\n\nYeah. But not granola. I don\u2019t listen to Ed Sheeran and John Mayer and stuff.\n\nDid folk singer Melanie Safka [with whom Cyrus performed in 2015] \u00adinfluence you?\n\nShe did, and I grew up with her. But I also love that new Kendrick [Lamar] song [\u201cHumble\u201d]: \u201cShow me somethin\u2019 natural like ass with some stretch marks.\u201d I love that because it\u2019s not \u201cCome sit on my dick, suck on my cock.\u201d I can\u2019t listen to that anymore. That\u2019s what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much \u201cLamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock\u201d -- I am so not that.\n\nI was torn on whether I was going to work with certain producers that I really like. But I feel if we\u2019re not on the same page \u00adpolitically ... My record is political, but the sound bite doesn\u2019t stop there. Because you can write something beautiful and you know E! News will ruin our lives and say, \u201cThis is a political record.\u201d Because then I\u2019m the Dixie Chicks and I\u2019m getting my album smashed in the streets, and that\u2019s not what I want. I want to talk to people in a compassionate, understanding way -- which people aren\u2019t doing.\n\nWhat appealed to you about The Voice?\n\nI\u2019m down for hanging with Blake [Shelton]. I actually want to take \u00adadvantage of the fact that he\u2019s there, [because] his fans don\u2019t really take me seriously as a \u00adcountry artist. One, I haven\u2019t given them that music. But I\u2019ve got a tattoo of Johnny Cash\u2019s autograph that he gave me when I was a \u00adlittle girl that says, \u201cI\u2019m in your corner.\u201d Dolly Parton is my \u00adfucking \u00adgodmother. The fact that \u00adcountry music fans are scared of me, that hurts me. All the \u00adnipple pastie shit, that\u2019s what I did because I felt it was part of my political movement, and that got me to where I am now. I\u2019m evolving, and I surround myself with smart people that are evolved.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen the way that Madonna and Lady Gaga get asked, \u201cIs this just another costume? Another phase?\u201d\n\nI think [Madonna and Gaga] are \u00adenlightened. I \u00adfucking hate it when people can\u2019t adjust. I used to [resist changing]. But I haven\u2019t smoked weed in three weeks, which is the longest I\u2019ve ever [gone without it]. I\u2019m not doing drugs, I\u2019m not drinking, I\u2019m completely clean right now! That was just something that I wanted to do.\n\nIs it hard to not smoke?\n\nIt\u2019s easy, dude. When I want something, it\u2019s fucking easy for me. But if anyone told me not to smoke, I would have not done it. It\u2019s because it was on my time. I know exactly where I am right now. I know what I want this record to be. And not in the sense of manipulation -- wanting something from my fans or the audience, like some slimy thing -- \u201cHow do I get attention?\u201d I never thought about that. Dude, I was shocked that \u00adpeople gave a fuck about the [MTV Video Music Awards in 2013, when she \u00adperformed with Robin Thicke] -- the \u00adtwerking, the teddy bear. It\u2019s a totally \u00addifferent time, and I don\u2019t think that would freak people out anymore.\n\nOur perceptions of a lot of things are changing at lightning speed. Still, there\u2019s an audience that\u2019s maybe a little scared of you, those who might have a tendency to vilify the \u201cother.\u201d\n\nI was talking about this with my sister [Noah], who\u2019s 17, and she\u2019s doing music right now. She basically grew up in L.A. She\u2019s never known anything different. She doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s open-minded, it\u2019s the only kind of mind she has ever known. It\u2019s mind-boggling to me that there was even a controversy around me having black dancers. That became a thing, where people said I was taking advantage of black culture, and with Mike [WiLL Made-It] -- what the fuck? That wasn\u2019t true. Those were the dancers I liked!\n\nWhen I met Pharrell [Williams], before \u201cBlurred Lines,\u201d before \u201cHappy,\u201d people wouldn\u2019t take meetings with me because they said, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had a hit in 10 years.\u201d They wanted to put me with the Dr. Lukes of the world, the Max Martins, and put me through the fucking assembly line, and I said, \u201cNo. This is someone who actually cares about me. This is someone I feel safe with.\u201d I got completely shut out, and I had to just trust myself. What feels right to me feels right to my fans, because they know some dude in a suit didn\u2019t tell me to do it. And by the way, I brought \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d to Luke. No one put me in the room with Luke. I had done \u201cParty in the U.S.A.\u201d with him, and that\u2019s just someone I thought could handle that sound. Did you ever get to come to a Bangerz show?\n\nYeah, I did.\n\nI was crazy about making the tongue slide work. I was so \u00adembarrassed to be on the red carpet and so many of those fucking disgusting \u00adphotographers would tell me to blow a kiss, and that\u2019s not me! I don\u2019t want to blow you a kiss. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my face, so I stuck my tongue out, and it became a rebellious, punk-rock thing.\n\nThe Dead Petz track \u201cBB Talk,\u201d which calls out a man for his \u201cbaby \u00adtalking,\u201d seems to reject a similar kind of \u00adgender standard.\n\nI wish it would\u2019ve gotten some \u00adattention. No one saw the video! It was a real rant. Dating a musician [like me] is probably the worst thing ever, because you always end up \u00adhaving your shit in songs. It\u2019s just \u00adinevitable. But I\u2019m just that way. I\u2019m a little bit boyish. But I can also be super femme and dress as a bunny rabbit. Who I\u2019m with has nothing to do with sex -- I\u2019m super open, pansexual, that\u2019s just me.\n\nDo you want your dudes to be dudes?\n\nNot even. That really grosses me out. I always get in trouble for \u00adgeneralizing straight men, \u2019cause straight men can be my worst nightmare \u00adsometimes. And I\u2019m with a straight dude. But he\u2019s always like, \u201cWell, don\u2019t call me that!\u201d I ask him sometimes, \u201cDo you like being a boy?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t really think about it.\u201d And that\u2019s crazy to me, because I think about being a girl all the time. I\u2019m always like, \u201cIt\u2019s weird that I\u2019m a girl, because I just don\u2019t feel like a girl, and I don\u2019t feel like a boy. I just feel like nothing.\u201d So when someone\u2019s too \u00admasculine, that really grosses me out.\n\nBut then, girls really make me sad a lot of the time too, especially right now. I think fashion has taken us a little bit downhill. I can only speak for the years that I\u2019ve been alive, but I don\u2019t know if it has ever been so important to \u201cfit in.\u201d It\u2019s not about standing out right now. Which is so weird, because it seems like for the really unique, smart kids in this generation, it\u2019s all about standing out. I love seeing these kids on Instagram that dress fucking dope. This whole world right now is so divided, in the arts, fashion -- everything.\n\nThe country is certainly very divided.\n\nI like the way I think right now. But don\u2019t Trump supporters like the way they think? So I\u2019ve also got to be open with the way I approach people with my opinions. That\u2019s the only way to make real change. And it\u2019s not because I want to sell records! I know now the ways that don\u2019t work. Because I went really hard during the \u00adelection. But at the end of the day, we lost. We won, but because the system is fucked up, we lost. I thought, \u201cOK. I learned my lesson on this one.\u201d\n\nDid you have to go into The Voice right after Election Day?\n\nThat next day, dude. I wanted to go to rehearsals. Liam was like, \u201cJust don\u2019t go. You\u2019re not there. And you don\u2019t know how everyone feels on that set.\u201d Everyone\u2019s from all different parts of the country, so he was like, \u201cDon\u2019t go and get into it with \u00adpeople right now.\u201d Because clearly \u00adunity is what we need.\n\nYou posted a tearful Instagram video the day after the election, and I tweeted, \u201cLove you, Miley.\u201d And so many alt-right dudes responded, \u201cAre you just trying to fuck her?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s them sexualizing me, because they think that you couldn\u2019t take me seriously. The first thing I got on my Instagram when I posted that was people saying, \u201cYou said you were going to move. When are you going to move?\u201d It\u2019s not time for me to leave now, dude. I\u2019ve got to be here. I\u2019ve got to glue this place back together, because I\u2019m from Tennessee -- that state [went to] Donald Trump. I\u2019m such a dreamer, and I know a lot of things that I\u2019ve wanted to do people said weren\u2019t possible. When I started Happy Hippie -- this is before Caitlyn Jenner transitioned, before this became something that is a part of the culture...\n\nLeelah Alcorn -- a 17-year-old \u00adtransgender girl who committed \u00adsuicide in December 2014 -- brought a new awareness to transgender issues.\n\nYes. I was on a Christmas trip, and I was like, \u201cHow am I sitting here about to open presents and someone has taken their own life?\u201d I started Happy Hippie because I never thought we would see this day where you have the Laverne Coxes of the world get not only trans roles, but female roles. And I realized the voice I had. That\u2019s why I brought Jesse [Helt, a homeless man, to the 2014 VMAs], because it felt wrong for me to go and get an award, celebrating me getting naked and riding a fucking wrecking ball around for a day. I mean, what would I have said? \u201cThanks, uh... thanks to [\u201cWrecking Ball\u201d video \u00addirector] Terry Richardson\u201d? That would have been so weird.\n\nDo you think you\u2019ve managed to bring your politics into The Voice?\n\nBy sitting there after the election in head-to-toe pink, while on the inside being a gender-neutral, \u00adsexually fluid person, hopefully that was saying \u00adsomething. I needed some sparkle in my life, to make me able to deal. Radiating love is \u00adsomething that is important to me -- \u00adhopefully, that is being political.", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/media/miley-cyrus-bb11-2017-fhdj-fea-billboard-1500-768x433.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/miley-cyrus-bb11-2017-fhdj-fea-billboard-1500-1024x577.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?31b846bafac45d8539bb"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/miley-cyrus-bb11-2017-fhdj-fea-billboard-1500-1024x577.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7783997/miley-cyrus-cover-story-new-music-malibu", "title": "Miley Cyrus Breaks Silence on Rootsy New Music, Fiance Liam Hemsworth & America: 'Unity Is What We Need'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2019-12-04T00:05:00-05:00", "published_time": "2017-05-03T21:50:50-04:00"}, "description": "Shaken by the election and inspired by her broad platform on The Voice, Miley Cyrus is about to emerge from a social media blackout with rootsy new music and a mission to connect with country fans and Trump voters -- even as she calls out misogyny in hip-hop and fights for transgender rights. \"Im giving the world a hug,\" she says at her home in Malibu.", "og": {"description": "Shaken by the election and inspired by her broad platform on The Voice, Miley Cyrus is about to emerge from a social media blackout with rootsy new music and a mission to connect with country fans and Trump voters -- even as she calls out misogyny in hip-hop and fights for transgender rights. \"Im giving the world a hug,\" she says at her home in Malibu.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/miley-cyrus-bb11-2017-fhdj-fea-billboard-1500-1024x577.jpg", "height": 577, "width": 1024}, "title": "Miley Cyrus Cover Story May 2017 | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/7783997/miley-cyrus-cover-story-new-music-malibu", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Miley Cyrus Breaks Silence on Rootsy New Music, Fiance Liam Hemsworth & America: 'Unity Is What We Need'", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Shaken by the election and inspired by her broad platform on The Voice, Miley Cyrus is about to emerge from a social media blackout with rootsy new music and a mission to connect with country fans and Trump voters -- even as she calls out misogyny in hip-hop and fights for transgender rights. \"Im giving the world a hug,\" she says at her home in Malibu.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/miley-cyrus-bb11-2017-fhdj-fea-billboard-1500-1024x577.jpg", "title": "Miley Cyrus Breaks Silence on Rootsy New Music, Fiance Liam Hemsworth & America: 'Unity Is What We Need'", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493862650.0, "source": "http://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
