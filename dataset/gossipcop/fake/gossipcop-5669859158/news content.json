The singer-songwriter admits he has models his look after '90s country-pop superstar Shania Twain, who was one of his mom's favorite artists when he was growing up.\n\n\"I think both music and fashion, [my] main influence was probably Shania Twain. I think she's amazing,\" Styles raves to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nIt's a surprising connection, no doubt, but makes sense when you look at the former One Direction frontman and the country icon \u2014 both love colorful, extravagant outfits that defy the norm.\n\nStyles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town's \"Girl Crush\" during a show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act. He says the track is \"one of my favorite songs recently that's come out of this place,\" meaning Nashville.\n\nHe'll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour. Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton, citing himself as a \"massive fan.\" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson, who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it \"something real.\"\n\nTwain's latest album, Now, her first studio album release since 2002's massively successful Up!, landed at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2017. The album's second single \"We Got Something They Don't\" is currently on country radio.", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/12/shania-twain-harry-styles-style-influence.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/12/shania-twain-harry-styles-style-influence.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cillea Houghton"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/harry-styles-style-shania-twain/", "title": "Harry Styles' Style Icon?
