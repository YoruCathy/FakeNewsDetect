Their life is about to get a lot busier.\"\n\nThe couple reportedly turned to surrogacy last year. They refused to name the woman who will be carrying the twins.\n\nParker, 44, is currently filming Did You Hear About the Morgans?, a romantic comedy with Hugh Grant. Broderick, 47, is starring on Broadway in the play The Philanthropist.\n\nThe Sex and the City sequel is expected to be released in 2010.", "images":
