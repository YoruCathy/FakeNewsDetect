She\u2019d be horrified if she knew the extent of the relationship because she\u2019d think of it as a complete betrayal on both their parts.\u2019\n\nJust for some posterity, shall we remind you all Selena once said this about Jennifer Aniston:\n\n\u2018I always say that I worship Rachel McAdams as a movie actress but for comedy\u2014the whole reason I started my show and mannerisms, they were after Jennifer Aniston,\u2019 she told Just Jared in 2009.\n\n\u2018It was so funny, they were playing clip reels of the work she\u2019s done and I quoted the whole thing. Every single thing she\u2019d say, I would say it. People were sitting there laughing at me and they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, you\u2019re obsessed.'\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead into that what you will.\n\nAy ay ay, this is all more drama than that time Ross and Rachel were on a break.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
