This question and more were answered by spouses Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, director and producer, respectively, of the sci-fi/adventure/drama.\n\n\u201cInterstellar,\u201d written by Chris and his brother Jonah, follows a team of explorers as they travel beyond the galaxy to find another home for humankind since Earth is nearing its end.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile \u201cInterstellar\u201d features some stunning visual images of the voyage, the film succeeds more when it delves into relationships through a family, that of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an experienced pilot, and his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet).\n\nJessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn portray Murph at various ages while Casey Affleck plays the older Tom. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, John Lithgow and Topher Grace round out the cast.\n\nExcerpts from our interview:\n\nWhy did you keep Matt Damon\u2019s casting a secret?\n\nChris Nolan (C): I imagined Doctor Mann a bit like from Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness.\u201d You have Kurtz, this character that you hear about. Everybody says, \u201cOh, he\u2019s great. Maybe you\u2019ll get to meet him.\u201d I really love the idea for an audience to go, when they see him, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Matt Damon. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\nMatt very graciously agreed to do it. He didn\u2019t have to shoot for long. So we didn\u2019t want to market the film using him because he\u2019s not in it very much. We didn\u2019t want to mislead people. But Matt is a very important part of the movie. It\u2019s fun to watch with an audience who doesn\u2019t know because they haven\u2019t heard about it.\n\nMatt has the most amazing ability to project integrity and warmth. So he turns up in the film and he\u2019s got a plan and it\u2019s all going to be okay. For me, to realize that he\u2019s a frail human being and subject to cowardice and all the terrible weaknesses that we all have\u2026 he loved that challenge. I loved what he did with it.\n\nEmma Thomas (E): If people get to watch the film twice, it\u2019s so great watching Matt when you know what\u2019s really going on.\n\nC: When people see Matt\u2019s face, they are like, oh, okay. It\u2019s the lift that the movie needs at that point. Structurally, you have a lot of talk in the 20 minutes before. There\u2019s a lot of negativity, a lot bad things happening. The film is very much going to a dark place at that point. So getting that lift in that way with a great actor and movie star coming on screen, is a good thing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHow has the dynamics between the two of you evolved over the years?\n\nE: (Laughs.) We love working together\u2014 obviously, with Jonah as well\u2014in a large part because, when you are working with somebody whom you are tied to beyond by blood or marriage, there\u2019s a lack of agenda. Or as Chris once said, I (Emma) have an agenda. He knows what it is. (Laughs.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a level of trust that is fantastic, particularly when you are making a big movie like this one. I am often asked as a producer and when Chris is the director, \u201cWhen do you tell Chris, no, he can\u2019t have that?\u201d The truth is, I am very lucky because Chris is also a producer. He takes every aspect of the filmmaking process very seriously.\n\nHe is very helpful in terms of trying to figure out how we make the film for the correct budget, and so on. To me, it\u2019s never absolutely saying no. I tell Chris [how I feel about] certain things. We have discussions. But ultimately, it\u2019s Chris\u2019 vision. He always has a very strong idea of what a film is going to be. He\u2019s the director and it\u2019s very much his film.\n\nI see my job as being very much a facilitator for that, filtering out the things that he doesn\u2019t have to worry about so he can concentrate on getting the film made.\n\nC: It\u2019s fantastic working with people you have worked with a long time and have a high degree of trust in. Emma is always very objective, which is great\u2026 I consider Emma a very good gauge (from a moviegoer perspective) because she\u2019s not particularly interested in science-fiction or science. (Laughs.)\n\nI show her the film and ask, \u201cAre you following the emotional threads?\u201d What\u2019s wonderful about working with someone like Emma is that I get an honest opinion, good or bad, instantly. There are no politics to it.\n\nThis film\u2019s working title or code name was \u201cFlora\u2019s Letter,\u201d a cinematic letter to your daughter. How is your relationship with your kids reflected in the story?\n\nC: The relationship between a father and his children was clearly something I related to very strongly in the script. Murph was originally written as a boy in my brother\u2019s draft. I changed the character to a girl\u2014just instinctively. It may well be because Flora, my eldest, is a girl.\n\nYou do have different relationships with sons and daughters. It really paid off with Matthew because what he was very determined about was that his character\u2019s love for his children should be equal for both. The character having a girl and a boy took the burden off the idea of favoritism. It\u2019s not that he loves Murph more than he loves Tom. There\u2019s just a different relationship. And Murph is more interested in science and the things that have driven her father\u2019s life.\n\nE: Girls are much more complicated, I feel. And boys are rather\u2026\n\nC: Simple.\n\nE: I wouldn\u2019t say simple.\n\nC: That\u2019s what you were thinking, though.\n\nE: It\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about the film. I almost don\u2019t think of it as a big, spectacular space movie. I really love the relationships. They feel very real to me as the mother of a girl and boys.\n\nWhen I watch Mackenzie\u2019s performance, she feels incredibly real to me. I [see] my own daughter in her. Going back to the code name question, I will just say that we have always had code names for our films\u2014our kids\u2019 names. It was just Flora\u2019s turn (laughs).\n\nWhat are the kids\u2019 ages?\n\nE: Now that\u2019s a difficult question (laughs). They are 12, 11, 9 and 7. Flora is the oldest.\n\nEmma, you were quoted as saying that Chris could not have done this film 12 years ago when you didn\u2019t have kids. Can you both talk about that?\n\nE: I am not saying that Chris couldn\u2019t have made this film 12 years ago. But there\u2019s such a heart, such a reality to the relationships in the movie. The reason we pick a movie to make\u2014because it\u2019s a long process\u2014is that you have to feel an affinity for the story. You have to want to put that story up on the screen.\n\nThe place that Chris and I are in now is very different from where we were 12 years ago. This is a story that we are interested in telling. It\u2019s also a movie that is fun to watch with our kids. We watch different movies now than we did 12 years ago because the kids came along.\n\nC: The simple answer is, I don\u2019t know if I couldn\u2019t [have done this movie 12 years ago], but I wouldn\u2019t have and I didn\u2019t. Becoming a father was a very big change in my life, something that affected my outlook and the kind of stories that I am interested in telling and in ways that I would have never been able to predict and not in simple ways.\n\nWe did a press conference yesterday and Matthew was asked about being a father. He said he could have played the part even before he had kids. What I didn\u2019t say to him because I didn\u2019t want to embarrass him\u2014but I am going to embarrass him now\u2014is that I would have found it very difficult to cast someone who wasn\u2019t a father. Matthew was absolutely the right person to play the role. He\u2019s a terrific father.\n\nWhy did you choose a Dylan Thomas poem to use in the film?\n\nC: Those lines at the end\u2014\u201cDo not go gentle into that good night\u2026 Rage, rage against the dying of the light\u201d\u2014I have [not] heard a better way of expressing the sentiment of death, dying, the end of the world, any of those things. There\u2019s such a raw emotion in those words; they speak to me so strongly. I didn\u2019t want to write my own version of that. Another example, which I didn\u2019t use, would be of TS Elliot saying, \u201cThis is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.\u201d\n\n(E-mail the columnist at [email protected] Follow him at www.twitter.com/nepalesruben.)\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ", "images": ["https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/inquirerdotnet_2016.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/sm_share_fb.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/landing2017/images/ch-follow-us.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/inquirerdotnet_2016_white.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/landing2017/images/ch-like-us.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/fb-icon-blank.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/sm-share-email2.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/sm_share_twt.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2014/11/1114interstellar-3.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=EEzxg1aAQ700y0", "http://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=00a51dfd915770a7547723911a319f366a", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2014/11/1113INTERSTELLAR-6-300x171.jpg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2014/11/1114interstellar-3-600x402.jpg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2014/11/1114interstellar2-300x373.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2004610026278274&ev=PageView \n&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=767727496894134&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/sm_share_bookmark.svg", "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/single2017/images/twitter-icon-blank.svg"], "top_img": "https://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2014/11/1114interstellar-3-600x402.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ruben V.
