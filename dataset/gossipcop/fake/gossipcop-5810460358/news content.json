A source exclusively told In Touch that Jen invited Angie over for dinner but was quickly rejected. \u201cJen thought the time was right to sit down with Angelina. She was wrong,\u201d the insider shared.\n\nIt appeared that Angelina had a change of heart as she previously told Vogue in 2006 that she would be willing to sit down with Jen and clear the air. \u201cWe\u2019ve, like, passed each other and said, \u2018Hi\u2019 briefly, shook hands. But not a real sit-down-and-talk kind of meeting. That would be her decision, and I would welcome it.\u201d\n\nNow that Jen and Justin Theroux confirmed their split and Angie and Brad\u2019s marriage fell through as well, \u201cJen thought it was finally time to resolve the past.\u201d But when Angelina dismissed the idea of dinner, things went sour. The source explained, \u201cAngelina said she didn\u2019t owe her an apology.\u201d\n\nHowever, if they did end up having a meeting, it would have been even worse having to rehash how Angelina broke up Brad and Jennifer\u2019s relationship. The source explained, \u201cIt would be so awkward. I imagine Angelina wouldn\u2019t be able to look her straight in the eye after what she did, even though so much time has passed. There\u2019d be a lot of small talk.\u201d\n\nAnd although the source said Jen\u2019s friends knew she might regret reaching out to Angelina, she doesn\u2019t want to hold a grudge about it. Why? Because things are going so well between her and Brad at the moment! The source revealed, \u201cIf she holds on to her anger toward Angelina, Brad may see her as petty.\u201d\n\nA source previously told In Touch, \u201c[Brad] wants and needs Jen in his life.\u201d And while the pair has kept quiet about the contact they\u2019ve had over the years and in recent months, the insider claimed, \u201cThere would have been fireworks, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch Weekly, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-divorce.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-jen-aniston-dinner-date.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/it-1814--march-21st--1024.jpg?w=1180&h=1027&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jen-aniston-brad-pitt-reunion.png?w=1180&h=739&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-aniston-moving-on.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jen-justin-blast.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/brad-angie-divorce.png?w=1180&h=676&crop=1", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-jen-aniston-dinner-date.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/angelina-jolie-jen-aniston-dinner-date.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Riccardi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/jennifer-aniston-angelina-jolie-dinner-156945/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston's Dinner Invite Rejected by Angelina Jolie", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "More than a decade after Angelina Jolie stole Brad Pitt from Jennifer Aniston, the Friends alum was finally ready to hash things out.
