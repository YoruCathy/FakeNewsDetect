It was a pretty dramatic end to the night and Portia seemed pretty angry,\u2019 the source adds.\n\nSince Jen\u2019s recent split from Justin, 46, in February, along with rumoured troubles with Jen\u2019s ex-husband Brad Pitt, 54, Portia knows that Jen isn\u2019t very positive about relationships at the moment and she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with Jen hanging around with Ellen.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day, Portia just doesn\u2019t trust Jen around Ellen. She is convinced that Jen is turning Ellen against her.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve never seen eye to eye and Portia is convinced that Jen badmouths her to Ellen, and it drives her wild with anger and jealousy,\u2019 the source adds.\n\nReports that Portia\u2019s nine-year marriage to Ellen is in trouble have surfaced repeatedly, with Life & Style claiming the couple were fighting non-stop last year.\n\nOne Craig\u2019s staffer admitted to the publication that the couple didn\u2019t seem happy at all while they were dining at the eatery.\n\n\u2018Ellen seemed miserable and Portia just looked sad,\u2019 the staffer said. \u2018\u201cHappy\u201d isn\u2019t the first word I would use to describe them,\u2019 they added.\n\nAnd according to New Idea\u2019s source, Portia is concerned that Ellen is saying negative things about her to Jen, and the Friends actress is just adding fuel to the fire, especially as she\u2019s had such a bad run in her own love life.\n\n\u2018Portia knows that Ellen talks to Jen about her and their marriage \u2013 especially their relationship troubles \u2013 and she can only imagine what Jen has to say about that,\u2019 the source says.\n\nPortia\u2019s biggest fear is that Jen will advise Ellen to simply throw in the towel \u2013 like she did with Justin \u2013 and give her the wrong message.\n\n\u2018The fact that Jen is pretty down on love and negative about marriage at the moment, after her relationship to Justin ended so abruptly, makes it worse in Portia\u2019s eyes. She and Ellen have ups and downs like any married couple, but she\u2019s worried that Jen has given up on marriage and is telling Ellen to do the same.\u2019\n\nBut despite troubles behind closed doors, Portia and Ellen remain publicly united.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re just really good friends and we talk about everything, and we never, ever, ever lie to each other, like, not even the tiniest lies,\u2019 Portia told ET. \u2018And she\u2019s the only person I want to hang out with. Like, she is my best friend and I just want to be with her all the time.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/73139/ni4619_cover_nobc_bws.png?height=158", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/Images/idm-error-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/gmail.svg", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/28041/ellen-jen-portia-feud.jpg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/newidea/images/idm-thanks-icon.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/28041/ellen-jen-portia-feud.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
