Perhaps two. Really.\n\nThe designer in question is Giles Deacon, creator of Ms. Middleton\u2019s lace-covered gown, a dress that was, like that of her sister, firmly in the Grace Kelly-marrying-Prince-Rainier continuum: high-necked, cap-sleeved, molded to her torso; fairy tale and contemporary at the same time, with a full skirt but not a stuffed one. Not radical by any means.\n\nWhich is what was interesting.\n\nMr. Deacon, after all, made his name as part of the cooler, conceptual strain of British design. \u201cEccentric\u201d is an adjective often attached to his name. He\u2019s the guy who put Cate Blanchett in an enormous strapless empire gown at Cannes in 2015, decorated with a digitized print he called a \u201cTudor collage,\u201d and who dressed Solange Knowles in what looked like two oversize, unfurled fans for the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Gala that same year. Last year, he stepped off the London Fashion Week schedule to show couture instead; a signal, seemingly, that he was going to go even more extreme and extravagant.\n\nSo when rumors began to fly that Ms. Middleton had picked Mr. Deacon to make her dress, it seemed unlikely. There was speculation that he had done her party frock for the reception (an outfit that remains a mystery, as the social media ban for the party seems to have succeeded, an extraordinary achievement these days), but that a more establishment choice \u2014 Catherine Walker, who ultimately dressed Carole Middleton, the mother of the bride, or Jenny Packham, a favorite of the Duchess of Cambridge \u2014 would do the bride\u2019s wedding dress.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/22/fashion/22otr-A/22otr-A-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/fashion/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-giles-deacon.html", "title": "The Pippa Middleton Wedding Dress Effect", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-05-22T12:14:00.000Z", "modified": "2017-05-22T12:13:57.000Z", "section": "Fashion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/vanessa-friedman", "tag": "Weddings and Engagements", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005120852, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1e6ba864-97d2-533f-89cf-9ef1238c6bf6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/fc59a4f5e8a74e11b5078a7d7ab73f7c", "description": "The lace gown may change the fortunes of the edgy British designer Giles Deacon.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "byl": "By Vanessa Friedman", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "news_keywords": "Pippa Middleton,Duchess of Cambridge Catherine,Giles Deacon,Weddings and Engagements", "pdate": 20170522, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/fashion/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-giles-deacon.html", "type": "article", "title": "The Pippa Middleton Wedding Dress Effect", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png", "description": "The lace gown may change the fortunes of the edgy British designer Giles Deacon."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/fashion/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-giles-deacon.html", "title": "The Pippa Middleton Wedding Dress Effect", "description": "The lace gown may change the fortunes of the edgy British designer Giles Deacon.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1e6ba864-97d2-533f-89cf-9ef1238c6bf6"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "fashion", "CN": "on-the-runway", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/fashion/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-giles-deacon.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1e6ba864-97d2-533f-89cf-9ef1238c6bf6", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/fashion/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-giles-deacon.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/fashion/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-giles-deacon.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495382400.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
