Uma Thurman says she is open to working with Quentin Tarantino again if he wrote \u201ca good part\u201d for her.\n\nUma Thurman has said she always shared a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with filmmaker Quentin Tarantino and is open to working with him once again if he wrote \u201ca good part\u201d for her. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the 48-year-old actor was asked whether she is open to working with the director despite the recent revelation about the car crash that happened on the sets of Kill Bill.\n\n\u201cIf he wrote a great part! I understand him and if he wrote a great part and we were both in the right place about it, that would be something else,\u201d Thurman said. Earlier this year, Thurman had said in an article that she suffered severe injuries after she was pressured into driving a stunt car she did not feel comfortable operating on the sets of Tarantino\u2019s film.\n\nThe director, on his part, had admitted that he still blames himself for convincing Thurman to sit in the car and called the incident \u201cone of the biggest regrets of my life\u201d. Thurman and Tarantino, 55, first collaborated on the cult favourite Pulp Fiction and they followed it up the Kill Bill movies. Thurman told the magazine that she always \u201chad a good relationship\u201d with Tarantino even after the incident.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our fights over the years. When you know someone for as long as I\u2019ve known him, 25 years of creative collaboration\u2026 Yes, did we have some tragedies take place? Sure. But you can\u2019t reduce that type of history and legacy,\u201d she added. In the aftermath of the controversy, Thurman had clarified that she blamed the producers of the film, including disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein, the most for the accident and revealed that Tarantino had already apologised to her for his role.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
