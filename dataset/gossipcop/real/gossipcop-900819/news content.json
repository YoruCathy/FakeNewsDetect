This is beneath you, Rose.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to support and stand with us, but we stand and support you. You may take below the belt shots at us but we will not take them at you in return.\u201d\n\nWriting that the black dresses represents the darkness sexual assualt victims feel, Tamblyn concluded, \u201cWe stand together in this fight, shoulder to shoulder, weapon to weapon, woman to woman (and man), body to burned body. And our arms are open. And our hearts two fold. And our fire will be a universal scorch.\u201d\n\nTamblyn\u2019s tweet comes one day after McGowan, 44, spoke out against the \u201csilent protest,\u201d criticizing women said to be taking part, who had worked with disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein in the past \u2014 calling out Meryl Streep in particular.\n\n\u201cActresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @GoldenGlobes in a silent protest,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, referring to Weinstein.\n\n\u201cYOUR SILENCE is THE problem,\u201d McGowan continued. \u201cYou\u2019ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa,\u201d she added, referencing Weinstein\u2019s estranged wife Georgina Chapman\u2019s fashion line.\n\nImage zoom Mark Sagliocco/Getty Images; Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nAfter Tamblyn\u2019s initial tweet, McGowan\u2019s Charmed costar Holly Marie Combs criticized the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants actress for publicly addressing the issue rather than calling McGowan privately.\n\n\u201cYou just did to @rosemcgowan what you claim you don\u2019t support her doing to others. Every activist for every cause the world over has different methods but share a common and more important message that should remain the same,\u201d Combs tweeted. \u201cAnd undiluted above all else.\u201d\n\nWriting that she did, in fact, speak to McGowan about the issue, Tamblyn replied: \u201cHer statement was public and hurtful to some women so a public response was earned. I spoke to her at length today, she knows how I feel. I love Rose fiercely, that will never change. To be critical of an action is not to condemn the person behind it. There\u2019s your common message.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Harvey Weinstein Hired Intelligence Agencies to Spy on Accusers Including Rose McGowan: Report\n\nOver 50 women have accused Weinstein, 65, of sexual assault and misconduct since The New York Times and The New Yorker documented decades of alleged sexual misconduct and sexual assault involving a number of women in detailed articles in October. McGowan was one of the first women to come forward \u2014 accusing the producer of rape.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have denied any allegations of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has never at any time committed an act of sexual assault, and it is wrong and irresponsible to conflate claims of impolitic behavior or consensual sexual contact later regretted, with an untrue claim of criminal conduct,\u201d his lawyers said. \u201cThere is a wide canyon between mere allegation and truth, and we are confident that any sober calculation of the facts will prove no legal wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, to those offended by Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior, he remains deeply apologetic.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Famber-tamblyn.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Famber-tamblyn.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Famber-tamblyn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/amber-tamblyn-slams-rose-mcgowan-for-shaming-women-who-plan-to-wear-black-to-golden-globes/", "title": "Amber Tamblyn Slams Rose McGowan for 'Shaming' Women Who Plan to Wear Black to Golden Globes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Amber Tamblyn,Harvey Weinstein,Movie Celebrities,Rose McGowan,Style News", "news_keywords": "Amber Tamblyn,Harvey Weinstein,Movie Celebrities,Rose McGowan,Style News", "description": "On Sunday, Tamblyn accused McGowan of \"shaming\" and \"taunting\" the other women, writing \"This is beneath you, Rose\" on Twitter", "og": {"title": "Amber Tamblyn Slams Rose McGowan for 'Shaming' Women Who Plan to Wear Black to Golden Globes", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/amber-tamblyn-slams-rose-mcgowan-for-shaming-women-who-plan-to-wear-black-to-golden-globes/", "description": "Amber Tamblyn is not pleased with her friend Rose McGowan\u2018s decision to speak out against Hollywood actresses who plan to wear black to the Golden&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Famber-tamblyn.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/amber-tamblyn-slams-rose-mcgowan-for-shaming-women-who-plan-to-wear-black-to-golden-globes/", "description": "On Sunday, Tamblyn accused McGowan of \"shaming\" and \"taunting\" the other women, writing \"This is beneath you, Rose\" on Twitter", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Famber-tamblyn.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/amber-tamblyn-slams-rose-mcgowan-for-shaming-women-who-plan-to-wear-black-to-golden-globes/", "title": "Amber Tamblyn Slams Rose McGowan for 'Shaming' Women Who Plan to Wear Black to Golden Globes", "description": "On Sunday, Tamblyn accused McGowan of \"shaming\" and \"taunting\" the other women, writing \"This is beneath you, Rose\" on Twitter", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Famber-tamblyn.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
