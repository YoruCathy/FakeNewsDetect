A more conservative estimate earlier this week from the disaster research group Enki Research put the total at $30 billion.\n\nDamage to Puerto Rico has been catastrophic. People are scrambling for food, water, fuel and cash. Almost the entire island is without power, and outages are expected to last for months in some areas.\n\nRelated: Who will help Puerto Rico?\n\nThe Moody's estimate says as much as $40 billion could be lost in economic output because of impassable roads and lost power. Property damage could total $55 billion.\n\nFor comparison: Moody's estimates that Hurricanes Irma and Harvey combined caused more than $150 billion in damage after those storms hit major U.S. cities in Texas, Florida and Georgia.\n\n\"Given that Harvey and Irma disrupted far larger and more vibrant economies than that of Puerto Rico, this reflects the stunning amount of damage that Maria has wrought,\" Kamins said.\n\nRelated: The people of Puerto Rico are in a desperate scramble for cash\n\nPuerto Rico's economy was already struggling. The island has been in recession for 11 years and has lost 10% of its population in that time. In May, it filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nKamins said fallout from Hurricane Maria could make it all worse. Puerto Ricans are American citizens and can freely move to the mainland.\n\n\"The end result could be a permanent increase in the rate of population decline, with many of those who remain too poor to move elsewhere,\" he said. \"Puerto Rico's already murky future is now even more in doubt.\"\n\nThe catastrophe modeling firm RMS released a damage estimate Thursday for the entire Caribbean that was also more conservative than Moody's. It said damage to the region could be $30 billion to $60 billion.\n\nMaria devastated several islands in the region, including Dominica and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "images": ["https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnn.svg", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170928121332-puerto-rico-damages-780x439.jpg", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/branding/8.0/section/investing/specials/before-the-bell/right-rail-sign-up-with-logo_2X.png", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170928140622-video-title-2017-hurricanes-200-billion-1024x576.jpg", "https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnnbusiness.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif"], "top_img": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170928121332-puerto-rico-damages-780x439.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jill Disis"], "canonical_link": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/news/economy/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-damage-estimate/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Maria could be a $95 billion storm for Puerto Rico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140", "date": "2017-09-28 12:45:53", "title": "Hurricane Maria could be a $95 billion storm for Puerto Rico", "description": "The island's very future is in doubt, one analyst says.", "author": "Jill Disis", "section": "news", "subsection": "economy", "og": {"title": "Hurricane Maria could be a $95 billion storm for Puerto Rico", "type": "article", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/news/economy/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-damage-estimate/index.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170928121332-puerto-rico-damages-780x439.jpg", "width": 780, "height": 439}, "site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "The island's very future is in doubt, one analyst says."}, "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNMoney", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/09/28/news/economy/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-damage-estimate/index.html", "title": "Hurricane Maria could be a $95 billion storm for Puerto Rico", "description": "The island's very future is in doubt, one analyst says.", "image": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170928121332-puerto-rico-damages-540x304.jpg"}, "DC.date.issued": "2017-09-28T12:45:53"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506528000.0, "source": "https://money.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
