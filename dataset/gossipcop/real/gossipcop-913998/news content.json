The actress and awards show dominator took to social media to remind us that she still despises cancer, she\u2019s still feeling positive and, yes, she\u2019s still as glamorous as ever. Oh, and she\u2019s also as bawdy as ever, because she also wanted us all to know that there\u2019s nothing more empowering and liberating than a good, old-fashioned \u201cF*ck you!\u201d.\n\nHoorah! Great doctors, great results, feeling happy and ready to rock after surgery. Hey cancer, \u201cFuck you!\u201d Here\u2019s my first post op photo. pic.twitter.com/5LPlbzpiI3 \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) February 14, 2018\n\nOf course she\u2019d find a way to make a joke somehow because that pic she captioned is more professional photoshoot shot than post-op selfie. But it only makes us love her more. It was back in September that JLD revealed her breast cancer diagnosis and since then she\u2019s been nothing short of inspiring. Her posts have always been positive, touching and, often times, hilarious. In October, she posted a pic following her second round of chemo, quoting the incomparable Katy Perry after getting a little inspo from her Veep co-stars Tony Hale and Timothy Simons.\n\nFellow Veep-ers Sam Richardson and Matt Walsh also did their part to send their love and support.\n\n2 of my darling Bozos (love them so much) psyche me up for 3rd chemo today. And guess what? It worked! I\u2019m psyched AF. @SamRichardson @mrmattwalsh pic.twitter.com/OuwR5hvHlf \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) November 9, 2017\n\nThe writers of Veep tried but, well, they weren\u2019t nearly as good. But, hey, the thought was there.\n\nJulia\u2019s sons, Henry and Charlie, however, have them all beat. Literally.\n\nNow, with breast cancer surgery out of the way, people are rejoicing and pretty much just repeating what Julia said. Because JLD couldn\u2019t be more right about cancer.\n\nYeah !
