The tryouts consist of several office-oriented challenges and it is found, through Jim's scheming, that Dwight is the most qualified for the newly founded A.A.R.M. position. Angela is forced to bring her son, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, who initially wanted to marry his current girlfriend Esther, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. He confronts her, but she tells him that this is not the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, who tells Dwight that if he truly loves Angela then that's who he should pursue. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son.\n\nMeanwhile, Darryl returns to Scranton, after quietly quitting a week ago to work full-time at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand to spend some time with him one way or another before he leaves for good. The office ultimately decides on one final dance together.\n\nWhen Darryl runs into Pam, he tells her about Athlead's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do something that he does not want to do. She later confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be enough for him; he tries to tell her that she is the most important thing in his life. Later, he decides to get the documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of many of the highlights of Jim and Pam's relationship throughout the series. The final scene is from the second season Christmas episode \"Christmas Party\" in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his very emotional note that expresses his feelings for Pam before she notices it. After the DVD plays, Jim presents Pam with the actual, unopened note. She reads it, and the two happily embrace.\n\nMeanwhile, Andy auditions for America's Next A Cappella Sensation. Andy meets an exuberant and like-minded lady, Casey Dean from Cincinnati, Ohio. However, before he is able to tryout in front of the judges\u2014who include Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold\u2014the auditions close, and Andy makes a fool of himself. Dejected, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets up with the rest of his former office workers. Altogether, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS' Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV. As the office workers stare at the screen, the audience hears the opening dialogue from the series' first episode, \"Pilot\".\n\nCultural references Edit\n\nConnections to previous episodes Edit\n\nIn the last few moments of the episode, you can hear the opening lines from Pilot.\n\nDwight is his own assistant during the brief hours when he is Regional Manager in The Job.\n\nJim finally decides to give Pam the note he wrote for her in Christmas Party, when he gives her the teapot letter he originally took back from her in the same episode.\n\nDwight hangs paintings of himself around the office when he becomes acting manager in Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager.\n\nWhile Philip is crying, Dwight offers to try to calm him down, even saying, \"Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps\", referencing the episode Viewing Party, when he was able to quiet down Cece, Jim and Pam's daughter, just by holding her in his arms.\n\nGoofs Edit\n\nPhillip is seen as a baby two episodes ago yet was acted by a toddler in the episode.\n\nAngela admits she lied about Phillip not being Dwight's baby. However, Dwight was informed of the opposite by a geneticist in the episode New Guys. (Greg Daniels explained that they shot but cut a scene in which it is explained that Dwight grabbed the wrong diaper.)\n\nWhen Andy is auditioning for the singing competition, he claims he is singing the Cornell fight song (\"Give my Regards to Davy\"). He is actually singing the Cornell Alma Mater (\"Far Above Cayuga's Waters\").\n\nJim's video misspells Pam's last name as \"Beesley\" instead of \"Beesly\".\n\nAmusing details/Trivia Edit\n\nThe card from the teapot contains a personal message from John Krasinski to Jenna Fischer about how much their time together meant to him. (Confirmed by Jenna Fischer. [1] ) She was not aware of this beforehand and reads the letter for the first time on camera.\n\n) She was not aware of this beforehand and reads the letter for the first time on camera. This marks the last day the documentary crew is actually filming for the initial documentary. As we learn in Finale, twelve months passed between this episode and the last episode, Dwight also says they sent another crew for Finale.\n\ncrew for Finale. In the painting hung in the conference room, Dwight is portrayed in the same manner as DPRK president Kim Il-sung in his statue at Mansu Hill Grand Monument in Pyongyang.\n\nIn this episode, Kevin acts like many former only children do when the parents bring home a new baby. Oscar and Angela perform the common practice of giving the child (Kevin) a gift and saying that it's from the baby to make them feel better.\n\nThere is no implication that Dwight leaves work to get a beet, meaning he already had one in the office.\n\nCast Edit\n\nMain Cast Edit\n\nSupporting Cast Edit\n\nGuest Cast Edit\n\nGallery Edit", "images": ["https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/karlacamilacabello/images/b/b6/Spotlight.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20200211045312", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/hildatheseries/images/0/01/Community-Page-Header.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20190914140704", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/xavier-riddle-and-the-secret-museum/images/9/97/N2losLW-asset-kids-mezzanine1-16x9-N70Tdc3.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20190910004306", "https://images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb9/theoffice/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130513003210", "https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb1586975593232/common/extensions/wikia/WikiaBar/images/wikiabarIcon.png", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/350?cb=20130513003210", "https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb1586802696638/common/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/b/bc/Wiki.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/20?cb=20091222015027"], "top_img": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130513003210", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/A.A.R.M.", "title": "A.A.R.M.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "generator": "MediaWiki 1.19.24", "keywords": "Dunderpedia: The Office Wiki,theoffice,A.A.R.M.,Season 9,Brent Forrester,David Rogers,Livin' the Dream,Finale,Dwight,Angela Martin,Andy Bernard,Jim Halpert,Dwight Schrute", "description": "&quot;A.A.R.M.&quot; is the twenty-second/twenty-third episode of the ninth season of the American television comedy series The Office and is the show's 198th/199th episode overall.
