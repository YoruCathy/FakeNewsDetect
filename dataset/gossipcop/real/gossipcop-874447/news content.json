It was perfect.\u201d\n\nThe bride wore two dresses for her big day: During the ceremony she opted for a Milady-designed mermaid gown, which featured bling everywhere, and for the reception, she changed into a Lena Bernisha-designed dress with a detachable train.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be able to dance the night away,\u201d Roberts told Us.\n\nTheir beach-glam wedding also featured lots of candles and gold touches.\n\n\u201cEverything is very formal beach glamour, it\u2019s a beach wedding, but still very glam,\u201d Roberts told Us of her vision. \u201cLots of bling, candles everywhere and gold touches.\u201d\n\nThe couple got engaged during a November 2016 episode of the hit E! show.\n\nSeason 2 of WAGS Miami premieres on E! on June 29.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-da6f978b-88d1-4460-b5c9-f70c33002765.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/wags-miami-stars-ashley-nicole-roberts-and-philip-wheeler-are-married-w482173/", "title": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 Stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler Are Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler said \u2018I do\u2019 on Sunday, May 14 \u2014 all the exclusive wedding details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 Stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler Are Married!", "description": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler said \u2018I do\u2019 on Sunday, May 14 \u2014 all the exclusive wedding details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/wags-miami-stars-ashley-nicole-roberts-and-philip-wheeler-are-married-w482173/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:06:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-05-14T22:41:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:06:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler said \u2018I do\u2019 on Sunday, May 14 \u2014 all the exclusive wedding details", "title": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 Stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler Are Married!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494801717.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
