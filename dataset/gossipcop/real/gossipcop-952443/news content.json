{"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/kylie-travis-cover-2018", "text": "It's Kylie, from the jump, who controls the tempo. The youngest Jenner and her well-oiled glam squad bounce around Milk Studios, in Hollywood, with supreme purpose. Her half-male, half-female contingent is like Ocean's Eleven, except with more crop tops and lip fillers. And instead of a case full of phony casino chips, there's just a roller bag full of luscious hair extensions that need meticulous untangling. Midway through the shoot, the photographer and stylists start praising a particular photo on the monitor, but King Kylie shuts it down. \u201cPeople are going to turn it into a meme,\u201d she says, like some kind of social-media medium. \u201cLet's move to something else.\u201d She later tells me that Kim and Kanye are the ones who taught her to be more assertive on creative things. \u201cI just want the best cover photos for me and for you guys.\u201d\n\nJoining her in the studio is her 27-year-old partner, Travis Scott. They've been together for about a year, but this is their first photo shoot together. What's the binding force between a rage-thirsty rock star from Missouri City, Texas, and a beauty mogul of Calabasas royalty? Other than their newborn baby girl, Stormi? What's that shared frequency that's responsible for the most dynamic celebrity couple of modern times? We'll get to that, but what I can report is that it's not a mutual admiration for posing in front of a seamless. Taking pictures is a lucrative sport for one and medieval torture for the other.\n\nGet this issue, featuring Kylie and Travis, straight to your doorstep. On Travis Scott: Blazer, $2,150, pants (price upon request), and shirt, $590, by Dior Homme. Shoes, $1,050, by Thom Browne. Socks, $19 (for three pairs), by Gold Toe. On Kylie Jenner: Bodysuit by Norma Kamali. Bracelet by RENVI. Styled throughout by Madeline Weeks.\n\nTravis has a much smaller team with him. Just his manager\u2014who works from a laptop the entire shoot\u2014and a bag of what smells like some of California's loudest weed. Between shots, he just kind of paces around, with his head down and his lanky limbs covered in expensive clothes. A wall or photo light would stop him and send him in a different direction. He looks like one of those Microsoft screen savers from the '90s, careening off the edges of the monitor. \u201cHe was whispering to me the whole time,\u201d Kylie tells me afterward, smirking. \u201cHe just doesn't like taking the photos.\u201d Travis hates anything that slows him down. (He even hates restaurants; the man despises wasting time in restaurants.) And he admits that he's \u201cimpatient as a motherfucker\u201d during photo shoots, despite really liking the end result. But it isn't simply young angst that makes hurry-up-and-wait painful for Travis. It's \u201cla flame\u201d\u2014the internal fire, the rage, \u201cthe piss,\u201d as he calls it, aggression in its funnest form. It's why Travis, a decade into a notoriously energetic career, has made his case for having the best live show in hip-hop history.\n\nA few years ago, at a nightclub, I saw Travis swing from a chandelier while performing. One of the gold baroque leaves he held on to for dear life cut his hand, and he was beginning to bleed pretty badly. He paused for a second. Smiled. Then pressed his bloody palm against the ceiling, leaving a red handprint, and kept rapping. That energy, that commitment\u2014that's why there's an entire generation of young tattooed daredevil rappers coming up behind him who look to Travis as the source, and who've taken his lead.\n\nThat may be the thing between the two of them, the binding force: influence. Not in some Adweek marketing sense\u2014in direct-contact-with-the-people kind of way. When they say jump, kids will do it\u2026off a balcony. (That actually happened to Travis.) These two make the mosh pits, memes, and moments that trend and move the needle. They forge 2017's most overused four-letter word\u2014vibe\u2014and they're masters at 2018's: wave. You can't pause when catching a wave. And that's their art. Their common thread. Which helps explain how their relationship went from zero to Stormi in just a few months.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/5b43878cf7a37614fc28a4bc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-02.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b48c7432a27124d610d9081/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-08.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/576032d43ffe8f0c075dd487/3:2/w_775%2Cc_limit/kk-gq-0716-watermark-1.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b439043d06c996750c92a2e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b439151edec410bc81d05d2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-06.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b43903cf7a37614fc28a4c0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-04.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b43864fd06c996750c92a26/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-03.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b43918ab8d0e16cfcf6727e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-07.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b4e06d080d4544fbe01ebe8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie-Jenner-and-Travis-Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-14.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b4d17949eea1c27bfdb9e98/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie-Jenner-and-Travis-Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-13.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b4386981b6a316d7ee6372a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-05.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b4d16889eea1c27bfdb9e96/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-August-0818-Cover.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b48c640e9157f25e7c7886c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-09.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b4d307af5dc912083d87b68/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kylie%252520jenner%252520and%252520travis%252520scott-modern-family-gq-august-2018-12.png", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b48c6df80d4544fbe01eb2e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kylie%252520Jenner%252520and%252520Travis%252520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-11.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-header.d739eb0c2af2cf500d0c7ebecd1d6597474e69aa.svg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-reverse.2fe772617ee3b7f2fc81c9f7237c17495b42eaee.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b43918ab8d0e16cfcf6727e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kylie%2520Jenner%2520and%2520Travis%2520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-07.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b43918ab8d0e16cfcf6727e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kylie%2520Jenner%2520and%2520Travis%2520Scott-Modern-Family-GQ-August-2018-07.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mark Anthony Green", "Mark Anthony Gree", "Paola Kudack", "Caity Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/kylie-travis-cover-2018", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott on Love, Making It Work, and the Kardashian Curse", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Mark Anthony Green", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "She's a billionaire business mogul.
