We all know that she has always wanted to be a mother. She\u2019s talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.\n\nAround the time of True\u2019s birth, Khloe\u2019s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?\n\nA post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she\u2019s been trying again with Tristan?\n\nA source has said, \u201cKhloe loved being pregnant, but she\u2019s the first to say how great she feels now that she\u2019s lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.\u201d\n\nEven so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, \u201cthey\u2019ve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It\u2019s basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.\u201d\n\nThe source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. \u201cHe\u2019s been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn\u2019t changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she\u2019s not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan\u2018s a convincing guy,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nIs that enough to convince Khloe to try to get pregnant again? After giving birth, women have to wait six weeks before they can have sex again and the couple is well past that date.\n\nBut don\u2019t get too excite because Khloe herself revealed that she\u2019s not quite ready. A fan recently asked if she was having another baby:\n\nNot right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol https://t.co/TthrxOQdHr \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018\n\nKeep in mind that she just went back to work, and is in the process of fixing her relationship with Tristan. Would she really be in the right state of mind to welcome another child into the world?\n\nWhile she may wait a while, there\u2019s no doubt that she loves being a mom. We just hope she gets her house in order before expanding her family any further.\n\nA post shared by Top Media New Zealand.
