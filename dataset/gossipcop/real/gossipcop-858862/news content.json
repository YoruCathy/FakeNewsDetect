The British Red Cross said it raised 10 million pounds, which is about $13 million, for the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund, the Associated Press reports.\n\nGrande organized the concert in the 13 days after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured many others outside of her concert at Manchester Arena. The concert continued as planned even after another terrorist attack struck the United Kingdom on Saturday evening, when authorities said three men drove a van into pedestrians on the London Bridge and attacked people with knives at nearby Borough Market. Grande enlisted a number of celebrities to perform, including Katy Perry, Liam Gallagher, Chris Martin, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Pharrell Williams, among others. Throughout their performances, instructions for how to donate to the British Red Cross were displayed across massive screens on stage.\n\nGrande visited injured fans in the hospital before the concert and met the mother of Olivia Campbell, one of those killed during the Manchester attack. She also offered 14,000 free tickets for the benefit concert for those who attended her May 22 concert.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you so much for coming together and being strong,\u201d Grande told the crowd. \u201cI love you guys so much, and I think the kind of love and unity you\u2019re displaying is the medicine the world needs right now.\u201d\n\nThe British Red Cross has also organized fundraising efforts for victims of all recent U.K. terror attacks \u2014 including the most recent one in London.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to choose love, right? Especially in moments like this it can be difficult,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut love conquers fear and love conquers hate. And this love that you choose will give you strength, and it\u2019s our greatest power.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
