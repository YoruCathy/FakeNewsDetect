For the telco, the new programming initiative is aimed at attracting \u2014 and retaining \u2014 subscribers to its video services with a slate of content showcasing women\u2019s stories and perspectives.\n\nThe nine-episode \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d comes from Hello Sunshine, Witherspoon\u2019s production company formed under a pact with AT&T and Chernin Group\u2019s Otter Media in November 2016.\n\nThe first three \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d episodes debut July 17, featuring Dolly Parton, Ava DuVernay and P!nk. According to Witherspoon, Hello Sunshine\u2019s content is intended to be \u201centertaining, inspiring, thought-provoking and unabashedly real.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to have such like-minded, creative collaborators at AT&T to help Hello Sunshine pursue our mission of elevating and showcasing the voices of women that we have such admiration and respect for,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nSubsequent \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d segments will profile poet Cleo Wade and journalist Elaine Welteroth; Candace Nelson, founder of Sprinkles, and Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx; author-activist Glennon Doyle and athlete-author Abby Wambach; actress-activist America Ferrara; singer-songwriter Kacey Musgraves; and Simone Askew, the first black woman named West Point\u2019s First Captain.\n\nAlso coming to the Hello Sunshine channel: \u201cMaster the Mess,\u201d which premieres Sept. 4. The 12-part series features decluttering experts Clea Shearer and Joanna Teplin of the Home Edit, a Nashville-based interior design business, giving makeovers to rooms in their clients\u2019 homes.\n\nThe Hello Sunshine programming for now will not carry any advertising, said Valerie Vargas, AT&T\u2019s senior VP of advertising, creative services and consumer marketing. \u201cIt really provides the ideal destination for female-driven programming. There just aren\u2019t nearly as many women in writing and directing roles as there should be,\u201d Vargas said.\n\nAT&T will be tracking viewership and subscriber acquisition rates fueled by Hello Sunshine, Vargas added.\n\nIn a bid to attract DirecTV Now subs, AT&T is offering new customers of the internet-delivered TV service\u2019s \u201cLive a Little\u201d entry-level package for three months at $10 per month (normally $40) with the promo code \u201cSUNSHINE3\u201d at att.com/hellosunshine.\n\n\u201cShine On with Reese,\u201d which began production in October 2017, will be exclusive on AT&T and DirecTV platforms for one year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been heads-down making this show,\u201d said Sarah Harden, CEO of Hello Sunshine (who previously was with Otter Media). One of the challenges was scheduling time with the interview subjects: \u201cThey are all incredibly ambitious and busy women,\u201d said Harden.\n\nThe women featured in \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d each have a personal connection to Witherspoon, said Charlotte Koh, Hello Sunshine\u2019s head of digital media and programming. \u201cThe idea was to showcase women who have made notable achievements, but through the lens of Reese\u2019s relationship with them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s truly an intimacy, where you feel like you\u2019re crashing a coffee date with Ava [DuVernay] and Reese.\u201d\n\nTo watch \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d and other Hello Sunshine programming, users can search \u201cHello Sunshine\u201d on DirecTV Now, or tune to channel 1112 on DirecTV or channel 1530 on AT&T\u2019s U-verse.\n\nWhile AT&T obviously hopes the Hello Sunshine partnership helps boost subscriber metrics, more broadly it\u2019s part of the telco\u2019s brand-buffing effort to fund the development of programming from historically underserved filmmakers and creators.\n\nAnother element of the pact includes the AT&T Hello Sunshine Filmmaker Lab. Slated to run July 30-Aug. 6 in Los Angeles, the lab is a two-week immersive camp where 20 girls aged 13-18 will work with industry mentors \u2014 including Witherspoon \u2014 to create content for the Hello Sunshine VOD channel. The AT&T Hello Sunshine Filmmaker Lab is being produced in collaboration with Dreaming Tree Foundation (Fresh Films LLC).\n\nIn addition to the channel for AT&T and DirecTV, Hello Sunshine is producing feature films, scripted and unscripted TV shows, audio content, and social series, and also is the home for Reese\u2019s Book Club.\n\nHello Sunshine projects in development include: a limited series for Hulu based on Celeste Ng\u2019s novel \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d from Witherspoon and Kerry Washington; a 10-episode comedy series for Apple created by Colleen McGuinness (\u201c30 Rock\u201d) inspired by Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s short-story collection \u201cYou Think It, I\u2019ll Say It\u201d; \u201cAre You Sleeping,\u201d also for Apple, executive produced by and starring Octavia Spencer, based on the true-crime novel by Kathleen Barber and created and written by Nichelle Tramble Spellman (\u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d \u201cJustified\u201d); and an untitled morning show produced by and starring Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, which was given a two-season, straight-to-series order by Apple with Kerry Ehrin (\u201cBates Motel\u201d) serving as showrunner.\n\nPictured above: Reese Witherspoon with P!nk in \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/reese-witherspoon-pnk-att-hello-sunshine-shine-on-with-reese.png?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Freese-witherspoon-shine-on-with-reese-hello-sunshine-att-directv-1202868192%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202868192&comment_count=15", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/reese-witherspoon-pnk-att-hello-sunshine-shine-on-with-reese.png?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Spangler"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/reese-witherspoon-shine-on-with-reese-hello-sunshine-att-directv-1202868192/", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Interview Series to Kick Off Her Hello Sunshine Channel Debut on AT&T, DirecTV", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Reese Witherspoon's first unscripted TV show, \"Shine On with Reese,\" will debut on her Hello Sunshine channel on AT&amp;T and DirecTV.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202868192, "author": "Todd Spangler", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-07-10T06:01:25"}, "pmc-tag": "At&t,Directv,DirecTV Now,Hello Sunshine,Reese Witherspoon", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Interview Series to Kick Off Her Hello Sunshine Channel Debut on AT&T, DirecTV", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "digital,tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "digital", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Interview Series to Kick Off Her Hello Sunshine Channel Debut on AT&T, DirecTV", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/reese-witherspoon-shine-on-with-reese-hello-sunshine-att-directv-1202868192/", "description": "Reese Witherspoon will show her personal side in \u201cShine On with Reese\u201d \u2014 the actress-entrepreneur\u2019s first unscripted TV show in which she visits with female celebs and other\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/reese-witherspoon-pnk-att-hello-sunshine-shine-on-with-reese.png?w=1024", "width": 1200, "height": 675, "alt": "Reese Witherspoon, P!nk -
