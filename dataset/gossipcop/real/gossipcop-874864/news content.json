They used to be like brothers before Kanye started running his mouth about Beyonce during his Saint Pablo Tour and he went too far.\n\nThis is what Jay-Z said about Kanye according to the latest interview that he had on the Rap Radar podcast.\n\n? #Jayz #Beyonc\u00e9 #BlueIvy #444 A post shared by JAY-Z (@jayzfanspot) on Aug 6, 2017 at 6:07pm PDT\n\n\u2018Kanye is my little brother. He\u2019s talked about me a hundred times,\u2019 Jay-Z stated this week.\n\nHe even made a song called Big Brother. \u2018We\u2019ve gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it\u2019s a problem.\u2019\n\nFans thought Jay-Z might have put their beef behind him by talking about Kanye on his new album 4:44, but it looks like he\u2019s not ready to let it go just yet, unfortunately.\n\n\u2018You know it\u2019s a problem because he and I would have been talked about it, been resolved our issues,\u2019 Jay-Z shared.\n\n\u2018And he knows crossed the line. He knows. And I know he knows. Because we\u2019ve never let this much space go between one of our disagreements and we\u2019ve had many. That\u2019s part of who we are.\u2019\n\nKidchella #Norths1stBirthday A post shared by Yeezus. (@privatekanye) on Jun 23, 2014 at 8:50am PDT\n\nOn the other hand, Kanye\u2019s health problems are troubling his wife, Kim Kardashian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has been begging her husband to let it all go, because she is afraid that all this diss coming from Jay-Z may affect once again Kanye\u2019s health. We hope that the two of them will somehow be able to sort thing out for the sake of both families.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kourtney-Kardashian-Flaunts-Nipple-In-See-Through-Black-Bra-Top-Lounging-By-The-Pool-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jay-Z-Talks-About-Current-Relationship-With-Kanye-West-He-Knows-He-Crossed-the-Line.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chrissy-and-Kim-Edited-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YNWMelly-Vibe.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kim-Kardashian-StyleCaster.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Jay-Z-Talks-About-Current-Relationship-With-Kanye-West-He-Knows-He-Crossed-the-Line.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jay-z-talks-about-current-relationship-with-kanye-west-he-knows-he-crossed-the-line-61141/", "title": "Jay-Z Talks About Current Relationship With Kanye West: \u2018He Knows He Crossed the Line\u2019", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "beyonce, jay-z, kanye west, kim kardashian, the kardashians,", "keywords": "celebrity news, beyonce, jay-z, kanye west, kim kardashian, the kardashians,", "description": "It seems like Kanye West is still stepping on thin ice with Jay-Z!
