There\u2019s clearly a lot of #blackgirlmagic going on at the beauty brand.\n\nIn an official statement, Curry said, \u201cMy philosophy is all about seeking joy and creating balance in life. I\u2019ve shared a lot about how I do this with food, family and faith, and now \u2013 through my partnership with CoverGirl \u2013 I want to share how makeup helps create those moments of happiness, confidence and self-expression.\u201d\n\nConsidering Curry\u2019s infectious personality and practically permanent smile, we look forward to seeing The Seasoned Life author\u2019s upcoming work with the makeup giant. For her first COVERGIRL campaign, Curry will be promoting the brand\u2019s soon-to-be-launched Peacock Flare Mascara. The new product will hit shelves in November.\n\nIt looks like daughters Riley and Ryan will have some big shoes to fill now if they want to walk in their mama\u2019s footsteps! Curry isn\u2019t the only Black star to recently join the COVERGIRL family.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1505857240/acgettyimages-576754556_copy_720-900x600.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rgb-TAG-Registered-80px.png", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1505857240/acgettyimages-576754556_copy_720.jpg?width=1472&height=1472"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1505857240/acgettyimages-576754556_copy_720-900x600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/beauty/ayesha-curry-official-covergirl/", "title": "Ayesha Curry New Face Of COVERGIRL- Essence", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "COVERGIRL just announced their newest spokesmodel for the makeup brand -- Ayesha Curry.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "<p>Ayesha Curry Has Been Named A New Face Of COVERGIRL, So Much #BlackGirlMagic Happening</p>", "description": "COVERGIRL just announced their newest spokesmodel for the makeup brand -- Ayesha Curry.", "url": "https://www.essence.com/beauty/ayesha-curry-official-covergirl/", "site_name": "Essence", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1505857240/acgettyimages-576754556_copy_720-900x600.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1505857240/acgettyimages-576754556_copy_720-900x600.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/essence"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2453509358209265}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "COVERGIRL just announced their newest spokesmodel for the makeup brand -- Ayesha Curry.", "title": "<p>Ayesha Curry Has Been Named A New Face Of COVERGIRL, So Much #BlackGirlMagic Happening</p>", "site": "@essence", "creator": "@essence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-essence-fav-icon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.essence.com", "summary": ""}
