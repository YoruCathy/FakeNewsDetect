A post shared by skittishkid (@skittishkid) on Apr 16, 2017 at 1:29pm PDT\n\n#BigBoyMcCoy is going to be #BigBroMcCoy! Scott Porter and his wife, Kelsey Mayfield, are expecting their second child together, the Friday Night Lights alum announced on Instagram on Sunday, April 16.\n\n\u201cHappy Easter from our growing family,\u201d Porter, 37, captioned a photo of himself with his son, McCoy, and his pregnant wife. Mayfield shared the same pic and caption on her Instagram account, adding a few bunny and baby emojis for good measure.\n\nThe Hart of Dixie actor and the casting producer met back in 2008 when he was filming FNL in Texas, where she was a cheerleader at the University of Texas at Austin. They married on April 20, 2013, in front of guests including Porter\u2019s former costars Taylor Kitsch and Gaius Charles.\n\nIn February 2015, the couple revealed they were expecting a baby boy. \u201cLittle guy is going to have a tough time deciding who to root for \u2026 but we\u2019ll love him no matter what school he chooses \u2026\u201d Porter captioned a photo of two tiny football jerseys \u2014 one for Texas and one for Nebraska (his home state) \u2014 hanging on a clothesline.\n\nLittle guy is going to have a tough time deciding who to root for\u2026but we\u2019ll love him no matter what school he chooses\u2026right @kiwiporter? #housedivided #PorterOnTheWay A post shared by skittishkid (@skittishkid) on Feb 12, 2015 at 12:24pm PST\n\nMayfield gave birth a few months later in May, and Porter tweeted the experience to his fans. \u201c30 hours in. My wife is a gladiator in the ring!\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am astounded by her fight. A long road to go, no meds at all. Prayers for strength.\u201d\n\nMcCoy has since made several appearances on the actor\u2019s social media accounts, first under the hashtag #BabyBoyMcCoy, and more recently as #BigBoyMcCoy. Earlier this month, Porter shared a pic of his son smiling and carrying a large bouquet of flowers for Mayfield.\n\nTook the bubs to the Farmers Market when Mama wasn\u2019t feeling good. #BigBoyMcCoy was so happy to bring her home some flowers. Sweetest kid ever. And he\u2019s got that #SundayStyle in spades.
