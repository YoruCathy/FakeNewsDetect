As a mom and member of Bravo\u2019s Real Housewives of NYC cast, I love any reason to celebrate! I can\u2019t help but jump right into holiday decorating and what better way to do that then to get some new holiday d\u00e9cor inspiration? You know what that means\u2026 time to go shopping! My decorations go-to: HomeGoods, of course!\n\nFor me, holiday d\u00e9cor needs to evoke feelings of \u201cold Christmas\u201d and memories of days gone by. I love traditional, colorful and old fashion pieces \u2013 the more color, the better I like it! The holidays in New York City (and the Berkshires!) are my absolute favorite time of year.\n\nNo matter how big or how small your space or your holiday gathering, it may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but in my experience, decorating is easier than you think with the right inspiration! The holidays are the perfect time to get together with friends and family, so I\u2019ve laid out five tips for creating a show-stopping holiday space:\n\nTip #1: Mix Traditional with Glitzy\n\nFor my Christmas tree, I love traditional, large old fashion lights bulbs and a mix of glitzy fun ornaments. In the Berkshires, I am able to decorate outside of my home so I really try to have fun with my Christmas tree at my apartment, it\u2019s my centerpiece in the space. I went to HomeGoods this year to refresh my ornament collection and found a London tour bus ornament which I am so excited about, London has such a special place in my heart having lived there for 10 years.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\nTip #2: Create a Faux Mantle\n\nAt my NYC apartment, I don\u2019t have a fireplace so each year I like to create a faux mantle in my living room where I\u2019ll hang stockings and decorate with fake snow. My favorite part of my mantle this year are the gorgeous glass figurines I found at HomeGoods. The reindeer is my favorite!\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\nTip #3: Dress Up the Window Sills\n\nIn addition to my mantle, I also love to dress up my window sill. This year I went with a snow village theme of various trees and adorable caroling people. My favorite is Mrs. Clause, she reminds me of my grandmother, which makes me so happy!\n\n|\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nTip #4: Embrace the Statement Piece\n\n\n\nMy absolute favorite piece in my home this year is the old fashion Christmas TV set. I want to live inside of it! It sings, moves and reminds me of my favorite part about the holiday season, the Christmas spirit. I know Santa isn\u2019t real but for those moments where you really believe, it feels so magical and brings back important memories of cooking, entertaining and being with family.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\nTip #5: Elevate Your Tablescape with Seasonal Pops\n\nEveryone knows I love to cook, clean, decorate and make it nice so when guests come over I want to be prepared. In my dining room, I turned my buffet table into a beautiful spread complete with freshly baked holiday cookies, fun cocktails and beautiful florals. I love fresh flowers, they instantly lift my mood.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2019s a wrap \u2013 I hope my tips inspire you to decorate your home and make it nice!\n\n\n\nPhoto by Matt Harrington\n\nDorinda Medley is a paid HomeGoods partner.", "images": ["https://www.homegoods.com/img/sierra-orn.svg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-4-490x735.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dorinda-7-490x326.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/sierra-gry.gif", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/header/icons/google-play-icon.png", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-79.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dorinda-490x325.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dorinda-6-490x611.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/header/icons/app-store-icon.png", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-3-490x735.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-2-490x735.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/homesense-gry.gif", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dorinda-4-490x324.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/marshalls-gry.gif", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/homegoods-gry.gif", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-490x735.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dorinda-last-490x656.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/homegoods-red.svg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dorinda-3-490x629.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/marshalls-blu.svg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/tjmaxx-gry.gif", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Dorinda-5-490x326.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/tjmaxx-red.svg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/logo.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/homesense-grn.svg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/header/logo.svg", "https://www.homegoods.com/img/the-art-of-finding.gif", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Untitled-design-1-490x735.jpg", "https://www.homegoods.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dorinda-8-490x325.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.homegoods.com/img/logo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.homegoods.com/blog/2017/12/06/how-dorinda-medley-makes-her-home-nice-for-the-holidays/", "title": "How Dorinda Medley Makes Her Home \u201cNice\u201d for the Holidays", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "HomeGoods stores offer an ever-changing selection of unique home fashions in kitchen essentials, rugs, lighting, bedding, bath, furniture and more all at up to 60% off department and specialty store prices every day.", "og": {"url": "https://www.homegoods.com/blog/2017/12/06/how-dorinda-medley-makes-her-home-nice-for-the-holidays/", "type": "website", "title": "How Dorinda Medley Makes Her Home \u201cNice\u201d for the Holidays - HomeGoods", "description": "HomeGoods stores offer an ever-changing selection of unique home fashions in kitchen essentials, rugs, lighting, bedding, bath, furniture and more all at up to 60% off department and specialty store prices every day.", "image": "https://www.homegoods.com/img/logo.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512489600.0, "source": "https://www.homegoods.com", "summary": ""}
