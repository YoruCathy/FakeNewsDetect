Hollywood\u2019s most famous flock to eastern Long Island every summer to live as only Hamptons celebrities can: soaking up sun on the beach, relaxing in their sprawling mansions, and hitting up adorable farm stands. It\u2019s enough to make us all a little envious. But we can always dream, right? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most amazing celebrity homes in the Hamptons, including some formerly celebrity-owned homes that are currently for sale or rent.\n\nBrooke Shields in Southampton\n\nAmerica\u2019s sweetheart owns this charming cottage in Southampton: one of the more classic, historic neighborhoods in the Hamptons, and also one of the wealthiest. This 6-bedroom, 8-bath home has two laundry rooms and a library, and its covered outdoor dining area and huge freshwater pool look like they\u2019d make great places to take it easy.\n\nAnderson Cooper in Westhampton\n\nOur favorite CNN personality used to own this beautiful home in the quieter, more relaxed town of Westhampton. With those waterfront views and three acres of land, it\u2019s a wonder Cooper ever managed to leave. The place also has a ton of great designer touches, including built-ins, fireplaces and Viking appliances.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci in Water Mill\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\u2019s stint in the Trump administration wasn\u2019t much shorter than his stint as the owner of this Water Mill house. Though he and his wife bought the new construction home in 2018 \u2014 for a whopping $9 million \u2014 they put it back on the market almost immediately as they searched for a home on the waterfront. This price isn\u2019t out of the norm for this hamlet on the South Fork, which has a bustling art scene. And here it pays for 8 bedrooms, a huge pool with hot tub, separate guest and staff suites, a media room, and a gym, not to mention style and charm galore. The home is no longer on the market, with a pending sale at an asking price of $7.8 million.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris in East Hampton\n\nNeil Patrick Harris hit it big with a house that sits on 13.5 acres of land in East Hampton. With a tennis court, pool, cabana, garage, and a location adjacent to 10 acres of town-owned, conserved land, he is truly living in the lap of luxury \u2014 and privacy.\n\nBethenny Frankel in Bridgehampton\n\nSkinnygirl magnate and reality TV star Bethenny Frankel put her Bridgehampton home up for sale this spring for just shy of $3 million, only seven months after she purchased it. A recently renovated shingle-style classic, the house has 7 bedrooms, a pool, stone patio, and much, much more. It\u2019s now in contract.\n\nRamona Singer in Southampton\n\nOkay, so maybe Ramona Singer doesn\u2019t live at this Southampton manse anymore, but that only means we regulars have an opportunity to rent one of the Real Housewives\u2019 Hamptons homes. In addition to having a ridiculously nice interior, the waterfront property also comes with a heated pool, covered decks, bocce ball court, sunken tennis court, and more. What a place to spend the summer.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z on Georgica Pond\n\nThe couple who could very well take over the world (their combined net worth is $1.35 billion) have a lovely home in East Hampton, one of the most exclusive towns in the Hamptons. Their house fits right in. Known as \u201cPond House,\u201d it\u2019s located next to Georgica Pond and sits near 17 acres of meadow preserve. With an infinity pool, hand-carved, heated marble bathtubs, and parquet de Versailles flooring, it\u2019s no wonder Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z shelled out $25 million for the place.\n\nJulianne Moore in Montauk\n\nJulianne Moore\u2019s Montauk home is an airy cottage with wood-paneled walls, wide-planked floors, and a screened-in porch. With the water just past the backyard, Moore has easy access to kayaking, paddle boarding, swimming, and more. Truly a Hamptons dream!\n\nAlec Baldwin in East Hampton\n\nAlec Baldwin has been spending much of his time in East Hampton since the \u201880s, when he started renting there. He purchased this house in 1995, and he and his wife Hilaria have since renovated it into a gorgeous family home.\n\nKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos in Southampton\n\nKelly Ripa and husband Mark Consuelos bought their Southampton house in 2004 for $2.35 million, and have since put a whole lot of work into it. Kelly\u2019s familiarity with the Hamptons is paying off \u2014 the TV network Freeform just picked up her and Consuelos\u2019 new show about Hamptons \u201cshare homes,\u201d based on Jasmin Rosemberg\u2019s book \u201cHow The Other Half Hamptons.\u201d Get ready for drama!\n\nRobert Downey, Jr. in East Hampton\n\nIron Man himself owns the famous \u201cWindmill Cottage\u201d in East Hampton, which doesn\u2019t feature a truly working windmill, but rather a replica of a classic Hamptons one. The house was apparently used to film the movie \u201cDeathtrap\u201d during the \u201880s. There\u2019s also a separate guesthouse onsite, in addition to a tennis court and pool.\n\nRobert De Niro in Montauk\n\nRobert De Niro owns this oceanfront property in Montauk, although he got permission last year to knock down the existing house and build something smaller. While we\u2019re not sure that ever happened, we\u2019re excited to see what De Niro might do.\n\nCalvin Klein in Southampton\n\nFashion designer Calvin Klein reportedly spent more than $75 million building this house out on Meadow Lane in Southampton, which, at least from this Google Street View image, looks like a big glass box. But of course it\u2019s more than that: The home sits right on the water, and sliding glass doors in every room look out over expertly landscaped sand dunes. The whole thing took years to complete.\n\nChristie Brinkley in Bridgehampton\n\nThe actress and model actually listed both of her Hamptons homes in 2018 and decided that she would live in whichever one didn\u2019t sell. The result? She still calls Tower Hill \u2014 an 11,000-square-foot historic home on 20 acres \u2014 home.\n\nJill Martin in Southampton\n\nWhen the TV personality and sportscaster needs a little break, she heads to a six-bedroom, six-bath Southampton home that was built in 2016. The 5,300-square-foot hideaway also includes a wine cellar and sauna.\n\nLouis CK on Shelter Island\n\nThe comedian dropped $2.44 million in 2014 for a charming Tudor from the 1900s dubbed Primrose Cottage. Inside the historic home there\u2019s plenty of original details and impressive old-world craftsmanship. And the two acres of waterfront escape (complete with a dock) make it an ideal retreat from the stage.\n\nElie Tahari in Sagaponack\n\nThis Sagaponack oceanfront home is everything you\u2019d expect from one of the world\u2019s top fashion designers. Spread out over 4,500-square-feet is three bedrooms and bathrooms, a great room with soaring ceilings, chef\u2019s kitchen and master suite with unobstructed views of the Atlantic Ocean. And the 60-foot swimming pool is perfectly secluded by Russian Olive trees. The house is currently on the market, but Tahari can still call it home for now.\n\nIna Garten in East Hampton\n\nAn eat-in kitchen with professional appliances and doors opening to rear dining terrace is par for the course when it comes to a celebrity chef\u2019s home. The rest of the cozy space includes a master suite with a balcony, wraparound porch, and a formal dining with French doors to an arbor. Garten did list the three acre lot in prime East Hampton Village in 2019, but the listing has since been removed.\n\n\u2014\n\nFor the best of the Hamptons and North Fork, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.", "images": ["https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Christie-3874ab.png", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/calvin-klein-house-hamptons-15ac17.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/robert-de-niro-montauk-house-2ebbbe.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/ina-0a60e6.png", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/ramona-singer-hamptons-house-702c28.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/alec-baldwin-house-1a9441.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/CelebHouses_Thumbnail-95eefd.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/OE_avatar-a545e6-150x150.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/louis-8c4ce7.png", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/kelly-ripa-and-mark-consuelos-hamptons-house-0e119f.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/brooke-shields-house-hamptons-92a00b.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Bethenny-Frankel-Lists-Morning-Glory-House-f88442-c823d6.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/juliane-moore-hamptons-house-0d2286.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/neil-patrick-harris-hamptons-house-39305e.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Robert-Downey-Jr-Hamptons-7d67ae.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Jill-009c8a.png", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/jay-bey-pond-house-5f8c0c-1024x462-a78a94.jpg", "https://outeast.com/wp-content/themes/out-east/dist/images/i-shorthand-white_29dc66d7.svg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Anderson-Cooper-house-hamptons-471a93.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Scaramucci-New-Water-Mill-House-3555c5-118444.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/elie-4a723a.png", "https://outeast.com/wp-content/themes/out-east/dist/images/i-logo_1e8046f1.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=50&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/CelebHouses_Thumbnail-95eefd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heading Out", "Grace Cassidy", "Andrea Mazandi", "Mariela Quintana"], "canonical_link": "https://outeast.com/stories/hamptons-celebrities-homes/", "title": "Hamptons Celebrities' Homes: See How the Stars Live", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "description": "The Hamptons is full of celebrities, and you won't believe some of their homes.
