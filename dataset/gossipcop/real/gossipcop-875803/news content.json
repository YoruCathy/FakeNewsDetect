Or perhaps more accurately, Scarlet could only stay away from Jane for so long.\n\nAfter Jane\u2019s decision to leave the magazine at the end of The Bold Type\u2018s first season, she went through a lot. She became a meme. She was fired. She was rejected by Scarlet. And then, after a lot of writing at coffee shops and wearing sweats, she seemed to figure out the whole freelance market. But of course, the moment she did that, Jacqueline declared that she was ready to return home.\n\nNow, EW has an exclusive sneak peek at Jane\u2019s first day back in the Scarlet offices, where she\u2019ll once again get to write under Jacqueline\u2019s guidance, wear amazing outfits, and of course, drink in the fashion closet with her best friends.\n\nWatch the full clip above.\n\nThe Bold Type airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on Freeform.", "images":
