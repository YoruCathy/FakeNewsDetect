The Bronx bred rapper has been on the news ever since her debut single \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019 set the music world on fire.\n\nThe hit single was the first female-sung song to reach #1 on the Hot 100 chart since 1998. \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019 reigned at the charts for three weeks \u2013 the joint longest by any female in 2017.\n\nHowever, this time she created headlines for a whole new reason. Belcalis Marlenis Almanza, or Cardi B as she is popularly known, has given birth to a baby girl.\n\nShe let the world know through Instagram, revealing the name of the girl, \u2018Kulture Kiari Cephus.\u2019 The caption was set against a nude floral picture of Cardi B.\n\nIs Cardi B Pregnant?\n\n\u201cCardi was so excited to have the baby early and has been nothing but head over heels with her baby girl,\u201d a source shared with a private news agency. \u201cShe had a smooth delivery, and the baby was definitely ready to be here early.\u201d\n\nThis is her first and her beau Offset\u2019s fourth child.\n\nBorn on 10th of July 2018, Kulture has been hidden well beyond the eyes of the paparazzi for all of her existence. However, the rapper is beginning to give her fans a sneak peek into her world of being a mother.\n\nOnly recently she uploaded a video of her baby\u2019s custom-made crib on Instagram to much interest of Hollywood.\n\nBut that\u2019s about it. The rapper has secluded to privacy and is reluctant to share pictures of herself or her baby. The rapper even refused to confront her own cellphone camera.\n\nAs per various reports, Cardi is obsessed with Kulture and is very attached and overprotective. She has only let her family and a few friends see the baby and has been spending a lot of time at home with her husband.\n\nCardi B resorted to Instagram to thank her fans for the overwhelming support that helped her achieve 10 MTV Music Video Award Nominations. However, the video focused on a doll instead of the famous Instagram star herself.\n\nShe stated , \u201c It\u2019s your girl Cardi B. I wish I could show my face right now, but a bitch looks f\u2013ked up in the game. My hair\u2019s f\u2013ked up. My eyes are so dark and puffy. Like, I\u2019m wild pale.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI know I haven\u2019t said anything about it but it\u2019s because I\u2019ve just been so busy, so tired and like in a different world, different dimension.\u201d\n\nFrom rocking the red carpet to refusing to show her face \u2013 the birth of Kulture has signaled a change in the ways of Cardi B.\n\nShe was \u2018ecstatic\u2019 about the whole pregnancy affair and has grown very overprotective and dedicated to her newborn, according to close sources.\n\nComing off the success of her album \u2018Invasion Of Privacy\u2019 which debuted at #1 at the Billboard, the female rapper is fully committed to being an ideal mother, so much that she has rejected the idea of a nanny.\n\n\u2018I have not gotten a nanny yet,\u2019 she said in a video . \u2018I just want to learn how to be a mom. I want to enjoy every single second of it since I\u2019m going back to work.\u2019\n\nCardi B\u2019s Pregnancy Experience\n\nNot everything has been smooth about her road to motherhood though. Cardi B has seen the highs and lows during her pregnancy. Here we will look through the highlights of the time Cardi was pregnant.\n\nFirstly, she was hit by a cheating rumor regarding Offset in December 2017, just two months after he proposed her in a concert. Hackers had released private images of Offset which sparked the rumors. She was in her initial stages of pregnancy at that time.\n\nShe was reportedly upset but asked for privacy and respect from the media. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a decision in my own times with my heart and mind. I don\u2019t need to be rushed or be told what to do.\u201d\n\nThe two made peace and moved on rather affectionately, spotted in the 2018 Grammy\u2019s in January.\n\nThe rapper had said in an interview at the 2018 Grammy Awards that somebody is always saying that she\u2019s pregnant every two weeks. \u201cSo it\u2019s just like, if ya\u2019ll wanna know, ask me, I\u2019ll tell ya,\u201d she added.\n\nShe remained tight-lipped during the whole affair, responding to pregnancy questions by saying she\u2019s getting fat. A reply to a followers question read \u201cNo bitch I\u2019m just getting fat. Let me fat in peace.\u201d\n\nDuring this period Cardi B was attending functions in heavy, well-covered dresses with extravagant frills and puffs that did well to hide the baby bump. While many speculated the reason behind the change in design, for most it was just a fashion tweak.\n\nThe announcement came in April, as she was hosting the SNL Live with actor Chadwick Boseman. Dressed in a skin-tight gown that revealed the baby bump in all its grace, the rapper addressed the world.\n\nIn response to the mean comments, she reiterated her desire for privacy. \u201cThis is why I did not want to say nothing,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cPeople be so thirsty to scrutinize and try to destroy something that is supposed to be a blessing.\u201d\n\nIn a later interview, she revealed she had some doubts about the whole pregnancy thing. However, she was determined to go on and be a mother. Cardi was recorded saying, \u201cYou know what\u2014I\u2019m a grown woman. I\u2019m 25 years old. I\u2019m a schmillionaire and I\u2019m prepared for this.\u201d\n\nWhile she was setting the industry ablaze previously, she did not stop with pregnancy. Cardi performed at Coachella 2018 along with gracing prestigious events, the Billboard Latin Music Awards and the Met Gala.\n\nIn May, she revealed in an interview that the child is going to be a girl. This revelation was followed by another major revelation.\n\nIn May, Rolling Stone unveiled their cover for the July edition. It showed Offset kissing Cardi\u2019s baby bump. She revealed that the two secretly got married last year.\n\nShe added to the revelation in typical fashion. \u201cWell now since you lil nosey f\u2013ks know at least ya can stop saying I had a baby out of wedlock.\u201d\n\nSince July, Cardi B had dedicated her time and energy to her baby. Now that Kulture is here safe and sound, she will look to return to work.\n\nThe upcoming weeks are all reserved to her motherhood before she leaves for a tour with Bruno Mars in September.\n\nRelevant Topics:\n\nNorth West Stylist: Baby North West Has Her Own Stylist\n\nPerfect Baby Names for Kate Middleton & Prince William\u2019s Third Child\n\nJohn Stamos Opens Up About His Parenting Struggles", "images": ["https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/pregnancy.png?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/periodafteramiscarriage-100x70.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cardi-bs-pregnancy.jpg", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pasted-image-0-100x70.png?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cardi-B\u2019s-Pregnancy-1.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/logo1-300x111.png?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/hollywood-celebrities-and-their-pregnancy-218x150.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Meghan-Markle-218x150.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Infertility-2.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2-100x70.png?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amazing-Thanksgiving-History--218x150.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PCOS-anatomy.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/chrissy-teigen-is-giving-parenting-goals-218x150.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Swimming-while-pregnant.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Too-protective.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-History-of-Halloween-1-218x150.jpg?x65456", "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/John-Stamos-parenting-struggles-218x150.jpg?x65456"], "top_img": "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cardi-bs-pregnancy.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Please Enter Your Name Here"], "canonical_link": "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/cardi-b-pregnancy/", "title": "A Look Back at Cardi B\u2019s Pregnancy as Her Due Date Approaches", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cardi-bs-pregnancy.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.checkpregnancy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cardi-bs-pregnancy.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 667}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A Look Back at Cardi B\u2019s Pregnancy as Her Due Date Approaches", "description": "Cardi B is no stranger to headlines.
