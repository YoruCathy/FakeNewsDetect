It was matched with a Philip Treacy hat and shoes by Jimmy Choo.\n\nHowever style spotters were quick to point out she had worn that outfit before. It was first worn for the christening of Princess Charlotte back in July 2015, and at the Queen\u2019s birthday celebrations in June 2016. She also wore the coat to the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium in July last year.\n\nThe Duchess stepped into the church just minutes ahead of the bride herself, in a stunning modern Givenchy dress.\n\nThe Queen and Prince Philip were also last to arrive before the bride, in keeping with royal protocol that dictates those most senior arrive last.\n\nThe Queen wore a flared dress in lime, lemon, purple and grey printed silk by favoured designer Stuart Parvin and entered the church to a fanfare. The Duke wore a morning suit and it\u2019s the first time he\u2019s been spotted in public since a recent hip operation.\n\nCamilla, the Duchess of Cornwall wore an ice pink silk marocain asymmetrical coat dress from Anna Valentine. Meghan\u2019s mum, Doria Ragland, wore a custom dress and day coat designed by creative directors of Oscar de la Renta, Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim.\n\nCELEBRITY STUDDED WEDDING\n\nGuests included an eclectic mix of British aristocracy, Hollywood celebrities, sports stars and members of nominated charities who were outside the chapel.\n\nOprah Winfrey was spotted walking in along with Idris Elba, James Blunt and Princess Diana\u2019s brother Earl Spencer.\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s ex-girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy both made an appearance, alongside senior members of the royal family including Princess Anne, Zara Phillips and Princess Beatrice and Eugenie.\n\nMORE: Harry and Meghan\u2019s new titles announced\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney and David and Victoria Beckham arrived within minutes of each other. Amal Clooney wore a canary yellow dress and hat, while Victoria Beckham wore navy blue and David Beckham stopped to take a selfie at the entrance to the event with Amelia Thompson, a survivor of the Manchester Arena bombing.\n\nRoyal Wedding: George Clooney and The Beckhams amongst star-studded guest list Royal Wedding: George Clooney and The Beckhams amongst star-studded guest list\n\nElton John, former Miss World Priyanka Chopra, TV host James Corden, actor Tom Hardy, the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson and Meghan Markle\u2019s co-stars from Suits also attended, as did former British Prime Minister John Major.\n\nEarlier, Serena Williams shared pictures of herself getting ready, ending speculation over whether she had been invited to the event. She wore an elegant pink outfit with matching fascinator and posed alongside her husband Alexis Ohanian.\n\nKate Middleton\u2019s family arrived together, with Pippa Middleton wearing a mint green long-sleeved dress over her baby bump. Former England rugby player Jonny Wilkinson also arrived with his pregnant partner.\n\nAbigail Spencer, Janina Gavankar, Patrick J. Adams, Rick Hoffman, Sarah Rafferty and Gina Torres of Suits also attended.\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s best friends, including Tom Inskip were also there. Former England rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward also attended, along with Princess Diana\u2019s siblings.\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s father, half sister and brother were not there after a dramatic week in which Thomas Markle was forced to pull out following heart surgery.\n\nActress Carey Mulligan was spotted arriving with her husband, singer Marcus Mumford. Singer Joss Stone and Meghan\u2019s glamorous friends Jessica Mulroney and fashion designer Misha Nonoo were also set to attend.\n\nOutside the chapel, people from nominated charities gathered to
