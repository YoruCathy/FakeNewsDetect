However, Dawson\u2019s parents, played by Mary-Margaret Humes and John Wesley Shipp, were not invited.\n\n\u201cOK, so let me get this off my chest as the initial hurt has subsided just a bit,\u201d Humes, 63, wrote in an Instagram post on Thursday, March 29. \u201cI send an enormous amount of love and shout outs to the thousands of followers messages and love that both @johnwesleyshippjr and I have read about being left out of @entertainmentweekly \u2018s #dawsonscreek \u2018reunion\u2019 photos.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cThis was their choice \u2026 not ours \u2026 it was done behind our backs and we both were literally blindsided by it when we woke up yesterday in NYC and LA. We both did a short telephone interview after the fact, but were never told about the reunion. For months, I have been posting #behindthescenes photos to share my experiences of six years on this show. We were a #family & I know how much the photos mean to you from all the love you send me in comments \u2026 Yes, I do read them.\u201d\n\nShe went on to explain that she will continue posting throwback photos from her time on the show, and couldn\u2019t be more thankful for her costars and for the fans. \u201cFor the portion of our family that did appear in these photos \u2026 congratulations, you look great and I love you,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI only wish I had been given the opportunity to have said it to your faces. Such a shame.\u201d\n\nShipp, 63, also took to Instagram to share a photo of the EW reunion, Photoshopping himself and Humes in.\n\nThe reunion included the original four cast members, as well as Mary Beth Peil (Grams), Kerr Smith (Jack), Meredith Monroe (Andie) and Busy Philipps (Audrey). Oddly enough, both Humes and Shipp starred in more episodes (93 and 83, respectively) than Monroe and Philipps (69 and 46).\n\nIn January, Us Weekly spoke to Humes about her time on the show, and she shared that she was very eager to get the cast back together.\n\n\u201cEverybody talks about, \u2018Oh is there gonna be a reunion? Is there gonna be a convention? Is there a way to bring everybody back together again?\u2019 Some say too many people are dead and yada, yada, yada. But in my mind, I have this thought that there\u2019s a way to suspend your disbelief where everyone can get the happily ever after,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m just putting it out there into the universe because I\u2019m harboring a little secret idea and we\u2019ll see what happens!\u201d\n\nDawson\u2019s Creek is currently streaming on Hulu.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C17px%2C900px%2C509px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek2.jpg?w=300", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/dawsons-creek-parents-cast-reunion-was-done-behind-our-backs/", "title": "'Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Parents: Cast Reunion Was 'Done Behind Our Backs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Mary-Margaret Humes and John Wesley Shipp were shocked to see that the \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 cast got back together for a reunion photo shoot and that they were not invited \u2014 read their comments", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Parents: Cast Reunion Was 'Done Behind Our Backs'", "description": "Mary-Margaret Humes and John Wesley Shipp were shocked to see that the \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 cast got back together for a reunion photo shoot and that they were not invited \u2014 read their comments", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/dawsons-creek-parents-cast-reunion-was-done-behind-our-backs/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-30T21:14:32+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-03-30T17:32:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-30T21:14:32+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Mary-Margaret Humes and John Wesley Shipp were shocked to see that the \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 cast got back together for a reunion photo shoot and that they were not invited \u2014 read their comments", "title": "\u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Parents: Cast Reunion Was 'Done Behind Our Backs'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C900px%2C473px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522431162.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
