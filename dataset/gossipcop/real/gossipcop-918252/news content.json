He had traveled there to ask Daniela Vega, who would become the star of his of Oscar-nominated film, a question: What is it like to be a transgender woman in Santiago these days?\n\nLelio recalls Vega answering this, in part, by showing him something once they sat down together at a nearby cafe. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget this,\u201d says Lelio, whose feature, A Fantastic Woman, is one of five up for best foreign language film. \u201cShe opened her purse and took out her ID, with her old masculine identity on it, because the state of Chile doesn\u2019t recognize or acknowledge the existence of transgender people\u2026. I was just in awe.\u201d\n\nBoth the director and the star say that A Fantastic Woman is not a political film, even if it is having a political impact. The success of the film has catapulted Vega to stardom in Chile, where she recently called for reform to the country\u2019s laws while sharing a stage with the outgoing president \u2014 and where the film is still showing in theaters, more than a year after it become a darling on the festival circuit. The actress will also be making history when the ceremony airs on March 4, with Vega becoming the first openly transgender person to present an Academy Award.\n\n\u201cI feel a lot of love from everybody,\u201d Vega, 28, tells TIME on a phone call from Chile, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cIf there is any problem, I would say there is a social problem. It\u2019s about the lack of action on the part of the politicians when it comes to transgender rights.\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s nomination is trailblazing too, because the lead role is not only a transgender character but one being played by a transgender actress. Viewers may recall that non-transgender actors have been feted for playing such roles in recent years (See: Jared Leto in Dallas Buyers Club or Eddie Redmayne in The Danish Girl). Those casting choices, advocates say, are by no means wrong, but they can reaffirm the stereotype that transgender women are nothing more than men in costume.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare to have this kind of thing come along,\u201d says Nick Adams, who works at LGBTQ media advocacy organization GLAAD. When Vega is out promoting the film, \u201cshe is still a woman, which is who transgender women are,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are not just women when they\u2019re on screen.\u201d\n\nThe story of A Fantastic Woman is one about grief and shock, exploring the question of what happens to a person when their lover dies just moments after they were in a tender embrace. Lelio initially planned on telling this tale through a cisgender heterosexual couple, but the moment he and his script co-writer Gonzalo Maza hit on the notion of the woman being transgender, the project took on a new dimension, presenting a challenge to the filmmakers and the viewers.\n\nFor the director, the challenge was in how to tell the story. \u201cI heard like a clack in my head. I froze,\u201d Lelio says. \u201cBecause I felt that the idea was extremely moving, contemporary, full of the potential of resonating with so many things that we are going through as a human society. And at the same time,\u201d he continues, \u201cit was, to me, full of dangers. Political dangers, aesthetic dangers, artistic dangers. It had so many traps that it was too irresistible.\u201d\n\nFor viewers, this decision also changed the stakes, because it is easy to feel understanding for someone whose life is similar to your own. \u201cThe first question that I would like for people to ask when they watch this movie is, what\u2019s happening with empathy. What are the limits of our empathy?\u201d Vega says. \u201cAnd who has the right to say that certain bodies cannot be inhabited or certain loves cannot be conquered?\u201d\n\nInitially Lelio had reached out to Vega to be a consultant on the film. But over the course of a year, the script \u201cstarted to absorb elements from Daniela,\u201d he says. For instance: the main character, Marina, became a singer because Vega is a singer (a classically trained one who did live recordings for most of the music in the film). Lelio says he knew from the minute he met her that he wanted a transgender actress to play the role.\n\n\u201cIt felt like it was too late for that, to me,\u201d he says of casting a non-transgender actor to play Marina. \u201cI\u2019m not saying transgender characters should be only interpreted by transgender actors \u2014 because that would be as rigid as saying transgender actors cannot play cisgender roles, and that\u2019s not the idea. I want to be clear about that. We are talking about freedom here. I\u2019m just saying that was my feeling and my solution to the ethical challenge of how to cast this film.\u201d\n\nThe film is more provocative than preachy. Lelio likes to describe it as transg\u00e9nero, a word that can mean transgender as well as cross-genre. At times it feels suspenseful and dangerous, at others like a love story. There\u2019s magical realism and regular old realism, as the main character, Marina, has her identity and her relationship questioned by secondary characters ranging from her lover\u2019s children to the police. Some characters in the movie affirmingly call her Senora, others call her a pervert and a chimera.\n\nThe director says he chose the title A Fantastic Woman (or Una Mujer Fantastica) in part because he was offering two options to the spectators. \u201cFantastic means that which has extraordinary properties,\u201d he says, \u201cbut at the time it means that which is the product of fantasy. So the spectator has enough space within the film, I hope, to decide which way Marina is fantastic.\u201d When secondary characters make those judgments, Lelio says, they are revealing things about themselves more than her. That is why there are several scenes where Marina points her big, dark eyes straight at the camera. Those moments are meant to say to viewers, \u201cWhat are you seeing in me? What are you projecting?\u201d he explains.\n\nVega emphasizes that the story itself is not biographical. But she has faced discrimination in her own life and the fact that we know she could face the same kind of treatment that Marina does makes the film more uncomfortable and more powerful. \u201cThat delivery of a line comes from deep down within,\u201d says Participant Media\u2019s Jonathan King, whose company has produced other \u201cpro-social\u201d films like Spotlight and An Inconvenient Truth. He says that the Oscar nomination has made the film more impactful in Chile, because having a feature put up for an award on the big night is \u201calmost like sending your team to the World Cup or the Olympics.\u201d\n\nVega, the starring member of that team, doesn\u2019t want to focus too much on who plays which roles. She says the real problem is a lack of opportunities for transgender people across the board \u2014 that there is struggle to get employment in many industries, that transgender people in Chile face difficulties in trying to get housing \u2014 and she sees the arts as something that can act as a catalyst. \u201cThe arts were actually a window of opportunity for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a chain effect, in the sense that throughout the arts there will be more inclusion.\u201d And that will lead to more inclusion in other industries, she adds.\n\nSo what does Vega think of her upcoming turn as a presenter at the Oscars, a moment being heralded by LGBT rights groups? As she responds, her interpreter laughs. \u201cI love that everybody is so excited about it,\u201d her interpreter relays. \u201cAnd I really, really hope that they love the dress I\u2019m going to be wearing.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.
