Tyra has a busy life on account of her hosting duties, as well as motherhood. In fact, during an interview with E! News, the model talked about being a mom and what it\u2019s like to raise her son, York.\n\nIn case you missed it, Banks welcomed York by surrogate two years ago and announced the news in January of 2016.\n\nBanks, like Kim Kardashian, had her baby via surrogate due to possible complications during surgery. In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the reality star revealed that her doctor said another pregnancy would be too much of a risk.\n\nAlthough it isn\u2019t clear if Banks had the same illness as Kim, it\u2019s clear that she must\u2019ve needed the surrogate to have a child.\n\nWhile speaking with the reporter, she said she is a \u201chardworking momma\u201d and plans to set an excellent example of what it\u2019s like to be a person with a tremendous work-ethic.\n\nBanks said to E! that she wants her child to know what it takes to get what you want out of life. The former supermodel said, \u201cthat\u2019s how we have these things, and we can travel and get on airplanes.\u201d\n\nBanks said, despite her hard work and constant traveling, she often brings her son along. The host of America\u2019s Next Top Model claimed she wants her child to understand what she\u2019s up to whenever she\u2019s away.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Tyra revealed her baby is \u201cthe boss\u201d because his demands come front and center. She added, if you\u2019re tired, it doesn\u2019t matter because when the child wants to play, you just have to either way.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lookbook-eva-tyra-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tyra-Banks--700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tyra-Banks-Billboard--e1513744627378.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Joe-Rogan-Angers-Some-Of-His-Fans-After-Revealing-Hes-Been-Tested-Multiple-Times-For-COVID-19-300x210.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Caitriona-Balfe-Sam-Heughan-Outlander-Actors-300x210.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rasheeda-Frost-Kirk-Store-Pressed-Restocked-300x177.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tyra-banks-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1280_garcelle_beauvais_jamie_foxx_GettyImages-171509406-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tamar-Braxton-Vincent-Herbert-Divorce-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tyra-Banks-Billboard--e1513744627378.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/tyra-banks-opens-up-about-motherhood-will-she-have-more-kids-97618/", "title": "Tyra Banks Opens Up About Motherhood \u2013 Will She Have More Kids?", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "americas next top model, Tyra Banks,", "keywords": "celebrity news, americas next top model, Tyra Banks,", "description": "Next year, on the 9th of January, Tyra will return to host the upcoming season of America's Next Top Model on Vh1.
