In the behind-the-scenes photograph, the mom of three was covered in grey plaster, but that was not enough to cover her nether region or her nipples, so she was forced to blur out her private parts.\n\n\u201cWe took a mold of my body and made it a perfume bottle,\u201d she captioned the revealing image.\n\nOn top of her upcoming KKW Fragrance launch, Kardashian West also teamed up with Lumee to design her own collection of Kimoji-covered cases, available now online.\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian Shares ANOTHER Nude Photo As Concerns for Husband Kanye West Grow\n\nBefore unveiling her new fragrance bottle, Kardashian West defended her husband, who has been making headlines for his ongoing Twitter spree, in a series of tweets of her own.\n\n\u201cTo the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this\u2026 your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRELATED: Kanye West Has Had \u2018Explosive\u2019 Fights with Kris Jenner & Kim Kardashian Can\u2019t \u2018Control\u2019 Him: Sources\n\nContinued Kardashian West: \u201cYesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye\u2019s mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I\u2019m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America?\u201d she added. \u201cBecause some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That\u2019s just not fair. He\u2019s actually out of the sunken place when he\u2019s being himself which is very expressive.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty\n\nLooking for more style content?

I\u2019m not a Democrat or a Republican.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWhen he spoke out about Trump\u2026 Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this,\u201d the mom of three said. \u201cBut this is HIS opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if really different from mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe never said he agrees with his politics,\u201d she added.\n\nLast but not least, Kardashian West praised her husband for being unique, even if he\u2019s not universally liked.\n\n\u201cKanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that\u2019s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren\u2019t labeled the way he is and you will all praise them!\u201d she wrote. \u201cKanye is years ahead of his time.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkim-k-perfume-1-2000x1333.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fgettyimages-601892266-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkim-k-perfume-1-1333x2000b-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fkim-k-perfume-1-2000x1333.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mariah Haas"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-debuts-fragrance-bottle-inspired-her-naked-form-after-kanye-west-twitter-spree/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Debuts 'KKW Body' Fragrance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Beauty,Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,Style,TV,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Beauty,Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,Style,TV,TV Watch", "description": "On Wednesday, Kim Kardashian West revealed her 'KKW Body' fragrance bottle, inspired by her naked form, on Instagram.", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Debuts Fragrance Bottle Inspired by her Naked Form\u00a0After Kanye West's Twitter Spree", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/kim-kardashian-debuts-fragrance-bottle-inspired-her-naked-form-after-kanye-west-twitter-spree/", "description": "Kim Kardashian West just revealed her latest fragrance bottle and, as promised, it\u2019s shaped like her body.
