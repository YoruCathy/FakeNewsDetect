He proved to be a sly force of nature throughout season 33\u2019s Millennials vs. Gen X edition, winning allies with savvy gameplay and a wide grin. And on season 34\u2019s Game Changers \u2014 which is currently airing and pits some of Survivor\u2019s most interesting experienced players against one another \u2014 Zeke has been strategic, focused, and giddy as hell to be playing a game he loves with players he\u2019s watched for years.\n\nZeke is also transgender. But this isn\u2019t a fact that you, or I, or anyone outside the people he\u2019s revealed it to would know if it weren\u2019t for Survivor\u2019s April 12 episode, during which a member of Zeke\u2019s tribe outed him in a moment of vindictive desperation \u2014 while simultaneously declaring that Zeke was being deceptive by not revealing his transgender status.\n\nSurvivor has been a surprisingly astute study of personal politics since it premiered on CBS nearly two decades ago, in 2000. (I mean, watching people do puzzles in the jungle is fun, but it\u2019s not \u201c34 seasons and counting\u201d levels of fun.) When pushed to their physical edges and worn down to their rawest nerves, people tend to either fall back (almost gratefully) into what a script would have them do or turn around and surprise you.\n\nThis episode was definitely a surprise \u2014 but in more ways than that first nasty moment. The way Zeke was outed furthered a pernicious misconception, the kind that puts transgender people in real danger every day. But by the end of the hour, there was, incredibly, more reason to be hopeful about the way trans people are seen and represented than before.\n\nZeke was outed when a fellow player got desperate and made a reprehensible decision\n\nFor a while, \u201cWhat Happened on Exile Stays on Exile\u201d was about as typical an episode of Survivor as any other episode that\u2019s aired this season. One tribe won pizza; the other had a tearful conversation around a campfire. When Zeke\u2019s tribe failed to spell \u201cmetamorphosis\u201d in a word jumble during the final challenge, they were put in the unfortunate position of having to vote someone out during Tribal Council. The obvious pick was Jeff Varner, since Varner\u2019s only ally was voted off the show last week. And Varner knew it, especially once Zeke \u2014 a new friend \u2014 told him frankly that his chances weren\u2019t looking good.\n\nSurvivor contestants usually try to pull a few Hail Marys once they realize they\u2019re circling the drain. But for Varner, feeling the pinch of possible elimination, that apparently involved any strategy he could come up with to torpedo Zeke\u2019s ironclad alliance with the rest of the tribe.\n\n\u201cZeke\u2019s not being truthful,\u201d Varner insisted to the camera. \u201cI know something about Zeke that none of them know. ... This is not the guy you think he is.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like typical Survivor talk. But these statements take on a whole new, and horrifying, context in light of what Varner did at Tribal Council. After his first pitch to make everyone turn on a fellow tribe member flopped, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d He then turned to Zeke and said, point blank, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told anyone you\u2019re transgender?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m showing here,\u201d Varner continued as Zeke and his teammates blinked, \u201cis a deception.\u201d\n\nZeke, in a remarkably candid piece for the Hollywood Reporter, writes that he was too shocked to react at first. He and the Survivor producers had apparently talked about the possibility that him being transgender might come up, but according to Survivor host and producer Jeff Probst, they agreed that \u201cif his story was to be told, he would be the one to decide when, where, and how.\u201d\n\n(For those wondering if this episode falls into that category, it\u2019s not clear if Zeke would have \u2014 or could have \u2014 preferred to keep this episode off the air. According to GLAAD, its Transgender Media Program worked with CBS and Zeke \u201cfor several months to ensure that when the episode aired, Zeke would have the opportunity to speak for himself about his experience.\u201d)\n\nA longtime Survivor obsessive, Zeke wrote for THR that he just wanted the chance to play as Zeke, a guy with a knack for strategy and thinking three steps ahead. \u201cI didn\u2019t discuss my trans status in my initial [audition] video,\u201d he writes, \u201cbecause I wanted the show to desire me as a game player and an eccentric storyteller, not as \u2018The First Trans Survivor Player.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe show seemed to respect that \u2014 but one of its contestants didn\u2019t.\n\nAnd now, a quick reminder of why calling trans people \u201cdeceptive\u201d is such a dangerous thing to do\n\nAs Zeke\u2019s teammates rose up to call out Varner during Tribal Council (more on that in a minute), Debbie Wanner declared that Zeke not disclosing that he\u2019s transgender \u201cisn\u2019t deceiving us strategically in a game.\u201d\n\nAnd in a reply I hope Varner truly regrets, he doubled down by insisting that it \u201creveals the ability to deceive.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be very clear: Saying that trans people are inherently deceptive feeds into one of the most poisonous misconceptions about what it means to be transgender. It paints trans people as liars who are willfully misleading innocents astray, when they\u2019re just people trying to live their lives. It invalidates their identities and experiences in a way that makes them more vulnerable to discrimination and assault.\n\nIt is, in other words, an extraordinarily shitty thing to do to someone, even if you don\u2019t consider him a friend, as Varner appeared to think of Zeke.\n\nBy all accounts, Varner deeply regrets what he did. And Zeke has acknowledged that he can forgive Varner\u2019s mistake. But he also admits that he probably can\u2019t forget the toxicity of Varner\u2019s words. As he wrote for THR:\n\nIn proclaiming \u201cZeke is not the guy you think he is\u201d and that \u201cthere is deception on levels y\u2019all don\u2019t understand,\u201d Varner is saying that I\u2019m not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick. In reality, by being Zeke the dude, I am being my most honest self \u2014 as is every other transgender person going about their daily lives.\n\nIn fact, as Zeke put it to People, Varner\u2019s entire strategy hinged on painting trans people as liars. \u201cThat reasoning is infinitely worse than him outing me because it\u2019s the same one used to discriminate against, attack and murder trans people,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cWhat\u2019s great is that nobody bought it.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s anything encouraging about this disaster, it\u2019s what Zeke and his competitors did next\n\nIn the moments after Varner outed Zeke, everyone else who was present \u2014 including host Jeff Probst \u2014 was taken aback. They were not, however, confused.\n\nIn a swarm of immediate and furious disgust, a few phrases kept jumping out: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s personal.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s wrong of you to do that.\u201d\n\nImmediately, what could have been nothing more than a cruel televised outing became something else entirely: an unequivocal shutdown of unfounded anti-trans rhetoric on national television, and on a landmark network reality show at that.\n\nVarner, scrambling, first defended his reasoning with the aforementioned \u201cability to deceive\u201d nonsense, only to have Probst fire back that Varner was taking \u201ca giant leap of logic.\u201d When Varner then tried to save face by reminding everyone he was just trying to win a million dollars, contestant Tai Trang exclaimed in horror, \u201c[By] outing somebody?!\u201d\n\nNothing Varner tried could get anyone around him to mince words. Fan favorite Ozzy Lusth \u2014 who\u2019s now on his fourth round of Survivor with Game Changers \u2014 told Varner he should be \u201cashamed ... of what [he\u2019s] willing to do,\u201d adding that he was \u201cplaying with people\u2019s lives at this point.\u201d\n\nEventually, Varner began to fall all over himself apologizing, saying he thought Zeke was \u201cout and loud and proud.\u201d But Varner and Zeke\u2019s teammate Sarah Lacina wasn\u2019t buying it, delivering a truly impressive eye roll and calling Varner\u2019s tactic \u201ca malicious attack.\u201d She then stumbled into a moment that took even her by surprise. \u201cI\u2019m from the Midwest,\u201d she said. \u201cI come from a very conservative background, so it\u2019s not very diverse ... [and] the fact that I can love this guy so much, and it doesn\u2019t change anything for me, makes me realize that I\u2019ve grown huge as a person.\u201d\n\nTo be honest \u2014 and a little depressing \u2014 the speed and ferocity of these responses were almost as surprising to me as the outing itself. Everyone immediately seemed to recognize that Varner had screwed up; everyone immediately jumped to Zeke\u2019s defense.\n\nIn fact, when it was time to vote, Probst didn\u2019t even bother going through with the ceremony of it all. He just called up Varner to snuff out his torch, and that was that. For Varner, and for millions of viewers, the message was clear: Survivor might be a cutthroat game, but he had still managed to cross an unacceptable line.\n\nZeke, for his part, was as composed as his teammates were incensed. He explained that he\u2019d chosen not to divulge this part of his life because \u201cwhen people know that about you ... it sort of overwhelms everything else that they know about you.\u201d\n\nBut he steeled his jaw and continued, saying he knew there was always a risk that something like this might happen and that he\u2019s prepared to handle whatever comes next. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of crappy the way it\u2019s happened,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if \u2018metamorphosis\u2019 is the word of the episode ... I am a changed, stronger, better man today.\u201d\n\nNo one can argue with that statement. Zeke has impressed everyone from his teammates to viewers to Probst with his daring and generosity. That he managed to respond to such offhand cruelty with firm resolve and even grace speaks to the extraordinary strength of character his teammates leaped to defend. This one moment won\u2019t \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t \u2014 define him.\n\nSurvivor: Game Changers airs Wednesdays at 8 pm on CBS.", "images":
