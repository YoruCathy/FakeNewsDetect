The ladies gave \u201cDown\u201d its television debut when they performed during Good Morning America\u2018s summer concert series Friday, where they were joined by the rapper.\n\nUnfortunately Kordei took the song title a bit too literally, falling to the stage mid-Gucci rap. (See it at 2:15 in the video above.) \u201cLeave it to Normani to eat the stage,\u201d she joked after the performance. \u201cHella went down!
