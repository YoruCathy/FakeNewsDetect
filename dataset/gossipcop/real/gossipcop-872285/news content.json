Jennifer Lopez, Ne-Yo, and Derek Hough served as the judges, with Jenna Dewan serving as host. Hip hop dancers Les Twins, from Paris, France, were crowned as the winners of the $1,000,000 prize on August 8, 2017. Fourteen-year-old contemporary dancer Eva Igo and Latin/Swing group Swing Latino were named first runner-up and second runner-up respectively.\n\nDancers [ edit ]\n\nJunior (under 18) [ edit ]\n\nUpper (18 and over, up to 4 members) [ edit ]\n\nTeam (18 and over, 5\u201315 members) [ edit ]\n\n^1 Despite their Qualifier performance not being shown, this act's hometown and dance style were made available on the World of Dance website.\n\n^2 MiniRequest, Kings Unite & Rhythmatic were the only groups not to have a full performance featured during their time on the show.\n\nQualifiers [ edit ]\n\nIn each round of the Qualifiers, the dance acts will perform a 2-minute routine in front of the judges and a live audience. They will be scored by the judges in 5 categories: Performance, Technique, Choreography, Creativity & Presentation. Each category is worth 20 points with a perfect score of 100. For the dance act to progress forward, they must receive an average score of 80 or higher.\n\nColor key:\n\n&n| style=\"background:#DCDCDC; border:1px solid black;\"| Contestant was eliminated\n\nPart 1: May 30 [ edit ]\n\nPart 2: June 6 [ edit ]\n\nPart 3: June 13 [ edit ]\n\nThe Duels [ edit ]\n\nIn each round of The Duels, two acts in the same division compete for a spot in the next round. In each division, the acts with the top qualifying scores choose their opponents, then both acts perform back-to-back, receiving feedback from the judges. After each performance, the judges will score them in the 5 categories: Performance, Technique, Creativity, Choreography & Presentation. Unlike the Qualifiers, only the final average for each act is shown. The act with the highest average at the end of the duel moves on to the next round, the other faces immediate elimination.\n\nSong Not Shown -\n\nThe Cut [ edit ]\n\nIn The Cut, the 15 remaining acts compete for two spots in each of their divisions. As each dance act competes, their final score is displayed on a leaderboard for their division. Once a dance act's score falls out of the top 2, they face immediate elimination. For this round, each of the judges became mentors for one of the divisions; Jennifer worked with the Juniors, Derek worked with the Upper acts and Ne-Yo worked with the Teams. Guest judge Misty Copeland joined the panel for this segment.\n\nSong/Score Not Shown -\n\nDivisional Final [ edit ]\n\nIn the Divisional Final, the 2 remaining acts in each division square off, with only one act going to the World Final to represent their division. Continuing from the previous round, each of the 3 judges acted as mentors for the divisions; Jennifer worked with the Teams, Ne-Yo worked with the Upper acts and Derek worked with the Juniors. Keone and Mari were awarded the first and only 100 score of the entire season by Ne-Yo during the Divisional Final.\n\nOrder Division Dance Act Performance Song Judges' Score Ne-Yo Jennifer Derek AVERAGE 1 Team Kinjaz \"Work Song\" \u2013 Hozier 91 91 95 92.3 2 Swing Latino \"Gracias A La Vida\" \u2013 Mercedes Sosa 95 95 94 94.7 3 Upper Keone & Mari \"The Way You Look Tonight\" \u2013 Frank Sinatra 100 90 95 95 4 Les Twins \"Some Minds\" \u2013 Flume ft.

As with the previous 2 rounds, the judges became mentors for each of the finalists; Jennifer worked with Les Twins, Derek worked with Swing Latino and Ne-Yo worked with Eva. Each of the 3 finalists performed twice; The first performance's music was chosen by one of the judges and the second was chosen by the finalist. After each performance, the final scores were displayed on a leaderboard. The winner of the World Finals was determined by the judges combined average scores from both performances. After the final performances, Les Twins were announced as the winners of World of Dance; their final combined score of 93.8 just barely edged out Eva Igo by 0.1 points.\n\nFinal Scores [ edit ]\n\nLes Twins (93.8)\n\nEva Igo (93.7)\n\nSwing Latino (93.2)\n\nContestants who appeared on other shows [ edit ]\n\nHighest Scoring Dances [ edit ]\n\nName Division Round Judges' Scores Ne-Yo Jennifer Misty Derek AVERAGE Les Twins Upper Divisional Final 99 99 \u2013 95 97.7 Eva Igo Junior Divisional Final 96 97 \u2013 97 96.7 Eva Igo Junior World Final 95 96 \u2013 98 96.3 Les Twins Upper Qualifiers 95 96 \u2013 96 95.7 Keone & Mari Upper Divisional Final 100 90 \u2013 95 95 Swing Latino Team Divisional Final 95 95 \u2013 94 94.7 Swing Latino Team World Final 93 95 \u2013 96 94.7 Les Twins Upper World Final 94 97 \u2013 93 94.7 Kinjaz Team The Cut 93 90 96 95 93.5 Les Twins Upper The Cut 90 94 98 92 93.5 Keone & Mari Upper The Cut 94 92 94 93 93.3 Les Twins Upper World Final 92 92 \u2013 95 93\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nShow Episode title First air date Timeslot (EDT) Rating\n\n(18\u201349) Share\n\n(18\u201349) Viewers\n\n(millions) Nightly\n\nrank 1 The Qualifiers 1 May 30, 2017 Tuesday 10:00 p.m. 2.4 9 9.71[1] 2 2 The Qualifiers 2 June 6, 2017 1.9 7 8.42[2] 2 3 The Qualifiers 3 June 13, 2017 1.9 8 8.04[3] 2 4 The Duels 1 June 20, 2017 1.8 7 7.61[4] 2 5 The Duels 2 June 27, 2017 1.8 8 7.51[5] 2 6 The Duels 3 July 11, 2017 1.7 7 7.08[6] 2 7 The Cut 1 July 18, 2017 1.6 7 6.91[7] 2 8 The Cut 2 July 25, 2017 1.6 7 6.88[8] 2 9 Divisional Final August 1, 2017 1.7 7 7.00[9] 2 10 World Final August 8, 2017 1.9 8 8.00[10] 2", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Dance_(season_1)", "title": "World of Dance (season 1)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
