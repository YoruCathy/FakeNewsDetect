At this time, I want to focus on my beautiful family, my growing business and some exciting new projects.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tommy Garcia/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHONJ\u2018s Danielle Staub Has Forgiven Teresa Giudice for Calling Her a \u2018Prostitution Whore\u2019 8 Years Ago\n\nFlicker, 50, joined the Bravo show in season 7. Her exit comes on the heels of a tense season, in which she\u2019s feuded bitterly with Josephs, 50. The drama came to a head during a group trip to Milan where Flicker \u2014 the only Jewish New Jersey Housewife \u2014 accused Josephs of being anti-Semitic after she made a controversial comment about Adolf Hitler. (Flicker, whose father Dr. Mordecai Paldiel is Holocaust survivor, said Hitler\u2019s name was a \u201ctrigger word\u201d for her.)\n\nOn this week\u2019s episode, Josephs apologized to Flicker, and after some time, Flicker appeared to accept it.\n\n\u201cLast night you gave me a heartfelt apology that was sincere and I thank you for that,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed time to process that. I\u2019m still upset. I don\u2019t think anybody should ever reference Hitler. \u2026 I said it in the heat of the moment, but I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re anti-Semitic. I don\u2019t believe that Margaret is anti-Semitic, I believe that Margaret is anti-Siggy. \u2018Cause from the moment that I introduced you, it\u2019s like taking someone to a wedding and you deserted me at cocktail hour. That\u2019s what you did.\u201d\n\nThough the women were co-existing calmly by the end of the episode, it appears the fight didn\u2019t end there \u2014 the two have continued to feud on social media.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1520&h=796&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fsiggy-flicker1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fsiggy-flicker1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1520&h=796&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fsiggy-flicker1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/siggy-flicker-leaving-real-housewives-new-jersey/", "title": "Siggy Flicker Leaving Real Housewives of New Jersey After 2 Seasons", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Margaret Josephs,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Siggy Flicker,TV", "news_keywords": "Margaret Josephs,News,Real Housewives,Real Housewives of New Jersey,Siggy Flicker,TV", "description": "Siggy Flicker's exit comes on the heels of a tense season, in which she's feuded bitterly with Margaret Josephs", "og": {"title": "Siggy Flicker Leaving the\u00a0Real Housewives of New Jersey After 2 Seasons", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/siggy-flicker-leaving-real-housewives-new-jersey/", "description": "Siggy Flicker is saying goodbye to the&nbsp;Real Housewives of New Jersey.
