In response, Laura said all of the curious busybodies should point their fingers in the other direction because it wasn\u2019t her.\n\nAs for where the speculations originated, Govan claimed the allegations come from her ex, Gilbert Arenas. She wrote to E! News on Sunday morning that the accusations coming from Arenas are \u201ccompletely false\u201d and are devoid of any truth, whatsoever.\n\nLaura added she merely wants to keep her life out of the public\u2019s eye and has done so somewhat successfully in the year of 2017. She explained, \u201cI just pray that they leave me out of this.\u201d\n\nReporters from the organization, TMZ, asked her if she had gotten pregnant, and she stated: \u201cnot true at all.\u201d\n\nIt got even messier when her ex, Arenas, took to Instagram and called Laura a liar. He wrote, \u201cI was trying to enjoy the last of 2017\u201d, but his ex-girlfriend is attempting to smear him to clear her name.\n\nAs you may know, Braxton made her comments yesterday after she filed for divorce to end her nine-year marriage to Vince Herbert.\n\nFurthermore, Herbert found himself in serious trouble this past week when he ended up in jail. Police booked him due to alleged spousal assault.\n\nHowever, Herbert denied the charges and said there has never been a physical altercation between the pair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn insider close to Herbert claimed, \u201cVince would never hurt Tamar even though their relationship has been fraught with all kinds of problems. It\u2019s totally unlike him to strike anybody, especially women. It\u2019s highly unlikely anyway.\u201d", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-1-1-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tamar-Braxton39s-boyfriend-David-Adefesso-is-being-dragged-amid-break-up-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Mark-Wahlberg-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Vince-Herbert-and-Tamar-Braxton-Hello-Beautiful--e1514760579635.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/media-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Vince-Herbert-and-Tamar-Braxton-Hello-Beautiful--e1514760579635.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/tamars-ex-vincent-herbert-and-laura-govan-deny-the-baby-rumors-101142/", "title": "Tamar\u2019s Ex Vincent Herbert And Laura Govan Deny The Baby Rumors", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "Laura Govan, tamar braxton, vincent herbert,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Laura Govan, tamar braxton, vincent herbert,", "description": "After Tamar Braxton revealed that a woman allegedly told her Vince got another girl pregnant, fans were quick to point their fingers at Laura Govan -", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tamar\u2019s Ex Vincent Herbert And Laura Govan Deny The Baby Rumors", "description": "After Tamar Braxton revealed that a woman allegedly told her Vince got another girl pregnant, fans were quick to point their fingers at Laura Govan -", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/tamars-ex-vincent-herbert-and-laura-govan-deny-the-baby-rumors-101142/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Vince-Herbert-and-Tamar-Braxton-Hello-Beautiful--e1514760579635.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-31", "modified_time": "2017-12-31", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/toddmalm/", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "vincent herbert"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514649600.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
