From calling slavery \u201ca choice\u201d to openly supporting President Trump, West has sparked just as much outrage as there is intrigue surrounding his celebrity. Basically, it\u2019s been two weeks of wild behavior and lots of questions. And now there\u2019s even more of that to contemplate. So, what\u2019s happened now? Well, Kanye West got rid of his phone, so he\u2019s not answering anyone\u2019s text messages.\n\nThe news of West\u2019s phone abandonment comes from West himself via is Twitter account. West took to the social media platform to explain his lack of communication to friends, family, and business associates:\n\nFor anyone who\u2019s tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks I got rid of that phone so I could focus on these albums\n\nWest is currently in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, trying to focus all his energy on his upcoming album. So, basically, he has ditched mobile communication in favor of cultivating his inherent talent and musical genius. Can\u2019t blame him for drowning out the noise to focus on the music. He\u2019s clearly committed to his craft.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what West tweeted about getting rid of his cell phone:\n\nWest\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian, reportedly joined the 40-year-old rapper in Wyoming in early May 2018. At the time, a source close to the family told People that Kardashian was content to join him as he worked:\n\nKim happily joined Kanye in Jackson Hole. She wants to be supportive so he can finish his album. The album has caused Kanye a lot of stress. He is a perfectionist and wants the music to be amazing.\n\nWest\u2019s dedication to his music is truly admirable and it\u2019s great that Kardashian is there to support him in this effort. A lot of fantastic and interesting music is sure to come out of it.\n\nIn addition to supporting West\u2019s creative pursuits, Kardashian is also reportedly worried about his health, especially in light of his recent erratic and scandalous behavior. According to People\u2019s source, Kardashian headed out to Wyoming to make sure he\u2019s in a good place:\n\nKim is absolutely concerned about Kanye. She likes being in Jackson Hole so she can keep an eye on his health. She wants to make sure he eats and sleeps enough. She doesn\u2019t want him to push himself beyond his limits. She wants a healthy Kanye.\n\nHow sweet and supportive of her! It\u2019s so obvious how much West and Kardashian love and value each other. You have to give them credit for always having each other\u2019s backs, even in light health issues and media scandals.\n\nHopefully, none of that will overshadow West's music. On Tuesday, May 15, West previewed some of his new music on Twitter. The rapper posted a video of himself sitting at a keyboard while a beat plays in the background. Here\u2019s a look at what West is working on:\n\nIn the video, you can also see what seem to be sample tracklists on whiteboards above his head and to his right. These tracklists look to be part of multiple projects that he\u2019s working on at the moment. Among the tracks listed are \u201cExtacy\u201d, \u201cWouldn\u2019t Leave\u201d, \u201cReborn\u201d, and \u201c4th Dimension.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s pretty clear that West is hard at work and making all that studio magic happen. Dedicated fans of the rapper are waiting anxiously to see what types of tracks he\u2019s going to drop. If the preview on Twitter is a hint of what\u2019s to come, then his fans are definitely going to be happy!", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/11/4361046b-c022-4e61-931f-cfafa2baaa60-getty-1153778216.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15353773&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/15/ac797990-cf78-4ca5-b690-797c8db864e4-getty-486015758.jpg?w=1020&h=574&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/15/ac797990-cf78-4ca5-b690-797c8db864e4-getty-486015758.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/11/cf0dcb3d-21fa-43da-aa1e-dcac3adb7bb1-getty-1042108086.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/11/959d0fb8-50a7-4da1-aaa8-a61da167c25a-getty-1181284940.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=100478526961130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2018/5/15/ac797990-cf78-4ca5-b690-797c8db864e4-getty-486015758.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/kanye-west-got-rid-of-his-phone-so-thats-why-hes-not-returning-your-texts-9099306", "title": "Kanye West Got Rid Of His Phone, So That's Why He's Not Returning Your Texts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@elitedaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "url": "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/kanye-west-got-rid-of-his-phone-so-thats-why-hes-not-returning-your-texts-9099306", "type": "article", "title": "Kanye West Isn\u2019t Returning Text Messages & The Reason Why Is Surprisingly Clever", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that Kanye West is causing a swarm of media speculation about his strange behavior.
