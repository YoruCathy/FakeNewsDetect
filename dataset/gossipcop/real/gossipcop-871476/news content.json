{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_Kai", "text": "American web television series\n\nCobra Kai is an American action comedy-drama YouTube Premium series, presented in an episodic storytelling format, and based on The Karate Kid film series. It was created by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, and Josh Heald, and stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka (both of whom are reprising their roles from The Karate Kid, and who also serve as co-executive producers of the series) along with Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Courtney Henggeler, Tanner Buchanan and Mary Mouser. Cobra Kai is set 34 years after the original Karate Kid film, and re-examines the narrative from Johnny Lawrence's point of view (placing it within the \"minor-character elaboration\" genre).[1] His decision to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo leads to the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel LaRusso.\n\nThe first season was released on May 2, 2018 and the second season on April 24, 2019, both on YouTube Premium. On May 2, 2019, YouTube renewed the series for a third season,[2] which is scheduled for a 2020 release.[3] As of January 2020 , the series premiere has received over 80 million views on YouTube.\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nThirty-four years after his defeat in the 1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament, Johnny Lawrence, now in his 50s, works in construction and lives in an apartment in Reseda, Los Angeles, having fallen far from the wealthy lifestyle in Encino that had been enabled by his verbally abusive step-father, Sid Weinberg. He has a son, Robby Keene, with ex-girlfriend Shannon Keene, but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother Laura died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, Ali Mills.\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a gang of bullies using karate. Miguel, an asthmatic raised by his Ecuadorian single mother Carmen, asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo in a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with Daniel LaRusso. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to Amanda and has two children: Samantha and Anthony. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor Mr. Miyagi passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother Lucille, his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students Tommy, Bobby, Dutch, Jimmy and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by John Kreese. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, Tory who is Sam's rival.\n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nGuest [ edit ]\n\nPat Morita, Elisabeth Shue, and Thomas Ian Griffith appear via archive footage from the film series as Mr. Miyagi, Ali Mills, and Terry Silver, respectively.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally released 1 10 May 2, 2018 ( ) 2 10 April 24, 2019 ( )\n\nSeason 1 (2018) [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title Directed by Written by Original release date 1 1 \"Ace Degenerate\" Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg May 2, 2018 ( ) Thirty-four years after losing to Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 All Valley Under-18 Karate Championship, Johnny Lawrence struggles to make a living as a handyman while Daniel runs a successful car dealership chain in the San Fernando Valley.

First, the 2007 music video for the song \"Sweep the Leg\" by No More Kings stars William Zabka (who also directed the video) as a caricature of himself as Johnny, and features references to The Karate Kid, including cameo appearances by Zabka's former Karate Kid co-stars.[4][5] In a 2010 interview, Zabka jokingly discussed this video in the context of his vision that Johnny was the true hero of the film.[6] Then, in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made guest appearances as themselves in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother (\"The Bro Mitzvah\"). In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka.[7]\n\nCobra Kai was greenlit on August 4, 2017, with ten half-hour episodes, written and executive produced by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg.[8] The trio was joined by executive producers James Lassiter and Caleeb Pinkett of Overbrook Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures Television.[9] It was renewed for a second season on May 10, 2018[10] and for a third season on May 2, 2019.[3]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nWilliam Zabka and Ralph Macchio both revived their Karate Kid characters, Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso, for the series. Randee Heller also reprised her role as Daniel's mother.[11] In addition, Martin Kove joined the series as a regular cast member in the second season, reprising his role as John Kreese (after making a cameo appearance at the end of Season 1).[12] Other actors from The Karate Kid franchise have also commented on the series.
