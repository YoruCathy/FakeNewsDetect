At least 17 people died in the mudflows, and over 100 homes in Montecito were destroyed (some swept off foundations) in the neighborhood shared by Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. The two previously shared images from the catastrophe, and on Thursday, Ellen \u2014 who evacuated and has been unable to check on her house \u2014 FaceTimed with Oprah, who is still at her home, which (miraculously) only suffered minor damage while nearby houses were crushed.\n\nWinfrey also brought some firefighters, who received an enormous round of applause, on camera while telling Ellen that she\u2019s not fleeing Montecito because she wants to do whatever possible to help her community. She commented on how the sky looked red \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time that there were some gas fires, something exploded\u201d \u2014 and then the mudslides began. It took awhile for reality to set in for Winfrey the next morning:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking out the front window, I think everything\u2019s fine, everything\u2019s fine \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t until I put my boots on walking and I realized everything \u2026 wasn\u2019t fine at all. All of my neighbors\u2019 homes are gutted \u2026 The neighbors out back, their houses are gone.\u201d\n\nOprah continued, commenting upon how she shares a fence with Ellen and how several nearby homes are simply \u201cgutted.\u201d Fortunately for Winfrey, her house is located on a knoll, so she feels safe for now, even though her home won\u2019t have water or gas service until further notice.\n\nIn the below clip, Ellen uses her monologue to explain how much she loves Montecito. The host grows quite upset while revealing how she and wife Portia DeRossi had returned on December 27 from fire evacuations, only to be ordered to evacuate again on Sunday. \u201cThis room is always filled with positivity and love and today I really need it,\u201d she began. \u201cToday I need you because there\u2019s a lot going on in my life right now.\u201d\n\nOur community of Montecito has been through a lot. pic.twitter.com/Kp92OzqPEM \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 11, 2018\n\n(Via Ellen on YouTube)", "images": ["https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/market-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/YT_thumb_full4.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/themes/uproxx/assets/images/logo.svg?v=1.0.8", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/peoples-party-2.jpg?w=719&h=272&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1takejay-sessions.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/themes/uproxx/assets/images/section-icons/culture.png?v=1.0.8", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/kimberly-ricci.jpg?w=40", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/drink-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kenny-sailors.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fionna-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/porkys-grid-uproxx-1.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/trolls2-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michaelb-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pat-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcs-grid-uproxx-3.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/flight-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/resto-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chella-perf-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hike-grid-uproxx-1.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/resturant-grid-uproxx-1.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ellen-mudslide-0.jpg?w=650", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/wg-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/idontknowjeffery.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yt_thumb_full.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ellen-mudslide-0.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kimberly Ricci", "Film Tv Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://uproxx.com/culture/oprah-ellen-montecito-mudslides-facetime/", "title": "Oprah Facetimes With Ellen From California Mudslide Neighborhood", "meta_data": {"description": "Oprah brought some firefighters on screen to reveal grim happenings within the Montecito community.", "keywords": "culture, home page, tv, california, disasters, ellen degeneres, mudslides, oprah, oprah winfrey", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index,follow", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPROXX", "creator": "@UPROXX", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "Oprah Facetimes With An Emotional Ellen From Their Neighborhood That Was Devastated By California Mudslides"}, "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "qc": {"post": "oprah-ellen-montecito-mudslides-facetime", "author": "Kimberly Ricci", "section": "culture", "primary_tag": "california"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Oprah Facetimes With Ellen From California Mudslide Neighborhood", "url": "https://uproxx.com/culture/oprah-ellen-montecito-mudslides-facetime/", "description": "Oprah brought some firefighters on screen to reveal grim happenings within the Montecito community.", "site_name": "UPROXX", "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ellen-mudslide-0.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 360}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_GB"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-11T18:55:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-11T18:56:20+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "app_id": 117400151618132, "pages": 116548701336}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515696942.0, "source": "https://uproxx.com", "summary": ""}
