No return date for Season 2 of Talking With Chris Hardwick has been set yet due to scheduling issues, I hear. All episodes are already in the can.\n\nDeadline revealed July 4 that Community actor Brown would be taking over Hardwick\u2019s SDCC duties. A week later, AMC confirmed that Brown, who called Hardwick a \u201cfriend\u201d in a Independence Day tweet, would be fronting the Season 9 preview special for the zombie-apocalypse series and the series\u2019 much watched aftershow as an \u201cinterim host\u201d \u2014 only half of which she is doing now.\n\nReps for Hardwick did not respond to request for comment on the move by AMC.\n\nAfter accusations by Hardwick\u2019s ex Chloe Dykstra surfaced on June 15, AMC a day later pulled the Season 2 June 17 premiere of Talking with Chris Hardwick. At the time, the calber also said that The Wall host would not participate in Talking Dead for the immediate future, nor for the TWD or Doctor Who panels at SDCC he had already been set for.\n\nOn June 15, Hardwick strongly denied the allegations from Dykstra, which included sexual and emotional abuse.\n\n\u201cThese are very serious allegations and not to be taken lightly which is why I\u2019ve taken the day to consider how to respond,\u201d said Hardwick that night. \u201cI was heartbroken to read Chloe\u2019s post. Our three year relationship was not perfect\u2014we were ultimately not a good match and argued\u2014even shouted at each other\u2014but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.\u201d\n\nThe adamant response from the longtime AMC host and Nerdist founder followed the detailed and harrowing first-person account that Dykstra wrote for Medium. The post never called out Hardwick by name, but the post by TV personality and Syfy\u2019s Heroes of Cosplay castmember made it pretty clear whom she was talking about. With the duo having played out so much of their time together in the public and digital spotlight, there were details about the \u201cmildly successful podcaster\u201d who became \u201ca powerhouse CEO of his own company, their age difference and more. The details were indicative of the now married Hardwick, who announced online his break-up with Dykstra in 2014.\n\nDeclaring on June 16 that they were assessing the allegations, NBC has not announced whether Hardwick will be back for more of The Wall later this year.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg",
