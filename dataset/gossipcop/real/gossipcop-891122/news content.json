In the past, we\u2019ve recognized everyone from singer Lorde to Olympic champion Simone Biles to political activist Joshua Wong. Here\u2019s who made this year\u2019s cut (ordered from youngest to oldest):\n\nGetty Images (2) Millie Bobby Brown, 13 Not many actors can say they got an Emmy nomination, and worldwide fame, for convincing the world that they have superpowers. Brown can, thanks to her role on Netflix\u2019s sci-fi \u201980s-nostalgia-fest Stranger Things . She plays Eleven, a mysterious girl\u2014part science experiment, part prodigy, part awkward teen\u2014who uses telekinesis to ward off evil. But there\u2019s remarkable nuance in Brown\u2019s performance, the kind that is able to convey melancholy beneath magic. It has made Eleven the standout character on a show brimming with them, one who inspires Internet memes , Halloween costumes and newfound interest in Eggo waffles (Eleven\u2019s favorite food). Brown\u2019s own profile has risen as well. Since the show\u2019s July 2016 debut, the British actor has rapped at the Golden Globes, signed with IMG Models and appeared on the covers of Entertainment Weekly , InStyle and more. One secret to Brown\u2019s success? Not overthinking her craft. \u201cEleven is part of me and always will be. I don\u2019t try with her,\u201d she told TIME during a Stranger Things set visit earlier this year. \u201cI don\u2019t even know my lines for today\u2019s scene ... and that\u2019s what makes it so instinctual.\u201d \u2014Daniel D\u2019Addario\n\nUlmer: Courtesy D'Andra Ulmer; Getty Images Mikaila Ulmer, 13 Like most kids her age, Ulmer used to hate bees. \u201cI absolutely despised anything that buzzed,\u201d she says. But shortly after she was stung, twice, in 2009, the Texas native developed a fascination with them. That\u2019s when she learned that honeybees are critical to the ecosystem, and also going extinct . So Ulmer decided to help\u2014with lemonade. Using her great grandmother\u2019s recipe, Ulmer made a blend, sweetened with local honey, to sell at community business fairs, donating 10% of her profits to honeybee advocate groups. By 2014, her side project was a full-blown business . Now Me & the Bees Lemonade is stocked at more than 300 Whole Foods Markets, Wegmans and other grocers across the U.S. and Ulmer runs a nonprofit, the Healthy Hive Foundation, to raise awareness about the plight of the honeybee. Next up: finishing her first children\u2019s book (it aims to teach kids how to start their own businesses) and expanding her company. To that end, Ulmer says, \u201cI just hired my dad.\u201d \u2014Melissa Chan\n\nGuzman: Courtesy of Shamah S. Bulangis; Getty Images Shibby de Guzman, 14 It\u2019s a risky move to speak out against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal war on drugs has left thousands dead. He told E.U. politicians to \u201cgo to hell\u201d for raising human-rights concerns and branded Oxford University a \u201cschool for stupid people\u201d after it published a study claiming he employs an army of online trolls to suppress dissent. His fiercest critic, Senator Leila de Lima , has been in jail for more than eight months. None of this has deterred de Guzman, who shot to prominence after she was photographed protesting the lionization of late Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. She carried a megaphone and wore a cardboard sign similar to those sometimes strewn over the bodies of drug-war victims. Then, in a widely shared social-media post, she shut down critics who alleged that her fellow protesters were \u201cbrainwashed\u201d: \u201cWe completely know and understand the injustice we are protesting against.\u201d Now in the ninth grade, de Guzman hopes to rally even more young people to take action in the Philippines. \u201cIt\u2019s so important that [they] know their own rights and when authorities abuse them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are values that aren\u2019t up for debate.\u201d \u2014Joseph Hincks\n\nGetty Images (2) Moziah Bridges, 15 At age 9, Bridges launched his own handmade bow-tie business from his grandmother\u2019s kitchen table. Now Mo\u2019s Bows is worth about $1.5 million\u2014thanks in part to his 2015 appearance on ABC\u2019s Shark Tank and, more recently, a licensing deal with the NBA that lets Bridges sell bow ties featuring team logos. But the Memphis native has even grander ambitions: he plans to expand globally, breaking into new clothing markets (he just released a line of neckties), while working toward graduating from high school and getting his driver\u2019s license. \u201cMy all-time goal is to be a fashion mogul and a good person overall,\u201d says Bridges, who credits his success to his inborn sense of style (he says he would \u201cgo to the playground in a suit and tie\u201d). At home, though, his mom is still the boss: Bridges wants a Range Rover for his upcoming birthday, but she has made it clear that he\u2019s \u201cgoing to get the 2007 Jetta in the garage.\u201d \u2014Melissa Chan\n\nColon: Courtesy Michelle Colon; Getty Images Salvador G\u00f3mez Col\u00f3n, 15 Everything went dark when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico\u2014including Col\u00f3n\u2019s San Juan neighborhood of Condado, one of many that could remain without power for at least a year. Initially, Col\u00f3n says he felt scared and overwhelmed, especially when his family started to ration food. \u201cThen I asked myself, How could I give people hope?\u201d he says. The answer: Light and Hope for Puerto Rico, a Generosity campaign he started to raise money for solar lamps, hand-operated washing machines and other supplies for his neighbors in need. In four days, he raised $36,000; the total now stands at $75,000 and counting. Col\u00f3n estimates that the money will be able to help at least 1,000 people. But he knows it\u2019s only a start\u2014and that the world should remember Puerto Rico still needs aid. \u201cOne day should not go by that we don\u2019t remind ourselves of how we can make other people\u2019s lives better,\u201d he says. \u2014Ashley Hoffman\n\nGetty Images (2) Maddie Ziegler, 15 Ziegler, who recently made her big screen debut in 2017\u2019s The Book of Henry , has come a long way from starring in Dance Moms , the reality TV series that kickstarted her career. \"[Acting] has become one of my biggest passions,\" she tells TIME. \"It lets me express so many different emotions. When you're acting, you're always playing someone else and you're always getting to experience someone new.\" But that doesn't mean she's hanging up her dancing shoes. Ziegler continues to perform as Sia's spirited alter-ego on tour with the pop star. In March, she gave her many fans \u2014 the dance phenom has over 10 million followers on Instagram alone \u2014 an inside look at her rise to fame by releasing a memoir, The Maddie Diaries . Not to mention that she also has a trilogy of Young Adult novels about competitive dance in the works, the first of which is available now. \u2013Megan McCluskey\n\nAlhumedhi: Courtesy Rayouf Alhumedhi; Getty Images Rayouf Alhumedhi, 16 This fall, millions of women around the world will finally have an emoji they can identify with, thanks to this Vienna high school student who proposed Apple\u2019s new emoji with a headscarf. While messaging friends last year, Alhumedhi, who is Muslim and wears a headscarf, was baffled when she searched her phone for an emoji that looked like her but couldn\u2019t find one. \u201cIt\u2019s something important to my identity,\u201d she says. So Alhumedhi, who hails from Saudi Arabia, appealed to Apple and then the Unicode Consortium, which controls emoji standards. Her campaign quickly gained steam, earning the support of Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, and eventually Apple announced the emoji was on its way . Alhumedhi says it\u2019s a step forward in celebrating diversity and accepting the Muslim faith. \u201cI think this emoji will influence the world indirectly,\u201d she says, \u201conce people who are against women wearing the headscarf, or against Islam in general, view such an emoji on their keyboard.\u201d \u2014Melissa Chan\n\nGetty Images (2) Auli\u2019i Cravalho, 16 Even if you don\u2019t immediately recognize Cravalho\u2019s face, chances are you\u2019ve heard her sing: the Hawaii native voiced the titular hero in Disney\u2019s Moana , which grossed more than $640 million at the global box office. Now Cravalho is taking on a new role. In January, she\u2019ll star on NBC\u2019s Rise , a drama about a high school theater department that lifts the spirits of a struggling steel town in Pennsylvania. Cravalho says the premise, which is based on a true story, reinforced her belief that young people can effect real change\u2014though it helps, she adds, to \u201cfind a troupe who will support you and be your megaphone\u201d and to never let \u201cbeing a teen make you feel like you make less of an impact.\u201d Cravalho would know. On Rise she plays a character who, like her, is of Polynesian and Puerto Rican descent\u2014a heritage that isn\u2019t often portrayed onscreen. And while Cravalho is grateful that she gets to \u201cshare my culture with the world,\u201d she\u2019s also determined to help shift the status quo. \u201cAccurate representation matters,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be involved in projects that reflect the modern melting pot that is America.\u201d \u2014Eliana Dockterman\n\nGetty Images (2) Kaia Gerber, 16 The daughter of legendary supermodel Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber has clearly inherited her mother\u2019s fashion savvy. Since gracing the cover of Vogue Paris with her mom at 14, Gerber has made a name for herself as a high fashion model and snagged campaigns for major brands like Versace and Alexander Wang. And in 2017 Gerber became one of the most in-demand runway models at New York Fashion Week, walking in more than a dozen high-profile shows during her first year on the catwalk. More recently, Vogue gave her the reins to its Instagram account, so she could document her experience during New York Fashion Week. Her mom, of course, could not be prouder . \u2014Ashley Hoffman\n\nCourtesy of Lee Bada/SF Models; Getty Images Han Hyun Min, 16 Growing up in a largely homogeneous society, Han, who is half Nigerian, half Korean, was often made to feel ashamed of his appearance. \u201cThere are so many prejudices about darker skinned people in South Korea,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cWhen I was in kindergarten, some of the mothers in the playground would tell my friends, \u2018Don\u2019t play with him. If you play with him, you will become darker too.\u2019\u201d But Han, who was discovered on Instagram, is now one of the country\u2019s most sought-after fashion models ; he\u2019s a fixture in local magazines and walked in 20 shows during the recent Seoul Fashion Week. Although he has faced discrimination\u2014he was denied several early castings because of his skin color\u2014Han says he hopes his rising profile will help make South Korea\u2019s beauty standards more inclusive. \u201cMy dream is now a reality,\u201d he tells TIME, \u201cand I want those like me to feel they can achieve the same.\u201d \u2014Suyin Haynes\n\nGetty Images (2) Wang Yuan, 16 With lyrics like \u201cpolish your leather shoes, put on a suit \u2026 arrive at every place with head held high,\u201d Wang is not exactly the tattooed bad boy of Chinese pop. But that hasn\u2019t stopped his singing trio, TFBoys , from ruling the charts. Since its founding four years ago, TFBoys has amassed more than 20 million fans on the Twitter-like microblog Weibo and reportedly sells some $17 million worth of branded merchandise every month. And Wang, who goes by the English name Roy and hails from central China, is poised for even greater success: As a solo act, he has also appeared in a bevy of movie and television roles, and was appointed a UNICEF Special Advocate for Education . \u2014Charlie Campbell\n\nGetty Images (2) Noah Cyrus, 17 As the sister of Miley and daughter of Billy Ray, Cyrus is no stranger to show business. But her music \u2014 a collection of moody, emo-pop singles, with more to come on her debut album NC-17 \u2014 steers clear of her famous family\u2019s country roots, trading instead on teen angst. It seems to be working: her first single, \u201cMake Me (Cry),\u201d jumped to the top of Spotify\u2019s global viral charts, and she opened for Katy Perry during the megastar\u2019s recent New York shows. \u201cI feel like I communicate so much better through a song than I do through talking,\u201d Cyrus tells TIME, adding that she wants her music to be relatable. \u201cI\u2019m there with you if you\u2019re going through heartbreak, because I\u2019ve definitely had my share of heartbreak. People don\u2019t think we [celebrities] have normal people problems, but we do. We go through it just like you.\u201d \u2014Raisa Bruner\n\nGetty Images (2) Ethan and Grayson Dolan, 17 Ethan Dolan didn\u2019t want to get his tongue pierced, but he had to. Those were the rules. He and his twin Grayson had just attempted a series of tongue challenges\u2014like tying cherry stems into knots\u2014and agreed, on camera, that the loser would get the piercing. Of course, the brothers could have called it off. But they would have to answer to their legions of social-media followers (27 million across Instagram , Twitter, YouTube and Facebook). So in late September, the Dolans flew from L.A. to their home state of New Jersey, where piercing laws are less strict, to document Ethan\u2019s experience in all its graphic glory; the resulting YouTube clip has 2 million views and counting. It\u2019s these kinds of outlandish stunts\u2014coupled with their boyish charm and good looks\u2014that have catapulted the Dolans into social-media stardom. As they put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t like to limit ourselves to a certain category, such as \u2018content creators\u2019 or \u2018influencers,\u2019 because we like to do it all.\u201d Increasingly, the Dolans are popping up offline as well. Earlier this year, they embarked on a nationwide variety-show tour, which sold out in several cities; now they\u2019re regular correspondents on MTV\u2019s relaunched TRL . But these gigs, they insist, are not jobs: \u201cWe enjoy what we do too much to consider it work.\u201d \u2014Raisa Bruner\n\nGetty Images (2) Chloe Kim, 17 When Kim\u2019s father first took her snowboarding near the family\u2019s home in Orange County, California, when she was 4, Kim didn\u2019t fall hard for the sport. \u201cI wanted to go play My Little Ponies,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was stuck on a mountain.\u201d That was then. Now Kim, who last year became the first woman to ever land back-to-back 1080s (three full revolutions in the air) in competition, is widely seen as a favorite to win gold at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Although Kim is American and a member of Team USA, she\u2019ll also in effect be competing on home turf: both her parents were born in South Korea, and several of her South Korean relatives plan to cheer her on. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a good experience to go through such a crazy event with my family,\u201d says Kim. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m very worried, \u2019cause it\u2019s the freaking Olympics. I want to do really good. I\u2019ve got to nail it.\u201d \u2014Sean Gregory\n\nNithiyanandam: Courtesy Krtin Nithiyanandam; Getty Images Krtin Nithiyanandam, 17 He may not have graduated high school yet, but Nithiyanandam\u2014whose interest in science was sparked after getting ear surgery as a kid\u2014already has a resume that rivals many professional researchers. In 2015, when he was only 15, the U.K. native developed an antibody that can help detect early signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, a project that earned him a $25,000 award at the Google Science Fair. Then, this September, he won another award for creating a bioplastic that can clear wastewater of toxins. Meanwhile, Nithiyanandam is working on a method to make triple negative breast cancer\u2014a type of breast cancer that doesn\u2019t respond well to usual therapy\u2014more treatable. His advice to his peers? \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of being rejected,\u201d he says, noting that he reached out to 52 different academic institutions about his Alzheimer\u2019s research before finding someone to support his study. \u2014Alexandra Sifferlin\n\nGetty Images (2) Yara Shahidi, 17 Most network TV stars tend to avoid talking politics, so as to appeal to the widest possible demographic. But as the child of an Iranian father and an African-American mother, Shahidi, who plays Zoe on popular ABC sitcom Black-ish , has felt compelled to speak out. When President Trump first tried to enact his travel ban against several Muslim majority countries, for example, she took him to task for xenophobia . \u201cImmigrants don\u2019t threaten safety \u2014 stereotypical narratives that promote hate do,\u201d Shahidi wrote on Instagram , noting that she herself is the product of \u201cBlack and Iranian love.\u201d If Shahidi is no ordinary sitcom star, it\u2019s because Black-ish is no ordinary sitcom. The show examines issues of race and class through the lens of a black, upper-middle-class family; in January, Shahidi will star in her own spinoff, Grown-ish , about college students wrangling with those same issues in the age of Trump. \u201cMy family taught me to use my voice, my work, to help better society,\u201d she tells TIME. Next year, after Grown-ish wraps, Shahidi is heading to Harvard to double major in sociology and African-American studies \u2014 thanks in part to a recommendation letter from Michelle Obama. \u2014Eliana Dockterman\n\nGetty Images (2) Willow Smith, 17 The daughter of actors Will and Jada Pinkett, who first rose to prominence with her 2010 breakout single \u201cWhip My Hair,\u201d has since emerged as one of her generation\u2019s most intriguing artists. Her latest single, \u201cRomance,\u201d imagines a world where \u201cmorality doesn\u2019t exist\u201d and \u201cman and women stay equal in the eyes of society.\u201d She also serves as a Chanel ambassador and frequently shares her musings about art and science with her 2.4 million Instagram followers. \u2014Cady Lang\n\nGetty Images (2) Brooklyn Beckham, 18 As the son of footballer David and pop star-turned-fashion maverick Victoria, Beckham was never going to live an ordinary life. Case in point: although he just started his first year as a photography major at Parsons in New York City, Beckham has already published a book of his own photos ( What I See ), shot a campaign for Burberry Brit , worked with esteemed fashion photographer Nick Knight, and touts some 10 million Instagram followers . \u201cI\u2019m just so lucky to have been given the opportunities that I have,\u201d Beckham tells TIME. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the next few years and learning as much as I can and experiencing life as a student.\u201d \u2014Cady Lang\n\nMcLaughlin: Sports Illustrated; Getty Images Sydney McLaughlin, 18 At track meets, on social media, at the New Jersey dress shop where she worked this summer, people often tell McLaughlin that she\u2019s inspired them to run. It\u2019s no wonder: as the first repeat winner of the Gatorade National High School Athlete of the Year Award, the youngest U.S. track and field Olympian since 1972 (she reached the semifinals of the 400-m hurdles in Rio), and holder of the junior world record in the 400-m hurdles, McLaughlin is the future of U.S. track and field. But first, she\u2019s headed to college. Rather than turn pro right after high school and cash in on sponsorships and prize money, McLaughlin will race for the University of Kentucky , where she\u2019s a freshman relishing her newfound freedoms. \u201cI can always take a nap when I have free time,\u201d she tells TIME, \u201cinstead of my parents telling me to do laundry.\u201d \u2014Sean Gregory\n\nRanran: Courtesy Hu Ranran; Getty Images Hu Ranran, 18 While depictions of LGBTQ lifestyles are relatively routine in Western media, China has taken several steps backward, rolling out new regulations in July that put homosexuality alongside incest as cases of \u201cabnormal sexual relationships\u201d unfit for broadcast. So it was especially daring for Hu to direct Escape\u2014a 75-minute film about a transgender youth coming to terms with his sexual identity\u2014and release it in her home country. \u201cI wanted to address the theme of being yourself,\u201d she tells TIME. To help realize her vision, which had basically no production budget, Hu tapped 37 students from her high school, which is affiliated with Beijing\u2019s prestigious Renmin University. They made the sets and costumes themselves and shot the film mostly on school grounds. Subsequent critical acclaim helped Hu gain a place at the University of California, Los Angeles, and reignited conversation about trans issues across the world\u2019s most populous nation. \u201cGetting to know [the stories of] LGBTQ people is the start to reducing prejudice,\u201d Hu says. \u2014Charlie Campbell\n\nGetty Images (2) Isaac Hempstead Wright, 18 The U.K. native has spent eight years playing Bran Stark, a character whose every move is scrutinized by Game of Thrones\u2019 massive fan base \u2014especially during the most recent season. And as one of the show\u2019s few remaining players, he can drive countless headlines by simply commenting on a plot or debunking a fan theory . But Wright, who just started his first year at the University of Birmingham, isn\u2019t fazed by the attention: \"You can go pretty much anywhere in the world and be able to drum up a conversation with someone and have something in common with someone,\" he tells TIME. \u201cIt means that pretty much everywhere you go, you\u2019re met with the warmest of welcomes.\u201d \u2014Megan McCluskey\n\nMuzoon: Courtesy UNICEF; Getty Images Muzoon Almellehan, 19 For the millions of children living in refugee camps, the outlook is bleak: only half are enrolled in primary school and less than a quarter in secondary school, which severely limits their upward mobility. \u201cThey don\u2019t have many options,\u201d says Almellehan, who experienced these conditions firsthand after she fled Syria for Jordan in 2013. (Her family has since resettled in Newcastle, England.) Now she\u2019s fighting to change that. In June, Almellehan became UNICEF\u2019s youngest ever goodwill ambassador . As part of her duties, she travels the world to evangelize the importance of education, especially in places like Chad, where the militant group Boko Haram has forced children out of school. Ultimately, though, Almellehan plans to return to Syria. \u201cOur country needs a strong generation,\u201d she says. \u2014Alexandra Sifferlin\n\nGetty Images (2) Elle Fanning, 19 Fanning began her career before the age of 3, playing the younger version of her sister Dakota\u2019s character in I Am Sam . Since then, she has carved out her own niche with roles in movies like The Neon Demon , The Beguiled and the Oscar-nominated 20th Century Women . She has also become a standout in the fashion world, appearing on her first Vogue cover and fronting her second Miu Miu campaign. Looking ahead, Fanning harbors big dreams of directing her own movie. \"From nothing to something,\" she tells TIME of creating a story. \"That's very enticing to me.\" \u2014Megan McCluskey\n\nGetty Images (2) Khalid, 19 The Texas musician, whose debut album was fittingly titled American Teen , is one of R&B\u2019s hottest new acts. His music, including the hit single \u201cYoung Dumb & Broke,\u201d has been streamed over a billion times worldwide, earning Khalid a win at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best New Artist and an opening-act spot on Lorde\u2019s tour. He\u2019s also committed, both in song and in life, to championing the vulnerable. \u201cAmerica today feels like a scary place for many people, people of color, DREAMERS, women, the LGBTQ community,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cIt\u2019s the young people of America, the teens, who have the power to create change.\u201d For now, though, he\u2019s focused on navigating his newfound fame. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year of firsts and surprises,\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed though. I\u2019m still the same Khalid, I just buy more clothes!\u201d \u2014Raisa Bruner\n\nGetty Images (2) Steve Lacy, 19 When Lacy first set out to make music, he couldn\u2019t even afford a laptop, let alone professional recording equipment. So instead, he turned his iPhone into a portable studio\u2014using apps to make original drum patterns and guitar riffs, then layering on vocals he\u2019d recorded using the mike. \u201cYou have to find a way with what you have,\u201d he says. His way paid off: Lacy co-produced his band, the Internet\u2019s 2015 release Ego Death , which went on to nab a Grammy nomination for Best Urban Contemporary Album . Now, in addition to creating his own music, the Compton, Calif., native is producing tracks for artists like Big Sean and Kendrick Lamar. (He says the latter collaboration was like \u201cmy eighth-grade playlist coming full circle.\u201d) As his profile increases, Lacy has started to embrace more traditional producing platforms. He remains committed to his iPhone, though. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to do things differently,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I\u2019m for the weirdos.\u201d \u2014Ashley Hoffman\n\nGetty Images (2) Shawn Mendes, 19 Mendes, like Justin Bieber before him, may have risen to fame on a social-media platform (in his case, the defunct video app Vine ). But he has since become one of pop music\u2019s biggest stars. In the past three years, Mendes has released two blockbuster albums and several hit singles, including \u201cStitches,\u201d \u201cMercy\u201d and \u201cTreat You Better\u201d; his latest, \u201cThere\u2019s Nothing Holdin\u2019 Me Back,\u201d has logged more than 700 million streams. And the Canadian singer has no plans to slow down. \u201cI\u2019m just honing and getting better at my craft,\u201d he says of writing songs for his as-yet-unannounced third LP. \u201cSo I hope what comes out will be the best album yet by a landslide.\u201d In the meantime, he remains focused on entertaining his many young fans\u2014 Mendes has 26 million followers on Instagram alone\u2014and encouraging them to pursue their passions. \u201cI always want people to feel like they can do anything,\u201d he says, \u201cand I hope that I can inspire them.\u201d \u2014Raisa Bruner\n\nGetty Images (2) Christian Pulisic, 19 The soccer prodigy, already one of the sport\u2019s most promising young players (alongside Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Gianluigi Donnarumma, among others), is poised to become America\u2019s first top-flight international star. Pulisic, who plays for both the U.S. national team and in Germany\u2019s top pro league, has broken multiple goal-scoring records, and was a rare bright spot in the recent U.S. attempt to qualify for the World Cup . The Pennsylvania native credits his success to his parents, who largely eschewed the travel soccer scene while he was growing up in Hershey. \u201cA lot of kids, their parents force them to play on some team where they have to travel super far everyday,\u201d he tells TIME. \u201cI think that makes it worse because they don\u2019t realize their kid isn\u2019t enjoying it at all. Let kids be kids.\u201d When asked about America\u2019s World Cup defeat, or to recommend any systemic changes to improve U.S. soccer\u2019s fate, Pulisic declined comment. But his rising profile may well offer U.S. soccer fans something more valuable: hope. \u2014Sean Gregory\n\nGetty Images (2) Bretman Rock, 19 There is nobody on the Internet more fabulous than Rock. Just ask him.
