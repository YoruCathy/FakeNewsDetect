Speaking to Variety, Lonergan said the actor has been \u201ctreated abominably\u201d in the #MeToo era.

Per tradition, Affleck would\u2019ve presented the 2018 best actress trophy, but he bowed out as the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up campaigns took center stage during awards season.\n\nAffleck notified the Academy on January 25 that he would not be attending this year\u2019s ceremony because he did not want his involvement in the telecast to distract from the performances of the five nominated actresses. Affleck realized he was in a \u201cno-win situation\u201d and voluntarily stepped down from his expected role in the broadcast.\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nMonths earlier in October 2017, just weeks after the Harvey Weinstein allegations reignited the industry\u2019s attention towards sexual abuse and harassment, an online petition circulated asking the Academy to ban Affleck from the telecast. The petition earned over 19,000 signatures.\n\nLonergan\u2019s \u201cHoward\u2019s End\u201d remake premieres April 8 on Starz, and his play \u201cLobby Hero\u201d is currently on Broadway with star Chris Evans. Affleck has kept a relatively low profile as of late, though he starred in David Lowery\u2019s \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d last summer. Affleck\u2019s upcoming credits include Lowery\u2019s \u201cThe Old Man and the Gun\u201d and \u201cLight of My Life,\u201d which he also wrote and directed.\n\nIndieWire has reached out to Lonergan\u2019s representatives for further comment.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
