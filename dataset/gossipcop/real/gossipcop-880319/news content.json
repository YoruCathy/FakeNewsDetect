Whether she\u2019s dressing up for Steven Mnuchin\u2019s wedding or dressing down and being mindful of the severity of damage inflicted by Hurricane Harvey and Irma, people are usually extremely critical of what she\u2019s wearing and, in many cases, how much it costs.\n\nThe constant criticism surrounding her personal style hasn\u2019t deterred Melania Trump from expressing herself how she sees fit, however. Tonight Melania Trump was quite the dazzling figure as she hosted the annual White House Historical Association dinner alongside Donald Trump, according to the NY Daily News.\n\nIn the photos, which you can see below, Melania Trump shines brightly in a sparkly floor-length gown, which the fashion finders at the White House Fash Twitter account have identified as a piece from Monique Lhuillier\u2019s line.\n\n#FLOTUS is wearing a Pre-Fall 2017 @M_Lhuillier gown for the black tie dinner tonight, available at $7995:https://t.co/khhPZCgu6C pic.twitter.com/SGoLxceaoP \u2014 White House Fashion (@WhiteHouse_Fash) September 15, 2017\n\nPer the website where it can be purchased, the shiny number comes with a jewel neckline and capelet back. It\u2019s also short-sleeved and comes in an A-line silhouette. A black \u201ccontrast velvet tie\u201d sits at the waist, acting as a belt. If you\u2019re looking to purchase the dress for yourself, the designer\u2019s website has it listed at a whopping $7,995 dollars.\n\n[Image By Alex Wong /Getty Images]\n\nIt should be noted that Melania Trump\u2019s version of the dress seems to have been altered based on her personal preferences. For starters, the lining of Melania Trump\u2019s dress seems to have a sweetheart neckline, while a sheer, sequined overlay covers her exposed shoulders and decolletage. The dress on the website doesn\u2019t seem to expose the bust of the gown. The sleeves appear to be shorter as well.\n\nMelania Trump didn\u2019t veer too far away from her usual hair and makeup looks. It seems that the former model prefers to keep her coif simple, even as her outfits remain anything but.\n\nWhat do you think of Melania Trump\u2019s sparkly Monique Lhuillier gown? Do you think that it flattered her? What do you think of the price? Too pricey? Or does it not matter?
