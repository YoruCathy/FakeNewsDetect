The actress, who played Harley Quinn in the film \u2018Suicide Squad,\u2019 just shared what her one regret is for taking on the role of the supervillain character.\n\nIn her recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Robbie opened up about having stalkers and receiving death threats after starring in the film. Her popularity comes with a price, and it definitely isn\u2019t cheap.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just all this stuff you learn along the way, like, when you get those death threats, it\u2019s [smart] to have a security team do a background check on whoever sent them to see if there is any past history of violence because you\u2019ll need to know whether you need security to go to certain events,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAnd every time you do a background check, it\u2019s going to cost $2,000, so take that into consideration when you\u2019re getting yourself into this.\u201d\n\nHaving said that, Robbie actually regrets not having someone who explained these kinds of things to her before she joined the DC universe.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have resented the position I found myself in because I would\u2019ve known what I was getting myself into,\u201d the actress shared.\n\nDespite her one regret, Margot Robbie is still on to polishing her celebrity status, as she recently took on the role of an abused and a disgraced figure skater in the movie \u2018I, Tonya.\u2019\n\nWhat do you think of Margot Robbie\u2019s latest confession?
