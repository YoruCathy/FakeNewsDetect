Just thought it was time I would share this beautiful news with all of you.\"\n\nLauren Paul also got in on the Instagram fun, sharing her own post that featured an ultrasound of their little one.\n\nThe couple wed in 2013.\n\nPaul currently stars in Hulu series The Path, in which he plays a cult member struggling with faith.\n\n\"If you have any sort of doubt, you\u2019re a nonbeliever, and are considered weak and thrown out to the curb by the ones you love,\" Paul told USA TODAY last year.\n\nAfter Breaking Bad ended, Paul also acted in movies like Triple 9 and Eye in the Sky. As for his current role? He almost turned it down.\n\n\"I wasn't interested in jumping into another show just yet. I was a little spoiled on the last one I was a part of,\" Paul said.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/443575eaaf0a0455c0b9c977a1cf2ff3d060e9f5/c=0-82-2391-1433/local/-/media/2017/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636414980584638201-485846451.jpg?width=2391&height=1351&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2016/03/29906170001_4819555435001_4819537098001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/443575eaaf0a0455c0b9c977a1cf2ff3d060e9f5/c=0-82-2391-1433/local/-/media/2017/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636414980584638201-485846451.jpg?width=2391&height=1351&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/09/20/aaron-paul-and-wife-lauren-paul-expecting-first-child/684421001/", "title": "Aaron Paul and wife Lauren Paul are expecting their first child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Aaron Paul and wife Lauren Paul are expecting their first child", "description": "The 'Breaking Bad' actor shared the happy news on Instagram Tuesday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/09/20/aaron-paul-and-wife-lauren-paul-expecting-first-child/684421001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/443575eaaf0a0455c0b9c977a1cf2ff3d060e9f5/c=0-82-2391-1433/local/-/media/2017/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636414980584638201-485846451.jpg?width=2391&height=1351&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2391, "height": 1351}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Brooke Metz", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The 'Breaking Bad' actor shared the happy news on Instagram Tuesday.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/443575eaaf0a0455c0b9c977a1cf2ff3d060e9f5/c=0-82-2391-1433/local/-/media/2017/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636414980584638201-485846451.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Aaron Paul and wife Lauren Paul are expecting their first child", "description": "The 'Breaking Bad' actor shared the happy news on Instagram Tuesday."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505836800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
