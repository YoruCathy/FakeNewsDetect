Celebrities requested donations, told heartwarming survival stories involving people caught in the storm and sang songs. Several organizations will benefit, including the United Way and Save the Children.\n\nActress Sofia Vergara and actor-filmmaker Tyler Perry are seen at the benefit.

And you don't have to be a celebrity to do it.\"\n\nFor many of the stars, the storms hit close to home.\n\nPeople want to give...people want to help. And you don't have to be a celebrity to do it. - Scooter Braun\n\n\"I have family in Puerto Rico, I have family in Miami. I've been on the road. I haven't been able to be there. So you can imagine how it's been,\" Fonsi said after the show, adding that all his family, including his wife and young children in Miami, survived the storm and are safe.\n\n\"Helpless \u2014 helpless is an understatement,\" Fonsi said of being on tour and unable to be with his family. He noted that his experience paled in comparison to the pain the storms have caused for many.\n\n\"You can imagine how frustrating it is to not be able to sort of protect your own family,\" he said.\n\n\"Imagine all of these people that have nothing to do. The videos that you see online. So as an artist, as a singer, I think it's part of our job, it's part of our resume, to take time off and come together and do these kind of things.\"\n\n'You can imagine how frustrating it is to not be able to sort of protect your own family,' said Luis Fonsi, seen performing Hallelujah with Tori Kelly during the benefit.
