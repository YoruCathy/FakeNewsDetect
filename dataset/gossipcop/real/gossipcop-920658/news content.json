It\u2019s why, she says, rumors abound. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I\u2019m not like all my other sisters, who are like, \u2018Here\u2019s me and my boyfriend!\u2019\u201d she tells Jonathan Van Meter. But that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t control her own narrative\u2014if anything, Jenner pulls the ultimate millennial power move by telling her story when and how she wants. In her latest Vogue profile, she addresses her love life, her sexuality, that Pepsi ad, and whether there is another Kardashian addition in the future head-on.\n\nFor one thing, is she gay? \u201cSo it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy,\u201d she tells Vogue. \u201cI would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time. You don\u2019t want to, like, look crazy.\u201d But she essentially confirms that she is in fact dating Detroit Pistons basketball player Blake Griffin, coyly phoning from Michigan on Valentine\u2019s Day. \u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d she finally admits. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice. I have someone being very nice to me.\u201d But if she weren\u2019t dating Griffin, and if she weren\u2019t, in fact, heterosexual, Jenner says that she isn\u2019t the type to hide it. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don\u2019t know! Who knows?! I\u2019m all down for experience\u2014not against it whatsoever\u2014but I\u2019ve never been there before.\u201d She has a \u201ctough energy,\u201d she says, but \u201cI\u2019m not gay. I have literally nothing to hide\u2026. I would never hide something like that.\u201d\n\nAs for the Pepsi ad heard round the world, Jenner had a difficult time in the fallout. \u201cObviously, my intention was not to hurt anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cHonestly, I just hid out. It hurt me that I hurt other people\u2026. I\u2019ve been yelled at before, stepped in controversy before, but nothing to that extent. You can never really prepare for something like that.\u201d But she has learned, as \u201ca huge people pleaser,\u201d to be more aware of goings on on set, where, she said, \u201cI need to be more present and pay more attention.\u201d\n\nOne thing Jenner isn\u2019t mincing her words over is whether she\u2019ll be joining her sisters in their very contemporaneous pregnancies. \u201cI am ready to wait,\u201d she clarifies, having just bought a new home and forming plans to maybe begin competing as an equestrian under an androgynous alias. \u201cI want to have kids, but at, like, 28 or 29.\u201d\n\nWatch Kendall Jenner Ask Herself Some Existential Questions:", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa926664650d478d14ab889/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-kendall-jenner-vogue-cover-april-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa9266a74dfbf0bd53fc373/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-kendall-cover-breakout.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa9266a74dfbf0bd53fc373/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-kendall-cover-breakout.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-rumors-response-pepsi-ad-april-vogue-interview", "title": "Kendall Jenner Tells Vogue About Lesbian Rumors, That Pepsi Ad, and Kylie\u2019s Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The supermodel opens up about Blake Griffin, industry rumors, and more in the April issue of Vogue.", "id": "5aa8b1b874dfbf0bd53fc34e", "keywords": "news,kendall jenner", "news_keywords": "news,kendall jenner", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5aa8b1b874dfbf0bd53fc34e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The supermodel opens up about Blake Griffin, industry rumors, and more in the April issue of Vogue.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa92663d3a5026d7da8e1fb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-kendall-cover-breakout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa92663d3a5026d7da8e1fb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-kendall-cover-breakout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "From that Pepsi ad to her love life, Kendall Jenner handles rumors like a millennial\u2014head-on.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa9266a74dfbf0bd53fc373/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-kendall-cover-breakout.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "The 3 Biggest Revelations From Kendall Jenner\u2019s April Vogue Cover Story", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-rumors-response-pepsi-ad-april-vogue-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "From that Pepsi ad to her love life, Kendall Jenner handles rumors like a millennial\u2014head-on.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5aa9266a74dfbf0bd53fc373/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-kendall-cover-breakout.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "The 3 Biggest Revelations From Kendall Jenner\u2019s April Vogue Cover Story"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
