Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, online records show.\n\nThe brothers last saw each other in 1996, when they were found guilty of murdering their father Jose and mother Kitty as they watched TV inside their $5 million estate in Beverly Hills on Aug. 20, 1989.\n\nAuthorities said they shot Jose Menendez several times in the head. Initially, their mother was only wounded.\n\nBut when she tried to crawl away, Lyle Menendez reloaded his shotgun and shot his mother several more times, officials said.\n\nThe brothers claimed they killed their parents after enduring years of abuse, but prosecutors argued they wanted access to their parents\u2019 millions. They were each found guilty of two counts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nLyle Menendez reportedly asked to be moved closer to his brother during his last hearing on his inmate classification status. He was then transferred from Mule Creek State Prison in Northern California to the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego on Feb. 22.\n\nErik was then moved to the same unit as his brother Wednesday.\n\n\"He had been asking for it, and the department could find no reason they could not be at the same prison,\" Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections, told the New York Daily News. \u201cThere are people who are related who may also be crime partners, and it's not unprecedented for them to be living in the same prison or even sharing the same cell.\"\n\nThe brothers, who are believed to have kept in contact only through letters, will now be able to spend time together at meals, during recreational periods and while exercising.\n\nTammi Menendez, who married Erik three years after his sentencing, told TheBlast.com that her husband is \"settling in\" and described the brothers' reunion as \"heartfelt.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nNew Lifetime Movie Paints Menendez Brothers as Victims Driven to Murder by Years of Abuse\n\nCould a New California Law Bring a New Chapter in Menendez Brothers' Killings?\n\nWoman Targeted in Alleged Murder-For-Hire Plot Recounts Terrifying Ordeal", "images": ["https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/1x1_transparent.png", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/whatsapp.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/article_reddit_share.png", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/twitter.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/reddit.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/IE-Stickyplayer-BG-930x524.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/logo.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/100x100/public/images/2020-04/041720-trucker-1280x720.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=PEKaqfd_", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/article_twitter_share.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/facebook.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/email.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/100x100/public/images/2020-04/041720_baby_coma_web.jpg?h=d1cb525d&itok=5x0WqKPY", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2018-04/040618-menendez-1280x720.jpg", "https://www.insideedition.com/themes/custom/iebs/images/sharethis/article_facebook_share.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/images/2018-04/040618-menendez-1280x720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.insideedition.com/menendez-brothers-reunite-prison-22-years-after-sentencing-parents-murders-42222", "title": "Menendez Brothers Reunite in Prison, 22 Years After Sentencing in Parents\u2019 Murders", "meta_data": {"title": "Menendez Brothers Reunite in Prison, 22 Years After Sentencing in Parents\u2019 Murders | Inside Edition", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 71728150722, "app_id": 966341826790079}, "og": {"site_name": "Inside Edition", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/menendez-brothers-reunite-prison-22-years-after-sentencing-parents-murders-42222", "title": "Menendez Brothers Reunite in Prison, 22 Years After Sentencing in Parents\u2019 Murders", "description": "Erik Menendez, 47, has been transferred to 50-year-old Lyle Menendez\u2019s designated section at Richard J.
