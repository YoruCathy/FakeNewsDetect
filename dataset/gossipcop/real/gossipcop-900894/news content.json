News that Gomez disliked the fact that Bieber\u2019s dancing drew too much attention. Immediately after Gomez walked out of the venue, Bieber followed her, and they both returned to Los Angeles together.\n\nThe couple rode a private jet over the weekend to enjoy some quality time together. Another source told the same publication that the two are doing great ever since they started seeing each other again in October.\n\n\u201cSelena and Justin are doing great. Justin is very affectionate to Selena. He wears his heart on his sleeve lately especially when it comes to her. They are still learning about each other as grown adults,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe same source claimed that Bieber and Gomez will be spending New Year\u2019s Eve together since they won\u2019t be able to celebrate Christmas together. However, nothing has been finalized as of late.\n\nAnother source told People last week that Gomez\u2019s family doesn\u2019t like Bieber for the \u201cWolves\u201d singer that\u2019s why she never invites him to attend their gatherings.\n\n\u201cJustin\u2019s family always loved Selena, but Selena\u2019s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin. Selena doesn\u2019t bring Justin to any family events. Selena is spending Christmas with her family. As of now, Justin is not invited,\u201d the source said.\n\nGomez and Bieber dated on and off from 2010 to 2015. The two rekindled their romance after she underwent kidney transplant. Following her split from The Weeknd, Bieber and Gomez started hanging out more frequently. Last month, they were also photographed kissing each other on the lips.\n\nWhile speaking with Billboard, Gomez also said that she\u2019s more mature now to know who is good for her.\n\n\u201cI cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn\u2019t right. But that doesn\u2019t mean caring for someone ever goes away. And that goes for people in general,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/small-business-administration-chief-jovita-carranza-has-overseen.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/18/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/the-group-tours-istanbul-neighbourhoods-densely-populated-by.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/03/19/spacex-dragon-has-made-several-resupply-trips-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/president-donald-trump-flanked-by-vice-president-mike.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/wuhan-is-slowly-reopening-after-a-lockdown-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2014/01/21/target-logo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/arinew10.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/02/06/airasias-top-executives-have-stepped-aside-during-an.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/18/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/why-selena-gomez-walked-out-justin-bieber-during-their-date-night-2630134", "title": "Why Selena Gomez Walked Out On Justin Bieber During Their Date Night", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "selena gomez justin bieber seattle date night, selena gomez justin bieber sugar factory, selena gomez walks out justin bieber, justin bieber selena gomez holidays, selena gomez justin bieber relationship, justin bieber selena gomez split, selena gomez", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/why-selena-gomez-walked-out-justin-bieber-during-their-date-night-2630134", "title": "Why Selena Gomez Walked Out On Justin Bieber During Their Date Night", "description": "Selena Gomez walked out on Justin Bieber during their recent date night in Seattle.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/18/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/18/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg", "height": 594, "width": 490, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Camille Heimbrod", "modified_time": "2017-12-19T05:29:27-05:00", "published_time": "2017-12-19T05:29:27-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Selena Gomez Walked Out On Justin Bieber During Their Date Night", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/why-selena-gomez-walked-out-justin-bieber-during-their-date-night-2630134", "description": "Selena Gomez walked out on Justin Bieber during their recent date night in Seattle.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2017/12/18/selena-gomez-justin-bieber.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "selena gomez justin bieber seattle date night, selena gomez justin bieber sugar factory, selena gomez walks out justin bieber, justin bieber selena gomez holidays, selena gomez justin bieber relationship, justin bieber selena gomez split, selena gomez", "author": "Camille Heimbrod", "description": "Selena Gomez walked out on Justin Bieber during their recent date night in Seattle."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513679367.0, "source": "https://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
