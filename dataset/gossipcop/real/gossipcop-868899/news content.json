Real talk!\u201d Jackson shouts. Laughing, Spears responds, \u201cI need a black dude? I like black dudes. You guys are cool.\u201d\n\nAfter Jackson repeatedly begs the \u201cToxic\u201d singer to \u201ctake down my number,\u201d he insists that he\u2019s \u201cdead serious.\u201d She smiles and asks for his name as he replies, \u201cMy name is DeMario Jackson. I\u2019m an up-and-coming actor. I want to be like you. I want everybody to see me on TV. Real talk. You\u2019re dope. \u2026 My mom loves you, and she said tell Britney.\u201d\n\nThe future Bachelor Nation star then proceeds to give Spears his Myspace URL (throwback!) as she packs her grocery bags into the car. \u201cCan I have a hug? Can I just have a hug for TV?\u201d he asks before putting his arm around Spears. \u201cYou should really take down my number. Like, you know what I\u2019m saying? We should f\u2013king hang out.\u201d\n\nIn an instant, the Grammy winner\u2019s smile turns to a grimace as she walks away from Jackson and climbs into her car.\n\nThe video was filmed amid Spears\u2019 custody battle with her ex-husband Kevin Federline. The former couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, share sons Sean Preston, 11, and Jayden James, 10. Spears is currently dating personal trainer Sam Asghari.\n\nJackson, meanwhile, recently made headlines for his brief stint on the upcoming season of Bachelor in Paradise. The ABC reality series temporarily suspended production in June after a producer filed a claim of sexual misconduct in the workplace after an alleged incident occurred on set between Jackson and fellow contestant Corinne Olympios. Jackson vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and Warner Bros. found no evidence of misconduct after completing a thorough investigation.\n\nSeason 4 of Bachelor in Paradise premieres on ABC on Monday, August 14, at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/britney-spears-demario-jackson-b70f07d6-6127-45b5-8685-1ae6093430cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/britney-spears-demario-jackson-813965a4-4dc9-42cc-8aca-2046b703f0cc.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/britney-spears-demario-jackson-b70f07d6-6127-45b5-8685-1ae6093430cf.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/britney-spears-rejected-bachelor-in-paradises-demario-jackson-in-2008-w493739/", "title": "Britney Spears Rejected Bachelor in Paradise's DeMario Jackson in 2008", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Britney Spears was approached by future 'Bachelor in Paradise' star DeMario Jackson during a night out in January 2008 in a recently resurfaced video \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Throwback!
