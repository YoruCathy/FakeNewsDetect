With Bruno Mars sweeping the major categories, Fonsi and Yankee weren\u2019t able to make that historic stride forward, but the Puerto Rican artists remained positive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not leaving empty-handed tonight,\u201d wrote Fonsi on Instagram following the award show. \u201cTo be able to break the language barrier and unite the world with a song is the best prize anyone can win. Let\u2019s continue sharing our culture and our Latin music with the entire world. Thanks for supporting us, this is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nYankee shared the same image, writing, \u201cThanks to all #latinos for coming together to see us shine at the #grammys.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS\n\nFor Fonsi, the Grammy nod \u2014 and potential win \u2014 was all about celebrating his Latin heritage and pride. Before the ceremony, he spoke to ET about what the evening meant to him. \u201cThis is really big,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only for me, but for Latin music in general, to be able to sing a song in Spanish for the big show. I\u2019m really proud to be here. Being from Puerto Rico, growing up here in the United States, I\u2019ve always been so proud of my roots and my language, and all these artists who are performing, they\u2019ve all influenced me. So to be able to celebrate a little bit of who I am and where I\u2019m from, and to share with the world, and break that language barrier \u2014 especially after everything that [Puerto Rico has] been going through.\u201d\n\nAlthough the two artists kept their post-Grammy messages positive, some celebs and fans felt the duo were robbed, including Perez Hilton and Frankie Grande, the brother of pop star Ariana Grande.\n\nThey didn\u2019t walk away with a trophy, but Fonsi and Yankee gave a rousing performance of \u201cDespacito\u201d that brought the crowd, including Chrissy Teigen and John Legend, to their feet and won a standing ovation from the audience.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thatiana Diaz"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Daddy Yankee,Luis Fonsi", "news_keywords": "Daddy Yankee,Luis Fonsi", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee walked away with zero wins at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards,\u00a0but the Puerto Rican artists thanked fans in positive post-ceremony messages.", "og": {"title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee nabbed big nominations at Sunday\u2019s 60th Annual Grammy Awards with their record-breaking hit \u201cDespacito.\u201d The track got nods in the&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee walked away with zero wins at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards,\u00a0but the Puerto Rican artists thanked fans in positive post-ceremony messages.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/chica/luis-fonsi-and-daddy-yankee-respond-to-grammy-snub/", "title": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee React to Zero Grammy Wins for 'Despacito'", "description": "Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee walked away with zero wins at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards,\u00a0but the Puerto Rican artists thanked fans in positive post-ceremony messages.", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fgettyimages-911511418-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
