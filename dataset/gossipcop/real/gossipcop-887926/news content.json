{"url": "http://riverdale.wikia.com/wiki/Jingle_Jangle", "text": "Jingle Jangle is an addictive drug on Riverdale. Most of the teenage Southside Serpents use it, and so do some of the kids at Riverdale High School. Robert Phillips, also known as the \"Sugarman\", was the supplier of these drugs, who sold them to Ghoulies, who then distributed them throughout the streets of Riverdale. The Ghoulies also made some supplies inside of The House of the Dead.\n\nContents show]\n\nDescription\n\nJingle Jangle is a drug used as a stimulant, and, according to Reggie Mantle, is able to boost energy and keep the user wide-awake, also implying reinvigorating sexual performance as one of its effects. Toni Topaz also pointed out that this drug is highly addictive, a \"total gutter drug\", in reference to some Southside High's students. Jingle Jangle is consumed with a paper straw, and stays in your system for three days, according to Sheriff Keller.\n\nHistory\n\nThroughout the years they were many Sugarmen, each taking over the last previous Sugarman, they were described to be monsters, by Penelope Blossom.\n\nThroughout the Series\n\nMidge Klump approached Reggie Mantle by his locker looking to score some \"Jingle Jangle\", a new drug that has found its way onto the north side of Riverdale. After instructing Midge to keep her voice down on school property because the simple mentioning of the drug can land them both in a lot of trouble, Reggie asked who the Jingle Jangle was for, to which she replied that it was for her and Moose Mason. Reggie told her that he'll see what he can do.\n\nThe following night, Reggie delivered the Jingle Jangle in the diner's parking lot to Midge and Moose, attempting to do it in secret, but ended up being photographed by Alice Cooper, unbeknownst to Reggie and his clients. The couple then consumed the drug at a secluded location at Lovers' Lane, which ends them up in the Black Hood's line of fire.[1]\n\nWhile Toni Topaz was giving Jughead Jones a tour of Southside High, she pointed out a group of kids consuming Jingle Jangle in their natural habitat. Later that day, Mr. Philips agreed to reopen the Red and Black as long as Jughead didn't include Jingle Jangle or gangs within the paper.[2]\n\nNick St. Clair hosts a party in his room in the Five Seasons hotel. To make the party more interesting, he pulls out a few straws of the drug out of his jacket, and offers the members of the party a straw; everyone accepts, though Betty declines.[3]\n\nAt the Cooper house, it was revealed to the parents of the attendees of Nick St. Clair's small gathering that their children abused the drug. Reggie Mantle revealed that he supplied Nick with the Jingle Jangle, and that he acquired it from a Southside teen, who he suspected of being a Southside Serpent that attended Southside High. The mayor, Sierra McCoy, was especially furious towards the revelation of her daughter, Josie McCoy, using the drug. After learning that the use of Jingle Jangle was effecting her home life with her daughter, Mayor McCoy announced that her number one priority would be taking back the Southside and the eradication of Jingle Jangle.\n\nMoving forward with her plan, Mayor McCoy and Sheriff Keller raided Southside High, arresting every Southside Serpent in sight, including Sweet Pea and Toni Topaz.\n\nIn order to reveal the Sugarman's identity, Veronica Lodge attempted to buy some of the drug from a dealer whom Reggie was a customer. When she arrived at the location, she said the word \"Sugarman\" and how he created this drug. The dealer seemed shocked hearing that word, and raced off.[4]\n\nChic reveals that his former roommate, Charles Smith, had overdosed on Jingle Jangle; however, their next-door-neighbor knew nothing of a drug problem. Instead, she claims that they fought all the time and then one day there was only one. She also explained how she noticed bloody sheets and pillows in the dumpster when she took out her trash, suggesting a far more sinister conclusion between Chic and Charles.[5]\n\nAt the speakeasy, Veronica and Reggie discover a large stash of Jingle Jangle inside some boxes they were unpacking. Shortly after, they receive a visit from Sheriff Minetta who's clearly looking around for the drug. As Minetta exits, Veronica shares with Reggie her suspicion that the drugs were sent by Penny Peabody. She and Reggie know these encounters are a result of her father trying to bait her into a confrontation.\n\nVeronica visits Toni and Cheryl at Sunnyside Trailer Park to gather information from the Serpents. Toni admits they discovered that over the summer, the Ghoulies had set up shop in the basement of the Whyte Wyrm, which Hiram owns. Sweet Pea and Fangs think they\u2019ve turned it into a Jingle Jangle lab.\n\nThe three girls sneak into the basement of the Whyte Wyrm in an attempt to gain leverage over Hiram. While inside, they discover that Sweet Pea and Fangs were right in their assumptions. As the lab workers exit, Veronica, Cheryl and Toni move in. Toni takes several photos of the lab as proof of Hiram's corrupt business.
