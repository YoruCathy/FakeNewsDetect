We were at a surprise party in Hollywood at a speakeasy kind of a bar, a private club, and we were standing around in a group of people,\u201d he reveals in the book. \u201cI made some sort of sarcastic comment, really dry. Nobody got it except her. She laughed, and I noticed, all of a sudden, and in the way where you wonder if a person\u2019s like you, if they have a very dry, dark sense of humor too.\u201d\n\nDespite all of that, Timberlake didn\u2019t initially ask for her number because \u201cit wasn\u2019t the right time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to psych myself up,\u201d Timberlake writes of preparing to ask her out. \u201cI had to remind myself that I was me -- giving myself a pep talk, shadowboxing with myself, rubbing my own shoulders.\u201d\n\nTimberlake, as it turns out, didn\u2019t even make the next move! A mutual friend offered to bring Biel, 36, along to one of his shows, something that Timberlake graciously accepted.\n\n\u201cPatience may not be my strong suit but, apparently, playing coy is,\u201d he quips of the not-so-chance meeting.\n\nFrom there, Biel and her group of friends rode with Timberlake on a bus to his next show, during which time they \u201ctalked the whole way up\u201d and were \u201cjoking around.\u201d\n\nFollowing the bus ride, Timberlake finally asked her for her phone number and the two kept in touch, talking on the phone throughout the remainder of his tour.\n\n\u201cWe were both still seeing other people, keeping ourselves safe from getting hurt, from really putting ourselves out there,\u201d Timberlake writes of that time period. \u201cIt took a bit for both of us to admit to ourselves that we were really, really into each other.\u201d\n\nOnce they figured out their connection, though, they were inseparable. In order to see each other, both Timberlake and Biel traveled all around together in between their busy schedules.\n\n\u201cWe were going to different cities, having a ball, with room service and pay-per-view and great dinners. And Scrabble,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of unforgettable times.\u201d\n\nFor Timberlake, his admiration for his better half has only grown over time, first when they tied the knot -- \u201cI knew I was getting married only one time in my life,\u201d he writes -- and second, when they welcomed their 3-year-old son, Silas.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s become a huge influence on my life, and I have such admiration for her, especially seeing her as a mother now,\u201d he praises. \u201cBut I had admiration for her before. She\u2019s a very good writer. She\u2019s a poet. She\u2019s a tremendous actor. She\u2019s funny. Very funny. And she\u2019s one of the most patient people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe changed me. She changed my life,\u201d he gushes. \u201c... She\u2019s a different person from when I first met her, but she\u2019s also the same. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d say the same thing about me. Ten years is a long time.\u201d\n\nThat personal growth that Timberlake writes about keeps him happy, inspired and in awe of Biel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched my wife change. I\u2019ve watched her body change. It\u2019s a temple. It should be worshipped. It should be marveled at. I\u2019m fascinated by her. She\u2019s everything, man,\u201d he writes. \u201cShe just constantly surprises me with who she is, and who she\u2019s becoming, and I really hope I do the same for her. I\u2019m excited to see what she\u2019s going to do next. I wake up and roll over and look at her, and I\u2019m inspired.\u201d\n\nET caught up with Biel in April, where she gushed about her husband and the life they\u2019ve built together.\n\n\"It's so easy to get out of touch with your partner, especially if you're over here in one part of the world, and they're over there in another part of the world. Very easily you can become strangers,\" she confessed at the time. \"So having his back and he having my back in every moment of our lives, even if it's the decision of what's for breakfast, you feel safe and you feel like you're not alone in the world. So it's very important for us.\"\n\n\"[Becoming parents] changed everything, because we're both in awe of each other,\" Biel added. \"In many moments, I will do something and feel it's a bit of a mom fail, and kind of look over at him. There's no judgment there, so it's a safe place that we've created for ourselves and our partnership.\"\n\nWatch the video below for some more revelations from Hindsight & All the Things I Can\u2019t See in Front of Me:\n\nJustin Timberlake's Best Book Revelations This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
