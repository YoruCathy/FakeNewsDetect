Danny Masterson was fired from Netflix\u2019s The Ranch in December and on Friday, June 15, audiences got to see his final episode. Netflix released the first 10 episodes of season 3, and Masterson\u2019s Rooster made his final appearance in the tenth episode, entitled \u201cChange.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning of the episode, Rooster gets into an argument with Mary\u2019s (Megyn Price) boyfriend Nick and Nick threatens to kill Rooster. However, it\u2019s broken up by Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Colt. Rooster tells Heather (Kelli Goss) about Nick, who then relays the message to Mary \u2013 and Mary breaks up with Nick. So, Rooster invites Mary to WrestleMania only to come home and see that Nick has, once again, broken into his place. Nick gives Rooster a duffle bag full of his things and says, \u201cYou either take that bag and disappear, or you could just disappear.\u201d He then pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Rooster\u2019s entire family. So, he leaves.\n\nIt was an exit that audiences knew was coming. \u201cAs a result of ongoing discussions, Netflix and the producers have written Danny Masterson out of The Ranch,\u201d Netflix told Us Weekly in a statement in December. \u201cProduction will resume in early 2018 without him.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department has been investigating Masterson since March when four women came forward claiming they had been raped by the actor in the early 2000s. Following his firing, Masterson again denied all allegations made against him.\n\n\u201cI am obviously very disappointed in Netflix\u2019s decision to write my character off of The Ranch. From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit,\u201d Masterson said in a statement to Us at the time. \u201cI have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cHowever, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all. In the meantime, I want to express my gratitude to the cast and crew that I\u2019ve worked so closely with over the past three seasons. I wish them nothing but success. I am also so thankful to the fans that have supported me and continue to do so.\u201d\n\nThe Ranch is now streaming on Netflix.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ranch-masterson.jpg?crop=8px%2C6px%2C904px%2C511px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ranch-masterson.jpg?crop=22px%2C7px%2C895px%2C470px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ranch-masterson.jpg?crop=22px%2C7px%2C895px%2C470px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/how-danny-masterson-was-written-off-the-ranch/", "title": "How Danny Masterson Was Written Off \u2018The Ranch\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018The Ranch\u2019 said goodbye to Danny Masterson\u2019s Rooster during season 3, which was released on Netflix on Friday, June 15 \u2013 find out how he was written off the show", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Danny Masterson Was Written Off \u2018The Ranch\u2019 After Rape Allegations", "description": "\u2018The Ranch\u2019 said goodbye to Danny Masterson\u2019s Rooster during season 3, which was released on Netflix on Friday, June 15 \u2013 find out how he was written off the show", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/how-danny-masterson-was-written-off-the-ranch/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ranch-masterson.jpg?crop=22px%2C7px%2C895px%2C470px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ranch-masterson.jpg?crop=22px%2C7px%2C895px%2C470px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-15T20:13:47+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018The Ranch\u2019 said goodbye to Danny Masterson\u2019s Rooster during season 3, which was released on Netflix on Friday, June 15 \u2013 find out how he was written off the show", "title": "How Danny Masterson Was Written Off \u2018The Ranch\u2019 After Rape Allegations", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/the-ranch-masterson.jpg?crop=22px%2C7px%2C895px%2C470px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529093627.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
