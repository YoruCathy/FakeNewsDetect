She has not only managed to survive but has carved a niche for herself in the cold and cruel world of Hollywood showbiz. She is in the midst of a constantly growing career graph and is highly acknowledged. She became an iconic action star after the release of her cult classic Underworld in 2003 and has worked in many action movies since. She won the Best Actress Award at Sitges \u2013 Catalonian International Film Festival in 1997 for her film Shooting Fish. In 1999 she won the British Supporting Actress of the Year at London Critics Circle Film Awards for the movie The Last Days of Disco and in 2012 she won the Jean-Claude Gahd Dam at Spike Guy\u2019s Choice Awards for her movie Underworld: Awakening.\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\nKathrin Romary Beckinsale was born in London, England. She is the only child of actor Richard Beckinsale and actress Judy Loe. Her father was of one-quarter Burmese descent. She made her first television appearance at the age of four, in an episode of This is Your Life dedicated to her father. When she was five years old, her 31-year-old father died suddenly of a heart attack. Beckinsale was deeply traumatised by the loss and \"started expecting bad things to happen\". While she has seen her father \"more on television than I have in life\", \"there are certainly enough memories for me not to feel that it's somebody I didn't know.\"Her widowed mother moved in with director Roy Battersby when Beckinsale was nine and she was brought up alongside his four sons and daughter. She has a close relationship with her step-father: \"I couldn't have knitted a better one ... He wasn't pushy, he let me come to him.\" She has a paternal half-sister, actress Samantha Beckinsale, but they have not had regular contact. Beckinsale was educated at the fee-paying Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith, West London and was involved with the Orange Tree Youth Theatre. She was a two-time winner of the WH Smith Young Writers Award for both fiction and poetry. She has described herself as a \"late bloomer\": \"All of my friends were kissing boys and drinking cider way before me. I found it really depressing that we weren't making camp fires and everyone was doing grown-up stuff.\" \"I loathed being a teenager.\"She had a nervous breakdown and developed anorexia at the age of 15 and underwent Freudian psychoanalysis for four years\n\n\n\nActing career\n\nEarly acting roles (1991\u20131997)\n\n\n\nBeckinsale decided at a young age that she wanted to be an actress: \"I grew up immersed in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends\u2019 parents.\" She was inspired by the performances of Jeanne Moreau.She made her television debut in 1991 with a small part in an ITV adaptation of P. D. James\u2019 Devices and Desires. Also that year, she appeared as a young woman engaging in a forbidden affair with a Nazi officer in the Hallmark film One Against The Wind. In 1992 she starred alongside Christopher Eccleston in Rachel\u2019s Dream, a 30\u2011minute Channel 4 short and in 1993, she appeared in the pilot of the ITV detective series, Anna Lee, starring Imogen Stubbs.In 1993, Beckinsale landed the role of Hero in Kenneth Branagh's big-screen adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing. It was filmed in Tuscany, Italy, during a summer holiday from Oxford University.She attended the film's Cannes Film Festival premiere and later remembered it as an overwhelming experience.\n\n\n\nMove to Hollywood (1998\u20132002)\n\n\n\nAt this point in her career, Beckinsale began to seek work in the United States, something she has said wasn't \"a conscious decision...My boyfriend was in a play on Broadway so that's why we ended up in New York, and my auditions happened to be for American films\". She starred opposite Chlo Sevigny in 1998's The Last Days of Disco. The Whit Stillman film focused on a group of Ivy League graduates socialising in the Manhattan disco scene of the early 1980s. Beckinsale's attempt at an American accent was widely praised. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt her role as the bossy Charlotte was \"beautifully played\".\n\n\n\nFocus on small-scale drama (2007\u20132009)\n\n\n\nBeckinsale then made a return to smaller-scale projects: \"My experience is that I sort of stepped away from the independent movies and did a couple of big movies. But that's not necessarily how it's perceived by everybody else, which I do understand.\"\"I enjoy an action movie as much as the next person it\u2019s not something that I would like to do solely.\" She explained that she had originally decided to appear in Underworld because she felt typecast in classical roles \u2014 it was \"assumed that I use a chamber pot and wear bloomers\"\u2013 but that her action career \"kind of took off a little too much\". In 2007, Beckinsale starred opposite Sam Rockwell in the independent drama Snow Angels, based on the novel by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale \"in kind of a tough place\".\n\n\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships\n\n\n\nBeckinsale had an eight-year relationship with actor Michael Sheen from 1995 until 2003. They met when cast in a touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards. She has said it was \"love at first sight\"and that he saved her from \"a hospital for the criminally insane\". In 1997, they appeared in a radio production of Romeo and Juliet.Their daughter, Lily Mo Sheen, was born in London in 1999. The actress has said she was \"embarrassed\" that Sheen never proposed but felt as though she were married: \"If you keep a library book out long enough, you feel it's yours.\"\n\n\n\nTheir relationship ended in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld.Beckinsale had persuaded director Len Wiseman to cast Sheen in the film, but, while on set, she and Wiseman (who was married) began a relationship. All parties, aside from Wiseman's first wife,have maintained that there was no infidelity.Wiseman married Beckinsale on May 9, 2004 in Bel-Air, California. They live in Los Angeles. Beckinsale and Wiseman both remain friends with Sheen.", "images": ["https://www.biphoo.com/images/bipamerica-feedback-button.png",
