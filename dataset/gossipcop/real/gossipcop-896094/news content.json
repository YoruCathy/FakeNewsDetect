Seth Meyers\u2019 wife, Alexi Ashe, is pregnant and expecting the couple\u2019s second child together.\n\nMeyers announced the news on Thursday, November 23, during the Thanksgiving episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, alongside his parents, Larry and Hilary Meyers, and his brother Josh, who were his guests on the show.\n\n\u201cI want to take this opportunity now, you guys obviously know, my wife and I are expecting a second baby,\u201d the late-night host said. \u201cVery excited. Thank you! Very excited.\u201d\n\nHis mother told the audience the story of when her son called her to give her the good news. \u201cI get the phone call, and my Seth is sometimes a crier. He\u2019s sobbing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Because for over a month, I\u2019ve had to pretend that I don\u2019t care what sex it is and I do care, I want a little boy!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe comedian, who welcomed his first son Ashe in 2016, said: \u201cThat\u2019s true, I really wanted a brother for my son because I was so lucky to have one.\u201d\n\nThe Saturday Night Live alum, 43, and the human rights lawyer announced their first pregnancy in September 2015 while attending New York\u2019s Natural History Museum Gala.\n\n\u201cThey are so thrilled to become parents and were so happy to share the exciting news with friends and cast members from SNL last night,\u201d a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.\n\nThe couple wed in September 2013 in front of family and friends at Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Although the late-night host typically holds back from commenting on his marriage, he did share a sweet memory back in 2014 of Ashe trying on her wedding gown.\n\n\u201cI will never forget the first time she returned from her fitting because she was happier than I\u2019ve ever seen her,\u201d Meyers gushed at the time while attending a NYC luncheon. \u201cWhich was a little jarring for me because I had recently proposed to her. Turns out getting a ring from me is less exciting than having Carolina Herrera creating your dress.\u201d\n\nThe Late Night With Seth Meyers host also poked fun at Ashe for having food poising the night before their nuptials. \u201cIn a testament to my wife\u2019s will and my wife\u2019s strength, she got herself pumped full of fluids, and she railed it and made it to the ceremony,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she walked out in her Herrera wedding dress, she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her look.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alexi-ashe-seth-meyers-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1827px%2C960px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alexi-ashe-seth-meyers-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1827px%2C960px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/seth-meyers-and-wife-alexi-ashe-expecting-baby-no-2/", "title": "Seth Meyers and Wife Alexi Ashe Are Expecting Baby No. 2: Details!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Seth Meyers' wife, Alexi, is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child together \u2014 details!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Seth Meyers and Wife Alexi Ashe Are Expecting Baby No. 2: Details!", "description": "Seth Meyers' wife, Alexi, is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child together \u2014 details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/seth-meyers-and-wife-alexi-ashe-expecting-baby-no-2/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-11-24T15:06:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alexi-ashe-seth-meyers-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1827px%2C960px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alexi-ashe-seth-meyers-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1827px%2C960px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-24T14:51:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-24T15:06:41+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Seth Meyers' wife, Alexi, is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second child together \u2014 details!", "title": "Seth Meyers and Wife Alexi Ashe Are Expecting Baby No. 2: Details!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alexi-ashe-seth-meyers-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1827px%2C960px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511535078.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
