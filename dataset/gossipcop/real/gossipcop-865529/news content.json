So what could it be? Oh, only that she didn\u2019t try pie until she was 31 years old. More, she doesn\u2019t want to try it ever again.\n\nHer character, M, plays a grieving wife. The ghost of her husband tries to reconnect with her. In the midst of her grief, M devours an entire pie. It\u2019s something Rooney never did before and something she never wants to do again.\n\nREAD: Why Rooney Mara Will No Longer Play Lisbeth Salander In \u2018The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\u2019 Sequel\n\n\u201cIt was certainly something that popped out at me when I read it, that was one of the things I was really excited to do. So, it doesn't surprise me that it's something that jumps out of the movie,\u201d she told The Los Angeles Times Thursday. \u201cIt was such a unique way of showing grief; we've never seen anything like that before. And I'd actually never had pie before. That was my first and last pie.\u201d\n\nSounds bizarre that Mara never tried the dessert in her life, but she explained it\u2019s because she isn\u2019t fond of sweets and was never tantalized by pie.\n\nPhoto: Ideaman Studios, Sailor Bear, Zero Trans Fat Productions\n\n\u201cI just don't really have a sweet tooth and I was a really, really strange, geeky child. Something about pie always grossed me out and I just never tried it before,\u201d said Mara. \u201cAnd this came along and I tried making them switch it to something else, but [director David Lowery] really wanted it to be pie, so we did pie.\u201d\n\nLowery was also shocked that Mara had never tried the baked good. At first they weren\u2019t sure what the character was going to inhale, but they decided on pie.\n\nWhen she finishes wolfing down the dessert, Mara\u2019s character vomits at the end of the scene.\n\nREAD: \u2018Carol\u2019 Beautifully Captures An Elegant Romance Thanks To Cate Blanchett And Rooney Mara [REVIEW]\n\n\u201cIn the script, the description was, \u2018She sits down and eats the entire thing.\u2019 It was just one line,\u201d Lowery told USA Today Tuesday. \u201cI told her, \u2018Try to eat the whole thing and when you can't eat any more, get up and run to the bathroom. You don't actually need to throw up. But if you need to, go for it.\u2019 It was up to her to bring the scene to an end at the time she thought was appropriate, and she knew what the emotional intent behind the scene was, so there wasn't a lot of talking about it.\u201d\n\nThe film is in theaters nationwide now, but fans seemed more preoccupied with Mara\u2019s reveal.
