But this time around, he\u2019s got a lot more screen time: he\u2019s back in school, where bullies make fun of him; he keeps having terrifying \u201cepisodes\u201d that expose him to the shadowy realm that co-exists with his sleepy Indiana hometown; and, perhaps most importantly, he\u2019s got to decide how he feels about his prospective stepdad, played by none other than nerd royalty Sean Astin. Though this season holds many great surprises, one of its best is the skill and sensitivity with which Schnapp plays Will\u2014turning what could have been a flat scream-fest into something more deeply resonant. At times, staring into Will\u2019s wide, terrified eyes, it\u2019s hard not to feel his isolation and terror.\n\nIn an interview with V.F., Schnapp outlined tackling some of this season\u2019s greatest challenges\u2014including, yes, losing his voice for three days from screaming so much in the finale.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the massive success of Season 1 made the experience of filming Season 2 a little different. Security was beefed up: the cast\u2019s scripts had to be \u201call rounded up and given to this one guy, so he could burn it or something,\u201d according to Schnapp. And, yes, there were several meetings outlining what the cast could and could not discuss publicly\u2014though plenty of people have still tried to coax spoilers out of the actor. \u201cThey\u2019ll say it like, \u2018So I know this is happening. Can you just confirm it?\u2019 . . . People are very sneaky, but we\u2019ve been drilled in not to say anything.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for Schnapp is one of relatability: \u201cI\u2019ve never been stuck in the Upside Down, and no one else I know has, so it was kind of something new to just create,\u201d Schnapp said. His inspirations? Schnapp read stories and myths about people who had been possessed, then did his best to put himself in Will\u2019s shoes. We won\u2019t spoil the finale, but Will does spend one particularly harrowing scene screaming his lungs out. Although the Duffers initially instructed Schnapp not to strain his voice\u2014the actual screaming sounds would be edited and added in later\u2014he went for it anyway; as the actor explained, \u201cit felt really weird [to have] my mouth open but not screaming.\u201d Eventually, he paid the price.\n\n\u201cI was screaming and screaming,\u201d Schnapp said. His voice held out for a full day of shooting\u2014\u201dbut then the next morning I woke up, and I just\u2014I\u2019d open my mouth, and nothing came out for the next three days.\u201d\n\nChallenges like this are part of the Stranger Things deal, but it\u2019s also got its perks\u2014like meeting Astin, whom Schnapp described as \u201cso cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved meeting him, and we just got to talk about The Goonies with him,\u201d Schnapp said. \u201cHe\u2019s like a kid. He was always playing with us.\u201d Though eventually\u2014spoiler alert\u2014Astin\u2019s character gets served a grisly death by Demodog, Schnapp said the cast tried to lobby against losing their colleague\u2014to no avail. \u201cWe were all protesting just to keep him on set,\u201d said Schnapp, adding that Winona Ryder in particular \u201cwas so sad\u201d to see Astin go. The bottom line: they all loved him, but alas, the Duffers could not be moved.\n\nFor all the horrifying things Will must endure this season, the finale provides a bit of respite: the season closes on a dance, where a freshly exorcised Will gets to try out being a normal kid for just one night. Schnapp noted that playing a not-panicking Will was jarring, after so many episodes of embodying sheer terror, but we couldn\u2019t let him go without asking one thing about life as, well, an actual kid: do tweens today actually dance with each other, like they do in movies and TV shows, or are 21st-century middle schoolers as awkward as we were?\n\nFor the curious, rest assured: middle school dances are still awkward, says Schnapp.\n\n\u201cI went to a middle school dance and it was not like that,\u201d Schnapp said, referring to the packed party we see in the Season 2 finale. \u201cLike, from my middle school dance . . . the boys were on one side, and the girls were on the other side, and we never interacted with each other.\u201d As the clich\u00e9 goes, some things never change.",
