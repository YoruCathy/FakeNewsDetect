The flashy video seems as though it\u2019s Drake\u2019s way of honoring the Hollywood actresses \u2014 who look powerful while decked out in lavish outfits \u2014 as it\u2019s shot from different perspectives \u2026 a sly nod to his lyric, \u201cWith your phone out/Gotta hit them angles.\u201d\n\nFans quickly took to Twitter to praise the \u201cHotline Bling\u201d singer for making a music video that celebrates women.

Women always looking to gain a following and live in the light, but that also comes with some resistance and hate \u2014 despite what they go through, Drake understands it and appreciates the hustle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis New Drake song got the bad b\u2014ch in me feelin[g] even badder.

Wilde, who is the first Hollywood star featured in the video \u2014 looking fantastic in a black top and red skirt \u2014 tweeted her approval: \u201cThis was funnnnnnnn.\u201d Haddish also shared a clip on Instagram, writing, \u201cThis video is great and Everybody is Looking Good.\u201d\n\nThe single \u2014 equipped with a funky hook using Lauryn Hill\u2019s \u201cEx-Factor\u201d \u2014 is the second song by Drake that borrows from the former Fugee. He previously sampled Hill\u2019s song, \u201cDoo Wop (That Thing)\u201d for his hit, \u201cDraft Day.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drake-nice-for-what-music-video-olivia-wilde-zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drake-nice-for-what-music-video-olivia-wilde-zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drake-nice-for-what-music-video-olivia-wilde-zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/olivia-wilde-tiffany-haddish-more-appear-in-drakes-new-music-video/", "title": "Olivia Wilde, Tiffany Haddish, More Appear in Drake\u2019s New Music Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Hollywood stars including Olivia Wilde, Tiffany Haddish, Zoe Saldana and more are featured in Drake\u2019s new music video for \u2018Nice for What\u2019 \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Find Out Which Stars Appear in Drake\u2019s \u2018Nice for What\u2019 Music Video!", "description": "Hollywood stars including Olivia Wilde, Tiffany Haddish, Zoe Saldana and more are featured in Drake\u2019s new music video for \u2018Nice for What\u2019 \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/olivia-wilde-tiffany-haddish-more-appear-in-drakes-new-music-video/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drake-nice-for-what-music-video-olivia-wilde-zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drake-nice-for-what-music-video-olivia-wilde-zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-04-07T16:37:05+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hollywood stars including Olivia Wilde, Tiffany Haddish, Zoe Saldana and more are featured in Drake\u2019s new music video for \u2018Nice for What\u2019 \u2014 find out more", "title": "Find Out Which Stars Appear in Drake\u2019s \u2018Nice for What\u2019 Music Video!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/drake-nice-for-what-music-video-olivia-wilde-zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523119025.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
