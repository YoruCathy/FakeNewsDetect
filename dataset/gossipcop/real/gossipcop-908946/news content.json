The song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres. A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the song's chart performance in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. \"Despacito\" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in popularizing Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market again. The worldwide increase of Latin pop music consumption from 2017 onwards has been referred to as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"\n\nIt is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about having a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. Commercially, the song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others, making it both Fonsi's and Daddy Yankee's most successful single to date. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since \"Macarena\" (Bayside Boys Mix) in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-running number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Internationally, it broke the record for most weeks at number one in Switzerland and Germany and became the longest-reigning foreign language number-one in the United Kingdom. In August 2017, the official music video for \"Despacito\" became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time after receiving its three billionth view. It became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, and six billion views.\n\nUpon its release, \"Despacito\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. The remix version has received three Grammy Awards nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all-time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop music history.\n\nBackground\n\npictured) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi. Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender ) co-wrote \"Despacito\" with Luis Fonsi.\n\nAfter two years without releasing new music, Luis Fonsi wanted to create \"a fun track that had that Latin feel with a melody that I feel very comfortable singing and that will make people just dance.\"[3][4] The lyrics were born in late 2015 in Fonsi's house after he expressed his desire to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album.[5] Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender, a Latin Grammy Award-winner, went to Luis Fonsi's house in Miami, who said to her that he woke up mulling about \"writing a song called 'Despacito'.\"[6][7] Fonsi sang the lines \"Vamos a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico\", Ender replied \"Hasta que las olas griten 'Ay Bendito'\" and then they began to build the song.[7] The Puerto Rico line was moved to the end of the song in order to not sound \"so regional\" and they started writing a story.[7] Fonsi co-wrote the song on a Gibson Emmylou Harris guitar.[8]\n\nFonsi originally composed \"Despacito\" as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but began to consider giving it an \"urban injection\" and contacted reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee, who agreed to collaborate on the song after Fonsi played him the demo.[4][9] Prior to collaborating on \"Despacito\", Fonsi and Daddy Yankee had worked together on \"Una Oportunidad\", released digitally in 2010.[10] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse while thinking about his father playing bongos at his house, citing that as \"percussion attacks,\" and wrote the post-chorus or hook.[11][12][13] They recorded the song at Noisematch Studios in Miami, United States in 2016.[14][15] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali & El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thal\u00eda, and Ricky Martin, among various Latin acts.[16][17][18] It was mixed by American engineer Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, United States.[19]\n\nOriginally, Luis Fonsi focused on other songs of his album after making the demo of \"Despacito\".[20] Andr\u00e9s Torres said that the track \"kept getting postponed\" because \"there was always some issue with [it].\"[21] After showing the demo to his producers, they and Fonsi decided to focus on \"Despacito\" and leave the other works aside.[20] Sometime in October or November 2016, Fonsi called Miami-based Noisematch Studios' CEO Alex Campos in order to record the track there, where he had worked his 2012 song \"Nunca Digas Siempre\" with Spanish singer Merche.[22] Campos stated that the first recording session consisted on \"working mostly the music,\" including the Puerto Rican cuatro.[23] Daddy Yankee's vocals were recorded on the second day of work. He asked for a Shure SM58 and recorded his verse and the post-chorus in a corner of the studio's control room.[24]\n\nLuis Fonsi stated that both Daddy Yankee and he were surprised after hearing the final song because it sounded \"powerful, fresh and different.\"[20] Luis Fonsi said that he does not consider it a reggaeton song but feels that \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat.\"[4] He also affirmed that Daddy Yankee's work was a plus to the song because \"it needed that explosion that only he can bring to the table.\"[4] Mauricio Rengifo expressed that the song \"really took 100 percent shape the day Yankee recorded.\"[21] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted.\"[7]\n\nFonsi stated that he made \"Despacito\" a danceable song because \"Latinos are known for being happy people\" and that he feels the need of happy music.[25] He added that the \"urban feel\" in the song's rhythm is the type that \"Latinos breathe in and out\" and that it is \"a synonym of party.\"[25] According to him, \"Despacito\" is a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[25] In an interview with Billboard magazine in April 2017, Erika Ender stated that the track \"made a special connection\" and that the collaboration with Daddy Yankee was \"a great idea.\"[5] She also said that because of the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and that her approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste.\"[5] During the 2017 Billboard Latin Music Conference, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song's release interfering with the launch of his album F\u00e9nix.[21][26][27]\n\nJustin Bieber remix version\n\nThree months after the release of the original version, Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix after seeing how people reacted to the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[28][29] The following day, Luis Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[30] On April 11, 2017, Bieber's manager Scooter Braun contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin, who was preparing to go on a short holiday to the Caribbean until April 17, to work on the song.[31] He flew from Los Angeles to Bogota and recorded Justin Bieber's vocals in Estudios Audiovisi\u00f3n after American songwriter Jason Boyd sent his lyrics and melody outlines.[31]\n\nJustin Bieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician and Latin Grammy Award-nominee Juan Felipe Samper.[32][33][34] After recording the beginning of the song, Bieber approached Samper in order to receive coaching with his Spanish pronunciation, which he wanted to be perfect.[34] He stated that what cost Justin Bieber the most was the 'ere' (\u027e) sound in words like \"laberinto\" (labyrinth), \"paredes\" (walls) and \"manuscrito\" (manuscript).[34] Samper wrote the lyrics of the song phonetically to ease Bieber's pronunciation, which was \"perfectly\" achieved in two hours.[34]\n\nJosh Gudwin used a Neumann U47 microphone, a Neve 1081 microphone preamplifier and a Tube-Tech CL1B compressor for the four-hour recording session, and sent Bieber's vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris \"Tek\" O'Ryan for vocal tuning.[31] Gudwin completed re-arranging the song and started to mix it while waiting during a five-hour lay-over at Miami International Airport.[31] He concluded the production of the remix version in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi's English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[31] The entire process until the release date took six days.[31] Mauricio Rengifo stated that Justin Bieber \"approached reggaeton in a very different way\" and that \"the melody he does at the beginning is not reggaeton at all but it fits beautifully.\"[35]\n\nIn June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song but Justin Bieber \"advantaged him.\"[36][37] He also stated that he likes reggaeton music, saying that it has a \"good rhythm\" and that \"everyone enjoys it.\"[37]\n\nComposition\n\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton[38][39] and Latin pop[40][41] song composed in common time (4\n\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A.[42] The vocals span from F# 4 to A 5 .[43] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[44][45] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[46][47]\n\n\"Despacito\" A 22-second sample of \"Despacito\" featuring part of the chorus. Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\nMauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and its final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[35] Rengifo said that \"an interesting thing about this song is that it breaks a lot of rules\" and that they \"usually do not take one minute to get to the chorus, but when it works, it works.\"[35] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar played by Andr\u00e9s Torres when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[35][48] Rengifo stated that the guitar \"was actually played, but then [they] chopped it and made it really digital.\"[35] The producers decided to record a cuatro because they wanted \"to feel very Puerto Rican and ethnic\" and that it \"gives the song a really unique character.\"[35] Nieves played salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains vocal samples and \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[35] Percussion instruments guache and g\u00fcira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track's cumbia influences.[35] The song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent,\" silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[49] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[49] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, g\u00fcira, and sequenced drum patterns.[35]\n\nThe remix featuring Justin Bieber maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee's verses were kept from the original version.[32] It has a length of three minutes and forty-eight seconds. For the beginning of the song, Josh Gudwin adjusted the levels of some of the instrumental tracks and arranged and muted parts of the original vocals in order to have more space for Bieber.[31] The final mix consisted of 67 tracks.[31]\n\nRelease and reception\n\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017 by Universal Music Latin. It was released physically on April 30, 2017 in Europe as a 2-track single including the original and pop version. Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music after the release of singles by Nicky Jam, Thalia, Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Ricky Martin and Shakira.[50] Fonsi considered the trend to be \"the new pop\", and Ender said of it, \"everyone is making this type of fusions.\"[3][5] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don't call, people who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him that the track was a \"home run.\"[51]\n\nThe song was well received from music critics. Doris Irizarry of AXS praised the fusion between \"Latin sensual rhythms\" and urban music, describing it as \"masterful.\"[52] Sebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts electronic journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[53] He added that \"'Despacito' has the magic it takes to reach the world\" and that \"works both on the dancefloors and on the radio.\"[53] Buddy Iahn of The Music Universe described it as an \"infectious tune\" and expressed that its music video became very popular because it is \"great music performed by two of the biggest stars in the Latin music business.\"[54] Diana Marti of E! News said that \"it is almost impossible not to dance to it.\"[55] Caroline Soriano of Enstars magazine described the song's beat as \"quite sexy and catchy\" and defined the lyrics as \"captivating.\"[56] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone magazine described it as alluring, sexy and catchy.[14] Leila Cobo of Billboard expressed that \"Despacito\" is \"a great pop song\", highlighting the \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" of the pre-chorus and the chorus.[57] Cobo also stated that it \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat, subtly naughty lyrics, a rapper's contemporary edge and an irresistible chorus that can be applied to so many situations.\"[58]\n\nRobert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need stated in his review that the song has \"something very interesting happening\" and that it can be classified as a Latin-American song because of its composition and characteristics.[49] He highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, on which flamenco is usually played, representing \"a modern take on a historical musical style.\"[49] Joffred also stated that what makes \"Despacito\" a \"great song\" is that it \"throws decades of tradition to the wind in a very subtle way\" because of the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus.[49] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius.\"[49] Petra Rivera-Rideau, author of Remixing Reggaet\u00f3n: The Cultural Politics of Race in Puerto Rico (2015), said that \"what's great about 'Despacito' is that it shows reggaeton never really went away\" and that the song's success \"makes her really excited to see what's going to happen next.\"[59] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune.\"[60]\n\nSpanish record producer Nah\u00fam Garc\u00eda stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius,\" referring to the first time Luis Fonsi performs the word \"Despacito\".[61] He explained that \"the brain realizes that there has been a rare breakdown and it catches its eye\",[61] and claimed that this \"trick\" in particular is not very common \"and much less in pop music.\"[61] Garc\u00eda concluded stating that the song \"is very well made.\"[61] James Kellaris, composer and professor at the University of Cincinnati's business school,[62] expressed that \"'Despacito' contains earworm elements\" for being \"cheerful, simple, repetitive and having a sticky rhythm.\"[61] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics after being translated to English, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive.\"[63] Christian Koch of The Culture Trip also referred to the lyrics as \"creepy.\"[64] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that \"the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting.\"[65] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances, describing them as \"one of a kind.\"[66] Derrick Rossignol of Uproxx described it as \"the perfect mix of everything pop fans want: it's acoustic and sexy, but with a fun beat, and it gives the feeling that you are listening to something new.\"[67]\n\nThe remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017 by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and School Boy Records.[68] It is the first collaboration between Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee with Bieber. The remix's official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[69] Hilton Dresden of Out magazine described it as \"unexpected and delightful\" and that \"Justin Bieber singing in Spanish is a highly sexual experience,\" defining the results of the collaboration as legendary.[70] Caroline Soriano of Ernstars magazine stated that Bieber's voice \"sounds appealing with the song,\" whose remix version make it sound \"a little bit better.\"[56] Latina's Daniela Galvez described Bieber singing in Spanish as \"amazing.\"[71]\n\nMike Senior of Sound on Sound gave a negative review of the remix's mixing by wondering the reasons of its polarity inversion regarding the original version, in which \"the kick sound feels appreciably punchier and the bass feels much warmer, while the stereo image is wider and more open-sounding.\"[72] He also noted that Daddy Yankee's \"melodic rapping seems appreciably quieter in the remix,\" while Justin Bieber's voice sounds louder.[72] As to the original version, Senior wrote that the producers did not waste the potential of the hook line \"Despacito\" and referred to its first appearance as a \"masterstroke\" because \"it puts the brakes on just enough to heighten the anticipation of the downbeat, but not so much that you totally lose the sense of rhythmic momentum during the hiatus.\"[72]\n\nAccolades\n\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success. In 2017, the original version won three awards at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video, while the remix version won Best Urban Fusion/Performance.[73] It won Collaboration of the Year and Favorite Pop/Rock Song and was nominated for Video of the Year at the 45th American Music Awards.[74] The Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame recognized it as the Song of the Year at its 5th La Musa Awards.[75] The song has also won two Teen Choice Awards,[76] two Premios Juventud,[77] and an NRJ Music Award,[78] and was nominated for three Latin American Music Awards,[79] an MTV Europe Music Award,[80] and an MTV Video Music Award during that year.[81]\n\nIn 2018, the remix version received three nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Grammy Awards.[82] Due to the track's successful chart performance in the United States, the remix received six Billboard Latin Music Awards, including Hot Latin Song of the Year, and five Billboard Music Awards, including Top Hot 100 Song.[83] It has also received an ASCAP Latin Music Award for Song of the Year by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers at the 26th ASCAP Latin Music Awards.[84][85] Erika Ender became the youngest person to be inducted into the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame and the first female Latin artist to garner a Grammy Award for Song of the Year nomination.[75][30] At the 5th iHeartRadio Music Awards, both versions were nominated for three awards each, with the original receiving one award.[86]\n\nThe song has also appeared on the top 10 of several year-end and best of all-time lists. Billboard's critics ranked the original version the fourth best song overall and the best Latin song of 2017, as well as the fifth best Latin song of all-time, referring to it as \"one of the biggest

\"Despacito\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[108] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its

featuring Descemer Bueno and Gente de Zona, achieved between May 2014 to February 2015, on the issue dated February 17, 2018.[116][117][118] \"Despacito\" left the Hot Latin Songs chart on March 9, 2019 after 110 consecutive weeks, becoming the list's second longest-charting title, due to a recurrent rule that removes songs that rank below number five after 52 weeks.[119][120][121][122] The track has never ranked below the top five of Hot Latin Songs during the entirety of its run.[68][123][124] After falling to recurrent status, \"Despacito\" has topped the Hot Latin Songs Recurrents

Brandle referred to it as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[223] Jeff Benjamin of Billboard stated that the success of the song represented that \"English is no longer a requirement for mainstream U.S. success.\"[224]\n\nIn December 2017, British Official Charts Company recognized \"Despacito\" as the song that \"helped Latin pop crossover to the mainstream once again\" and highlighted that \"Little Mix, Matt Terry, Demi Lovato and Camila Cabello all released Latin inspired songs this year.\"[225] Writing for Nielsen's 2017 Music Year-End Report, Erin Crawford stated that \"Despacito\" had \"a halo effect on several other Latin hits ripe for crossover success, most notably J Balvin & Willy William's 'Mi Gente,' which catapulted to the top of the Hot Latin Songs chart after Beyonc\u00e9 made a 'Despacito'-esque cameo on the song in September to help raise proceeds for families affected by Hurricane Maria.\"[144] In June 2018, Rolling Stone magazine stated that the song \"hastened a massive historical turn in American music, demonstrating the mainstream viability of Spanish-language pop.\"[102] In July 2018, John Ochoa of Rolling Stone stated that \"the resulting so-called 'Despacito effect' has advanced a wave of subsequent Spanish-language hits and mainstream crossovers, from the Latin trap explosion to J Balvin's reggaeton globalization.\"[103] In August 2018, Billboard affirmed that the song's influence has impacted other Latin crossovers, including \"Mi Gente\".[226]\n\nThe Recording Industry Association of America reported in April 2018 that Latin music revenues grew 37% in 2017, \"driven primarily by music streaming,\" whose revenue increased 84% compared to 2016.[227] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) reported that revenue in Latin America grew 17.7% in 2017, \"driven largely by a 48.9% increase in streaming revenues that helped offset a 41.5% decline in physical revenue.\"[207] \"Despacito\" has been described by the IFPI as \"a game-changing hit from Latin America to the world\" and declared it \"the song of 2017.\"[207] IFPI's chief executive Frances Moore described the song as a \"global smash hit\" and related its success with \"the broadening appeal of Latin music.\"[207] In July 2018, Billboard reported that Latin music's consumption in the United States increased 15% between the first half of 2016 and the first half of 2018, directly relating it with the success of \"Despacito\" during 2017.[228] In 2018, eight out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos of the year were for songs performed in Spanish.[229] The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation referred to the worldwide increase of Latin pop music consumption in 2018 as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[230]\n\nIn June 2019, Sony/ATV Music Publishing President Jorge Mej\u00eda stated that \"Despacito\" marked a \"before and after\" in the global consumption of Latin music.[231] Before the song's success, Sony \"had a big Latin single roughly every two years,\" a situation that reverted into an \"avalanche of Latin songs around the world.\"[231] In November 2019, Billboard's Leila Cobo wrote that \"it wasn't only that no other Latin song, in history, had had that level of success, it also outdid everything that came in its wake\".[232] In December 2019, Andrew Unterberger of Billboard stated that \"2017 was the year that Latin pop took over the United States\" due to the song and its quick impact on J Balvin's and Willy William's \"Mi Gente\", Camila Cabello's \"Havana\", and the chart performance of acts including Maluma, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved their biggest hits in the country.[233]\n\nEconomic impact\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[234][235] Tour operators cite the song's music video for increasing interest in locations such as Club La Factor\u00eda and La Perla district in Old San Juan,

worked on the music video.[239]\n\nWanting Carlos P\u00e9rez to direct the clip, Luis Fonsi reached him the song and wanted to make \"something special.\" According to Fonsi, P\u00e9rez was impressed with the track after listening to it, and showed interest in the project.[51] Fonsi then called 2006 Miss Universe Zuleyka Rivera, wanting her to represent \"the Latina powerful woman.\" She called him back 10 minutes later and replied that it was \"the best song she had ever heard.\"[51]\n\nFonsi stated that the music video celebrates Latin American culture, saying that movement, dancing and rhythm are \"engraved into his bones.\" He also affirms that part of the song's success was the reception of the fans, capturing the best of Fonsi's romantic ballad and danceable facets.[25] Carlos Perez stated that the clip \"directly supports the vibe of the song\" and that it \"is a video that has soul to it.\"[240] Jorge Mu\u00f1\u00edz Ort\u00edz of EFE stated that the music video \"highlights some of the main cultural and folkloric symbols of Puerto Rico\" by showing its \"splendid beaches, the colorful landscape of La Perla, the rattle of the Puerto Rican cuatro and the barrels of the autochthonous genre of bomba, even Zuleyka Rivera's hips movement, and a pair of men enjoying a game of dominoes.\"[9]\n\nOn April 10, 2018, Luis Fonsi's YouTube Vevo account was hacked by an anonymous group, who removed the music video for \"Despacito\" from his channel for hours before becoming available again.[241] BBC News reported that clips from more than a dozen Vevo channels, including those of Drake, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez and Shakira, were also affected.[242] The hackers stated that \"the act was not malicious, but just in good fun.\"[242]\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe video shows both artists performing the song while participating on different parties on the island, featuring model Zuleyka Rivera.[243] The clip starts with shots of La Perla's coast during daylight while showing Zuleyka Rivera arriving at the shanty town on foot. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee perform the song in a street while elders are playing dominos, a child is getting his hair cut, two people are talking while listening to the radio, and couples are dancing in the background. The video intercalates with shots of Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing in front of a car with people sitting on it and dancing next to it. As Daddy Yankee is finishing his verse, Zuleyka Rivera enters La Factor\u00eda bar while the artists are performing and dancing alongside other people, and men are playing bomba drums.[9] Fonsi proceeds to dance with Rivera as the song ends. The outro consists of Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee singing the hook a cappella with the people at the bar.[9]\n\nPerformance and accolades\n\n[244] Video views on YouTube grew virally, and peaked about 28 weeks after video was posted.
