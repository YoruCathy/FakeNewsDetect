Which is exactly how Spider-Man would feel.\n\nThe young actor joins more than two-dozen other Marvel heroes in the third Avengers movie, which brings the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe together to battle the otherworldly warlord Thanos (Josh Brolin).\n\nJesse Grant Getty Images\n\nSpeaking to E! News earlier in the week, Tom admitted that being together on set with Hollywood titans like Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbatch and Chris Pratt left him with sensory overload at times.\n\n\"To be 21 and to get the chance to work with people like this is amazing,\" he beamed. \"It was just a real whirlwind to walk on set and see 30 of your favourite actors dressed up like superheroes, just having a coffee and hanging out. It was so bizarre.\"\n\nTom also joked that the superstar cast bonded mostly over their shared misery at being trapped in super-suits for most of the day.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\n\"Once you're in it, you're in it. They're the kind of costumes you can't take off,\" he complained. \"When we take our breaks, we're sitting in the green room drinking coffee. Some of us are trying to go to the bathroom. It's crazy.\n\n\"[With] my suit, there is no going to the bathroom! You have to know when you go in it that you have at least three hours in the tank.\"\n\nEek. Hopefully Tom has learned how to, ermm, contain himself a bit better because he's back to work filming Spider-Man: Homecoming 2 in London in just a few months' time.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War will be released on April 26 in the UK and April 27 in the US. Book tickets now.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
