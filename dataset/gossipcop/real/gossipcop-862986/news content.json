As improbable as it seems, \u201cThe House\u201d actor Cedric Yarbrough says that it really happened.\n\nYarbrough took to Facebook on Wednesday to detail how the singer \u201cruined\u201d an intended cameo featuring her in the film.\n\n\u201cYeah, a real funny cameo was SUPPOSED to happen in the new film #TheHouse with the superstar Mariah Carey. But it was ruined by superstar Mariah Carey,\u201d Yarbrough wrote. \u201cThe film takes place in a suburban home but is made into a \u2018Casino\u2019. Why not have Mariah be an act in the casino? Funny idea.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Mariah Carey Blames 'Everybody' for New Year's Eve 'Chaotic Mess'\n\nYarbrough went on to say that Carey \u201ceventually\u201d graced the set with her presence, \u201cafter waiting for her for 3-4 hours!\u201d And when the porpoise-ranged songstress arrived, Yarbrough recalled, she scuttled a stunt that had been cooked up in her absence.\n\n\u201cWhile we waited the director & team had the idea of doing a stunt that Mariah\u2019s body double would do now & bring in Mariah to match it. They do the stunt. All goes well,\u201d Yarbrough wrote. \u201cWhen Mariah finally showed up she refused to match the stunt. \u2018Darling, I would never do it that way\u2026'\u201d\n\nYarbrough added that Carey \u201crequested a large fan for her hair to be blown around and a camera that would be above her, basically a crane shot.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Mariah Carey Sues 'Deceitful' Promoter Over Canceled Argentina, Chile Concerts\n\nThe actor went on to call Carey \u201cborderline abusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis lady was unprofessional & borderline abusive to our director, who tried his best to appease her every wish. In the acting community, it\u2019s not very good form to \u2018tell\u2019 on your fellow actors,\u201d Yarbrough added. \u201cThey could be having a bad day, going through some personal things, & maybe Mariah was, I don\u2019t know. But I do know that our crew didn\u2019t deserve that, our director didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAs unsettling as Yarbrough\u2019s account was, the actor wrote that he hadn\u2019t even divulged the worst of it.\n\nAlso Read: Mariah Carey NYE Sabotage Claims Are 'Bullsh-t,' Jenny McCarthy Says (Audio)\n\n\u201cThis kind of behavior just isn\u2019t cool. I\u2019m not even going to tell you the worst part. (i will if i see you in person & if i deem you \u2018cool\u2019),\u201d Yarbrough wrote. \u201cFor you young actors, be on time, know your homework, but be courteous and respectful. For us old heads, the same. This kind of behavior should be called out for what it is. I miss \u2018I had a vision of love\u2019 Mariah. Be a damn professional.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laura-bush-michelle-obama-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/white-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bill-cosby-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MariahCareyNewYears-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-52741361-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dwayne-Johnson-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GettyImages-544282834-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Marilyn-Monroe-The-Prince-and-The-Showgirl.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mariahcarey.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mariahcarey.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Kenneally", "Debbie Emery", "Beatrice Verhoeven", "Daniel Goldblatt", "Rosemary Rossi", "Trey Williams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/mariah-carey-was-borderline-abusive-and-ruined-her-the-house-cameo-cedric-yarbrough-says/", "title": "Mariah Carey Was \u2018Borderline Abusive\u2019 and \u2018Ruined\u2019 Her \u2018The House\u2019 Cameo, Cedric Yarbrough Says", "meta_data": {"parsely-title": "Mariah Carey Was \u2018Borderline Abusive\u2019 and \u2018Ruined\u2019 Her \u2018The House\u2019 Cameo, Cedric Yarbrough Says", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/mariah-carey-was-borderline-abusive-and-ruined-her-the-house-cameo-cedric-yarbrough-says/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-22T11:40:28-07:00", "parsely-section": "movies", "parsely-author": "Tim Kenneally", "parsely-tags": "cedric-yarbrough, mariah_carey, the-house", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "\"This kind of behavior just isn't cool.
