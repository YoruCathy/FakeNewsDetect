The worst of it included a disastrous boat ride to Cartagena that was sold to the women as \u201ca sun-soaked cruise on a 5-star yacht.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boat was old, beaten up and falling apart,\u201d the insider says. \u201cThere were no amenities, no food, and a crew that didn\u2019t know what they were doing. I mean, the anchor had to be sawed off before they made it home because it was so rusty and tangled. That\u2019s how bad this was!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tinsley Mortimer, Sonja Morgan, Bethenny Frankel, Ramona Singer, Dorinda Medly, Luann de Lessepts, Carole Radziwill Patrick Ecclesine/Bravo\n\nThey didn\u2019t want to board the ship to ho home initially, \u201ccomplaining right off the bat.\u201d But production \u201cpushed them to continue because they knew it would make good TV.\u201d\n\nThings got worse when the boat finally left the dock. Turbulent seas caused several people to get sick. And when the boat\u2019s anchor caught mid-ride, the reality stars were left terrified.\n\n\u201cIt was a disaster,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe vessel was so shaky and the waters so rocky that the women got really sick. Things began flying off the boat. The engine caught on fire. None of the crew spoke English. None of the women felt safe. Carole got sick and was throwing up overboard. The others were all screaming for help. They were all scared out of the minds. They thought they were going to die out there.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ramona Singer and Sonja Morgan Heidi Gutman/Bravo\n\nA second source close to the cast calls it \u201cthe boat ride from hell,\u201d telling PEOPLE, \u201cthese women survived a horror show.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were soaked to the bone, scared s\u2014\u2014-, and sick by the end,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cThey were crying out for their lives. When smoke started coming form the ship, they thought it was over.\u201d\n\nEventually, a second boat came and recused them and the women were able to continue on with their vacation, but \u201cthe experience really put a damper on the rest of the trip,\u201d the production source says. \u201cThe whole thing was a mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anything the experience brought them together,\u201d the cast source adds. \u201cAny feuds that have been carrying through the season were thrown aside. They\u2019re furious with production for putting them in that situation to begin with.\u201d\n\nPage Six was first to report the incident.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Bethenny Frankel Talks Real Housewives of New York City and Luann De Lesseps Returning After Arrest\n\nA Bravo spokesperson tells PEOPLE in a statement, \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York City cast was recently on a boat in South America and encountered turbulent water.
