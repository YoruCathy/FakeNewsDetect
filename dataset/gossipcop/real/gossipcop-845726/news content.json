the UK and is resting at home after being released on Saturday, the statement said.\n\nThe infection was not identified, but the statement said John contracted the \u201charmful and unusual bacterial infection\u201d during his South American tour, which ended in Chile on April 10.\n\n\u201cInfections of this nature are rare and potentially deadly,\u201d the statement said, adding that his time in intensive care was followed by an \u201cextended stay in hospital.\u201d\n\nJohn is expected to make a full recovery but has canceled all his concerts in Las Vegas for April and May, as well as a gig in Bakersfield, California, on May 6.\n\nJohn apologized to fans for disappointing them, adding in a statement: \u201cI am extremely grateful to the medical team for their excellence in looking after me so well.\u201d\n\nHe is due to resume performances at a concert in Twickenham, England, on June 3.\n\nJohn, a Grammy, Oscar and Tony winner for his work in film and theater, is working on a score for a Broadway musical adaptation of the comedy-drama \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada.\u201d", "images":
