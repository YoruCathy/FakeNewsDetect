And then after, like, 10 years of that, at age 27, I realised, \u2018Man, I\u2019m so depressed. On the surface my life seems pretty good \u2014 I have a career and everything \u2014 but I feel isolated and lonely\u2019.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve started a new chapter of my life. I was very work-addicted, and addicted to other things \u2014 not substances, I got over that a long time ago \u2014 but I\u2019ve recently changed my life, and this is part of my therapy,\" he added.\n\n\u201cMost actors come to a point in their lives where they have to reassess what they\u2019re doing and why they\u2019re doing it. And for me, after going back to school and trying to do all these other things, this new chapter, with surfing and dancing, is really about slowing down and trying to focus on fewer things but in a deeper, more quality-filled way.\u201d\n\nFranco also insists that he will continue to act saying: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, of all the things that I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019ve done a lot, the actual process of directing is the most fun, because you\u2019re in the middle of all these different creative people. But no, I will not stop acting.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2017/2017-08/James_Franco_TCA_020817-seo.JPG", "https://media.malaymail.com/uploads/articles/2017/2017-08/James_Franco_TCA_020817.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2017/2017-08/James_Franco_TCA_020817-seo.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2017/08/02/james-franco-on-how-acting-helped-him-overcome-certain-addictions/1434147", "title": "James Franco on how acting helped him overcome certain addictions", "meta_data": {"keywords": "james franco", "fb": {"app_id": 1709756459249190, "pages": 163335377171805}, "twitter": {"site": "@malaymail", "creator": "@malaymail", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Franco on how acting helped him overcome certain addictions | Malay Mail", "url": "https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2017/08/02/james-franco-on-how-acting-helped-him-overcome-certain-addictions/1434147", "description": "LOS ANGELES, Aug 2 \u2014 James Franco is opening up about his battle with depression and how acting helped him overcome certain addictions.
