Since first popping onto the music scene, Ashlee Simpson has released three studio albums in her career. Her first album, \"Autobiography\" was a hit, as was its reality show counterpart that was called simply, \"The Ashley Simpson Show\". Her fame was tarnished somewhat after a poorly lip-synched performance on a 2004 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\". She was born Ashlee Nicole Simpson on October 3, 1984, in Waco, Texas. Ashlee is younger sister of superstar Jessica Simpson. Ashlee first became notable as a participant in her sister's reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. She then became the star of her own spin-off program The Ashlee Simpson Show, which documented the creation of her debut album, Autobiography. Having fallen in love in music at an early age, 11-year-old Ashlee was the youngest child ever to be admitted in the School of American Ballet. By the time she turned 14, she moved with her parents and older sister to Los Angeles where she was already dancing in Jessica's stage show. While her performances on Malcolm in the Middle and The View earned her a regular role on the television show Seventh Heaven. However, Ashlee's heart was set on a music career. She finally saw the leak of one of her songs, \"Just Let Me Cry\", as it landed on the Freaky Friday soundtrack in 2003. Since then, Ashlee has continued to work on her rocking and punky demos, a different musical style from Jessica's. Ashlee's debut album eventually came to light in 2004, when MTV was debuting Ashlee's own reality show. In the first week, the album went to #1 on the Billboard album charts with sales of 398,000 copies. Her second effort, I Am Me, was released in October 2005. As part of her tour to support the album, Simpson also appeared as Roxie Hart in the London production of Chicago. In 2008 Ashlee Simpson married Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz. They had one child together before divorcing in 2011. She released her third album Bittersweet World in 2008. That album featured the singles \"Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)\" and \"Little Miss Obsessive. In 2014, Ashlee married Diana Ross' son Evan Ross. They have one child together.", "images": ["https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1057081139/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Ashlee-Simpson-e1556809430531.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Ashlee-Simpson-e1556809430531.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/singers/ashlee-simpson-net-worth/", "title": "Ashlee Simpson Net Worth", "meta_data": {"description": "Ashlee Simpson Net Worth: Ashlee Simpson is an American singer-songwriter and actress who has a net worth of $11 million.
