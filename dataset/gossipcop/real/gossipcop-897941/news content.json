Successfully making the leap from dopey TV sidekick to full-fledged action movie hero, he doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down any time soon. Pratt is set to star in a slew of upcoming projects, including \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d and a yet-unnamed \u201cJurassic World\u201d sequel, both due out in 2018.\n\nThis June 21, the actor will turn 38. Here is a look at his net worth, career and marriage to Anna Faris.\n\nChris Pratt Net Worth: $30 Million\n\nChris Pratt\u2019s net worth of $30 million has its roots in Hawaii, when he was discovered while waiting tables. A part in Rae Dawn Chong\u2019s 2000 comedy-horror short \u201cCursed Part 3\u201d helped launch Pratt\u2019s career, eventually leading to parts in the shows \u201cEverwood\u201d and \u201cThe O.C.\u201d\n\nHis earnings have increased dramatically over the last few years, as he took on lead roles in blockbusters like \u201cJurassic World,\u201d which grossed $1.67 billion worldwide, and \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\u201d which was released in May 2017 and garnered more than $145 million its opening weekend, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nChris Pratt went from earning $180,000 for \u201cDelivery Man\u201d in 2013 to $1.5 million for the first \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d one year later, according to celebrity earnings source TheRichest. The year 2015 brought Pratt a huge bump in earnings when he snagged the lead role in \u201cJurassic World,\u201d earning just less than $10 million. A year after that, he starred in \u201cPassengers\u201d alongside Jennifer Lawrence for a whopping $12 million, according to Forbes.\n\nRELATED: Check out Forbes richest people in the world:\n\nChris Pratt Movies, TV Career and Awards\n\nChris Pratt\u2019s movies have earned billions at the worldwide box office, and the actor shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nHe played Josh Faraday in the 2016 reboot of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven,\u201d originally a 1960 Western, and Jim Preston in \u201cPassengers,\u201d also released in 2016. He reprised his role as Peter Quill/Star-Lord in the 2017 \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d sequel and is rumored to play the same character in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d due out in 2018.

She is possibly best known for her role in the \u201cScary Movie\u201d horror spoof franchise. The couple married in 2009 and had a son, Jack, in 2012.\n\nDespite their wealth, Chris Pratt and Anna Faris\u2019 2009 wedding was a low key event in Bali, Anna Faris\u2019 rep told PEOPLE.\n\nAnna Faris\u2019 net worth is estimated at $20 million, reported the website CelebrityNetWorth, and she is believed to earn $125,000 per episode for her role as Christy in the TV series \u201cMom.\u201d Some of her biggest movies have been animated, with two \u201cAlvin and the Chipmunks\u201d movies earning more than $340 million each and two \u201cCloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\u201d movies earning more than $240 million each worldwide, according to estimates by Box Office Mojo.\n\nChris Pratt Lifestyle and Hobbies\n\nChris Pratt might be earning millions, but he\u2019s quite the handyman. The actor posted to Instagram a restored 1965 Volkswagen Beetle he won playing blackjack. The self-taught mechanic spent 12 years restoring it to its current pristine condition. Here\u2019s Chris Pratt\u2019s Instagram post about the car:\n\nIn 2015, Anna Faris bought him something he\u2019s always wanted as a combined Father\u2019s Day and birthday gift: a piano. Although the price tag is undisclosed, the actor told E! it was the nicest gift he\u2019s ever received.\n\nChris Pratt will celebrate his birthday as one of the most popular actors in Hollywood. He hit his stride in the last two years with leading roles in movies that were blockbusters. His wife is also among the entertainment world\u2019s elite, and the couple has a Jurassic-sized lifestyle with plenty of new \u2014 and likely lucrative \u2014 projects on the horizon.\n\nMore from
