She was the kindest person I\u2019ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can\u2019t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cKate suffered from depression and anxiety for many. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn\u2019t her. There were personal demons she was battling.\u201d\n\nThe pair, who married in 1994, are the parents of daughter Frances Beatrix, now 13. They were separated at the time of Kate\u2019s death.\n\nLike Brosnahan, Andy\u2019s brother David Spade has returned to the public eye since the tragedy. On June 8, he said during a stand-up performance that it had been a \u201crough week\u201d but he didn\u2019t want to cancel the show.\n\n68 PHOTOS Tony Awards 2018: Red carpet arrivals See Gallery Tony Awards 2018: Red carpet arrivals NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 10: Todd Spiewak and Jim Parsons attend the 72nd Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 10, 2018 in New York City.
