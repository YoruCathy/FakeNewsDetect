Sunny's texts, Sara, Whoopi, you're my inspiration. Joy, when I need comedic relief, this is where I go. So we're going to be friends no matter what.\n\nWATCH: 'The View' Co-Host Jedediah Bila Announces Her Engagement\n\nBila, 38, couldn't leave without thanking The View's loyal viewers. \"I want to thank the viewers, even the ones that write me the hate tweets,\" she said. \"This is what I'm here for. I'm there to shake things up.\"\n\nAs for what's next for Bila, she told her fans to \"stay tuned,\" and plugged an upcoming book she's planning to write that will come out next year. \"There's some good stuff on the way,\" she said. \"I just have to map it out a little bit.\"\n\nWATCH: Candace Cameron Bure Leaves 'The View' -- A Look Back at Her Most Memorable Moments on the Show\n\nUpon breaking the news, Bila received hugs from her co-hosts and some kinds words. \"I am honored to call you friend,\" Hostin said.\n\n\"It's great to have you here,\" Behar chimed in. \"We need someone [who] disagrees. ...It has never been personal, and that has been good for the show.\"\n\n\"I've learned so much from you,\" Haines praised Bila.\n\nWATCH: Whoopi Goldberg Reunites With 'Sister Act' Co-Stars in Honor of Film's 25th Anniversary\n\nWhile Bila's exit may have come as a surprise to some viewers, ET did confirm last month that Goldberg would be returning for season 21 of the ABC show.\n\nET also spoke with the 61-year-old star -- who joined the program in 2007 -- at the GLAAD Media Awards in New York City in May, and she was adamant that she'd be at The View \"for as long as I need to be.\"\n\n\"This new administration's so inept, [it] makes it hard to walk away,\" she said. \"But, you know, the women are good and the table is settled and, you know, it'll be fine. It'll all be fine.\"\n\nWhoopi Goldberg Sounds Off on 'The View' Hiring and Firing Rumors This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
