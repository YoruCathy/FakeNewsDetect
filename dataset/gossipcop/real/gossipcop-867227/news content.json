Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are \"no further details to report at this time.\"\n\nThis comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nI have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real... https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1 \u2014 Kid Rock (@KidRock) July 12, 2017\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170425215104-caitlyn-jenner-intv-lemon-3-exlarge-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717095629-jenner-kidrock-therock-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170324220407-test-get-political-logo-large-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170810083230-get-political-logo-large-169.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717095629-jenner-kidrock-therock-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deena Zaru"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/politics/caitlyn-jenner-senate-run/index.html", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner latest celebrity to float run for office", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "politics", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2017-07-17T13:34:26Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/politics/caitlyn-jenner-senate-run/index.html", "title": "Jenner latest celebrity to float run for office", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717095629-jenner-kidrock-therock-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2017-07-17T13:34:26Z", "lastmod": "2017-08-14T18:36:04Z", "author": "Deena Zaru, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "Jenner latest celebrity to float run for office", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717095629-jenner-kidrock-therock-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.", "keywords": "politics, Caitlyn Jenner latest celebrity to float run for office - CNNPolitics", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170717095629-jenner-kidrock-therock-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/17/politics/caitlyn-jenner-senate-run/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "politics,bra-get-political,art-vid"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500220800.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
