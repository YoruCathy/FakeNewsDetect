{"url": "https://www.trashtalktv.com/04/08/married-to-medicine-recap-bowling-alley-blues/310925/", "text": "Last season, Dr. Jackie was a mature woman who survived cancer and sought to be a role model for African-American women. Dr. Simone was a doctor who liked to drink, hated exercise and loved her family. Mariah and her Black-adeshi family were at the center of most fights and Quad tried to avoid having sex with her nerdy husband. Oh, and Toya made Kelly Bundy look like a Pulitzer prize winner. Kari was there but she\u2019s undergoing a very personal struggle with her lips and couldn\u2019t be a part of this season.\n\nQuad is back and looking semi-clownish. Her hair is orange, her lips are red and her eyeshadow looks like something out of Face Maker circa 1983. It could be the fact that I\u2019m watching this on a 13 inch TV but all of this color is making my soul hurt. Anyway, she\u2019s shopping at her friend\u2019s store and he brings up the pressure for her to have a child. Okay, is this scene even in English? Quad and Reco sound like the result of James Brown possessing their bodies \u2013 if he was resurrected as a gay Southern man. I think the moral of the story is that Quad doesn\u2019t want to have babies yet but let\u2019s get down to the real story. Reco asked Mariah to pose for his magazine but she said she was busy. He told her he wanted to use Quad but Mariah felt it wasn\u2019t right to use someone else in her circle. Quad cries because her BFF is a selfish moron. I can\u2019t believe she was really crying over this so I choose to believe that there\u2019s more to this story. Maybe Mariah tried to show a family vacation slideshow on Quad\u2019s forehead. I don\u2019t know.\n\nDr. Jackie and Dr. Simone meet and discuss fun facts. For instance, some women forget to remove their IUD for decades and it\u2019s up to these brave souls to remove it. That was just the appetizer for the really fun stuff. Dr. Jackie talks about her husband\u2019s regret over not having a son. The first year of her marriage was when she went through her first bout with cancer. She also had a miscarriage so she wants to discuss using donor eggs with his sperm so he can have a child. Dr. Simone warns her not to do it because she\u2019s busy and she\u2019ll have to give stuff up in order to have a child. The conversation ends abruptly when Dr. Simone has to take off to push the eject button on a patient\u2019s uterus.\n\nMariah ruins her daughter\u2019s self-esteem during a family photo shoot when she tells her that she doesn\u2019t know how to give face and takes her place in the family photo. I see a Lauren Manzo in the making. I don\u2019t know what the Black-adeshi equivalent of provolone and egg salad is but order up a 30 year supply. Stat. Mariah\u2019s family, including her infamous mother, is there for dinner and Mariah asks her nephew Ian about being bullied at school. Mariah\u2019s advice to him is to beat up the girl who\u2019s been hitting him. More specifically, \u201chit it and quit it!\u201d First of all, the girl probably likes him and secondly, has Mariah not heard of school shootings and suicide? Kids are over the top these days. The last thing they need is permission to act out on whatever impulse they have. Third, \u201chit it and quit it\u201d definitely refers to sex. Perhaps she wants him to continue the reality tradition and be a star on MTV\u2019s Teen Dad: Reality Offspring. Then again this is Mariah. She\u2019d probably love for the kid to have a full meltdown so he can\u2019t overshadow her own kids.\n\nMariah says that she and Quad don\u2019t speak anymore and her sister says that Mariah created Quad. Actually, Suzuki invented quads. Mariah says that Rico Chapple, the dress shop man, got in Quad\u2019s ear about Mariah being jealous of her. Mariah\u2019s mother must\u2019ve read her hate mail last season because she\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s going to an inauguration and she\u2019s got a Hilary Clinton weave. Mariah\u2019s mom is disappointed in Quad so you know what that means. Quad\u2019s getting a beat down with a purse.\n\nDr. Simone gets home late from work. She missed her kid\u2019s game because a patient was in labor. Her husband, Cecil, was able to cover parental duties. She feels like she\u2019s trying to juggle lots of balls and based on her husband\u2019s facial expression, there\u2019s definitely a couple of blue balls in the house. Dr. Simone switched to a new billing system and she was prepared for a 3 month pay delay but not the 6 month one that she\u2019s going through. I love a doctor who can admit she\u2019s broke right now and can call herself a bitch in a loving way. I should have gone to medical school. I\u2019m always calling myself names and avoiding calls from collections.\n\nQuad is making breakfast for her husband, Greg. He\u2019s surprised and she makes the point that she can do this now that she doesn\u2019t work. She\u2019s brilliant! Quit work, do one menial task and justify leeching for as long as possible. Momma Joyce from RHOA would be relieved to know that Kandi\u2019s not the only \u2018victim\u2019. I love that she greets her husband politely but says good morning to her dogs like they got a medical degree and give her an eyeshadow allowance. Plus, her husband speaks in a higher pitch than her dogs bark and he doesn\u2019t need to be walked. He might need to be neutered though. She would give him sexy time but he farts in his sleep. I don\u2019t know why we need to hear about this but it makes me understand my perpetual loneliness. Dr. Gregory brings up the baby subject and fails to get her in the mood by basically saying that she\u2019s old. He tells her that she\u2019s on the back-end of thirty and she needs to get started. She laughs it off, says she\u2019s just starting her thirties and secretly pours laxative into his pancake batter.\n\nToya is a stay at home mom. Bravo basically spends 12 seconds catching up on her life of barely taking care of her kids and then has her go over to her dentist and friend\u2019s house. Dr. Heavenly says that Toya isn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer but she likes her spirit\u2026and role on a TV show. Dr. Heavenly is having a soiree for Atlanta\u2019s medial elite and hopes that everyone is on their best behavior. She questions the behavior of Drs. Jackie and Simone at Toya\u2019s sickle cell event. Dr. Jackie offended a plus-sized pageant winner and Dr. Simone was dancing on Toya\u2019s husband. It sounds to me like the two of them went to reality TV school over the hiatus.\n\nDr. Simone borrows a purse from Dr. Jackie for the party and says she\u2019s putting nothing in it. Andy Cohen, please cut this lady a check.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the computer? I need to put this purse on ebay.\u201d\n\nAt the party, Dr. Simone hugs Dr. Heavenly\u2019s husband and asks if it\u2019s okay to touch him. Obviously, she\u2019s gotten word regarding the talk that\u2019s circulating about her actions at Toya\u2019s party. They both squat and get into a pissing contest for wives. Dr. Heavenly brags that she works part-time so she can cook for her husband and be submissive. Dr. Simone mocks her for only being half a doctor and calling her husband \u201cdaddy\u201d. Dr. Heavenly even brags that she ironed her husband\u2019s tuxedo. Umm, what?! Did she do that before or after she took it out of the dryer?\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I took it out and since we\u2019ve been standing here I gave myself an orgasm so he doesn\u2019t have to do it later.\u201d\n\nSimone\u2019s husband tries to stop the conflict and Simone tells her not to start sh*t with her. Dr. Heavenly says if Simone starts it, she\u2019ll finish it. Heavenly\u2019s husband immediately yanks her leash and reprimands her for using the s-word. They each go to their separate corners. Kari and her lips make an appearance at the event. Quad and Mariah fake kiss and greet each other. Dr. Jackie and Simone are hanging out when Dr. Heavenly comes over for part two of her argument.\n\n\n\nDr. Jackie: There\u2019s nothing angelic about those fat rolls, Dr. Heavenly.\n\nSimone apologizes for Heavenly getting in trouble with her hubby but Dr. Heavenly doesn\u2019t mind being submissive to her husband and says that the two of them know nothing about that. Then, Dr. Heavenly calls Jackie out for criticizing the pageant girl in the bowling alley. She keeps emphasizing that the girl was insulted in a bowling alley and no one wants to be insulted in a bowling alley. I\u2019ll do you one better. No one wants to be in a bowling alley. Why in the hell were Atlanta\u2019s medical elite and random plus-sized beauty queens throwing greasy balls down a lane for charity? Dealing with greasy balls for a wedding ring or green card is one thing but I wouldn\u2019t do that for messed up cells.\n\nJackie takes the women aside to talk about the issue and Mariah makes her way into the conversation. In flashbacks, we see Dr. Jackie lecture Miss Plus-Size Georgia on heart disease, portion control, activity and bob sweat. Dr. Heavenly says that she lost 70 pounds so she knows where the pageant girl was coming from and she didn\u2019t want to hear that stuff in a bowling alley. Dr. Jackie talks about the importance of health and says that Heavenly doesn\u2019t totally get it because she isn\u2019t really a doctor. Dr. Heavenly explains that she is a doctor and Jackie corrects it by saying that she doesn\u2019t deal with hearts just crusty teeth. Meanwhile, Mariah is in the background setting Black-adeshis back 2 years with exclamations of \u2018Yes Jesus, hunty, oh Lord!\u2019. They\u2019ve only been around for like 8 years so it\u2019s like a quarter of their history down the drain. Jackie ultimately apologizes for hurting or offending anyone but she says that obesity cam lead to cancer which she\u2019s had.\n\n\n\nDr. Jackie: I am really, truly sorry. I can\u2019t express how sorry I am\u2026that I went to a bowling alley.\n\nDr. Simone jumps into the argument to help defend Jackie and Heavenly threatens to kick her out of the house. Dr. Simone doesn\u2019t mind, in fact she doesn\u2019t feel welcome so she\u2019s ready to leave.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already shoved two bottles of Absolut into my bag.\u201d\n\nAfter that conversation is over, Toya confronts Simone about grinding on her husband at the event. Simone doesn\u2019t recall doing it and then says that Toya couldn\u2019t even see around Eugene so how could she know.\n\n\n\nToya: I had on glasses. They call me five eyes.\n\nDr. Simone is on a roll and I don\u2019t mean those attached to Miss Plus Sized Georgia. She\u2019s angered Dr. Heavenly, made fun of Toya\u2019s dizzy eyes and called Eugene fat. I love her. Dr. Simone storms out and we\u2019re ready to roll for the rest of the season.\n\n\n\nDr. Heavenly: Can I have ice cream tonight, daddy?\n\nHusband: Right after you watch My 600 LB Life and write a 500 word essay on not ever gaining back 70 pounds.\n\nThis season, Jackie and Quad entertain reproduction, Simone has marital issues, Toya gets hit in the head again and no one likes Mariah. What\u2019d you think? It was a decent premiere and I hope it gets even better. The new doctor should be on next week\u2019s episode and why didn\u2019t we get to see the bowling alley, sickle cell fundraiser? It looks like that would\u2019ve been a good season premiere!\n\nWant more TrashTalk?
