The show is filmed far in advance of broadcast and sees only an edited and condensed version of all that actually unfolds before the camera.\n\nAD\n\nIn \u201cSurvivor,\u201d each episode builds to the tension-filled tribal council, where contestants trudge through the darkness to some kind of hut, carrying firelit tiki torches meant to signify their life in the game.\n\nAD\n\nThey are greeted in this hut, where there is more fire, by long-running host and producer Jeff Probst.\n\nProbst usually takes the contestants\u2019 temperature, asking probing questions about their mood, who is angry at whom that week and which contestants think they\u2019re heading home. The tension and drama is often orchestrated.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s episode, Varner immediately volunteered that he was on the chopping block, then alluded there was widespread \u201cdeception\u201d among the group.\n\n\u201cThere is deception here,\u201d Varner said. \u201cDeception on levels, Jeff, that these guys don\u2019t even understand.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cContinue,\u201d Probst urged in the cool tone of an arbiter who had moderated tribal councils for 17 years.\n\nAD\n\nVarner turned to his left, where Smith was sitting quietly, and said: \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you told anyone you\u2019re transgender?\u201d\n\nTheir five fellow tribe members \u2014 two men and three women \u2014 were visibly shocked and quickly came to Smith\u2019s defense, scolding Varner for choosing to out someone without their consent.\n\nThey shouted and Smith\u2019s gender history was \u201cpersonal\u201d and had \u201cnothing to do with the game.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff, I\u2019m arguing for my life,\u201d Varner retorted. \u201cI feel like I have to throw everything at the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy outing somebody?\u201d contestant Tai Trang, who is gay, fired back.\n\nEven Probst appeared rattled and told Varner it was a \u201cgiant leap of logic\u201d to argue that Smith was being deceptive.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral of the contestants cried in a seemingly authentic display of empathy for Smith.\n\nAD\n\nAnd as his tribe members remained defiant and united against his dirty trick, Varner began to slowly realize the grave mistake he had made.\n\nEventually, the camera fixed on Smith, who with surprising poise, considering what appeared to have transpired, explained that his friends and family at home knew he was transgender, but that he chose not to make it a part of his \u201cSurvivor\u201d narrative because he wanted to be known for his prowess as simply a player, not the show\u2019s first transgender player.\n\nSmith explained that revealing his gender history to people since he transitioned often \u201csort of overwhelms everything else they know about you.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVarner began to profusely apologize. Smith said he hoped it all \u201cwould lead to a greater good.\u201d\n\nAnd in what appears to be a \u201cSurvivor\u201d first, Probst didn\u2019t even call for a formal tribal council vote \u2014 where contestants walk to a confessional-like room in the hut, write their vote on a paper ballot and often offer colorful commentary on their choice.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, Probst just called for a raise of hands, and Varner was unanimously eliminated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Varner said, crying, as he hugged Smith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay man,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d\n\nThen Varner grabbed his tiki torch and exited the hut.\n\nIt was a dramatic 14 minute segment that left many viewers aghast.\n\nAD\n\nThe motto is Outwit, Outplay, Outlast not plain Out!!! #SurvivorGameChangers #survivor \u2014 Randy Sangha (@RandySangha) April 13, 2017\n\nJohnny Fairplay faking his grandma's death to get ahead on survivor is nothing compared to Varners move tonight #SurvivorGameChangers \u2014 Kaitlyn Stelzer (@KaitlynStelzer) April 13, 2017\n\nBut soon after the episode aired, a coordinated public relations campaign between the CBS showrunners, Probst, Varner, Smith and representatives from GLAAD, the LGBT advocacy organization, deployed.\n\n\u201cZeke Smith, and transgender people like him, are not deceiving anyone by being their authentic selves, and it is dangerous and unacceptable to out a transgender person,\u201d Nick Adams, director of GLAAD\u2019s Transgender Media Program, said in a statement. \u201cIt is heartening, however, to see the strong support for Zeke from the other people in his tribe. Moments like this prove that when people from all walks of life get to know a transgender person, they accept us for who we are.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe media program worked with show producers and Smith for months before the episode to make sure the reveal was handled with sensitivity, namely ensuring that Smith had an opportunity to tell his own story on his terms, according to the statement.\n\nAD\n\nLate Wednesday, the Hollywood Reporter published a lengthy guest column from Smith. He described his transitioning process, how competing on \u201cSurvivor\u201d helped him prove his \u201cmanliness\u201d to himself and what it felt like to be outed on national television.\n\nSmith wrote:\n\n\u201d \u2026 In calling me deceptive, Varner invoked one of the most odious stereotypes of transgender people, a stereotype that is often used as an excuse for violence and even murder. In proclaiming \u201cZeke is not the guy you think he is\u201d and that \u201cthere is deception on levels y\u2019all don\u2019t understand,\u201d Varner is saying that I\u2019m not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick. In reality, by being Zeke the dude, I am being my most honest self \u2014 as is every other transgender person going about their daily lives.\u201d\n\nIn a Q&A with Probst that also dropped late Wednesday, the show host told Entertainment Weekly that Smith\u2019s transgender identity was never going to be a part of the show unless Smith made it one.\n\nProbst said:\n\nZeke was fully aware someone might suspect it or bring it up and he said, \u201cI will deal with it as it arises.\u201d And I have to add it was never a question of Zeke being worried his story would come out. Zeke is a massive Survivor fan and his point with us was very clear \u2014 he wanted to be seen as a Survivor player. Not the first transgender Survivor player. I really respected that distinction and I understood it.\n\nVarner also released a statement on social media after the episode aired, again apologizing for his actions and calling it \u201cthe worst decision of my life.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, outing someone is assault,\u201d Varner said. \u201cIt robs a strong, courageous person of their power and protection and opens them up to discrimination and danger. It can leave scars that haunt for a lifetime. I am profoundly sorry.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet, Probst said the showrunners hoped something greater would come from the controversy.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that this emotional and powerful conversation will bring awareness and understand,\u201d he said, \u201cand ultimately effect change.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/puTNYmO2V4lD72BckoJaMK2A4lk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FGVOZ2B6BMZDJAJYGPQ3C4SICU.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/05aaf951-1996-4c85-81cd-049d7a6fd7ca.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/puTNYmO2V4lD72BckoJaMK2A4lk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FGVOZ2B6BMZDJAJYGPQ3C4SICU.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Mettler", "Reporter Covering Breaking News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/13/outrage-after-survivor-outing-why-havent-you-told-anyone-here-youre-transgender/", "title": "Outrage after \u2018Survivor\u2019 outing: \u2018Why haven\u2019t you told anyone here you\u2019re transgender?\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "It was a dramatic 14-minute segment that left many viewers aghast.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/13/outrage-after-survivor-outing-why-havent-you-told-anyone-here-youre-transgender/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/puTNYmO2V4lD72BckoJaMK2A4lk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FGVOZ2B6BMZDJAJYGPQ3C4SICU.jpg", "title": "Outrage after \u2018Survivor\u2019 outing: \u2018Why haven\u2019t you told anyone here you\u2019re transgender?\u2019", "description": "It was a dramatic 14-minute segment that left many viewers aghast."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Outrage after \u2018Survivor\u2019 outing: \u2018Why haven\u2019t you told anyone here you\u2019re transgender?\u2019", "description": "It was a dramatic 14-minute segment that left many viewers aghast."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-29T23:13:26.868Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492012800.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
