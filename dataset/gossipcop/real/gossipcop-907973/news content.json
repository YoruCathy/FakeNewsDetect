The legendary Latina entertainer received an arousing moment of sweet love last night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards when she got a standing ovation. Rita wasn\u2019t there to accept an award \u2014 although she should have for her role in the remake \u201cOne Day At A Time.\u201d The actress was there to present the Life Achievement award to her former co-star Morgan Freeman. The two actors were both featured on the show \u201cElectric Company\u201d 50 years ago.\n\nWhen Rita came out, everyone in the room got on their feet. It was quite a magical moment and you could tell the actress was overcome with joy and was very much surprised by the praise.\n\nTHIS is how you welcome Rita Moreno to the room!

News the standing ovation lasted more than 20 seconds, and when it comes to award ceremonies 20 seconds is a lot.\n\n\u201cOh, my God! That\u2019s a lot of love, but I can handle it,\u201d she said filled with emotion. \u201cOh! You\u2019ve just damn near killed me! It was, oh, I can\u2019t get over it!\u201d\n\nShe could barely get her words for Morgan Freeman out because she was so overtaken. It was just incredible! She also had said that she received that same acknowledgement five years and it\u2019s so amazing to see the love still there, more so because Latinos are so underrepresented in Hollywood.\n\nPeople on social media loved the moment too.\n\nRita Moreno is a treasure and you should all please watch One Day At A Time. #SAGAwards \u2014 Allison Shoemaker (@allisonshoe) January 22, 2018\n\n10 minutes ago Nicole Kidman talked about women over 40 being \u201cviable\u201d. And then Rita Moreno, 86, swans out and basically says EXACTLY. #SAGAwards \u2014 Elaine L. (@LaineyGossip) January 22, 2018\n\nWe hope this moment will make Hollywood recognize how much Rita means to the world and how we need more people like her on the big screen.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=805628919563253&ev=PageView\r\n&noscript=1", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/somacro/facebook.png", "https://trc.taboola.com/1157996/log/3/unip?en=view_content", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21175322&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/hl_logo_b64fa010c5d3dfd30743481faf80f810.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2141896119462672&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/ritamoreno.jpg", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2016-12-06-at-1.44.55-PM-300x300.png", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/05/hl_logo_b64fa010c5d3dfd30743481faf80f810-500x68.png", "https://trc.taboola.com/1157996/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/somacro/twitter.png", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/simple-share-buttons-adder/buttons/somacro/pinterest.png"], "top_img": "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/ritamoreno.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hiplatina.com/rita-moreno-standing-ovation/", "title": "Rita Moreno's Standing Ovation At the SAG Awards Was So Deserving", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/themes/hiplatina/assets/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Rita Moreno wasn't there to accept an award but to present one.
