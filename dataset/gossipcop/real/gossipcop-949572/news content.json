Each week, she looks forward to seeing which cast member is involved in zany hi-jinks and crazy hookups. (Um, yeah, it\u2019s usually Paula for both of those.)\n\nHowever, The Ashley is often asked by readers how things worked on \u2018The Challenge\u2019 so she set out to find answers to your burning questions about the show. After a lot of research, The Ashley has finally managed to get some inside info on what it\u2019s like to be on this show!\n\nQ: How did MTV get the idea for \u2018The Challenge?\u2019\n\nA: According to Wikipedia, it all started back in the late-1990s when the casts of \u2018The Real World: Boston\u2019 and \u2018Road Rules: Islands\u2019 met while the \u2018Real World\u2019 cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cProducers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize. The intensely competitive challenge brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce yet another spin-off series.\u201d\n\nQ: How long does the Challenge actually last? How long are they in the house if they make it to the end?\n\nA: Cast member Katie Doyle has said many times on her twitter that those crazy kids are stuck in the house for about six weeks while filming, if they make it to the end.\n\nQ: Does MTV foot the bill when the cast mates go out on the town during the Challenges?\n\nA: \u201cBattle of the Exes\u201d cast member Priscilla Mendez told US Davis\u2019 newspaper The Auggie that MTV does not pay for the cast\u2019s recreational activities, and does not condone underage drinking. Of course, the \u2018Challenges\u2019 always take place in foreign countries, and oftentimes it\u2019s not illegal to drink in those country if you\u2019re under 21. Still, the cast members have to pay for their own drinks, nightclub admission, etc.\n\nQ: Are the cast members putting on an act for the cameras? Are they really that way in real life?\n\nA: \u201cI tell people if they\u2019ll lie, cheat, steal on a challenge it means to lie, cheat and steal in the real life. What I really think, and where I\u2019m getting at is, however you act on the Challenge for whatever extenuating circumstance, that\u2019s really how you are under pressure or not,\u201d Abram Boise told The Celebrity Caf\u00e9 in a recent interview.\n\nPriscilla Mendez agreed, telling The Auggie \u201cIt is impossible to fake your life for [that long.] What you see on the show is truly me.\u201d\n\nHowever, all of the cast members aren\u2019t party animals, despite how it may look. According to a reporter for Crushable.com that attended a reunion show taping in December 2010 and wrote about it, several of the cast members claim that MTV made them go out to clubs, even though all they wanted to do is stay home and rest. (Of course MTV didn\u2019t air that part of the interview!)\n\nQ: Do the cast members have to cook and clean for themselves?\n\nA: \u201cWe have\u2026maids that come in whenever we do a challenge which is about twice a week, and they do a really really good clean over,\u201d Cara Maria Sorbello said in a recent interview. \u201cThey do all of the dishes and the bathrooms and stuff.\u201d\n\nQ: Who has the record for participating in the most \u2018Challenges?\u2019\n\nA: If it seems like you always see the same faces on \u2018The Challenge,\u2019 you\u2019re right. MTV has done 22 seasons of \u2018The Challenge.\u2019 (It was previously called \u2018Real World/Road Rules Challenge\u2019 before MTV changed it to its current, much-snappier name!)\n\nDerrick Kosinski, Katie Doyle, Paula Meronek and Robin Hibbard have all competed in nine \u2018Challenges,\u2019 the most of any contestants.\n\nOf all the contestants ever to appear on \u2018The Challenge,\u2019 Darrell Taylor holds the record for most money earned from the show. In total he\u2019s raked in over $240,000 in prize money from winning \u2018The Challenges.\u2019 Kenny Santucci is a close second, having won over $236,000 from the shows.\n\nMost of these people don\u2019t have jobs (outside of MTV) and consider this their career. I find this creepy.\n\nQ: Why do the cast members do when they\u2019re not participating in challenges on the show?\n\nA: \u201cBattle of the Exes\u201d cast member Dustin Zito told The Celebrity Caf\u00e9 that the contestants have no outside communication whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThere is no radio, there\u2019s no Internet, phone to call home or anything,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely hard when you\u2019re there because of the lack of communication with the outside world and everything it entails it\u2019s extremely stressful.\u201d\n\nQ: Do the cast members know who will be on a Challenge and what the theme will be.\n\nA: Yes and no. The cast members all keep in close contact with each other so the word spreads quickly when the production company is casting for a new Challenge.\n\n\u201cBunim-Murray, they call like 40 people and then pick out of the 40,\u201d Cara Maria recently said in an interview with Ifelicious.com. \u201cThis time around [Battle of the Exes] they called everybody because they know that as soon as they call a few people, that we all call each other, and we\u2019re like \u2018Oh, we already figured out the theme.\u2019\n\nQ: Is it true that one of \u2018The Challenge\u2019 cast members is suing MTV?\n\nA: Yes! Read more about that here!\n\nGot a question about \u2018The Challenge\u2019 that you want The Ashley to find an answer to?
