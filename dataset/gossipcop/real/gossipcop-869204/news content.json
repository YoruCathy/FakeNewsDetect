In season seven of Game of Thrones, fans were no doubt gripped as they watched Sansa and her half-brother Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) argue over how to rule the North. While Jon was named King in the North, he quickly rode off to see Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and beg her to help fight the Night King (Vladimir Furdik). When Jon left Winterfell, Sansa took control and it seems like she may take the reigns a little more in the new series. Speaking of how her character takes on a more powerful role in season eight, Sophie explained: \u201cShe\u2019s used Littlefinger for all he has.\n\n\u201cAs she said, \u2018Thank you for all your lessons.\u2019 He has nothing left to give her. \u201cSo she is so empowered. She has a family behind her. She has Littlefinger, Cersei, Margaery, everyone\u2019s wisdom and teachings all behind her. \u201cShe\u2019s a real, try leader of Winterfell now.\u201d Sophie went on to tell Digital Spy: \u201cAnd that\u2019s where we first see her - as a very protective, empowered lady in charge. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time you ever see her like that, and it\u2019s so amazing to see her like that - kind of owning her destiny.\u201d\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Sansa Stark to BETRAY Jon?

It\u2019s certainly likely, especially when the Stark children find out that Jon is really Aegon Targaryen. Sansa, her sister Arya (Maisie Williams) and their brother Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright) all worked together to take down Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) in the series seven finale. Given that Sophie noted that she has her \u201cfamily behind her\u201d, it seems that the trio could team up so that the Stark family take control of the North while Jon fights alongside Daenerys. But will Jon survive without them?\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Sophie Turner stars as Sansa Stark\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Will the Starks betray Jon after he teamed up with Daenerys?", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/134870.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-04-19.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/990307.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/285x190/990013_1.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/285x190/990084_1.jpg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/990307.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Helen Kelly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/990307/Game-of-Thrones-season-8-spoilers-Sansa-Stark-Jon-Snow-Sophie-Turner-HBO-video", "title": "Game of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Sansa Stark to BETRAY Jon?
