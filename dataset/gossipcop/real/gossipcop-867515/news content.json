The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge along with their kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte will launch a charm offensive, arriving in Warsaw on July 17 for an official tour, Kensington Palace has confirmed.\n\nThe five-day trip, including a visit to Germany, is part of a campaign by the British government to draft members of the royal family as unofficial ambassadors during the recently-launched negotiations over Britain's exit from the European Union.\n\nAlthough Prince William visited Germany recently, this will be the first visit of the most popular royal family to Poland and the second time they conduct an official foreign visit with their two children.\n\nLast year, the family of four took a very successful tour of Canada.\n\nThe upcoming visit to Poland and Germany follows the royal couple's trip to Paris in March and that of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall to Romania, Italy and Austria earlier this year.\n\nThis time, though, the presence of the children adds an especially warm touch to a goodwill visit, even if they'll only be seen and photographed during arrivals to and departures from the two countries.\n\nThese will probably be one of their last visits as a family now that Prince George is enrolling at Thomas's Battersea school in South London in September and Princess Charlotte is expected soon to start nursery school.\n\nIn Poland, they'll be greeted by President Andrzej Duda and the First Lady. The tour will include a visit to the Warsaw Rising Museum, dedicated to the attempt by Poland's resistance movement to liberate Warsaw from Nazi occupation in 1944.\n\nThey'll meet veterans from the resistance and light candles in memory of those who died.\n\nTheir second day includes a visit to the Stutthof Concentration Camp, which was liberated by Allied Forces, and a meeting with five surviving prisoners.\n\nThey'll also visit the Gdansk shipyards, birthplace of Poland's Solidarity movement that helped topple Communist rule. It hasn\u2019t been confirmed if Lech Walesa, the leader of that peaceful movement and former president of the country will be present.\n\nPrince William\u2019s father Charles, the Prince of Wales, is a patron of the Gdansk Shakespeare Theatre and the Cambridges will attend a special performance there. It will be followed by a formal reception that will include Polish personalities from the country's business, arts, cultural and media.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/164a3ffadd42452d8811f3c941b3e20d/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/698453194/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5e4342aa817e8f02961bf8651d8b4563?s=400&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/696933922/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/696888628/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/696888628/640x434.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/a87f9d581b5743f29cbfdb7aa4bad538/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/61c36e52c7c0405198c47569a7d3639b/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/696888628/640x434.jpg?fit=scale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cecilia Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/07/07/prince-william-and-kate-middleton-taking-the-kids-on-a-charm-offensive-to-poland-and-germany/", "title": "Prince William And Kate Middleton Taking The Kids On A 'Charm Offensive' to Poland and Germany", "meta_data": {"referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "description": "Now entering into the complex Brexit negotiations, Britain is sending its most popular family to the European continent to highlight the ties that still bind.", "author": "Cecilia Rodriguez", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "prerender-status-code": "{{meta.code}}", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "og": {"title": "Prince William And Kate Middleton Taking The Kids On A 'Charm Offensive' to Poland and Germany", "site_name": "Forbes", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847/https://www.forbes.com/sites/ceciliarodriguez/2017/07/07/prince-william-and-kate-middleton-taking-the-kids-on-a-charm-offensive-to-poland-and-germany/", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/696888628/640x434.jpg?fit=scale", "type": "image/jpeg,image/gif,image/png"}, "description": "Now entering into the complex Brexit negotiations, Britain is sending its most popular family to the European continent to highlight the ties that still bind.", "updated_time": "2017-07-07T06:06:11-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/cecrodmay", "section": "Business", "section_url": "//www.forbes.com/business", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/1961-8185", "published": "2017-07-07", "modified": "2017-07-07"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@forbes", "title": "Prince William And Kate Middleton Taking The Kids On A 'Charm Offensive' to Poland and Germany", "description": "Now entering into the complex Brexit negotiations, Britain is sending its most popular family to the European continent to highlight the ties that still bind.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170707130847im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/696888628/640x434.jpg?fit=scale", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/Cecilia_stories"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499356800.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
