But the 17-year-old Sports Illustrated cover star has equally impressive skills when it comes to photobombing.\n\nKim joined Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show\" Wednesday night and was enlisted in pranking visitors at 30 Rock.\n\nFor the skit, unsuspecting fans were offered the chance to take pictures on an Olympic-themed medal podium. As the photographer's camera snapped, Kim, sporting the gold medal she won in Pyeongchang, and Fallon crept in to make goofy poses in the background \u2014 including one with Fallon in a blond wig and a knockoff gold medal.\n\nOnly after the pics were taken did the mischievous duo reveal themselves to the squealing delight of their victims. They then took proper photos with their fans.\n\nKim seemed as calm on national television as she did on the halfpipe. The California native, after all, is someone who went for \u2014 and landed \u2014 difficult back-to-back 1080s on her final run, despite having already secured the win. Why'd she do it?\n\n\"I knew I could do better,\" she explained on Wednesday's \"Tonight Show.\" \"I think I'm just really competitive with myself, so if I know I can do better I'm going to do everything I can to do the best I can.\"\n\nClearly, that extends to the art of photobombing, too.", "images":
