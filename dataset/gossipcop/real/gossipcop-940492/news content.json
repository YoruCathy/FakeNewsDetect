Nicole Kidman opened up about the miscarriages she suffered during her marriage to Tom Cruise in a candid new interview.\n\nThe Big Little Lies star, 50, understandably felt \u201cmassive grief\u201d upon miscarrying at 23 shortly after her 1990 wedding to Cruise due to an ectopic pregnancy, a condition in which the embryo begins developing in the fallopian tube rather than in the womb.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge, aching yearning. I know the yearning,\u201d Kidman told Talter magazine while covering their July 2018 issue. \u201cAnd the loss! The loss of a miscarriage is not talked about enough. That\u2019s massive grief to women.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Oscar winner and the Mission Impossible actor, 55, tried to conceive again, she lost the child around the time he filed for divorce in 2001.\n\nKidman previously reflected on the miscarriages in a November 2007 interview with Marie Claire.\n\n\u201cFrom the minute Tom and I were married, I wanted to have babies,\u201d she told the publication at the time. \u201cAnd we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And that \u2019s when it came that we would adopt Bella.\u201d\n\nKidman and Cruise adopted two children during their marriage, daughter Isabella, 25, and son Connor, 22. \u201cMy mother has an adopted sister, so it\u2019s been part of our family and I knew it would probably play out somewhere in mine,\u201d she continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would happen so early but it did.\u201d\n\nThe Australia actress, who remarried Keith Urban in 2006, has spoken candidly about her relationship with Cruise in the past. \u201cI was a baby when I married Tom,\u201d she told the Evening Standard in December 2015. \u201cI don\u2019t regret any of it, but out of respect for Keith, I tend not to discuss any of that now.\u201d\n\nKidman and Urban, 50, share two daughters, Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7. Following his split from the Grace of Monaco star, Cruise went on to wed Katie Holmes in 2006 but the duo famously divorced in 2012. They are parents to daughter Suri, 12.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/119470591_nicole-kidman-tom-cruise-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/119470591_nicole-kidman-tom-cruise-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/119470591_nicole-kidman-tom-cruise-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nicole-kidman-had-two-miscarriages-during-tom-cruise-marriage/", "title": "Nicole Kidman Had Two Miscarriages During Tom Cruise Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Nicole Kidman reflected on her relationship with Tom Cruise in a candid new interview and opened up about suffering two miscarriages during the marriage\u2014 see more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nicole Kidman Suffered Two Miscarriages During Tom Cruise Marriage", "description": "Nicole Kidman reflected on her relationship with Tom Cruise in a candid new interview and opened up about suffering two miscarriages during the marriage\u2014 see more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nicole-kidman-had-two-miscarriages-during-tom-cruise-marriage/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/119470591_nicole-kidman-tom-cruise-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/119470591_nicole-kidman-tom-cruise-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-31T17:11:02+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Nicole Kidman reflected on her relationship with Tom Cruise in a candid new interview and opened up about suffering two miscarriages during the marriage\u2014 see more", "title": "Nicole Kidman Suffered Two Miscarriages During Tom Cruise Marriage", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/119470591_nicole-kidman-tom-cruise-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527786662.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
