I kind of live in the moment. I don't think people in New York will annoy me, and I feel like when I go there, I'll meet lifelong friends. Stuff like that,' he added.\n\nI'm nervous, and my mum's upset about me leaving\n\nTwo words Brooklyn: Beer pong.\n\nGetty Images\n\nDespite his mother's anguish at her eldest child moving out, the British-born star admits his parents have always been supportive of his photography endeavours.\n\n'I do backstage photography at my mum's shows,' the teenager told the publication.\n\n'And I mean, I love doing it\u2014but my mum's like, \"Go take pictures of the models!\" and I'm a bit shy. So I kind of have to get the first two out of the way, and then I'm used to it,' he added, weeks after the release of his first photography book, What I See.\n\nBrooklyn's comments comes days after David Beckham's Instagram posts which show him building Harper a Disney princess castle.\n\nAfter pulling an all-nighter earlier this week to finish the project, David posted a snap of himself - topless - captioning the snap: '1am done... Someone's gonna have a nice surprise in the morning.'\n\nThis family is too cute right now.", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/26/2048x1024/landscape-1498640745-beckhams-photography.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/1600x800/landscape-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/32/1600x800/landscape-1502269202-davidbeckham-a.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/1600x800/landscape-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a37826/victoria-beckham-upset-brooklyn-beckham-university-new-york/", "title": "Victoria Beckham Is 'Upset' About Brooklyn Beckham Attending University In New York", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Victoria Beckham Is 'Upset' About Brooklyn Beckham Attending University In New York", "description": "Someone give her some tissues", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a37826/victoria-beckham-upset-brooklyn-beckham-university-new-york/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/1600x800/landscape-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-01 08:19:48", "published_time": "2017-08-16 03:26:00", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/1600x800/landscape-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Victoria Beckham Is \u2018Upset\u2019 About Brooklyn Beckham Attending University In New York", "description": "The mother-of-four is finding the prospect of her eldest son fleeing the nest difficult, according to Brooklyn", "keywords": "Victoria Beckham, Brooklyn, university, david beckham, son, family, new york, college", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/980x980/square-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,brooklyn beckham,Harper Beckham,david beckham,victoria beckham", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-16T15:26:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/1600x800/landscape-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/33/980x980/square-1502894870-brooklyn-victoria.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Victoria Beckham Is 'Upset' About Brooklyn Beckham Attending University In New York", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502825160.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
