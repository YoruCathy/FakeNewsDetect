{"url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a15925589/rose-mcgowan-citizen-rose-review/", "text": "There\u2019s a scene in the new docuseries Citizen Rose where Rose McGowan, the former actress turned activist/artist who says she was raped by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997, has just learned that Weinstein\u2019s people have gotten a hold of 125 pages of her new memoir, Brave.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out that the monster stole the first 125 pages of my book to discredit and destroy my voice, I can\u2019t tell you how violating it felt,\u201d she says in a voiceover as she paces, frenzied, around the room, her friend Tamara sitting by, quietly watching. \u201cIt was like being back in that room with him all over again, only this time it was the inside of my mind and not my body.\u201d\n\nThe objective of the project is to show and exalt McGowan specifically \u2014 and that might test some viewers\u2019 patience. But beneath the surface is where the audience can better understand the larger conversation McGowan is trying to move forward. For all who see themselves \u2014 personally, intimately, unexpectedly \u2014 in the #MeToo movement, it\u2019s often impossible to find the words for what these men have taken. She\u2019s offering up her own.\n\nThe objective of the project is to show and exalt McGowan specifically \u2014 and that might test some viewers' patience.\n\nThe 90-minute docuseries follows McGowan over the course of three months \u2014 from October, when the first accusations against Weinstein were published by the New York Times, to the Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit, to her experience in November learning that, through a published report by Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker, Weinstein had hired a private intelligence agency to spy on her.\n\nThroughout the documentary, Weinstein\u2019s name is scrambled and his face is obscured, only being referred to by McGowan as her \u201cmonster.\u201d The series premieres on the same day as the release of her memoir, where she explicitly details what she says Weinstein did to her at Sundance in 1997, never having formally shared her story as a result of accepting a settlement from Weinstein. There is biographical context throughout, establishing McGowan\u2019s youth growing up in a cult with a domineering father and a mother she says failed her. The viewer is invited to a Thanksgiving dinner at McGowan\u2019s brother James\u2019s house, and is witness to an uncomfortable confrontation with her mother, Terri, who McGowan consistently interrupts as the woman \u2014 who has also experienced abuse at the hands of men \u2014 tries to explain her feelings about the movement that McGowan has heralded.\n\nFor this reason, Citizen Rose can be frustrating to watch. While the documentary is clearly positioned as a focused piece on McGowan, the viewer yearns to hear from more women\u2019s voices in the ongoing battle against abuse of power that McGowan talks about. In occasions where the struggles of other women are introduced \u2014 in one scene, McGowan holds a conversation circle with women who were victims of domestic violence, without explaining who they are or why they are there \u2014 there is a centering on McGowan that feels ill-conceived. When McGowan says in the beginning of the documentary, \u201cDo I make you uncomfortable?\u201d one wonders if this is what she meant.\n\nBut, for all the moments where we are unsettled by reminders of McGowan\u2019s confidence in her own heroism, we are given equal chances to reflect on our own bristling toward it. There is no perfect activist. There is no blueprint for this watershed moment, the likes of which we have never seen before. The violation that McGowan, and so many other women, have lived through does not and could not ever come with an easy and seamless healing. In a way, that is what McGowan is trying to communicate with this documentary: her \u201cmonster\u201d robbed her of so much, and as a result, she was shut down, dismissed, and called crazy. Several times in the docuseries, we see McGowan spontaneously break into tears, and these moments shatter the viewer\u2019s heart. \u201cI got really interrupted, you have to understand,\u201d she says, crying to her mother. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to be me for seventeen years.\u201d\n\nThere is no blueprint for this watershed moment, the likes of which we have never seen before.\n\nMcGowan, as well, admits briefly in the documentary that there have been times when she went too far. After accusing actress Meryl Streep and others of hollow support of the movement by wearing black to the Golden Globes, McGowan apologized, saying, \u201cThere is no map for this road I\u2019m on, I will fuck up.\u201d In another instance, McGowan responded to James Corden\u2019s Weinstein joke at the AmfAR gala in October by suggesting you could replace \u201cwomen\u201d with the \u201cn-word,\u201d and it would feel the same. \u201cAnd, please, to anyone POC I offended with my stupidity lapse, know that I am profoundly sorry. I hear you,\u201d she tweeted. McGowan is learning in real time not only what it means to tell the truth and be heard, but how privilege, and sometimes ignorance, affords her the opportunity to do this in the first place. The docuseries is an opportunity for her to bring her experiences, voice, and truth to a larger audience.\n\nThe most powerful scene comes when Italian director Asia Argento \u2014 another one of Weinstein\u2019s outspoken accusers \u2014 talks to McGowan about what happened to her after she had been assaulted. \u201cI wish I was softer,\u201d Argento says. \u201cIt made me hard toward the world. It made me worse as a person.\u201d The pair cry together, and McGowan tells her, \u201cAsia, you are an incredibly brave soul. You have persevered. You have fought to be here.\u201d It\u2019s then that the message of the series truly permeates: women like Argento and McGowan, Tarana Burke and Suzette Wright, and countless unnamed others have persevered to tell the truth. No matter how uncomfortable and painful and messy it might be, we owe it to all of them to listen.\n\nFollow Dayna on Twitter and Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.\n\nCitizen Rose premieres tonight at 8 p.m. ET on E!.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meryl-streep-rose-mcgowan-1513704128.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-626363072-1517412424.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0705xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-626363072-1517412424.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0705xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dayna Evans"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a15925589/rose-mcgowan-citizen-rose-review/", "title": "Rose McGowan\u2019s Citizen Rose Will Rub Some People the Wrong Way.
