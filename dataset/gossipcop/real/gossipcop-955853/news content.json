She was 49.\n\nAlmost a week after PEOPLE confirmed Neilson\u2019s death, the reality star\u2019s family broke their silence on her passing.\n\n\u201cVery sadly, we have been informed that my sister Annabelle, died as a result of a heart attack at home last Thursday,\u201d sister Camila Neilson said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE at the time. \u201cIt has come as a complete shock, as she had many plans having recently returned from Spain.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents and I are devastated and shocked by this news,\u201d Camila continued. \u201cWe would ask the media to respect the privacy of our family and Annabelle\u2019s close friends during this very difficult time. We will not be making any further statement at this time. We thank you for your consideration.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc.

The death is not being treated as suspicious by police.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Annabelle Neilson\n\nFollowing Neilson\u2019s death, Moss shared a smiling throwback photo of herself and Neilson to Instagram with a simple but impactful caption: a red broken heart emoji.\n\nIn 2015, Neilson said of Moss in an interview with the Daily Mail, \u201cKate is my best mate and I love her like a sister. Yes, she\u2019s an icon but to me she\u2019s just Kate.\u201d She added that \u201cwe fight over stupid things, then we kiss and make up.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc94 A post shared by Kate Moss Agency (@katemossagency) on Jul 17, 2018 at 6:24am PDT\n\nA source told PEOPLE that Neilson\u2019s \u201cfriends and family\u201d were stunned by her sudden passing.\n\nThe source also said Neilson endured plenty of \u201chard times\u201d in her life, most notably the 2010 suicide of her best friend, designer Alexander McQueen \u2014 \u201cshe was rocked by his death\u201d \u2014 and a horse riding accident five years ago that left her in agony. (\u201cCoping with the pain was horrific,\u201d said the source.)\n\nUltimately, the source said Neilson \u201chad a lot of private pain that she kept from others.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Provided by TIME Inc. Annabelle Neilson with Ladies of London costars Caroline Fleming, Marissa Hermer, Caroline Stanbury, Juliet Angus and Julie Montagu\n\nNeilson also previously struggled with a heroin addiction. She told the Daily Mail in 2015 that her addiction began when she was attacked by a man at the age of 16, \u201ctied to a tree and continually beaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cI managed to escape with my life but I needed reconstructive surgery because my face was so disfigured,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that, I fell into a serious depression and became a heroin addict because it provided an escape bubble and was the only way I could cope.\u201d", "images": ["https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB12QJO9.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=599&y=221",
