A body language expert has analysed the two couples in the same scenario and gave her professional opinion on how they differ. Judi James looked at images both couples kissing at the polo as the princes received awards. She claimed while the kisses are very different, this may have been inspired by the same women, the late Princess Diana. \u201cBoth boys grew up with a hugely loving and tactile role-model in Diana, but they might each have taken away totally different lessons that they now apply to their married life displays,\u201d Judi said.\n\nFor Harry and Meghan though there is a much more 'celebrity' approach to their PDAs Judi James\n\nAccording to the body language expert, spontaneous body language and risk-taking behaviours are not a feature of either William or Kate's public profile. She said: \u201cWilliam has always been appropriately cautious for a man who is heir to the throne and his non-verbal behaviour since his teens often signals more introvert traits, in direct contrast to his extrovert, risk-taking younger brother Harry. \u201cHarry seems happy to mimic his mother's trait of public displays of hugs and affection William might have grown up more aware of the potential risks involved.\u201d Kate Middleton and Prince William\u2019s kiss William avoids the \u201croyal soap opera signals that made Diana the victim of too much press attention\u201d Judi claimed. \u201cHis kiss with Kate at polo is suitably cautious and free of any open displays of emotion beyond general happiness.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry kiss vs Kate Middleton and William\u2019s analysed by expert\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry: Couple opt to kiss one another on the lips\n\n\u201cHe leans in for his kiss rather than touching torsos and he even holds his award high up next to his ribs to ensure the spatial gap between them is more the 'friendship' variety rather than 'lovers\u2019.\u201d However, his wife Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, seems to have the same attitude as her husband, with the pair perfectly in tune. \u201cKate responds in a complementary way with her hand laid firmly but politely on his shoulder. \u201cWe have to look at the subtler tie-signs to see evidence of the love that obviously exists between then two of them,\u201d Judi said. \u201cTheir mirrored smiles with Kate's cheeks rounded in an apple shape show genuine fun and delight at being together and Kate seems to chat while William grins happily.\u201d\n\nKate Middleton and William: Risk-taking behaviours are not a feature couple's public profile\n\nRoyal Wedding kiss in pictures: Charles and Diana to Meghan and Harry Mon, May 21, 2018 The heartwarming tradition captured in beautiful pictures.
