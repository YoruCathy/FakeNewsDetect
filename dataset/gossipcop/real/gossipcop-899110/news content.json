She said that the three of them spent a Sunday walking around Manhattan. Then they all went to Mr. Hoffman\u2019s hotel room to wait for Ms. Thomas\u2019s parents to pick her up, she told Variety.\n\nAfter Karina left, Mr. Hoffman took a shower and emerged with a towel wrapped around him, \u201cwhich he dropped,\u201d Ms. Thomas told Variety. \u201cHe was standing there naked. I think I almost collapsed, actually. It was the first time I had ever seen a naked man. I was mortified. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nShe said Mr. Hoffman eventually put on a robe, sat on the bed, and asked her to massage his feet. She complied.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do in the circumstance,\u201d Ms. Thomas told Variety. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that I could say no, so I did it. And he kept telling me, \u2018I\u2019m naked. Do you want to see?\u2019 \u201d Eventually the phone rang \u2014 it was her mother, who had arrived at the hotel to pick her up, she said.\n\nMs. Thomas, the daughter of the Liberian ambassador to the United Nations at the time, said she did not tell her mother what had happened until decades later. She said she told close friends and a family member some years later.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christine Hauser"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/dustin-hoffman-sexual-misconduct.html", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Dustin Hoffman of Sexual Misconduct, Variety Reports", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-12-15T21:33:38.000Z", "modified": "2017-12-16T00:32:53.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/christine-hauser", "tag": "#MeToo Movement", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005607229, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/41c659a1-6eb9-5178-a39a-00885e5cb7d2", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/60b32251a28e4262bed833953504f80a", "description": "The allegations included encounters in a car, a recording studio and a hotel room, where he allegedly exposed himself to a teenager.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Christine Hauser", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Dustin Hoffman,Sexual harassment,Actor,Variety,MeToo Movement", "pdate": 20171215, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/dustin-hoffman-sexual-misconduct.html", "type": "article", "title": "Three More Women Accuse Dustin Hoffman of Sexual Misconduct, Variety Reports", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/arts/16xp-hoffman/merlin_131314730_468658ce-7a97-4bcc-b0cf-7bac0e354296-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Dustin Hoffman at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year.
