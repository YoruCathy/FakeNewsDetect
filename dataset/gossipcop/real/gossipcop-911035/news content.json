Tension, especially for a sitcom, was high from the start, with both characters being \u201cextremely flawed,\u201d says co-creator and executive producer Gemma Baker.\n\n\u201cI think people assume we started \u2018Mom\u2019 with a desire to do a show about a mother-and-daughter relationship, but our starting place, as I remember it, was actually the word \u2018redemption,\u2019\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe loved the idea that you would be able to watch characters completely turn their lives around over the course of the series. The whole point of \u2018Mom\u2019 was to make a show that would give people hope.\u201d\n\nIn order to be successful in such a grand endeavor, the series in many ways was going to live or die by its casting.\n\nFaris had been in the comedy world since she helped the Wayans brothers launch the \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise in 2000, but her resume read much heavier in film titles than television ones. In 2004 she had a recurring guest-star arc on the final season of Warner Bros. mega-hit \u201cFriends\u201d and then she went on to play a version of herself in HBO\u2019s Hollywood-set bro-comedy \u201cEntourage.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until she booked \u201cMom\u201d in 2013 that she nabbed her first starring television comedy role.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about Anna as a human being that makes you care and root for her. You want her to succeed in life,\u201d says co-creator and executive producer Chuck Lorre. \u201cShe\u2019s a very skilled actress and she can do comedy and she can do the dramatic moments and she can do slapstick and the whole range of acting. But beyond that, just [as a] person [she] is very empathetic.\u201d\n\nFaris was the first person cast when CBS ordered the pilot into production for the 2013-14 television season. She booked the role of Christy Plunkett at the end of January, and with one of two major roles down, producers then turned to finding someone who would balance \u2014 and also have natural chemistry with \u2014 Faris for the role of her mother.\n\nJanney certainly wasn\u2019t a stranger to comedy in 2013 \u2014 she had appeared in such roles in films including \u201cDrop Dead Gorgeous\u201d and \u201c10 Things I Hate About You,\u201d as well as in guest-star spots on sitcoms including \u201cFrasier.\u201d But she was certainly better known for her dramatic turns \u2014 namely her Emmy-winning performance as CJ Cregg in \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 when she booked the role of Bonnie later that same January.\n\n\u201cAllison Janney is one of our great actresses, for whatever the requirement might be \u2014 she\u2019s the master of the craft,\u201d Lorre says. \u201cShe connected with Anna on a very deep level that created a team, that created a unit. They became a comedic team and when the comedy was put aside and the moments were being played just for what they were, it was something special and you could feel it when you were watching.\u201d\n\nFaris and Janney may not necessarily resemble each other physically, but the relationship they have developed certainly defines family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been in awe of her,\u201d Faris says of Janney. \u201cFrom the first season, we always had this kindred spirit element about us. We would hang out after work all the time, we\u2019d get to work early to just decompress or go over lines. We\u2019re incredibly close, and I learn from her. Whenever we have a scene that\u2019s just the two of us, it feels like this incredible dance partnership because we can anticipate each other\u2019s moves. I\u2019m so lucky and fortunate, and I couldn\u2019t love her more. I don\u2019t know what I would do without her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe loved the idea that you would be able to watch characters completely turn their lives around over the course of the series. The whole point of \u2018Mom\u2019 was to make a show that would give people hope.\u201d\n\nGemma Baker\n\nJanney says that everyone already knew Faris was \u201chysterically funny,\u201d but now they have learned she is gifted dramatically as well.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning she has made such brave emotional choices, and over time I think she has really begun to trust herself in that area and take more risks,\u201d Janney says. \u201cWorking with her this closely and this long has been one of the best parts of doing this show.\u201d\n\nAt times, some of the humor on \u201cMom\u201d comes from the women taking jabs at each other and their checkered history, but they also provide many more tender, serious and heartwarming moments, too. It is this balance that has become the quintessential tone for the show.\n\n\u201cI have always felt that one of the reasons that the show works is because of how much Anna and Allison love each other in real life,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThat love and respect comes through even when Christy and Bonnie are fighting, and it\u2019s what makes those scenes enjoyable to watch.\u201d", "images":
