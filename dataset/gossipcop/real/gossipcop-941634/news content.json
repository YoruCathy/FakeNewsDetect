(At least for the time being, anyway.)\n\nIHOP changed its name to IHOb this week as the company aims to advertise for its new selection of burgers \u2013 a shift for the sit-down chain known for its breakfasts. The pancake house is now selling what it calls \u201cUltimate Steakburgers\u201d \u2014 a menu item so monumental, it seems, that it warranted a name change \u201cfor the time being,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBurgers are a quintessential, American menu item so it makes perfect sense that IHOP, one of the most iconic, all-American comfort-food brands in the world, would go over the top to create a delicious line-up of quality burgers that hit the spot any time of day,\u201d said Chef Nevielle Panthaky, Head of Culinary at the restaurant chain, in a statement about the name change.\n\nIHOP \u2014 er, IHOb \u2014 has gone all-in on the name change in terms of its online marketing platforms before the \u201cb\u201d in the new name was revealed. On social media, the brand ditched the @IHOP twitter handle for @IHOb. On its website, the company featured a countdown clock for when the \u201cb\u201d would be revealed. Twitter users also shared images of the signage changing at locations around the country to \u201cIHOb.\u201d \u201cThey weren\u2019t playing,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n\n(To be clear, the lower-case \u201cb\u201d is used instead of a capitalized one to elicit the image of a \u201cP\u201d flipping over and turning into a \u201cb.\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine the new name could be permanent, as the nearly 60-year-old restaurant chain is best known for its pancakes and breakfast menu items. And, for what it\u2019s worth, the company is still publicly traded under IHP. The promotional tactic, as the company said, is used to draw attention to the new burgers (which, for $6.95, can come with unlimited fries and soda).\n\nPancake patrons need not worry, however. It doesn\u2019t seem like any of the restaurant chain\u2019s original items will be changed or replaced as a result of the new burgers.", "images": ["https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://time.com/img/navigation/subscribe-icon.svg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ihopnationalpancakeday-em-161192899.jpg?quality=85"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ihopnationalpancakeday-em-161192899.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas"], "canonical_link": "https://money.com/ihop-name-change-ihob-burgers/", "title": "Here's Why IHOP Is Changing Its Name to IHOb (for Now)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Food &amp; Drink,onetime", "news_keywords": "Food &amp; Drink,onetime", "description": "IHOP changed its name to IHOb (International House of Burgers) to promote its new steak burgers.", "og": {"title": "Here's Why IHOP Is Changing Its Name to IHOb (for Now)", "type": "article", "site_name": "Money", "url": "https://money.com/ihop-name-change-ihob-burgers/", "description": "International House of Pancakes no more.", "image": {"identifier": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ihopnationalpancakeday-em-161192899.jpg?quality=85", "width": 1024, "height": 718}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://money.com/ihop-name-change-ihob-burgers/", "description": "IHOP changed its name to IHOb (International House of Burgers) to promote its new steak burgers.", "media": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ihopnationalpancakeday-em-161192899.jpg?quality=85"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://money.com/ihop-name-change-ihob-burgers/", "title": "Here's Why IHOP Is Changing Its Name to IHOb (for Now)", "description": "International House of Pancakes no more.", "site": "@MONEY", "image": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/ihopnationalpancakeday-em-161192899.jpg?quality=85"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 119930514707114}, "google-site-verification": "5w1rl4iwAR7kN1jfJEXz5hqEVP7X_HAasGoC7R_LpDE"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xao_G1BzPI"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
