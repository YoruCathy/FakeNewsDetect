Khlo\u00e9 shared a series of cryptic tweets on Sunday, sounding off on the matter.\n\n\u201cPeople spend too much time finding other people to blame, too much energy finding excuses for not being what they are capable of being,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPeople these days are focused so much on someone else\u2019s life instead of their own.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian Leaves Tristan Thompson\u2019s Name Off Her Anniversary Card For Kimye\n\nThe 33-year-old reality star went on to seemingly criticize the hypocrisy in people sharing advice to her family on social media despite not personally knowing them.\n\n\u201cThey love to give advice but are not living the advice that they are offering. Most of the ones giving advice are in no place to give anything at all,\u201d she continued. \u201cFocus on your own world. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s cracks there that need your attention. We all got em.\u201d\n\n\u201cMisery loves company,\u201d she added. \u201cPeople can\u2019t stand for someone else to flourish and be happy. Nowadays people thrive off one\u2019s downfall rather than their success. Sadly.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian Fires Back At Critics Who Say She\u2019s \u2018Focusing Too Much\u2019 On Her Post-Baby Body\n\nKhlo\u00e9 hasn\u2019t been shy about clapping back at the haters since returning to social media one month after giving birth to her daughter, True. Last week, the \u201cRevenge Body\u201d host ranted on Snapchat after being mom-shamed for hitting the gym too soon in an effort to get her pre-baby body back.\n\nWhile she kept the meaning behind her tweets vague, Khlo\u00e9 later hinted that they were unrelated to her complicated relationship with Tristan Thompson.\n\n\u201cWild that people assume you\u2019re speaking about something and they run with it. Anything and everything gets twisted into something it\u2019s completely not. Lord, I\u2019m remembering how much I loved my social media break,\u201d she wrote.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 always keeps it real.", "images": ["https://static.accessonline.com/uploads/assets/articles/bc-9170079953604220.jpg", "https://www.accessonline.com/articles/khloe-kardashian-claps-back-people-giving-advice-after-tristan-thompson-cheating-scandal-series-cryptic-tweets/assets/images/logo-gray-1.png"], "top_img": "https://static.accessonline.com/uploads/assets/articles/bc-9170079953604220.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.accessonline.com/articles/khloe-kardashian-claps-back-people-giving-advice-after-tristan-thompson-cheating-scandal-series-cryptic-tweets", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Claps Back At People \u2018Giving Advice\u2019 After Tristan Thompson Cheating Scandal In A Series Of Cryptic Tweets", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "tp": {"EnableExternalController": "true"}, "fb": {"pages": 162290915432}, "google-site-verification": "TkPbHnf5fGyE6vrIQcUc5hATUn1xbAXICAeDmJ7TtsM", "msvalidate.01": "925622343B9488A94BAEAC1029ED5D78", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is over the unsolicited advice.
