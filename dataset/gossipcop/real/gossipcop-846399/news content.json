I was supposed to go in and work at three and I said, \u2018I have to go. I have to go meet Kylie Jenner.\u2019 I don\u2019t care if I get fired.\u201d\n\nFor those that don\u2019t get the hype, Andrea Espin explains.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just excited because it has never come to stores. It\u2019s always online and it\u2019s really hard to get them at times so for her to have them at Ulta, it\u2019s really amazing for all of us.\u201d\n\nJenner\u2019s supporters say there\u2019s a reason the 21-year-old is worth almost a billion dollars.\n\n\u201cThe cool thing about her, like I said, her lip kits that it comes with a lip liner and her full lipstick, it makes just the lips look a little like big in a way.\n\nJenner\u2019s best friend and make-up collaborator Jordyn Woods said the love they receive is overwhelming.\n\nWoods said, \u201cIt\u2019s just the internet comes to real life and you get to feel the love and see everyone in real life, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\nTravis Scott also wrapped an unforgettable weekend in Houston.\n\nHis sold out Astroworld Festival on Saturday received rave reviews, he opened an already popular Astroworld pop-up shop in Rice Village selling merchandise.\n\nOn Sunday, his acheivements were recognized by the city.\n\n\u201cFor I, Sylvester turner, mayor of the city of Houston hereby proudly proclaim November 18, 2018 as Astroworld Day/Travis Scott Day in the city of Houston.\u201d\n\nScott dedicates his accomplishments to the city he loves.\n\n\u201cI grew up here my whole life. I was inspired by Astroworld in 05 when they took it away,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt kind of took a big piece of my heart away. I didn\u2019t have anywhere to go.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s now a hometown hero giving the world a piece of Houston through his music.", "images": ["https://cdn.tegna-media.com/wbir/assets/khou-votenow-live-survey-352x52.jpg", "https://www.khou.com/Content/logos/dark/khou.png", "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "https://cdn.tegna-media.com/wbir/assets/verify-352x52.jpg", "https://www.khou.com/content/logos/mobile/khou.png", "https://cdn.tegna-media.com/wbir/assets/coronavirus-facts-not-fear-352x52.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Author", "David Gonzalez", "Published", "Pm Cst November", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.khou.com/article/news/entertainment-news/travis-scott-kylie-jenner-wrap-up-huge-weekend-in-houston/285-615728636", "title": "Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner wrap up huge weekend in Houston", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1170", "site": "khou.com", "fb": {"app_id": 1981419195445082}, "og": {"site_name": "KHOU", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.khou.com/article/news/entertainment-news/travis-scott-kylie-jenner-wrap-up-huge-weekend-in-houston/285-615728636", "title": "Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner wrap up huge weekend in Houston", "description": "On Sunday, Mayor Sylvester Turner declared it \"Astroworld Day\" in Houston to recognize Scott and the debut of the Astroworld Festival.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "11/19/2018 12:18:52 AM"}}, "description": "On Sunday, Mayor Sylvester Turner declared it \"Astroworld Day\" in Houston to recognize Scott and the debut of the Astroworld Festival.", "category": "news", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"title": "Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner wrap up huge weekend in Houston", "image": {"src": "https://media.khou.com/assets/KHOU/images/615729045/615729045_360x203.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "site": "KHOU", "description": "On Sunday, Mayor Sylvester Turner declared it \"Astroworld Day\" in Houston to recognize Scott and the debut of the Astroworld Festival.", "domain": "www.khou.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542557932.0, "source": "https://www.khou.com", "summary": ""}
