The 35-year-old actress has given birth to her first child, a baby boy, with her fianc\u00e9, Jesse Plemons, her rep confirms to Us Weekly.\n\nUs exclusively revealed in December that Dunst and Plemons, 29, were expecting. She confirmed the news the following month by cradling her baby bump in a stunning photo shoot for Rodarte\u2019s Fall-Winter 2018 lookbook.\n\nThe Spider-Man actress and the Friday Night Lights alum started dating in 2016 after meeting on the season 2 set of the FX series Fargo, where they played a married couple named Peggy and Ed Blumquist. They became engaged in January 2017.\n\nPrior to welcoming her new bundle of joy, Dunst opened up about wanting to expand her family. \u201cI\u2019m at a stage in my life where I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ve been working since I was 3. It\u2019s time to have babies and chill,\u2019\u201d she said in the July 2017 issue of Marie Claire U.K.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those \u2018I need a baby!\u2019 people until my goddaughter was born. I love her so much,\u201d the Golden Globe nominee continued at the time. \u201cThat love is just like \u2026 you can\u2019t experience that unless you have a kid. I put her to bed last night and she woke up this morning and said to her mom, \u2018Where\u2019s Kiki?\u2019 I just love that love. That\u2019s what I want.\u201d\n\nThe new parents are set to tie the knot this spring in Austin, Texas.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/689816324_kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/689816324_kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-zoom.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/689816324_kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kirsten-dunst-gives-birth-to-first-child-with-jesse-plemons/", "title": "Kirsten Dunst Gives Birth to First Child With Jesse Plemons", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kirsten Dunst gave birth to her first child with her fiance, Jesse Plemons \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kirsten Dunst Welcomes First Child With Jesse Plemons", "description": "Kirsten Dunst gave birth to her first child with her fiance, Jesse Plemons \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kirsten-dunst-gives-birth-to-first-child-with-jesse-plemons/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-08T16:27:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/689816324_kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/689816324_kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-05-08T11:20:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-08T16:27:26+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kirsten Dunst gave birth to her first child with her fiance, Jesse Plemons \u2014 get the details", "title": "Kirsten Dunst Welcomes First Child With Jesse Plemons", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/689816324_kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525778412.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
