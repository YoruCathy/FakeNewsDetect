Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec were thrown a lavish baby shower on Saturday, March 31, where they also revealed the gender of their twins!\n\nThe Shark Tank star, 55, and Johnson shared the exciting news \u2014 that they are expecting a baby boy and a baby girl \u2014 by popping two big black balloons that held smaller pink and blue balloons and confetti. The sweet moment was captured by one of their guests, BP Major, who wrote, \u201cGenders are revealed!!!! So excited. Congratulations to @robert_herjavec and @kymherjavec5678 \u2013 love you both\u201d with dancing man emojis. Other guests in attendance included the Dancing With the Stars alum\u2019s friends and costars, Cheryl Burke and Anna Trebunskaya.\n\nThe host of the party, Carson Kressley, shared a sweet photo with Johnson that he hilariously captioned, \u201cOne of us is pregnant!\u201d The Queer Eye for the Straight Guy alum, who was once a contestant on DWTS, decorated the party with pretty displays of pink and blue hydrangeas. Guests were treated to an impressive layout of pastries that were also surrounded by blue and pink details.\n\nAs previously reported, Johnson and Herjavec, who met when they were paired together on season 20 of the ABC series and married in 2016, announced they were expecting in December 2017. Throughout her pregnancy, the professional dancer, 41, has been documenting her journey by sharing photos of her baby bump on her social media accounts.\n\nThis was not the only party thrown in honor of the couple. In January, Herjavec threw his wife a baby shower in her native Australia, where she celebrated with family and friends.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-baby-shower-gender-reveal-carson-kressley.jpg?crop=7px%2C215px%2C877px%2C460px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-baby-shower-gender-reveal-carson-kressley.jpg?w=240", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-baby-shower-gender-reveal-carson-kressley.jpg?crop=7px%2C215px%2C877px%2C460px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-reveal-twins-gender-at-baby-shower/", "title": "Kym Johnson, Robert Herjavec Reveal Twins\u2019 Gender at Baby Shower", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec were thrown a lavish baby shower by Carson Kressley, where they also revealed the gender of their twins \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Find Out the Sexes of Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec\u2019s Twins!", "description": "Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec were thrown a lavish baby shower by Carson Kressley, where they also revealed the gender of their twins \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-reveal-twins-gender-at-baby-shower/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-01T14:01:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-baby-shower-gender-reveal-carson-kressley.jpg?crop=7px%2C215px%2C877px%2C460px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-baby-shower-gender-reveal-carson-kressley.jpg?crop=7px%2C215px%2C877px%2C460px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-01T13:59:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-01T14:01:16+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec were thrown a lavish baby shower by Carson Kressley, where they also revealed the gender of their twins \u2014 find out more", "title": "Find Out the Sexes of Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec\u2019s Twins!", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-baby-shower-gender-reveal-carson-kressley.jpg?crop=7px%2C215px%2C877px%2C460px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522591144.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
