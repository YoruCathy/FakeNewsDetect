The images, posted side-by-side by the actress to Instagram, feature Heigl lounging in the tub while the musician wears a headband and holds a drink staring at the camera.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cA few things have changed since then,\u201d said Heigl of the decade-plus since the first snap was taken. \u201cI quit smoking, thank God! I\u2019ve put on a few pounds. I don\u2019t often do spontaneously weird things like take random bathtub photos in the middle of the night anymore. But what hasn\u2019t changed, is that burning desire in me to be with this man.\u201d\n\nThe Grey\u2019s Anatomy alum, 39, admitted that their relationship wasn\u2019t picture perfect.\n\n\u201cI gotta be honest. There have been moments where I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it. Where I wanted to take my pillow and smother him in the middle of the night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what. The more time I spend with this guy the more deeply I begin to understand that he is the best of me. When the whole world falls into disarray and nothing makes sense to me he is my shelter, my safe harbor. When self doubt and self loathing creep into my soul he is my champion, my number one fan.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Katherine Heigl Celebrates Mother\u2019s Day Early by Sharing Pics of Her Three Kids\n\nHeigl continued, \u201cHe has bolstered my spirits more times than I can count and he has led me through the darkness back into the light even more times than that. In quiet moments of reflection I feel an overwhelming gratitude that I married this man.\u201d\n\nThe star went on to gush about her husband\u2019s incredible parenting skills, sense of humor and confident attitude.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person who\u2019s met him that doesn\u2019t love him and I get to call him mine. He makes me better in every way by loving me and believing in me and for never giving up on me,\u201d she concluded. \u201cSo here\u2019s to 10, 20, 40 more years of us! I love you @joshbkelley more than you can probably imagine and then some!\u201d\n\nImage zoom Josh Kelley and Katherine Heigl Mike Coppola/WireImage\n\nEarlier this week, Heigl reflected on the difficult delivery of her son, Joshua Bishop Jr., in honor of his first birthday, where she also gave her hubby a sweet shout out.\n\nShe said Kelley witnessed their son take his first breath and that she \u201cthanked the heavens for his breath, his life and for making me a mother three times over.\u201d\n\nHeigl is also mother to daughters Nancy Leigh, 9, and Adalaide Marie Hope, 5\u2026but her brood may grow again.\n\n\u201cI still want more children,\u201d she told PEOPLE for a February cover story. \u201cI\u2019d get pregnant again, and I still am very inspired by adoption. I also have been thinking a lot about fostering.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1152&h=603&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatherine-heigl2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatherine-heigl2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fkatherine-heigl-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1152&h=603&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatherine-heigl2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/katherine-heigl-josh-kelley-recreate-royal-tenenbaum-pic-10th-wedding-anniversary/", "title": "Katherine Heigl and Husband Celebrate 10th Anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Katherine Heigl,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Couples,Katherine Heigl,News,TV", "description": "It's been 10 years since Josh Kelley and Katherine Heigl tied the knot, but the actress says she still feels \"that burning desire in me to be with this man\"", "og": {"title": "Katherine Heigl and Husband Celebrate 10th Anniversary", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/katherine-heigl-josh-kelley-recreate-royal-tenenbaum-pic-10th-wedding-anniversary/", "description": "Ten years and three kids later, Katherine Heigl&nbsp;and husband Josh Kelley still get silly.
