It's fine!\" Mel B yelled immediately. \"It's fine.\"\n\nGuest host Ken Jeong comforted the concerned performers, explaining that, even though things didn't go flawlessly, it was clear how skilled they really are.\n\n\"This is not America's Got Perfection, it's America's Got Talent!\" Jeong shared. \"Nobody can do this. I mean, it's OK!\"\n\n\"I don't think there's ever been a singer on any of our competitions who's been note-perfect,\" Simon Cowell said, reiterating Jeong's remarks. \"It doesn't make them not amazing, it makes them human.\"\n\n\"Although the consequences of this are slightly worse than falling off-key, whereas you nearly broke your neck,\" Cowell added. \"And the fact that you're nearly blind makes this incredible.\"\n\nWhile the pair were understandably concerned that their mishap could spell the end of their AGT journey, they were overwhelmed when they were told they'd be moving on to the live rounds at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.\n\n\"It means so much to us,\" Mary said through tears. \"It's been such a long road to get here, and to be through to the live shows means we're one step closer to the dream.\"\n\nAmerica's Got Talent returns for its second night of Judge Cuts next Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'America's Got Talent': Goth Comedian Brought to Tears When All the Judges Love His Set\n\nInspiring Young 'America's Got Talent' Singer Dishes on Getting Golden Buzzer From Mel B (Exclusive)\n\n'America's Got Talent': Simon Cowell Promises to Buy Young Contestant a Dog After He Nails Audition\n\nRelated Articles:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mJywhJNpiibX8wJ4MiLSNg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ea25387ae141f4e3b620534ad4bc3ed", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7w4QXLv56rGku_oH3e5GEQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-03-12/5d3d7a20-25f7-11e8-a583-35df99676a72_et.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRfhUtPsOATyJENKXv.x_Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ea25387ae141f4e3b620534ad4bc3ed", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/87x.dUPdZ.nkxbFzTyrE1w--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtweW9mZj0wO3c9MjcyO2g9MTQ0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/3a844590-8108-11ea-9fbf-f3a8c1dc8471"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRfhUtPsOATyJENKXv.x_Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ea25387ae141f4e3b620534ad4bc3ed", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/apos-america-apos-got-talent-030356778.html", "title": "'America's Got Talent': Husband & Wife Trapeze Stunt Gone Wrong Shocks Audience", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Things didn't go according to plan on Tuesday's 'AGT' when one dangerous stunt led to a terrifying mishap.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRfhUtPsOATyJENKXv.x_Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ea25387ae141f4e3b620534ad4bc3ed", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRfhUtPsOATyJENKXv.x_Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ea25387ae141f4e3b620534ad4bc3ed"}, "title": "'America's Got Talent': Husband & Wife Trapeze Stunt Gone Wrong Shocks Audience"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Simon Cowell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=03f2784a-e5fa-3ba8-858b-174590007205&src=web", "description": "Things didn't go according to plan on Tuesday's 'AGT' when one dangerous stunt led to a terrifying mishap.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZRfhUtPsOATyJENKXv.x_Q--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/0ea25387ae141f4e3b620534ad4bc3ed", "description": "Things didn't go according to plan on Tuesday's 'AGT' when one dangerous stunt led to a terrifying mishap.", "title": "'America's Got Talent': Husband & Wife Trapeze Stunt Gone Wrong Shocks Audience", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/apos-america-apos-got-talent-030356778.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 73756409831, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=03f2784a-e5fa-3ba8-858b-174590007205&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=03f2784a-e5fa-3ba8-858b-174590007205&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531883036.0, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
