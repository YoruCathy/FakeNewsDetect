But we didn\u2019t talk about her identity as a black person.\"\n\nThat changed after the first season.\n\n\"[Since then] the writers have become more and more willing to deal with race,\" Washington continued. \"When Olivia was kidnapped, it was not lost on me that the fictional president of the United States was willing to go to war to save one black woman at a time when hundreds of black women were missing in Nigeria and we were begging the world to pay attention. Shonda [Rhimes, the show's creator] was saying, 'The life of a black woman matters.'\"\n\n\"Scandal\" is now in its sixth season. As for how much longer Washington will play Pope, she said it's up to Rhimes.\n\n\"Shonda has said from the beginning that she kind of knows how it ends. So I\u2019m trusting her to guide the arc,\" the 40-year-old actress said. \"It's also important for me to do other work -- and playing Olivia gave me the opportunity to become a producer. The charge of my production company, Simpson Street, is to tell stories that are about people, places and situations that may not always be considered by the mainstream. Inclusivity is not about, you know, creating a world where straight white men have no voice; it\u2019s about creating a world where we all have a voice. So I\u2019m excited to start that new journey, as a producer.\"\n\nWashington already uses her voice to speak on behalf of civil rights, LGBTQ individuals and women's issues.\n\n\"That idea of holding each other\u2019s hands at the Women\u2019s March -- it feels like we are being invited to do that every day,\" she said in Los Angeles at the Women's March in January. \"So many of us are feeling attacked, whether it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right to choose or headstones in a Jewish cemetery, immigrants being deported or banned. So many of us feel the need to protect and defend our democracy. And march toward the dream of being 'We the people.' So that\u2019s exciting, scary, and frustrating. We\u2019re awake. We are awake more than ever before, and we have to stay awake.\"\n\nThe mother of 2-year-old daughter Isabelle and infant son Caleb, with husband Nnamdi Asomugha, is partly motivated by making the world better for them.\n\n\"My deepest desire is to create a world where there\u2019s room for all of us, where no matter who you are, you get to wake up in the morning and know that you are worthwhile and deserving,\" Washington said. \"If that\u2019s the world I want to live in, I have to do the work to make that true for me. I have to do the work of self-love and affirmation, and say, 'I am a woman, I am a person of color, I am the granddaughter of immigrants, I am also the descendant of slaves, I am a mother, I am an entrepreneur, I am an artist, and I\u2019m joyful.' And maybe in seeing my joy, you can finish your sentence with, 'And I am joyful too.'\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP-Kerry-Washington-MEM-170404_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/AP-Kerry-Washington-MEM-170404_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Luchina Fisher", "April", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kerry-washington-scandal-character-olivia-pope-changed/story?id=46569420", "title": "Kerry Washington on how her 'Scandal' character Olivia Pope has changed her", "meta_data": {"description": "Washington has played Pope on ABC's \"Scandal\" for six seasons.", "keywords": "kerry washington", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
