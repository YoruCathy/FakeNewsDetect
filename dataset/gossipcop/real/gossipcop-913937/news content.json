Wearing a cheerleader-inspired look from the brand, the brunette teen looked more grown up than ever.\n\nWe\u2019ve always loved Millie for her whimsical, yet sophisticated, eye for style and it\u2019s never been as apparent as it was last night. The actress chose a purple-skirted jumper with a large varsity \u201cW\u201d on her torso. Underneath, she layered a slim white turtleneck and threw a matching white leather jacket over her shoulders. Owner of the most epic collection of Audrey Hepburn-inspired flats, she chose a pair of bright white pointed toe skimmers for the event.\n\nThe collection itself was Americana-inspired, though futuristic in feel. And each model marched down a runway totally covered in popcorn to drive the point home. Expanding on his quilted patterns and overly buttoned-up and structured silhouettes from seasons past, creative director Raf Simons mixed in hints of metallics, easy silks, and sheer ruffles.\n\nGetty Images Kelly Taub/BFA/REX/Shutterstock\n\nMillie Bobby Brown\u2019s velvet look was rife with youthful inspiration, yet tailored and classic at the same time. Though the star has been fairly absent from the Fashion Week circuit, she definitely came out of the cannon with a bang for this one. And, as the face of Raf Simons\u2019 first-ever made-to-order line, it seems fitting that her first appearance of the week was at the creative director\u2019s best show to date for the brand.\n\nRelated: You Missed the Secret Political Message in Michelle Obama's Official Portrait\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844afbc98c2d46de010818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520(8).jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844b830853d54aeb7311e2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/rexfeatures_9376077az.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844b08adfa794183b57468/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Lede%252520(4).jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/588fb1d474508ccc46b567b0/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/DSC_9440%2525202.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844afbc98c2d46de010818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520(8).jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Avery Matera", "Avery Mater"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/millie-bobby-brown-cheerleader-calvin-klein-fashion-show", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Stuns in Cheerleader-Inspired Look While Sitting Front Row at Calvin Klein\u2019s Fall 2018 Show", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Avery Matera", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Millie Bobby Brown was sitting front row at Calvin Klein show in New York City, but had you only taken a quick glance, you might not have recognized her.", "id": "5a8441f1c06208469d9170a8", "keywords": "celebrity style,millie bobby brown,calvin klein,fashion week,new york fashion week", "news_keywords": "celebrity style,millie bobby brown,calvin klein,fashion week,new york fashion week", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a8441f1c06208469d9170a8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Millie Bobby Brown was sitting front row at Calvin Klein show in New York City, but had you only taken a quick glance, you might not have recognized her.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844af439f4824c8eab85ba/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Tout%20(9).jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844af439f4824c8eab85ba/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Tout%20(9).jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She\u2019s giving off major \u2018Bring It On\u2019 vibes.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844afbc98c2d46de010818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520(8).jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Basically Wore a Cheerleader Uniform at NYFW", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/millie-bobby-brown-cheerleader-calvin-klein-fashion-show"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "She\u2019s giving off major \u2018Bring It On\u2019 vibes.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a844afbc98c2d46de010818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520(8).jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Basically Wore a Cheerleader Uniform at NYFW"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
