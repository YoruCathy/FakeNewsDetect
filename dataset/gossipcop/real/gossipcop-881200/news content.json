Gossip Girl, here.\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since the titular online menace from the CW\u2019s teen drama first began wreaking havoc on the fictional teen members of Manhattan\u2019s elite, and Vanity Fair is taking a look back on the beloved series.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nIn a lengthy new interview, the Gossip Girl creators and cast \u2013 including Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford and Penn Badgley \u2013 share behind-the-scenes secrets, reflect on the show\u2019s meteoric rise and reveal if they\u2019ll ever reunite on screen again.\n\nHere are the 10 biggest revelations from Vanity Fair\u2019s Gossip Girl 10th anniversary interview.\n\n1. Meester and Lively were not exactly friends, but there was no drama.\n\nThough they played frenemies Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively, onscreen, Meester and Lively kept their relationship professional.\n\n\u201cBlake and Leighton were not friends,\u201d executive producer Joshua Safran said. \u201cThey were friendly, but they were not friends like Serena and Blair. Yet the second they\u2019d be on set together, it\u2019s as if they were.\u201d\n\nThe divide was mostly because of the actresses\u2019 differing personalities, said Safran, who described Lively as \u201cvery in the moment,\u201d while Meester was \u201cvery removed and very quiet\u201d on set.\n\nThough the pair weren\u2019t pals, castmate Michelle Trachtenberg \u2013 who played Gossip Girl baddie Georgina Sparks \u2013 insisted there was no drama between the women: \u201cWe were all chill. It was cool.\u201d\n\n2. Gossip Girl stopped Lively from quitting acting.\n\nLively, then 18, was eyeing an exit from Hollywood when first approached about the series. Best known at the time for her role in the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants films, Lively told showrunners she wanted to go to college.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018O.K., you can go to Columbia [University] one day a week. After the first year [of the show], it\u2019ll quiet down. Your life will go back to normal and you can start going to school. We can\u2019t put it in writing, but we promise you can go,\u2019 \u201d explained Lively. \u201cSo that\u2019s why I said, \u2018O.K. You know what? I\u2019ll do this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOf course, the arrangement didn\u2019t work out as \u201cthe show didn\u2019t slow down.\u201d Said Lively, laughing, \u201cThis is advice to anyone: when they say, \u2018We promise, but we can\u2019t put it in writing,\u2019 there\u2019s a reason they can\u2019t put it in writing.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Giovanni Rufino/Landov\n\n3. Badgley and Lively kept their breakup a secret from the cast and crew for months.\n\nLively and her on-screen love interest dated in the early years of Gossip Girl\u2018s run, going public with their relationship in 2008 before ultimately splitting in 2010.\n\nWhen the romance ended, though, Lively and Badgley didn\u2019t tell anyone.\n\n\u201cThe shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the season two finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,\u201d Safran told Vanity Fair. \u201cThey kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don\u2019t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.\u201d\n\n4. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a cameo.\n\nBefore they were firmly situated in their White House roles, First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner appeared on the popular series.\n\nJoked series co-creator Josh Schwartz, \u201cThey did it for the money.\u201d\n\n5. Badgley had a lot in common with Dan.\n\nBadgley \u2013 one of the few series regulars not to speak with Vanity Fair for the article \u2013 \u201cdidn\u2019t like\u201d being on the series as Dan Humphrey, Safran said.\n\n\u201cHe was Dan. He may not have liked it, but [his character] was the closest to who he was,\u201d he said.\n\nImage zoom Neilson Barnard/Getty Images\n\n6. Westwick and Crawford were roommates when the show started.\n\nThe real-life Nate Archibald and Chuck Bass bunked up as rising stars, sharing a two-bedroom apartment together in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nTogether, they first encountered the fame that was to come when they attended a concert. \u201cWe had these girls coming up to us, and they were kind of freaking out about it: \u2018Oh, we love the books,\u2019 \u201d Crawford recalled. \u201c[Ed and I] kept looking at each other like, s\u2014, man.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch Blake Lively Remember the Night Ryan Reynolds Fell for Her\n\n7. Fans were so crazed at one point that they tried to stroke the stars\u2019 hair.\n\nThe show\u2019s men weren\u2019t the only ones to deal with Gossip Girl\u2018s fandom. Trachtenberg said she remembered viewers trying to \u201cpet [her] hair\u201d while she walked around the N.Y.C. set.\n\nShe added, \u201cI opened up my trailer door to see, literally, on my first day, I think 40 paparazzi. That\u2019s when I was like, \u2018O.K., I need my own bodyguard.\u2019 \u201d\n\n8. Westwick still doesn\u2019t know who Gossip Girl was.\n\nThough the identity of the show\u2019s main character has long since been revealed (spoiler alert!) as Badgley\u2019s Dan, Westwick told Vanity Fair over email, \u201cI still am not sure who GG was lol.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s crew said that Lonely Boy wasn\u2019t always the frontrunner for the mean-spirited blogger, noting that both Nate and Serena\u2019s brother Eric were once considered.\n\nAs Badgley told PEOPLE in 2015, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense at all!\u201d\n\nImage zoom The CW/KC Bailey\n\n9. The cast still gets approached by fans about the show.\n\nThough the finale aired in 2012, with today\u2019s online streaming, the show has found a whole new audience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so weird how the same demographic has been frozen in time,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cFourteen- to 20-year-olds still come up to me freaking out and it\u2019s because they binge [the show] on Netflix.\u201d\n\n10. The stars are open to a reunion.\n\nThe series neatly ended with a look at all the characters\u2019 futures, but the stars aren\u2019t opposed to revisiting their endings.\n\nKelly Rutherford, who played Lily van der Woodsen, Serena\u2019s mother, said she would be \u201ccompletely on board\u201d for a reunion. \u201cAnd I think they should do it soon,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019m open to anything that\u2019s good, that\u2019s interesting, and that sort of feels necessary,\u201d Lively said. \u201cI imagine we all would [consider it]. I can\u2019t speak for everyone else, but we all owe so much to this show, and I think that it would be silly not to acknowledge that.\u201d\n\nAs for Meester? \u201cI don\u2019t want to say, \u2018No, never . . .\u2019 \u201d she said.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20122'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1427&h=747&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F07%2Fgossip-girl.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Fgettyimages-133531304-1-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F07%2Fgossip-girl.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F01%2Fblake-lively1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2014%2F10%2F24016361_h11417522.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1427&h=747&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F07%2Fgossip-girl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/gossip-girl-10-anniversary-interview/", "title": "Gossip Girl: Revelations from Blake Lively, More Stars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Blake Lively,Chace Crawford,Ed Westwick,Gossip Girl,Leighton Meester,News,Penn Badgely,TV,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Blake Lively,Chace Crawford,Ed Westwick,Gossip Girl,Leighton Meester,News,Penn Badgely,TV,TV Watch", "description": "In a lengthy new interview, the\u00a0Gossip Girl creators and cast \u2013 including\u00a0Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford\u00a0and Penn Badgley\u00a0\u2013 share a variety of behind-the-scenes secrets, wax on the show's meteoric rise and open up about if they'll ever reunite on screen again", "og": {"title": "Gossip Girl: Revelations from Blake Lively, More Stars", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/gossip-girl-10-anniversary-interview/", "description": "Hey, Upper East Siders.
