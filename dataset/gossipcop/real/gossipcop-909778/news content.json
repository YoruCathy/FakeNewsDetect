Pictures\n\nFashion happens faster than ever these days. Each week, we attempt to make sense of it in a column called, \u201cWhat Is Fashion?\u201d\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t seen A Star Is Born, I know you\u2019re probably one of the 11 million people who\u2019ve at least watched the trailer. I know that you know that Bradley Cooper just wants to take another look at Lady Gaga. That he loves her face, and her eyes, but really her nose \u2014 so much, that he took a makeup wipe to her Italian-American features on set one day.\n\nIn order for L. Gaga to play Ally, a struggling singer-songwriter on the road to becoming a star, she had to strip herself down to the way she was before \u201cPoker Face.\u201d This meant not only wiping off her makeup, but also toning down her signature avant-garde style. She wears no dresses made of meat and emerges from no embryonic eggs. She doesn\u2019t even carry a Celine bag. Instead, Gaga\u2019s wardrobe in A Star Is Born is utterly unremarkable. Average, even. Which, of course, makes it highly remarkable.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say the clothes in A Star Is Born are great. They\u2019re not. This is not a fashion movie, which you also probably knew. But Gaga\u2019s \u2014 sorry, Ally\u2019s \u2014 refusal to look stylish, or campy, or dress any part besides her own, is an extension of the makeup-wiping myth: It\u2019s a way of asking us to focus on Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, the talented American treasure, rather than Lady Gaga, the character. And for me, it worked.\n\nIn the first half of the movie, we see Ally with nothing but a T-shirt on, to steal a line from Jessica Simpson. She\u2019s never looked and felt as beautiful as she does in these moments, now that she\u2019s with Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper). On their first \u201cdate,\u201d her most prominent accessory is a frozen bag of peas, which Jack insists she buy after punching someone in the face on his behalf.\n\nAs for her first big moment on stage \u2014 the moment where she finally dives off the deep end \u2014 Ally wears pinstripe jeans with a chainlink belt, plus a simple white T-shirt knotted in the front. At first glance, the look is very \u201cAdriana La Cerva, but make it country.\u201d But knowing Gaga, those are her actual $325 Miaou jeans, and an old tee from the back of her closet. The knot is important, though, because nothing is ever simple with Gaga; she makes every appearance her own.\n\nLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in A Star Is Born (2018). Photo: Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures\n\nAlly\u2019s knotted T-shirt look returns a few times throughout the film, but as she drifts closer to the spotlight, her style becomes increasingly pop-y and removed from her \u201ctrue self.\u201d Still, the movie doesn\u2019t judge her for her transformation (though drunk Bradley Cooper does). She\u2019s just Ally being Ally \u2014 only a little more bedazzled.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen Five Foot Two, the documentary on Lady Gaga\u2019s life up until now, then you know that she and Ally share the same \u201coff duty\u201d style: the same cropped T-shirts, jeans, and cowboy hats. The same leotards worn with low-waist sweatpants. It\u2019s not a coincidence that A Star Is Born felt like a high-production combination of the documentary and a Joanne music video. (Personally, I can\u2019t seem to get enough of all three.) But it\u2019s also too simplistic to say that any of these is the more \u201cauthentic\u201d version of Lady Gaga. Stefani-as-Gaga-as-Ally is merely a different costume, and this one is less distracting.\n\nI think I spotted a few outside references in Ally\u2019s costumes. Her off-the-shoulder gown at the Grammys, for example, felt like a nod to Janet Gaynor\u2019s in the original movie. Plus, there were a couple Judy Garland\u2013esque neckties, and maybe one floral jumpsuit like Marisa Tomei\u2019s in My Cousin Vinny. Meanwhile, Bradley Cooper gave us at least one shirtless Kris Kristofferson moment. But other than that, Gaga\u2019s style in A Star Is Born isn\u2019t special. It forces us to take her at face value. And man, does she have a great face.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/10/05/05-a-star-is-born-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/10/05/05-a-star-is-born-lede.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/10/05/05-a-star-is-born-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emilia Petrarca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/a-star-is-born-lady-gaga-costumes.html", "title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s Style Is Unremarkable in \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s Style in A Star Is Born Is Remarkably Unremarkable", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/10/a-star-is-born-lady-gaga-costumes.html", "description": "Just like her \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/10/05/05-a-star-is-born-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s A Star Is Born Style Is Remarkably Unremarkable", "description": "Just like her \u201cno makeup\u201d makeup.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/10/05/05-a-star-is-born-lede.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@emiliapetrarca", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-05T14:36:00.000-04:00", "tag": "fashion, style, a star is born, lady gaga, what is fashion", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "In \u2018A Star Is Born\u2019, Lady Gaga not only wiped off all her makeup, but also toned town her signature style.
