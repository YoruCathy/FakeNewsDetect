Over the weekend at San Diego Comic-Con, which ran from July 19th to July 22nd, Reynolds revealed which show he and Lively are currently addicted to, and honestly, same.\n\n\u201cLoving Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Wishing there were more, we just watched the last one,\u201d Reynolds said while speaking to fans at a Deadpool 2 panel. Although there\u2019s no release date set for Season 3 yet, it\u2019s expected to hit our screens in April 2019. Reynolds also said he\u2019s been \u201con a weird movie tour,\u201d while Lively has been overseas shooting The Rhythm Section. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a ton of time to pretend like I\u2019m watching the kids,\u201d he joked. \u201cShe\u2019s probably filing [divorce] papers as we speak.\u201d\n\nPart of Reynold\u2019s \u201cweird movie tour\u201d is watching \u201clike every Quentin Tarantino movie,\u201d he told the audience. We\u2019re guessing the tour starts after his daughters, three-year-old James and one-year-old Inez, are put to bed.\n\nBesides Handmaid\u2019s Tale and all-things Tarantino, Reynolds had high praise for Taika Waititi\u2019s 2016 film Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which stars Reynold\u2019s Deadpool 2 costar, Julian Dennison. Reynolds calls Hunt for the Wilderpeople \u201cone of the best movies you\u2019ll ever see.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re adding it to our list, ASAP.\n\nHaving starred in some seriously incredible television and film projects, Reynolds and Lively know what\u2019s up when it comes to good entertainment. Now, call us if you guys want to rehash that Handmaid\u2019s Tale finale.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F23065435%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072533/avatar-e-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F23065435%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Harvey"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds revealed his and Blake Lively's current favorite show, and same", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "blake lively,comic-con,deadpool 2,Hunt for the Wilderpeople,news,Ryan Reynolds,Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively,Ryan Reynolds Deadpool 2,San Diego Comic Con,television,the handmaid's tale,the handmaid's tale season 2,TRENDING,tv,News", "news_keywords": "blake lively,comic-con,deadpool 2,Hunt for the Wilderpeople,news,Ryan Reynolds,Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively,Ryan Reynolds Deadpool 2,San Diego Comic Con,television,the handmaid's tale,the handmaid's tale season 2,TRENDING,tv,News", "description": "During a panel discussion at San Diego's Comic-Con, Ryan Reynolds told fans what he and wife Blake Lively are currently bingeing, and honestly, us too.", "og": {"title": "Ryan Reynolds revealed his and Blake Lively's current favorite show, and same", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "description": "Reynolds and Lively have solid taste.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F23065435%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg", "width": 664, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "description": "During a panel discussion at San Diego's Comic-Con, Ryan Reynolds told fans what he and wife Blake Lively are currently bingeing, and honestly, us too.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F23065435%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/ryan-reynolds-blake-lively-favorite-show/", "title": "Ryan Reynolds revealed his and Blake Lively's current favorite show, and same", "description": "Reynolds and Lively have solid taste.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F07%2F23065435%2FRyan-Raynolds-and-Blake-Lively-e1532354127862.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8Xvsjy57X0?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
