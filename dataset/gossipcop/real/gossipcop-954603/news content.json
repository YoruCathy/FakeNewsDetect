And the average moviegoer, it transpires, likes the Twilight movies, Johnny Depp and Sandra Bullock.\n\nNo doubt reflecting its broad-based, popular appeal, the Twilight saga emerged as the overall champion at the 2010 People's Choice awards last night, winning for favourite movie and favourite franchise. Stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were named favourite on-screen team, while supporting actor Taylor Lautner picked up the award for \"breakout movie actor\".\n\nElsewhere, Sandra Bullock was named favourite actress thanks to her turn in The Proposal, while Public Enemies star Johnny Depp won the favourite actor prize. Presenting the gong, Sacha Baron Cohen paid tribute to the Pirates of the Caribbean mainstay. \"He singlehandedly made being a pirate fashionable again,\" Baron Cohen told the audience. \"Which is great unless you're sailing an oil tanker off the coast of Somalia.\"\n\nThe other categories made a good show of covering the bases, with Hugh Jackman named favourite action star and Jim Carrey winning the sister award for comedy. Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds won the independent film award, while the Pixar animation Up was selected as favourite family film. The winners were decided after an estimated 60m votes were cast online.\n\nThe People's Choice awards were established in 1975 to honour mainstream movies and actors who might otherwise be passed over by the Oscars. The Sting won the inaugural award for favourite film, while Barbra Streisand and John Wayne were named favourite actor and actress.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif",
