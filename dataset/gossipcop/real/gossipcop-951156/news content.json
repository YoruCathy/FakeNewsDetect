The streaming service doesn\u2019t release viewership numbers, but the show won over skeptical critics \u2014 it\u2019s at 96 percent among critics (and 90 percent among viewers) on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nA dozen years ago, France was living in New York with a housemate who was a Utah native. France came here to visit, and he decided he would make this his home after he\u2019d been here \u201cfor about 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nSeriously.\n\n\u201cI went out to dinner at Chili\u2019s on Fourth South,\u201d France said, \u201cand at the end of that meal, I said to my friend, \u2018I\u2019m going to live here one day.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHis friend scoffed, but France said Salt Lakers \u201care some of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met. And I can see the mountains from this restaurant, and that\u2019s beautiful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFrance continued to visit Utah every three or four months. A couple of years later, he met his husband, Rob France.\n\n\u201cWe started to date and then, yeah, I realized he was the one very shortly after that. So I planned on Utah being my home.\u201d\n\nWhich it has been for nearly a decade. France operated clothing businesses here \u2014 he created Kingdom & State and co-created Rachel Parcell Inc. \u2014 and made a home with his husband, who\u2019s an illustrator.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\u201cThere are so many things that kept me here,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, most importantly, I found the most incredible friend group. So it truly is my favorite place on Earth.\u201d\n\nUnexpected stardom \u2022 The producers of \u201cQueer Eye\u201d reached out to France because of his work in the fashion industry. They were looking for somebody to step into the shoes of the most high-profile guy on the original \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d (2003-07), fashion guru Carson Kressley.\n\nThe Netfix reboot, titled simply \u201cQueer Eye,\u201d features five gay men (the Fab Five) who help other men with fashion, style, personal grooming, interior design and the rather nebulous \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nFrance auditioned as sort of a lark, \u201cbut never in a million years did I think I would end up on a TV show. \u2026 It made no sense to me that they would take a chance on somebody who\u2019d never been on TV and gets nervous having a photo taken.\u201d\n\nYes, France is a handsome man with great hair, but he insists he never even liked to have his picture taken.\n\n\u201cThe other [Fab Five] boys have all done TV before. They\u2019d done film before. They\u2019re comfortable in this space, and they\u2019d always wanted this for many, many years,\u201d France said.\n\n(Bobby Berk has made multiple TV appearances on home design shows; Karamo Brown was on \u201cThe Real World\u201d and has many hosting and acting credits; Antoni Porowski is an actor; and Jonathan Van Ness stars in the \u201cFunny or Die\u201d parody \u201cGay of Thrones.\u201d)\n\n\u201cIt was just surprising when \u2026 I was the one who got the job,\u201d France said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s still shocking to me.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, the Fab Five are still waiting to hear if Netflix will pick up \u201cQueer Eye\u201d for a second season. But they\u2019re hopeful. Executive producer David Collins has been talking about producing Season 2 somewhere in the Midwest. (Atlanta was home base for Season 1.)\n\nMuslim and Mormon \u2022 Growing up in London, Tan France was raised Muslim; growing up in Wyoming, his husband, Rob, was raised Mormon. In an earlier interview with the New York Post, Tan France said, \u201cWe practice some of our religions\u2019 practices. We don\u2019t practice them all. We practice what works for us.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, Tan apologized and demurred when asked about their backgrounds.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t talk about religion,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople make assumptions about what our religions are, but we leave it to them.\u201d\n\nFamous in Salt Lake City \u2022 Since \u201cQueer Eye\u201d debuted, France is recognized constantly. And nowhere more often than in his adopted hometown \u2014 which is \u201cshockingly, even more hectic\u201d than New York or Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI no longer go to the store,\u201d France said. \u201cWe don\u2019t go out to dinner anymore, we only have friends over to dinner at our home. It just gets too chaotic.\u201d\n\nFrance believes he\u2019s recognized more often in Utah because \u201cthere aren\u2019t many people that look like me here. Whereas in New York and L.A., there are people of color. Here, people can spot me a mile off.\u201d\n\nOr they hear his accent. \u201cThey\u2019re wonderful because I\u2019m British,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cAnd I hate to say that, but they love the Brits out here.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not complaining. \u201cOn the whole, it\u2019s lovely. But one person asks for a selfie, there\u2019s then a line and we could be stuck there for an hour or two when we went out to get milk.\u201d\n\nInspiring to Salt Lake gays \u2022 France said he\u2019s regularly approached by people who don\u2019t just want a selfie with him, they want to tell him \u201ca story about their dad watching [\u2018Queer Eye\u2019] or their granddad watching it \u2014 just people who I would never expect to watch the show. And they say, \u2018You don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s changed the conversation in our home.\u2019\n\n\u201cI feel so blessed to be in a position where I\u2019m on a show and I\u2019m having conversations that are affecting real people.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also been surprised by the number of people \u201cwho reached out to say they were able to come out \u2026 because their family watched the show. Actually, a lot of Salt Lakers \u2026 will stop me and say, \u2018I came out this month because you gave me the courage to on this show.\u2019 It\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nGetting comfortable on camera \u2022 Chatting with the smooth, erudite France today, you\u2019d never know that he was overwhelmed when \u201cQueer Eye\u201d production began.\n\n\u201cI definitely wasn\u2019t the person that you see now. I was so nervous,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the pressure got to him when he filmed his first scene in front of a production team \u201cof 30-something people, all waiting for me to say something. That kind of pressure you can\u2019t prepare for, quite honestly.\u201d\n\nHe uses words like \u201chideous\u201d and \u201chellacious\u201d to describe the first couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cI would leave the set and go home and call my husband on FaceTime and just sit there and cry, saying, \u2018I\u2019ve made the biggest mistake of my life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to be comfortable,\u2019\u201d said France. \u201cI guess I just needed a couple of weeks to get over it. Now, these things don\u2019t faze me at all.\u201d\n\n\u2018Queer Eye\u2019 for a new generation \u2022 There are some major differences between the original \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy\u201d and the reboot \u2014 and not just that, in one of the eight episodes, the new Fab Five make over a gay guy.\n\nThe new guys are a lot more touchy-feely. They talk about their personal lives; the originals did not.\n\n1 of 10 View Caption (Photo courtesy of Carin Baer/Netflix) Karamo Brown, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France, Bobby Berk, Antoni Porowski, Neal Reddy \u2014...

Whereas now \u2026 I represent so much more than just putting clothes on somebody.\u201d\n\nHe is by no means trying to run away from his job as \u201cstyle guy\u201d on the show.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m hoping what you notice is that there\u2019s so much more to every one of us,\u201d France said. \u201cWe are there to change people\u2019s opinions. To open their hearts and minds, and show them a version of gay men \u2014 gay life \u2014 that they\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nA version that features \u201cjust regular folk who have husbands, who have children, who are of a certain religion, who are of a certain background.\u201d\n\nHair-raising social media \u2022 France is surprised that his social media following has ballooned; he\u2019s stunned by all the interest in his hair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one constant,\u201d he said. \u201cI get an average of a thousand [Instagram direct messages] a day, and probably 700 or 800 are about my hair.\u201d\n\nSeriously, people?\n\nFrance had fewer than 3,000 followers pre-\u201cQueer Eye\u201d; Netflix execs hoped that would climb to 10,000 after the show debuted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at almost 270,000 within less than a month. That\u2019s insane,\u201d France said. \u201cPeople are connecting so strongly with the show, and, therefore, they want to DM because they feel like they truly know me.\u201d\n\nBTW, yes, that\u2019s his real hair. No, he doesn\u2019t color it (the gray is real). And, no he doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time on it.\n\nGay, Muslim, Middle Eastern, immigrant \u2022 France isn\u2019t just shattering stereotypes about gay men, he\u2019s doing the same for other \u201cmarginalized demographics.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, in this current climate, me being on a very commercial show is the opposite of what our leadership may want shown on a national platform,\u201d he said. \u201cI represent everything that the current administration doesn\u2019t like. I\u2019m gay. I\u2019m of a certain religion. I am Middle Eastern. And I\u2019m an immigrant.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s showing that an immigrant can come to America, create successful businesses \u2026 and become a TV star.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a very important message,\u201d France said. \u201cSo I\u2019m really glad that they chose somebody like me to represent our community.\u201d\n\nDelayed retirement \u2022 Not only did France have no plans to be a TV star, he didn\u2019t plan to be working, period, at this point in his life.\n\n\u201cI was actually retiring just before I got the call for the show,\u201d he said. Yes, he\u2019s only in his mid-30s. But he and his husband want to start a family.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start the surrogacy process,\u201d France said. \u201cI just wanted to live a quiet life. I have a home that I\u2019m in love with in Salt Lake, and that was all I wanted. I just wanted to give it all up and focus on family life.\n\n\u201cAnd then this happens.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be intimidated \u2022 France said people tell him all the time that they\u2019re fearful he\u2019ll judge what they\u2019re wearing.\n\n\u201cLiterally everybody I meet,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, literally, everybody who asks me for a selfie, the first thing they say is, \u2018Oh, I should\u2019ve dressed up more.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis goal on the show is \u201cto get the best version of that person out\u201d by dressing them as well as he can.\n\n\u201cI really am not that critical of what people wear,\u201d he said, bursting into laughter. \u201cI think, \u2018If you\u2019re comfortable in what you\u2019re wearing, good for you.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/VDl9yC2Cax01q0xOiGj45-IkWpQ=/970x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YRARROSSEFF3JKTECJ54J4VBJY.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/w1Paet4BgFpN4NwSA3D3RtJG98U=/970x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P6CFXZDXUBBODMQPAUBQAYKXU4.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/5J_9VKqecygD6cTCQnsXUHn2ew0=/1200x630/filters:quality(85)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/336OGMWXU5GCPPU7BRFXMWH3GM.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/vlUHyMhAiuLI3nTt444jrwWOj4g=/970x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/33XCSBGY3JEXNC7BKDHSVZFZX4.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/pb/resources/assets/img/donate_sltrib_button_icon_redbright.png", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/Hgzw9wXDDs1hotQIsF8NvKWWogg=/970x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A464QMQWOJBIHA7BOQ7CQS4QXU.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/0h3k2YF-EUqq30La-kXzRJg8DDc=/970x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/336OGMWXU5GCPPU7BRFXMWH3GM.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/5qbxrFbleLgg-OgowstoQuEYepE=/970x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/N3CXWWRVS5DG7B2Z2CACJF7OZA.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/U-mH2cLeESxf6iBDFPIO0I6l4FE=/70x70/smart/filters:quality(86)/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/0d2c27ce-211e-4d20-9938-5a5db6302dbb.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/pb/resources/assets/img/vectors/sltrib-logo.svg", "https://www.sltrib.com/pb/resources/assets/img/vectors/close-icon.svg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/S-1tlL9udHu2x02zeLoV-lkNCnE=/60x60/smart/filters:quality(86)/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/0d2c27ce-211e-4d20-9938-5a5db6302dbb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/5J_9VKqecygD6cTCQnsXUHn2ew0=/1200x630/filters:quality(85)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/336OGMWXU5GCPPU7BRFXMWH3GM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Spierce Sltrib.Com", "Scott D.
