{"url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/this-is-us-dan-fogelman-emmy-nominations-season-3-1202872412/", "text": "\u201cThis Is Us\u201d solidified its stance as both an audience favorite and an awards contender, grabbing eight nominations for its sophomore season, including best drama and lead actor for its leading men, Sterling K. Brown (the reigning champ) and Milo Ventimiglia.\n\n\u201cThis is what really matters,\u201d joked series creator and executive producer Dan Fogelman, in an interview with Variety. \u201cThis is the stuff. Not family, not health \u2014 it\u2019s Emmy nominations.\u201d\n\nBut in all seriousness, Fogelman says he\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d to be part of the awards conversation \u2014 and to be representing for broadcast, as the lone network contender in the drama race. \u201cThe goal when I sat down was to try and make something that was high quality while at the same time being accessible to regular people and not be so kind of art house, avant garde or dark that people could not access the show. So to be popular and well-regarded by fancy people is exciting because it means we\u2019re threading a very fine needle.\u201d\n\nHere, he tells Variety what\u2019s in store for season three (which is now in production), his plan for the series finale, and who he\u2019ll be rooting for on Emmy night.\n\nWhy do you think the show is resonating so much?\n\nI hate to break it down to a bare minimum. I think people really love the actors and I think they really love the way the actors inhabit the characters. So we don\u2019t have, necessarily, plot lines that drive people to our television show. I think there\u2019s a warmth to it and a tone to it and a melancholy optimism to it that obviously draws people in. But I really do think it\u2019s these actors who are doing something that is very, very hard to do, which is they are super fun to look at while being incredibly talented actors while also being incredibly charming and funny and accessible. And so I think people turn on their television at 9:00 on Tuesday and see versions of their lives and their families and themselves. I think it\u2019s the actors who seem to be getting it done for us.\n\nSeveral of your actors were nominated \u2014 including Sterling and Milo, as well as guest actors Ron Cephas Jones and Gerald McRaney. But Mandy Moore, Chrissy Metz and Justin Hartley were overlooked. How do you assess the situation with the acting races?\n\nI don\u2019t understand how the whole thing works. It\u2019s an interesting thing because when we set out to do this show, I almost never would have thought we would have been able to be allowed into this fancy conversation. But then once you\u2019re there, you\u2019re going, how can Mandy and Justin and Chrissy not be nominated for what they did this season? And you get sucked in a little bit. You go real quick from being grateful to being disappointed for the ones that you didn\u2019t get. But I think our group is close enough that collectively we just feel that when any individual gets the nomination, they\u2019re representing the larger whole. And we\u2019re not just saying it like in a platitude kind of way. The show gets nominated. They won a SAG award last year against all these other fancy cable shows. That\u2019s exciting stuff. So for us that\u2019s the win. We\u2019ve got 20 million people a week watching the show, the cast can\u2019t walk down the street, and famous directors and writers are calling me about actors who they didn\u2019t know a couple of years ago. And so it\u2019s all really, really exciting.\n\nGiven the success of the show, are you surprised not to see more shows trying to copy your formula? Has broadcast learned anything from your success?\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s how television in any form of writing or producing really works. Our show is very hard to do. It\u2019s deceptively hard. And so, just because you\u2019re trying to do something with emotion or multiple characters doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s that simple. When we made this show, one of the things people would say was, \u201cI liked the script but these shows don\u2019t work. They don\u2019t draw in mass audiences, they don\u2019t get high ratings.\u201d And we did it anyway. And so I\u2019m a believer that when something hits, it can be good to go in the complete opposite direction because that\u2019s why something hits, it fills a void. It\u2019s different from what people have been getting fed. So my opinion is hit them where they are as opposed to just trying to do something. What would be nice is if this show\u2019s popularity allowed people to live in this kind of dramedy space a little bit more. Not because they\u2019re being copycats but because its success proved that there\u2019s an appetite for it. That would be an exciting thing for me as a person who loves that s\u2014, you know?\n\nWhen you look back over the course of the season, what moment are you proudest of?\n\nI have a few. We did an 11-minute family therapy scene in the middle of the season last year where the three siblings and Mandy as their matriarch were going back and forth at each other. Just watching the way our writers wrote that and that way the actors performed it I was like, \u2018Wow, we\u2019re really doing something here.\u2019\n\nHow does that impact you going into season three? How did you avoid that sophomore slump?\n\nI\u2019m surrounded by people who take this show and their job and their work very seriously and they\u2019re very good at it. The world is cynical and the Internet has turned into this vicious cynical place. I know the show\u2019s not going to dip in quality because we\u2019re not going to allow it to happen. If you liked the show for two seasons, you\u2019re going to like it now. We have nothing left to prove for ourselves now. Now we want to sit down and just make a bunch more great episodes of television and then get out while we\u2019re on top and while we\u2019re still feeling good before it all goes to s\u2014 and we\u2019ve overstayed our welcome. We\u2019re not gonna stick around forever. Our show has some scope and some size to it and we have a set story we set out to tell with an ending and we\u2019re not going to stretch it just to make more money or continue more seasons with more ratings. It\u2019s just not what we\u2019re going to do on this one.\n\nDo you have that end game in mind?\n\nI do. In some ways we\u2019ve shot some of it already. In my mind\u2019s eye I know what that episode is and how many episodes we kind of roughly have before then and seasons. We know where we\u2019re going and that\u2019s why I\u2019m not really worried about slumps. We know what our storylines are, we know what our arcs are, we know how we\u2019re going to kill ourselves to execute. We go through a process here where a script gets written, whether it\u2019s myself writing it or one of our writers, and we sit in a room and we beat it up and we criticize and then we rewrite and we work it and we work it and we work it and we do the same thing with our cuts and our edits and we don\u2019t stop until we feel we\u2019ve got something that we\u2019re really, really proud of. And as long as we continue that process, I don\u2019t see why we should take a step backwards.\n\nAre there things that you want to do with the third season that you haven\u2019t gotten to do yet?\n\nI think the third season we\u2019re going to be doing a lot of stuff that we haven\u2019t gotten to do yet because you know, the end of our second season was a bit of a chapter closing and new chapters opening and that was the point of our throw forward into the future, but also why we ended at a wedding where the family is collectively taking a breath and saying they\u2019re going to take a breath and try and move past these things they\u2019ve been holding onto. And so what\u2019s really exciting about the third season is we continue these same exact characters we know in their storylines, but there\u2019s new chapters for everybody and so it\u2019s not like starting over, but it\u2019s like we\u2019re embarking on some new plotlines for everybody that go to some issues that people are going to really attach to and have access points to and others will find that in other storylines. But there\u2019s a lot of new stories coming everyone\u2019s way, which is exciting for us.\n\nHow are you feeling about the third season?\n\nIt feels really strong. We\u2019re doing some really ambitious stuff. Our first episode back is our past storyline which is basically the first date, the first night following their meeting that Jack and Rebecca ever have together. We\u2019re really into early, early Jack and Rebecca incarnations, origin story, and then we\u2019re doing stuff with Vietnam. I just wrote an early episode of the series. It\u2019s a standalone Vietnam episode about Jack\u2019s story, and I wrote it with Tim O\u2019Brien who is our foremost author on Vietnam, so we\u2019re doing really cool ambitious stuff. And then we also have really relatable human stories for Beth and Randall on fertility and Kate and Kevin, and so I\u2019m really excited about what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m as excited as I\u2019ve been and more than our first two seasons.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re going to deliver on all those promises of the flash forward in the season 2 finale.\n\nThe future storyline is not going to play a big part in the season, but it\u2019s a framing device until we get the answers. We\u2019re not going to bring it all the way to the end of the season. I think it will be answered much sooner than that, like the midway section.\n\nIs there a nomination other than your own that you\u2019re excited about?\n\nJudd Apatow\u2019s documentary on Garry Shandling was the best thing I\u2019ve seen on a screen this year, I found it incredibly interesting and moving and smart. I found it profound and complicated and moving. I loved it. And anything with \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is always like a win for me. The first year we got nominated for everything, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d wasn\u2019t eligible. And so to be able to go to the [awards show] this year along with \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d it will be like being an eight-year-old boy and seeing like your favorite superhero dressed on Hollywood Boulevard for me. Like I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do with myself when they\u2019re all there together.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/this-is-us-tv-show-nbc.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fthis-is-us-dan-fogelman-emmy-nominations-season-3-1202872412%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202872412&comment_count=3", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/this-is-us-tv-show-nbc.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Debra Birnbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/this-is-us-dan-fogelman-emmy-nominations-season-3-1202872412/", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Boss on Emmy Noms and Snubs, Season 3\u2019s \u2018New Chapters,\u2019 the Series Finale", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"This Is Us\" boss Dan Fogelman on what's in store for season three, his plan for the series finale, and who he'll be rooting for on Emmy night.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202872412, "author": "Debra Birnbaum", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-07-12T19:36:34"}, "pmc-tag": "Dan Fogelman,Emmys,This Is Us", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Boss on Emmy Noms and Snubs, Season 3\u2019s \u2018New Chapters,\u2019 the Series Finale", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Boss on Emmy Noms and Snubs, Season 3\u2019s \u2018New Chapters,\u2019 the Series Finale", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/this-is-us-dan-fogelman-emmy-nominations-season-3-1202872412/", "description": "\u201cThis Is Us\u201d solidified its stance as both an audience favorite and an awards contender, grabbing eight nominations for its sophomore season, including best drama and lead actor for its\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/this-is-us-tv-show-nbc.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "This is Us TV Show NBC"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-13T02:36:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-13T14:04:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@debrabirnbaum", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Boss on Emmy Noms and Snubs, Season 3\u2019s \u2018New Chapters,\u2019 the Series Finale"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/this-is-us-tv-show-nbc.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "This is Us TV Show NBC"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Boss on Emmy Noms and Snubs, Season 3\u2019s \u2018New Chapters,\u2019 the Series Finale", "description": "\"This Is Us\" boss Dan Fogelman on what's in store for season three, his plan for the series finale, and who he'll be rooting for on Emmy night."}, "author": "Debra Birnbaum", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202872412, "title": "'This Is Us' Boss on Emmy Noms and Snubs, Season 3's 'New Chapters,' the Series Finale", "published_at": "2018-07-12 19:36:34", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/this-is-us-tv-show-nbc.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 3, "tags": "This Is Us", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "\"This Is Us\" solidified its stance as both an audience favorite and an awards contender, grabbing eight nominations for its sophomore season, including best drama and lead actor for its leading men, Sterling K.
