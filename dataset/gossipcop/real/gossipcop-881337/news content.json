I had just gone through a breakup. I\u2019m newly single. I wanna meet people!\u201d she told Jimmy Fallon Monday night on The Tonight Show.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThe star phoned her friend Dave O. to \u201cjust invite people over\u201d and didn\u2019t expect the guest list to be packed with celebrities.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, a couple hours later, Snoop Dogg was there. Dave O. knows everybody, so French Montana was there and Ty Dolla $ign and Wiz Khalifa and all these people were there. I was like, wait a second, I just wanted to have a couple people over to hang out!\u201d\n\nIn true Snoop Dogg form, Lovato\u2019s home was soon \u201cfilled with pot smoke everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, no smoking inside! Get out, get out!\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna tell Snoop not to smoke in my house, so I was like, \u2018Okay, Snoop, do what you want.'\u201d\n\nThe next day, Lovato\u2019s chef arrived at her house and joked, \u201cIt smells like Snoop Dogg was here,\u201d adds the singer. \u201cI was like, \u2018No, he literally was! He literally was.'\u201d\n\nLovato\u2019s new album Tell Me You Love Me is out Sept. 29.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=900&h=471&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fdemi-lovato-snoop-dogg-sq1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=900&h=471&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fdemi-lovato-snoop-dogg-sq1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-house-party-snoop-dogg-inspired-sorry-not-sorry-video/", "title": "Demi Lovato on Her Wild House Party with Snoop Dogg", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Demi Lovato,Music News,News,Snoop Dogg", "news_keywords": "Demi Lovato,Music News,News,Snoop Dogg", "description": "Lovato's house was \"filled with pot smoke everywhere,\" she shared on The Tonight Show", "og": {"title": "Demi Lovato on Her Wild House Party with Snoop Dogg", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-house-party-snoop-dogg-inspired-sorry-not-sorry-video/", "description": "Demi Lovato\u2018s over-the-top music video for her hit single \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d featuring a wild house party was inspired by a real-life bash she hosted&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=900&h=471&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fdemi-lovato-snoop-dogg-sq1.jpg", "width": 900, "height": 471}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-house-party-snoop-dogg-inspired-sorry-not-sorry-video/", "description": "Lovato's house was \"filled with pot smoke everywhere,\" she shared on The Tonight Show", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fdemi-lovato-snoop-dogg-sq1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-house-party-snoop-dogg-inspired-sorry-not-sorry-video/", "title": "Demi Lovato on Her Wild House Party with Snoop Dogg", "description": "Lovato's house was \"filled with pot smoke everywhere,\" she shared on The Tonight Show", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=900&h=471&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fdemi-lovato-snoop-dogg-sq1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MsvER1dpjM"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
