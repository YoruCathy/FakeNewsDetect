Blunt kicked things off at the ball by singing Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody,\" which inspired Corden to respond with Mars' \"Just The Way You Are.\"\n\nThey were, of course, quickly living a \"Teenage Dream,\" with Blunt crooning Adele's \"Hello\" from her balcony and Corden responding with Lionel Richie's yearning song of the same name as the Capulets and Montague's got to battling to Carl Douglas' iconic \"Kung-Fu Fighting.\"\n\nThe endless lovers wondered \"What's Your Fantasy\" and then complained their families were being \"Rude,\" leading Blunt to take something \"Toxic.\" And well, you know how it ends, but not typically with Carl Carlton's 1974 disco soul classic \"Everlasting Love.\"\n\nCheck it out:", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?5483f7d85ab28d1d2c44"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7825612/late-late-show-emily-blunt-james-corden-romeo-and-juliet-musical", "title": "Emily Blunt & James Corden's Musical Tribute to 'Romeo and Juliet' Features Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, Adele & More: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-06-09T09:04:25-04:00", "published_time": "2017-06-09T08:10:40-04:00"}, "description": "The \"Into the Woods\" reunion also featured songs from Mariah Carey, MAGIC! and Ludacris.", "og": {"description": "The \"Into the Woods\" reunion also featured songs from Mariah Carey, MAGIC! and Ludacris.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Emily Blunt & James Corden's Musical Tribute to 'Romeo and Juliet' Feat.
