You guys are awesome.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Brooklynn took advantage of her moment in the spotlight to mention the people in the world who are struggling to make it, just like her on-screen character and the girl's mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite).\n\n\"I'd like to dedicate this award to all the Halleys and Moonees out there,\" she said. \"Guys, this is a real problem. You need to go out there and help.\"\n\nChristopher Polk / Getty Images\n\nAnd then, after one big sniffle, her voice jumped in pitch for an almost-squeaky delivery of her last words on stage: \"Thank you so much!\"\n\nCongratulations, Brooklynn! We can't wait to see you win again.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1310175/brooklynn-prince-critics-choice-today-180112-tease_c7fca125a8121ee65335f482fd1da467.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1310175/brooklynn-prince-critics-choice-today-180112-tease_c7fca125a8121ee65335f482fd1da467.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/7-year-old-brooklynn-prince-delivers-moving-speech-critics-choice-t121150", "title": "This 7-year-old's acceptance speech will make you cry ... and laugh and smile", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/7-year-old-brooklynn-prince-delivers-moving-speech-critics-choice-t121150", "title": "This 7-year-old's acceptance speech will make you cry ... and laugh and smile", "description": "Brooklynn Prince's words were raw, moving, completely sincere, at times funny and definitely the best moment of Thursday's Critics' Choice Awards.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1310175/brooklynn-prince-critics-choice-today-180112-tease_c7fca125a8121ee65335f482fd1da467.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1310175/brooklynn-prince-critics-choice-today-180112-tease_c7fca125a8121ee65335f482fd1da467.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1310175/brooklynn-prince-critics-choice-today-180112-tease_c7fca125a8121ee65335f482fd1da467.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "This 7-year-old's acceptance speech will make you cry ... and laugh and smile", "description": "Brooklynn Prince's words were raw, moving, completely sincere, at times funny and definitely the best moment of Thursday's Critics' Choice Awards.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brooklynn Prince's words were raw, moving, completely sincere, at times funny and definitely the best moment of Thursday's Critics' Choice Awards.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1310175/brooklynn-prince-critics-choice-today-180112-tease_c7fca125a8121ee65335f482fd1da467.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJPa4AnYF_Q"], "publish_date": 1515780636.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
