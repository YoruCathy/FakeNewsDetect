I\u2019ve escaped from Kevin Spacey\u2019s basement!\u201d\n\nFamily Guy with a Kevin Spacey reference twelve years ago... creepy. pic.twitter.com/KLXT5MHVxU \u2014 Steve Bee\u270c (@Stevie_Beee) October 30, 2017\n\nThe joke caught public attention on Monday after the 58-year-old \u201cAmerican Beauty\u201d actor was accused of making a sexual advance toward a 14-year-old actor in 1986.\n\n\u201cRent\u201d star Anthony Rapp recounted the alleged incident to BuzzFeed in an article published Sunday. Spacey then apologized for the incident, adding that he couldn\u2019t remember it occurring.\n\n\u201cI am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years,\u201d the actor wrote in a statement on Twitter.\n\nLucas Jackson / Reuters Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey has been accused of making a sexual advance towards a 14-year-old boy in 1986.\n\nThe \u201cFamily Guy\u201d clip was being widely shared on social media and YouTube on Monday.\n\nMacFarlane has yet to publicly address the \u201cFamily Guy\u201d joke about Spacey. A rep for MacFarlane did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, the comedian and actor made headlines for calling out Weinstein\u2019s misbehavior involving women at the Oscars in 2013.\n\nJASON REDMOND / Reuters Comedian Seth MacFarlane said his joke about Harvey Weinstein at the Oscars in 2013 \"came from a place of loathing and anger.\"\n\nAfter announcing the names of the nominees for Best Supporting Actress, he congratulated the actresses, saying, \u201cYou five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\nMacFarlane addressed the joke on Twitter after it resurfaced.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthis came from a place of loathing and anger.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has since been fired from his production company as more women have come forward against him.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c16cd41220000be01deb834.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f65140000ae528ca4d5.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f0a140000ae528ca4d1.jpeg?ops=crop_0_274_2129_1826,scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f65140000ae528ca4d5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f65140000ae528ca4d5.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Breaking News Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/family-guy-joked-of-kevin-spacey_n_59f727ede4b07fdc5fbf89d9", "title": "'Family Guy' Made A Creepy Kevin Spacey Joke Years Ago", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "A clip from the animated show has resurfaced after Spacey was accused of harassing a 14-year-old actor.", "keywords": "Celebrities,harvey weinstein,Kevin Spacey,Family Guy,seth macfarlane", "og": {"title": "'Family Guy' Made A Creepy Kevin Spacey Joke Years Ago", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f65140000ae528ca4d5.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f65140000ae528ca4d5.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/family-guy-joked-of-kevin-spacey_n_59f727ede4b07fdc5fbf89d9", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "A clip from the animated show has resurfaced after Spacey was accused of harassing a 14-year-old actor."}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,harvey weinstein,Kevin Spacey,Family Guy,seth macfarlane", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-30 11:50:34 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-10-31 14:17:30 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "'Family Guy' Made A Creepy Kevin Spacey Joke Years Ago", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59f73f65140000ae528ca4d5.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "A clip from the animated show has resurfaced after Spacey was accused of harassing a 14-year-old actor.", "creator": "glowgow"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59f727ede4b07fdc5fbf89d9", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509378634.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
