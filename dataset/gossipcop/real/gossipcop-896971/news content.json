Al Roker made a chicken dish with Padma Lakshmi and, later, the hosts bid farewell to the show\u2019s adopted dog Charlie, who had been trained to become a service dog.\n\nStars react to Lauer's stunning firing\n\nBut the Lauer news kept coming up again and again. After Guthrie detailed NBC News Chairman Andy Lack\u2019s decision to let Lauer go following \u201ca detailed complaint,\u201d she turned to face Kotb, her voice shaking, and they promised to \u201ccontinue this important conversation.\u201d\n\nKotb then went to check the morning\u2019s other headlines, including news of a North Korea missile test. Later in the show, \u201cToday\u201d lightened up with Al Roker interviewing James Earl Jones.\n\nBut the show had to keep repeating the news of Lauer\u2019s firing at various intervals for viewers who may have tuned in late to the game.\n\n\u201cI texted him this morning and I said \u2018I adore you\u2019\u201d \u2014 Kathie Lee Gifford on Matt Lauer\n\nWhen Megyn Kelly took over at 9 a.m., she recapped that Lauer had been fired and played clips of Guthrie and Kotb\u2019s initial announcement.\n\nMatt Lauer: From rags to riches to what now?\n\n\u201cThis one hits close to home,\u201d said the host who recently departed Fox News and joined the show earlier this year. \"I\u2019ve known Matt for a long time, and he has been a friend, and kind, and supportive to me in my transition to NBC.\u201d\n\nBut she also decried Lauer\u2019s alleged behavior and voiced her support for the woman \u201cwho found the courage to come forward.\"\n\nThen Kelly interviewed a 10-year-old football star and Joe Keery of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\n\nKotb was back on the small screen for the 10 a.m. hour alongside her longtime co-host Kathie Lee Gifford as they were obliged to again address the Lauer news.\n\n\u201cHello everybody, thank you for joining us, and it\u2019s a very, very sad day here at NBC,\u201d Gifford told the audience with wide eyes. She gripped her hands together as she referred to Lauer as her \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nTourists outside 'Today' studios left stunned by news\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure by now you guys all know\u2026 we found out early this morning pre-dawn,\u201d Kotb said with composure.\n\nGifford revealed she had reached out to Lauer since hearing the news, \u201cI texted him this morning and I said \u2018I adore you,\u2019\u201d she told the audience.\n\nGifford said she was relying on her faith to get her through the difficult news. She said we \u201call have sins\u201d and \u201cwhat we need now is forgiveness.\u201d\n\nThe show then cut to a commercial before returning to discuss the details of the upcoming royal wedding.\n\nFans of the morning show praised how the \u201cToday\u201d staff handled the news, though some noted what an uncomfortable taping it must have been.\n\n", "images":
