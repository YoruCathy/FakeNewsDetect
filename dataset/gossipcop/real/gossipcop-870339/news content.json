She owned up to the tweets -- which included racist comments, fat-shaming remarks, using the R-word, and seemingly even slamming The Bachelor -- on Friday, alongside an apology.\n\n\"I want to start by expressing my sincerest apologizes for the extremely hurtful words that I said many years ago,\" Shapoff wrote on Instagram. \"I'm so sorry for those who I have offended. I am beyond mortified that I ever had those thoughts and then proceeded to express them. By no means does this reflect the person who I am today. To the people who do not know me, I am a loving, kind, thoughtful, generous, and compassionate woman. I am not mean-hearted or hurtful.\"\n\n\"The people I have always surrounded myself with are very diverse and come from all over the world,\" she continued. \"I have a huge heart and a very open mind. In the many years since writing those tweets, I have made a conscious effort not to be judgmental and to be accepting of all people. I have gone into a field of work where I am able to help women and men have positive images of themselves, their bodies, and feel beautiful in who they are. It is the most rewarding feeling being able to work in such a diverse field. It shows me the beauty in all people and I am so lucky to have this opportunity.\"\n\nShapoff concluded by insisting that she doesn't \"defend any of the words I have tweeted.\" \"I just want to deeply apologize and learn from my mistakes. I wholeheartedly reject all of those sentiments,\" she said. \"That being said, I take full responsibility for my tweets and will use this as a learning experience. I hope that we can continue to spread love and kindness in the world.\"\n\nABC has no comment.\n\nSocial media scandals have been a recurring theme for the Bachelor franchise lately. One of the contestants on Rachel Lindsay's season of The Bachelorette in 2017, Lee Garrett, was discovered to have a large history of racist tweets. Host Christ Harrison called him out on the show's Men Tell All special, and he apologized for his remarks.\n\n'Bachelorette' Winner Garrett Yrigoyen Was 'Worried' He Would 'Lose' Becca Kufrin After Instagram Scandal This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
