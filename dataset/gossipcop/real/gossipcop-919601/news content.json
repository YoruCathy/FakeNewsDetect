The 57-year-old actor\u2019s partner Anna Eberstein gave birth to their third child last week.\n\nThough the British dad has his hands full there\u2019s a good chance he may make time for a stern chat with his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley. She\u2019s the one who broke the news! While promoting her show The Royals, Hurley, 52, let it slip that he had welcomed baby No. 5.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky that 31 years into our friendship, he\u2019s still my best friend in the whole. He\u2019s really a great guy,\u201d she told E! on Tuesday, March 6. \u201cI see him a lot; I speak to him a lot. You know, he\u2019s now a father of five, he has five kids and he\u2019s a great dad. Yeah, will he remain my best friend for life.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, she elaborated about the newborn during an appearance on Bravo\u2019s Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. \u201cHe had another one last week. He has five,\u201d the Austin Powers alum gushed. \u201cHe was over 50 when he spawned them all! He\u2019s an enchanting dad.\u201d\n\nHurley, who split from Grant in 2000 after 13 years together, added: \u201cHaving these kids has transformed him from a very miserable person into a fairly miserable person. It\u2019s improved him. He\u2019s gone up the scale.\u201d\n\nGrant and the Swedish television producer welcomed their first child, John, in September 2012. Their 2-year-old daughter, whose name has not been made public, made her debut in December 2015. The rom-com king also shares two kids \u2014 Tabitha, and Felix \u2014with receptionist Tinglan Hong. In a cinematic twist, Hong and Eberstein were pregnant with their sons at the same time.\n\nThe Bridget Jones star told the Guardian in 2012 that fatherhood has made him \u201cfeel like a better person.\u201d\u2019\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews subscribe to our new podcast \u2018In Case You Missed Us\u2019 below!\n\n", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hugh-grant-anna-eberstein-baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hugh-grant-and-actress-elizabeth-hurley-1999.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hugh-grant-anna-eberstein-baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/hugh-grant-welcomes-baby-no-5-girlfriend-anna-eberstein-elizabeth-hurley-broke-news/", "title": "Hugh Grant Welcomes Baby No. 5", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Hugh Grant recently became a father for the fifth time and it was ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley who accidentally broke the news \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hugh Grant Welcomes Baby No. 5:\u00a0Find Out Who Accidentally Broke the News", "description": "Hugh Grant recently became a father for the fifth time and it was ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley who accidentally broke the news \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/hugh-grant-welcomes-baby-no-5-girlfriend-anna-eberstein-elizabeth-hurley-broke-news/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:14:33+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hugh-grant-anna-eberstein-baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hugh-grant-anna-eberstein-baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-03-09T15:08:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:14:33+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hugh Grant recently became a father for the fifth time and it was ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley who accidentally broke the news \u2014 get the details", "title": "Hugh Grant Welcomes Baby No. 5:\u00a0Find Out Who Accidentally Broke the News", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/hugh-grant-anna-eberstein-baby.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520608126.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
