But these women (who are not in middle school) play way too much Truth or Dare. Someone needs to tell me if these women are all deeply attracted to each other. I wouldn\u2019t be upset or confused. In fact, I would prefer it and understand it. Any time they\u2019re left alone in an expensive bus or a lake house, they\u2019re always trying to see each other\u2019s titties. Listen, I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m better than getting a glimpse at my friend\u2019s titties, but they are like, always trying to see each other\u2019s titties. Because if they want to see each other\u2019s titties, they can stop manufacturing situations where they\u2019re being \u201cforced\u201d into asking each other to have phone sex in front of each other or look at a titty. Just ask a friend. Ask a friend to suck their fingers. Maybe we\u2019ll end up somewhere interesting, like a seven-person non-monogamous sexual relationship. I WOULD WATCH IT. I would definitely watch it over a bunch of grown women figuring out a trip. If I wanted to watch a bunch of black women over 30 arrange a trip, I WOULD JOIN AN ADULT CHAPTER OF DELTA SIGMA THETA, OKAY? Let\u2019s get to it.\n\nPorsha starts the episode off by saying she\u2019s keeping her pregnancy a secret. She\u2019s also trying to get to know Dennis\u2019s mom but shows up in a catsuit to The Original Hot Dog Factory. She\u2019s going to spend an afternoon working with Dennis. Is this a thing? Going to your boyfriend\u2019s job to hang out and work for an afternoon? I\u2019ve had several unemployed ex-boyfriends so I guess when I went over to their houses, I was spending time at their place of business. Mama Gina keeps asking Porsha if there is anything she should know. Mama Gina knows. You just look at Mama Gina and know that she knows. She can smell the hormones shifting in Porsha\u2019s body.\n\nEveryone is getting ready for NeNe\u2019s couples\u2019 trip, but everyone\u2019s boyfriends and husbands keep suspiciously canceling. Dennis hurt his leg, it\u2019s Todd\u2019s birthday weekend, and Mike Hill just ain\u2019t going.\n\nMeanwhile, Shamari is packing for the trip and she\u2019s got her stylist pulling some outfit options. Unfortunately, one of those outfit options is a tiny denim vest to be paired with cut-offs. SHAMARI. That is not what everyone is looking for from you. She really enjoys a tight vest or vest-adjacent item of clothing. I think it\u2019s her over-reliance on the vest that\u2019s causing people trouble. Ronnie likes a pair of see-through, rhinestoned leggings. He smells them. Anyone else experience a full-body shudder?\n\nRonnie isn\u2019t just sniffing booty, though \u2014 he\u2019s there to sniff out crime. He noticed at the B00BZ & Bourbon Bonanza that Porsha gave them the cold shoulder. In case you forgot, Porsha and Shamari went to the same high school. Don\u2019t worry if you have trouble remembering that, it\u2019ll be mentioned no fewer than six times by Shamari this episode. Shamari\u2019s internal desire this episode is to squash the beef between her and Porsha.\n\nThe ladies all convene at Kandi\u2019s house to leave for their weekend after the trip has been converted into a girl\u2019s trip. Gregg really wanted to go on this trip but he would have been the only guy. Porsha arrives at the house first and she instantly bonds with Ace. Her maternal instincts are kicking in early. Cynthia arrives and she\u2019s finally got heels on. When Cynthia\u2019s got a man, she turns up the hotness. Then Tanya arrives. I GOTTA WORRY ABOUT TANYA ON THIS TRIP? I don\u2019t care what room she gets. Tanya needs to win me over immediately.\n\nGregg drops NeNe off and everyone gives them a standing ovation in the kitchen. Gregg says he wants them to learn something new about each other. I think that thing is going to be the color of each other\u2019s areolas.\n\nDuring the game of Truth or Dare, between sucking on each other\u2019s fingers, NeNe asks Porsha again if Dennis dated anyone on the trip or if anyone on the trip knows someone he dated. NeNe is just fishing for some drama. Kandi says that Dennis was dating someone pretty seriously up until about a month and a half ago. Porsha says that she\u2019s been in a strictly monogamous relationship with Dennis for six months \u2026 but three months ago she was at Shamea\u2019s birthday party with another dude. This is a real Eva-can\u2019t-keep-track-of-the-lies situation. Porsha just needs to say, \u201cI don\u2019t care who he was with. He\u2019s with me now. Anything beyond that is between him and his god.\u201d\n\nNeNe\u2019s spin on the age-old room-picking drama is a multi-step process that gets more confusing as each step is revealed. Each women picks a number, then they pick a name. Each name is assigned a number. The women then choose rooms in the order of their numbers, not for themselves but for whoever\u2019s name they picked. It\u2019s too much, but relatively drama-free. Marlo gives Tanya the bunk-bed room and that\u2019s why I fucking love Marlo.\n\nIt\u2019s time for dinner and Cynthia asks about the bachelorette party. Porsha says that she was invited. Um. Um. Uh-oh, Eva. Somehow Porsha was invited, but it was a secret, but also she didn\u2019t know everyone who was there. Eva needs one of those things quarterbacks wear on their wrists to track plays, but for her lies. Then Porsha asks why NeNe wasn\u2019t invited. Eva says she didn\u2019t think NeNe would want to come. NeNe relishes the opportunity of turning down an invitation, so to rob her of that is almost as bad as not inviting her. Eva breaks down crying about how she doesn\u2019t talk to NeNe every day but sees her as a big sister. I don\u2019t like this.\n\nShamari then sets her sights on Porsha for saying she needed a makeover when Porsha isn\u2019t the one who said it. Shamari is obviously trying her best to stir up some type of drama but she can\u2019t keep her facts straight. Shamari is also pissed that Porsha acts like they aren\u2019t friends and calls her out for not hugging her at the B00BZ & Bourbon Bash. Porsha says she wasn\u2019t feeling her that day so she didn\u2019t hug her and didn\u2019t introduce her to Dennis. Well, fuck, you can\u2019t argue with that.\n\nFinally, Marlo offers her services to give Shamari a makeover, and if next week doesn\u2019t begin with a full-on makeover montage, I\u2019m going to be pissed!", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/14/recaps/rhoa.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/14/recaps/rhoa.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/14/recaps/rhoa.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ali Barthwell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/real-housewives-of-atlanta-recap-season-11-episode-7.html", "title": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta Recap: Truth or Dare", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta Recap: Truth or Dare", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/real-housewives-of-atlanta-recap-season-11-episode-7.html", "description": "Eva needs one of those things quarterbacks wear on their wrists to track plays, but for her lies.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/14/recaps/rhoa.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Real Housewives of Atlanta Recap: Truth or Dare", "description": "Eva needs one of those things quarterbacks wear on their wrists to track plays, but for her lies.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/14/recaps/rhoa.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-17T10:09:50.710-05:00", "tag": "tv, tv recaps, overnights, recaps, the real housewives, the real housewives of atlanta, reality tv, bravo", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Eva needs one of those things quarterbacks wear on their wrists to track plays, but for her lies.
