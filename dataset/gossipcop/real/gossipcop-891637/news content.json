The former couple met on the set of Take Me Home Tonight in 2007 and wed in 2009.\n\n\u201cWe are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried really hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep the situation as private as possible moving forward,\u201d the statements read. \u201cWe still love each other and will always cherish our time together.\u201d\n\nThe exes remain friendly, with Pratt telling photographers that Faris \u201cdid great\u201d at the 2017 Emmy Awards in September: \u201cAnna did an amazing job. She rules! She was great. Her and Allison [Janney], they both looked great.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the Mom star, 40, had nothing but kind words about Pratt during an appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan in October, where she said, \u201cWe\u2019re great friends and we always will be \u2026 Life is too short.\u201d\n\nFaris has most recently been linked to cinematographer Michael Barrett.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-jack-instagram-split-anna-faris.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1418px%2C800px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-jack-instagram-split-anna-faris.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1418px%2C744px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-jack-instagram-split-anna-faris.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1418px%2C744px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chris-pratt-returns-to-instagram-with-son-jack-after-split-from-anna-faris/", "title": "Chris Pratt Returns to Instagram With Son Jack After Split From Anna Faris", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Chris Pratt returned to Instagram on Friday, November 3, for the first time since he and ex-wife Anna Faris announced their separation after eight years together \u2014 see the pic", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chris Pratt Returns to Instagram With Son\u00a0After Split From Anna Faris", "description": "Chris Pratt returned to Instagram on Friday, November 3, for the first time since he and ex-wife Anna Faris announced their separation after eight years together \u2014 see the pic", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chris-pratt-returns-to-instagram-with-son-jack-after-split-from-anna-faris/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:19:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-jack-instagram-split-anna-faris.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1418px%2C744px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-jack-instagram-split-anna-faris.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1418px%2C744px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-04T18:50:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:19:55+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chris Pratt returned to Instagram on Friday, November 3, for the first time since he and ex-wife Anna Faris announced their separation after eight years together \u2014 see the pic", "title": "Chris Pratt Returns to Instagram With Son\u00a0After Split From Anna Faris", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chris-pratt-jack-instagram-split-anna-faris.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1418px%2C744px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509821404.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
