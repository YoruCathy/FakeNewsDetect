I was like, 'Honey, give it a minute.'\"\n\nLuckily, Flynn's dreams of being a big brother have come true, as Kerr is currently pregnant. She and the Snapchat CEO announced they were expecting a child together in November 2017.\n\n\"[Flynn]'s very excited,\" she revealed to host Jimmy Kimmel. \"He has a mischievous personality like me. He also has my little chin.\"\n\nKerr, 34, and Spiegel, 27, who first met at a Louis Vuitton dinner in 2014, previously revealed that they were waiting until marriage to have children. The couple said \"I do\" in an intimate ceremony in Los Angeles, calling the day \"so joyful.\"\n\nHear more in the video below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMiranda Kerr Dishes on 'Magical' Wedding to Evan Spiegel: It Was 'So Joyful'\n\nMiranda Kerr Reveals Her Stunning Wedding Dress to Marry Evan Spiegel in 'Vogue': Pics\n\nMiranda Kerr is Pregnant, Expecting Her Second Child\n\nMiranda Kerr Marries Snapchat Founder Evan Spiegel This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
