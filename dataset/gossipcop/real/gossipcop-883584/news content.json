Together, stars Sasha Pieterse, Lucy Hale, Ashley Benson, Shay Mitchell, and Troian Bellisario get candid about making assistants cry, lying about their ages, and even on-set crushes.\n\nBenson and Mitchell admit to having had a crush on Nolan North, who played Mr. Hastings \u2014 a.k.a. Spencer\u2019s dad \u2014 on the series. Meanwhile, Hale revealed that way back in season 1 she actually had a crush on Ian Harding. Of course, PLL fans know that Harding played Ezra Fitz, who just so happened to be Hale\u2019s love interest on the show. (Spoiler alert: Their characters got married in the series finale.)\n\nFor more, watch the full video above.", "images":
