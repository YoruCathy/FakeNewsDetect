In an interview with British GQ, she says, \u201cFor a female artist, it takes a lot more to be taken seriously if you\u2019re not sat down at a piano or with a guitar, you know.\u201d She also added her perspective on the music industry for males. She says, \u201cFor a male artist, people instantly assume they write their own music, but for women, they assume it\u2019s all manufactured.\u201d\n\nDua Lipa understands the stuff she is saying considering she does not play any instruments while she sings, but she does write all of her own songs. She is credited to all but two songs on her album as her own words.\n\nPutting aside her frustrations with the music industry, Dua Lipa is in the process of writing music for her new album and according to her, it is all about \u201cdance crying.\u201d She says, \u201cIt is a pop album that you\u2019re going to be able to dance to, but a lot of the songs are sad.\u201d\n\nThe May issue of British GQ will be available on April 5.", "images": ["https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/themes/LargeGridRes/images/twitter-icon.png", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ad.jpg", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/LOGO2.jpg", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/themes/LargeGridRes/images/picasa-icon.png", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/themes/LargeGridRes/images/pinterest-icon.png", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/may_print_cover-785x1024.jpg", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/themes/LargeGridRes/images/facebook-icon.png", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/themes/LargeGridRes/images/youtube-icon.png", "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-31-at-9.10.03-PM.png"], "top_img": "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-31-at-9.10.03-PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://glittermagrocks.com/connect/2018/04/01/dua-lipa-points-out-sexism-in-the-music-industry-with-british-gq/", "title": "Dua Lipa Points out Sexism in the Music Industry with British GQ", "meta_data": {"description": "Dua Lipa points out the underlying sexism in the music industry and wants some new rules put in place for female artists.
