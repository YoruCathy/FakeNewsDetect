But this is not a dress code that applies to Los Angeles-born, former New York resident Gigi Hadid. On Thursday, the supermodel was spotted walking down the street in SoHo rocking a pair of high-waisted, flowing white pants that feature thigh-high splits up the sides that were dangerously close to coming in contact with the slush on the sidewalk. She paired the chic trousers with an off-white sweater, a small M2malletier backpack, sunglasses, and knee-high snakeskin boots.\n\nIt's worth noting that the temperatures in New York City this week are in the 20s and 30s\u2014in other words, below freezing. Hadid understandably looks sort of uncomfortable in a few of the photos, considering the freezing winds were hitting her (yet making her hair look flowing and fabulous). Imaginably, running through her head were visions of the dozens of fashionable and warm coats she saw at New York Fashion Week, Milan Fashion Week, and Paris Fashion Week, where the model walked on a slew of runways, including Jeremy Scott, Versace, Fendi, MaxMara, and Balmain. In fact, her risky white outfit is reminiscent of one she wore on Jeremy Scott's New York Fashion Week runway, which featured white, flowing bell bottoms and a matching jacket, both bedazzled with multicolor rhinestones.\n\nCheck out a few photos of Gigi's look below.\n\nJames Devaney/GC Images\n\nPhoto by James Devaney/GC Images\n\nPhoto by Raymond Hall/GC Images\n\nGigi Hadid Loves Fashion
