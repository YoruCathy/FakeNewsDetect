Blake Shelton: country singer, Voice judge, boyfriend of Gwen Stefani, and frequent purveyor of weird gay panic, misogyny, and Islamophobia.\n\nIf naming Shelton was a publicity stunt, it worked: Twitter users were so startled by the revelation that both \u201cBlake Shelton\u201d and \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d trended for most of Wednesday, and the jokes flowed loudly and freely:\n\neven a straight man can see there's no way blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. i dont think he's even the sexiest man named blake shelton. \u2014 Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 15, 2017\n\nwoke up this morning to news that blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. rip every sexy man in the world who died in the great sexy plague of 2017 overnight; u will be missed \u2014 I do not recall (@morninggloria) November 15, 2017\n\nThis is sexier than Blake Shelton https://t.co/j3B9B9cN4A \u2014 Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) November 15, 2017\n\nMany social media users were quick to compare Shelton\u2019s looks to things that are \u2014 how can we put this? \u2014 not sexy:\n\nBlake Shelton looks like the dad in a drug commercial where they list off the side effects at the end while you watch him build a birdhouse. \u2014 DeShawn (@DeShawnstantine) November 15, 2017\n\nLet's set the record straight: Blake Shelton looks like a second-stringer on Justified who gets murdered over a horse crime. \u2014 Kaleb Horton (@kalebhorton) November 15, 2017\n\nIf Blake Shelton is voted #SexiestManAlive then Ray Black Jr. is 2017's most popular driver. For real. Blake Shelton looks like a server at a Cracker Barrel in Gatlinburg. \u2014 nascarcasm (@nascarcasm) November 15, 2017\n\nBlake Shelton looks like a guy who gets shredded by everyone on Shark Tank for the outrageous valuation he places on his pre-revenue floating \u201cbeer cup\u201d that he invented after his wife left him, and it doesn\u2019t get much sexier than that. \u2014 Gabe Delahaye (@gabedelahaye) November 15, 2017\n\nblake Shelton looks like your middle school bus driver who got fired for buying four loko for the intimidating 8th graders who sit on the back of the bus https://t.co/fQCpg4Xx2g \u2014 maggie (@MaggieShmaggie) November 15, 2017\n\nOf course, People is routinely derided for its choice of Sexiest Man Alive, which is a transparently PR-driven exercise often jokingly equated to a \u201cbest publicist\u201d award. As such, each year\u2019s choice invites a wave of alternate opinions, and 2017 is no exception, with social media users being quick to point out other, sexier alternatives to Shelton:\n\nThe same people who voted in People\u2019s sexiest alive man list are the same folks who tampered w/ the presidential elections\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no way Blake Shelton is the sexiest man w/ Trevante Rhodes still breathing. pic.twitter.com/cd5NTcKJp4 \u2014 Corey Townsend (@JarrieBradshaw) November 15, 2017\n\nTwitter users had many opinions on who the actual sexiest men of the year were, but a general consensus seemed to form around the triad of perennially overlooked frontrunner Idris Elba, upcoming Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, and the usual gaggle of white guys named Chris:\n\nForget the fact that Idris Elba should\u2019ve obviously won. I can even think of like 5 white guys named Chris who are more deserving of the Sexiest Man Alive title than Blake Shelton. \u2014 Brohibition Now (@OhNoSheTwitnt) November 15, 2017\n\nBlake Shelton is People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night. \u2014 Jenn C (@TheJennC) November 15, 2017\n\nBut despite the jokes, there\u2019s plenty of reason beyond the subjective nature of sexiness to be critical of People\u2019s decision \u2014 namely because Shelton has been flagrantly and repeatedly homophobic in the past, once \u201cjoking\u201d in a 2011 tweet that he would leave any gay man who tried to touch him beaten and bloody.\n\nHe also used the stage at the Country Music Awards for an awkward gay joke about Jake Gyllenhaal because he starred in Brokeback Mountain, and has repeatedly referenced gay panic and jokes about finding lesbians hot on his Twitter account. In the past, he\u2019s made toxic jokes about women, including noting, in 2010, a \u201csick fantasy\u201d about then-16-year-old Dakota Fanning, and has repeatedly made Islamophobic and xenophobic jokes about non-English-language speakers and foreigners around him.\n\nLast year, after the tweets were uncovered and public outcry arose, he attempted to pass off all of his statements as comedy. Yet since then he\u2019s gone on to openly decry \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d and last year praised Donald Trump for \u201csay[ing] what he thinks,\u201d without acknowledging the coded racism and bigotry that often underlies Trump\u2019s statements.\n\nAfter the news about Shelton\u2019s new title began circulating, many began pointing out the singer\u2019s problematic history:\n\nI guess it makes sense in Trump's America that an Islamophobe who \"jokes\" about beating up gay men would be named the \"Sexiest Man Alive.\" \u2014 Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) November 15, 2017\n\nFor anyone who wants to shame people for making fun of the fact that Blake Shelton is \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d (barf) remember that he\u2019s a giant homophobe who once wrote a parody to \u201cAny Man Of Mine\u201d by Shania Twain that describes him assaulting men who show interest in him. FYI. \u2014 Sexiest Man Alive, Dan Blackroyd (@danblackroyd) November 15, 2017\n\nJust in case you guys didn't know, not only did Blake Shelton tweet racist & homophobic things he also made jokes about having \"sick fantasies\" about Dakota Fanning when she was 16 \u2014 Tatum Robinson (@TatumAlexis10) November 15, 2017\n\nStill, some were quick to point out that it\u2019s not the first time People has made odd decisions in its annual Sexiest Man vote. For starters, the list has historically been overwhelmingly white, with only two men of color ever gracing its cover \u2014 Denzel Washington in 1996 and The Rock in 2016. This fact, combined with backlash over Shelton, had many onlookers pointing out how problematic the list has historically been.\n\njust a reminder that only two men of color have been picked as the sexiest man alive in 32 years, people magazine is trash https://t.co/TVDNNcCMch \u2014 adam (@brokeangeI) November 15, 2017\n\nNot to mention how weird some of the choices have been:\n\nClearly, People\u2019s Sexiest Man award is yet another public institution that needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from its sexy foundations.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673215/GettyImages_1210313196.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66651909/1201158477.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673258/GettyImages_1219080127.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDgMsl6TUCtNqkcsJ3oD6CIdrD4=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9688379/868632848.jpg.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672824/GettyImages_491031770.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672963/GettyImages_1208286960.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673052/GettyImages_1210354251.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBXhruRr-_51X8BbW0BTCFgDcvk=/0x0:3000x2143/1200x800/filters:focal(781x247:1261x727)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57622937/868632848.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDgMsl6TUCtNqkcsJ3oD6CIdrD4=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9688379/868632848.jpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aja Romano", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Riley Beggin", "Dylan Matthews", "Li Zhou", "Ella Nilsen", "Nov"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/15/16657338/blake-shelton-sexiest-man-backlash", "title": "Blake Shelton is People magazine\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man\u201d of 2017.
