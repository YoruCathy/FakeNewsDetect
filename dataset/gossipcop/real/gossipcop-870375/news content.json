Their witty statement, issued through their spokesman, Stan Rosenfield, on June 6, said, \"This morning Amal and George welcomed Ella and Alexander Clooney into their lives. Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine. George is sedated and should recover in a few days.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2595895dcc72c624475b87e1a61624713f3a9459/c=0-187-3443-2132/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636371332593202819-AFP-AFP-R29IY.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5527651092001_5527646426001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2595895dcc72c624475b87e1a61624713f3a9459/c=0-187-3443-2132/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636371332593202819-AFP-AFP-R29IY.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2595895dcc72c624475b87e1a61624713f3a9459/c=0-187-3443-2132/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636371332593202819-AFP-AFP-R29IY.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/08/01/clooney-foundation-fund-schools-syrian-refugees/527877001/", "title": "Clooney foundation to fund schools for Syrian refugees", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Clooney foundation to fund schools for Syrian refugees", "description": "The Clooneys' foundation is planning to open seven public schools for Syrian refugee children in Lebanon.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/08/01/clooney-foundation-fund-schools-syrian-refugees/527877001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2595895dcc72c624475b87e1a61624713f3a9459/c=0-187-3443-2132/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636371332593202819-AFP-AFP-R29IY.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The Clooneys' foundation is planning to open seven public schools for Syrian refugee children in Lebanon.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2595895dcc72c624475b87e1a61624713f3a9459/c=0-187-3443-2132/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636371332593202819-AFP-AFP-R29IY.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Clooney foundation to fund schools for Syrian refugees", "description": "The Clooneys' foundation is planning to open seven public schools for Syrian refugee children in Lebanon."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501516800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
