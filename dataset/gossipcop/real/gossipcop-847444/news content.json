Most of us don\u2019t get to experience what seasonal produce some chef named Serge is offering at a Michelin-starred restaurant, but darn it if I can\u2019t go to Hardee\u2019s and eat a burger with some weird boneless ribs on it that were marketed on Shark Tank (yes, this is a thing).\n\nThese limited-time offers are where fast food gets weird, and when fast food gets weird, it gets fun. There are a couple of basic rules for running a good promotion.\n\nDid you cram more crap on your food? Why didn\u2019t you cram more crap on your food?\n\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s simple. What McDonald\u2019s has done with this whole \u201cfrork\u201d fiasco is asked me to change my eating habits. It makes no damn sense. This is the veil being pulled off corporate America. Some dude in a $5,000 suit named \u201cTodd,\u201d probably with a \u201cJr.\u201d or \u201cIII\u201d on the end of his name, was looking for brownie points by saying: \u201cYou know, I think America wants an edible fork.\u201d\n\nNO I DON\u2019T WANT A DAMN EDIBLE FORK, TODD. I WANT TO CRAM THE FOOD INTO MY MOUTH CHUTE WITH MY UNWASHED HANDS BEFORE BLOWING MY NOSE ON THE GREASE-COVERED BAG AND SHAMEFULLY REALIZING I FINISHED AN ENTIRE MEAL AT A STOP LIGHT AND THEN SEEING THAT THE PERSON IN THE CAR NEXT TO ME VIDEO\u2019D ALL THIS. THAT\u2019S WHAT I WANT, TODD.\n\nThe frork appeals to a very limited part of the fast food Venn diagram, all of whom are idiots. It\u2019s people who want to keep their hands clean while eating, but also who want to get grease all over their fingers while they cram greasy fries into a fork-shaped holder.\n\nGOD, TODD, I SWEAR I HATE YOU SO MUCH.\n\nThey even released an infomercial about these things.\n\nLook, I know what you\u2019re thinking: This is all a tongue-in-cheek joke. I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s a joke. Time and effort were wasted on the frork that could have been used working out how to give me portable poutine at fast-food prices.\n\n\u201cA limited supply of Frorks will be available with the purchase of a Signature Crafted Recipes sandwich on May 5 at participating restaurants. These sandwiches sell for between $4.99 and $5.19.\u201d\n\nGosh wow. I really couldn\u2019t have worked out this was going to be a limited supply. You mean to tell me that this trash idea created by an idiot named Todd (probably) is only going to be a small test? Wow \u2014 couldn\u2019t have worked that one out.\n\nAnd you know the part that really annoys me. There\u2019s going to be someone out there who calls themselves a \u201cfast food historian\u201d who\u2019s going to line up on May 5 and try to get a frork.\n\nI have such a high tolerance for bad promotions, but goodness if this doesn\u2019t make me mad. I\u2019m just going to try to forget this happened, ignore the frork ads, and wistfully lose myself in the Pizza Hut \u201cPriazzo\u201d ad when they tried to make deep dish pizza in the \u201980s.\n\nP.S. Still hate you, Todd.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82rp-1qMJY2MwrH5CGopz8coWME=/0x0:480x270/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54565101/C_wwfNxXcAEONBL.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/50859337/Lookit-Logo.vd43face.0.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82rp-1qMJY2MwrH5CGopz8coWME=/0x0:480x270/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54565101/C_wwfNxXcAEONBL.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Dator", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/5/1/15506376/mcdonalds-french-fry-fork-frork-promotion-what-is-this-video", "title": "This McDonald's french fry fork is infuriatingly stupid", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "SB Nation", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/SB-Nation/39606211535", "published_time": "2017-05-01T15:52:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-01T15:52:07-04:00"}, "author": "James Dator", "style-tools": "https://www.sbnation.com/style/community/247/c082338a7b3e875470a3be83b8a18e6e/tools.css", "twitter": {"user_id": 16745015, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/5/1/15506376/mcdonalds-french-fry-fork-frork-promotion-what-is-this-video", "title": "This McDonald's french fry fork is infuriatingly stupid", "description": "It\u2019s made out of fries and nothing in the world is right anymore.", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82rp-1qMJY2MwrH5CGopz8coWME=/0x0:480x270/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54565101/C_wwfNxXcAEONBL.0.jpg", "site": "SBNation"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "p": {"domain_verify": "e2158eab5a7dc9311e2dd3f866f0432f"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "It\u2019s made out of fries and nothing in the world is right anymore.", "og": {"description": "It\u2019s made out of fries and nothing in the world is right anymore.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82rp-1qMJY2MwrH5CGopz8coWME=/0x0:480x270/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54565101/C_wwfNxXcAEONBL.0.jpg", "height": 900, "width": 1600}, "site_name": "SBNation.com", "title": "This McDonald's french fry fork is infuriatingly stupid", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2017/5/1/15506376/mcdonalds-french-fry-fork-frork-promotion-what-is-this-video"}, "sailthru.title": "This McDonald's french fry fork is infuriatingly stupid", "sailthru.tags": "general,front-page,lookit", "sailthru.description": "It\u2019s made out of fries and nothing in the world is right anymore.", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-01T15:52:07-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82rp-1qMJY2MwrH5CGopz8coWME=/0x0:480x270/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54565101/C_wwfNxXcAEONBL.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jYqsGnE24pazXu4r9ifkrdgzJTw=/105x0:375x270/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54565101/C_wwfNxXcAEONBL.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/dev/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8108505/sandbox-www-data-ip-10-0-0-66_/sandbox_favicon-144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0033FF", "outbrainsection": "lookit"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltxLeLGozDk?wmode=transparent&rel=0&autohide=1&enablejsapi=1", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufepKsG3dc8?wmode=transparent&rel=0&autohide=1&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1493568000.0, "source": "https://www.sbnation.com", "summary": ""}
