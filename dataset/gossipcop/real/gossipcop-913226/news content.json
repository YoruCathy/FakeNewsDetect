Anything! He\u2019d f\u2014 a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.\u201d\n\nLast week, Pryor\u2019s widow Jennifer confirmed the rumor, telling TMZ that her late husband was always open about his bisexuality with friends and would not be ashamed that the relationship was revealed publicly. She also said the comedy icon wrote about sleeping with men extensively in diaries, which she says she plans to release later this year.\n\nImage zoom Getty; Bettmann/Getty\n\n\u201cIt was the \u201970s! Drugs were still good, especially Quaaludes,\u201d Jennifer said. \u201cIf you did enough cocaine, you\u2019d f\u2014 a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that she thinks Pryor would be having a good laugh if he heard Jones had spread the news.\n\nBut one of Pryor\u2019s daughters also denied the alleged affair, posting an impassioned post about her father on Facebook, slamming both Jones and Pryor\u2019s widow as a \u201cbottom feeders.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll you who touted Faux News and preach about wanting blacks to be represented in a great light and then posted Q\u2019s interview are irrelevant and full of your own BS,\u201d Rain, 48, wrote. \u201cQ, was once a brilliant music producer who is losing his mind, and decided to garner publicity for himself with a sensationalized interview; and because y\u2019all think and equate Fame and Money with decency, you ate it up like thirsty dogs, as he spewed out a lie about my father who\u2019s not here to defend himself.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Quincy Jones Claims He \u2018Used to Date\u2019 Ivanka Trump\n\nPryor \u2014 widely regarded as one of the most influential stand-ups of all time \u2014 was married seven times to five different women. Jennifer was both his fourth and seventh bride. They married in August 1981, divorced in October 1982, and later remarried on June 29, 2001. They were together until Pryor\u2019s death in 2005.\n\nHe also had relationships with actresses Pam Grier and Margot Kidder.\n\nBrando \u2014 considered one of Hollywood\u2019s all-time greatest actors and a legendary sex symbol \u2014 was married three times, had numerous girlfriends and was father to 11 children.
