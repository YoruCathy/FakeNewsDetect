However, they were spotted out together in Australia just days after news of their split broke.\n\nImage zoom Elon Musk/Instagram\n\nMusk said that he \u201ccannot be happy\u201d without a girlfriend.\n\n\u201c\u2018I never want to be alone.\u2019 That\u2019s what I would say,\u201d he explained. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d\n\nDespite having a successful career, he said his life feels empty without someone to share it with.\n\n\u201cI will never be happy without having someone. Going to sleep alone kills me,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know what that feels like: Being in a big empty house, and the footsteps echoing through the hallway, no one there \u2014 and no one on the pillow next to you. F\u2014. How do you make yourself happy in a situation like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anybody you think I should date? It\u2019s so hard for me to even meet people,\u201d he asked Rolling Stone\u2018s Neil Strauss. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a long-term relationship. I\u2019m not looking for a one-night stand. I\u2019m looking for a serious companion or soulmate, that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amber Heard on Coming Out in Hollywood: \u2018Everyone Told Me It Would End My Career\u2019\n\nHeard said in Allure\u2019s December cover story that she was told coming out as bisexual would destroy her film career.\n\n\u201cEveryone told me: \u2018You cannot do this.\u2019 I had played opposite Nicolas Cage [in one movie], and in another I was playing opposite Johnny [Depp],\u201d the Aquaman star said.\n\n\u201cAnd everyone said, \u2018You\u2019re throwing it all away.
