This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nBoth actresses left the long-running ABC medical drama earlier this month, with rumors swirling that Pompeo's salary made \"Grey's\" unable to keep them on.\n\nWhile Pompeo wasn't certain why Capshaw and Drew are no longer cast members, she guessed it was a creative decision on the show's part.\n\n\"I mean, I\u2019m not involved in these kind of decisions; however, there\u2019s a few problems that you encounter doing a show for 14 seasons,\" she explained. \"One of them is the writers have a really hard time creatively thinking up new stories for all these characters. I think we have 16 regular cast members, and I think it\u2019s always sad when we lose people for whatever reason.\"\n\n\"Whether they want to go or don\u2019t want to go, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier,\" she added.\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy\" star Ellen Pompeo opened up about rumors that her salary caused other actresses to be fired from the series. Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nPompeo, an outspoken advocate for equal pay for women in Hollywood, revealed she was upset by the rumors because they create a catfight-like story where there isn't one.\n\n\"I think that it\u2019s important for us to not pit women against each other and to really dispel the notion that women are always victims,\" said the star. \"You don\u2019t have to pit us against each other. We\u2019re not enemies. We do lift each other up and support each other, and we\u2019re not victims. We\u2019re very strong and we\u2019re capable of many, many things.\"\n\nWatch the discussion in the video above.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1326781/ellen-pompeo-today-tease-180322_3ff29f53daaa134e631e397f9a30a91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201706/2017-06-05T13-21-44-833Z--1280x720.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1326781/ellen-pompeo-today-tease-180322_3ff29f53daaa134e631e397f9a30a91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/ellen-pompeo-says-20-million-salary-didn-t-push-grey-t125696", "title": "Ellen Pompeo says $20 million salary didn't push 'Grey's Anatomy' co-stars out", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/ellen-pompeo-says-20-million-salary-didn-t-push-grey-t125696", "title": "Ellen Pompeo says $20 million salary didn\u2019t push \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 co-stars out", "description": "Pompeo, now the highest paid actress in a primetime drama, opened up about the chatter when she stopped by \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on Thursday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1326781/ellen-pompeo-today-tease-180322_3ff29f53daaa134e631e397f9a30a91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1326781/ellen-pompeo-today-tease-180322_3ff29f53daaa134e631e397f9a30a91a.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1326781/ellen-pompeo-today-tease-180322_3ff29f53daaa134e631e397f9a30a91a.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Ellen Pompeo says $20 million salary didn\u2019t push \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 co-stars out", "description": "Pompeo, now the highest paid actress in a primetime drama, opened up about the chatter when she stopped by \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on Thursday.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Pompeo, now the highest paid actress in a primetime drama, opened up about the chatter when she stopped by \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" on Thursday.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_12/1326781/ellen-pompeo-today-tease-180322_3ff29f53daaa134e631e397f9a30a91a.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/laT8M1x16QE"], "publish_date": 1521750600.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
