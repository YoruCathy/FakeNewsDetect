I haven\u2019t made one mistake that I haven\u2019t used as a stepping stone to get somewhere else. I\u2019m ruthless when it comes to using the hard things.\u201d\n\nShe defended her wellness and luxury lifestyle brand Goop, which has been criticised for promoting \u00a3260 \u201csex dust\u201d smoothies and pyjamas costing \u00a3225.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople were fine with me as an actress, but with Goop it was like, \u2018Stay in your lane\u2019. Women, in general, get a lot of pushback, especially if you\u2019re successful and attractive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying I\u2019m attractive. I mean when you\u2019re considered attractive.\u201d\n\nThe mother of two stood by the term \u201cconsciously uncoupling\u201d \u2014 the phrase that she and Martin used when announcing their separation in 2014.\n\nShe said: \u201cPeople are coming around. I know it\u2019s a dorky term, but it\u2019s very worthwhile.\n\n\"I\u2019m always the person who gets shit at first, but then later people say, \u2018Hey, maybe that\u2019s a good idea,\u2019 I don\u2019t mind. I wanted to turn my divorce into a positive.\n\n\u201cWhat if I didn\u2019t blame the other person for anything and held myself 100 per cent accountable? What if I checked my own shit at the door and put my children first?\n\n\"And reminded myself about the things about my ex-husband that I love and fostered the friendship? What I put myself through to get there was the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d\n\nShe said she takes her children Apple, 13, and Moses, 11, everywhere so that she can use them as a \u201cshield\u201d against the paparazzi and also revealed that she even occasionally eased up on her fitness and healthy eating regime.\n\nPaltrow said: \u201cI can\u2019t be on a cleanse all the time\u2026 I did one for seven weeks last year and it was awful. My first meal of the day is normally lunch. I keep it light on carbs so my energy levels don\u2019t peak and valley through the day.\n\n\u201cAt home, I loosen the reins: a glass of wine, maybe a baguette dripping in cheese, some fries\u2026 on vacation, I eat what I want \u2014 and there\u2019s no exercising either.\u201d\n\nTo read the full interview with Gwyneth Paltrow, read The EDIT at www.net-a-porter.com/magazine/404/12 and/or download The EDIT\u2019s free app for iPhone, iPad and Android", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/01/13/editpaltrow0106a.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/01/13/editpaltrow0106a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rashid Razaq"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/gwyneth-paltrow-i-ve-milked-every-opportunity-and-used-every-mistake-as-a-stepping-stone-a3554616.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow: I\u2019ve milked every opportunity and used every mistake as a stepping stone", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "http://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/gwyneth-paltrow-i-ve-milked-every-opportunity-and-used-every-mistake-as-a-stepping-stone-a3554616.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow: I\u2019ve milked every opportunity and used every mistake", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow has spoken about the pain of her divorce and how she has \u201cruthlessly\u201d pursued success.
