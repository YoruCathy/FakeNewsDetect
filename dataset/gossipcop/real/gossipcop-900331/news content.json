She was rescheduled to be a headliner this year, and now, fans are speculating that her set could actually be a Destiny's Child reunion.\n\nSo where is the speculation stemming from? The original members themselves. Bey, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, LeToya Luckett, and LaTavia Roberson have all hinted that something is in the works. Separately, they've all posted what fans believe are clues on social media\u2014from Beyonc\u00e9 rocking an AC/DC shirt, but only showing the \"DC\" letters on IG, to an Instagram story made by Michelle Williams and two posts made by LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett.\n\nMood \u2764\ufe0f#Tbt A post shared by LeToya Luckett-Walker (@letoyaluckett) on Oct 26, 2017 at 3:09pm PDT\n\nConsidering that Bey has a history of embedding clues on social media signaling major news, including the arrival of Lemonade and her twins, Rumi and Sir Carter, fans may be on to something. Add that to the fact that next year marks the 20th anniversary of DC's debut, self-titled album, and the plot definitely thickens.\n\nOf course, Coachella doesn't take place until April, so there's plenty more digging to do. Check out some of fans' detective work and reactions to a possible DC reunion below.\n\nNEXT: 10 R&B Acts That Defined the New Jack Swing Era", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/252/files/2018/04/popcrush-logo-carbon-high-rez-V2.png", "http://townsquare.media/site/625/files/2013/10/boombox-v2.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/625/files/2017/12/destiny-child.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/625/files/2017/12/destiny-child.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacinta Howard"], "canonical_link": "https://theboombox.com/is-destinys-child-reuniting-at-coachella/", "title": "A Destiny\u2019s Child Reunion at Coachella?
