How moms see things and it\u2019s not your typical way because the way I see things, they\u2019re dirty and they\u2019re messy and they\u2019re gross and you love them and you hate them and it\u2019s all those things. It\u2019s also very funny,\" said Bell, who has two daughters, Lincoln, 5, and Delta, 3, with hubby Dax Shepard.\n\nBell, 38, proved her point when she shared sneak peeks from the new six-episode season.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nIn one hilarious segment, Bell visits a family who'd welcomed twins just hours before. There, the \"Frozen\" star presents mom Kimberly Patel with a chilly but useful gift.\n\n\"This is an ice pack for, I think, you know what ... down there,\" Bell whispers to Patel conspiratorially.\n\nBell then reveals a hilariously long list of euphemisms she's given to her own vagina, some too bawdy to mention.\n\nNext comes a touching segment that finds Bell right in a labor and delivery room witnessing new mom Martha Trujillo-Gomez giving birth to her baby girl.\n\n\"Push, push, push,\" the actress chants from Trujillo-Gomez's bedside, where she's squeezed in next to excited family members.\n\nThe whole room erupts in cheers once the new bundle of joy arrives.\n\n\"You are a warrior,\" Bell sweetly tells the new mom.\n\nWhen Bell's video ended, she and DeGeneres welcomed Patel and Trujillo-Gomez to the stage, where Bell thanked the moms for allowing her to be a part of their birth experiences.\n\n\"You let me get so up close and personal,\" she said, before quipping, \"I was in the splash zone!\"\n\nWatch Bell's special motherhood moments in the videos above!", "images":
