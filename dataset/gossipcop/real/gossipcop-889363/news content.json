When asked what he thought about Chris Harrison on the Rose Buds podcast, he quickly responded with \u201ca\u2014hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrior to the whole Corinne show, [Harrison] had a hard on for me as if like, I like, hooked up with his wife or something. It was crazy,\u201d Jackson said on the Tuesday, October 24 episode. \u201cI met this guy three total times for less than 10 seconds and he legit hated \u2026 like, when I say hate, like deep-rooted. Like him and I at the Men Tell All, we had like 30 minutes of battle and I\u2019m like \u2018Bro, Lexi, I was already told they put her up to it.\u2019 Then he went to the press and talked all this s\u2013t when we were in the middle of all this.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Men Tell All taping, Harrison spoke about Jackson\u2019s style. \u201cHe\u2019s a loudmouth, he\u2019s funny, it\u2019s DeMario,\u201d the host told E! \u201cYou take him with a grain of salt, for sure. He said probably the most horrible, sexist, misogynistic things and then started jumping on Lee about being a misogynist. So if anybody should not be throwing stones in this glass house, probably DeMario.\u201d\n\nAfter Rachel Lindsay sent Jackson home from The Bachelorette, he went on Bachelor in Paradise, where he was involved in an alleged sexual assault scandal with Corinne Olympios. Production was temporarily shut down and Warner Bros. later confirmed the the show was cleared of all allegations. However, neither Jackson nor Olympios returned and they were not allowed to see or speak to one another until their sit-down interview with Harrison, which aired in August.\n\n\u201cIt was to the point where like, 100 percent, I kept it real,\u201d Jackson continued. \u201cI called Louie and said \u2018if he tries this shit when I do the sit down with Corinne, I will knock him the f**k out. Like period. Like straight up.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like the blatant disrespect for a man that I do not know,\u201d the reality star continued. \u201cLike bro, I met you three times. It\u2019s funny because the media will portray certain people in certain lights and what not, but he had a crazy hard on for me and I did not get it at all. It was nuts.\u201d\n\nAs for the next season of The Bachelor, Jackson is pretty confused about Arie Luyendyk Jr.leading the pack.\n\n\u201cPeople were like pretending that they wanted it. People were like \u2018Well, I think because he\u2019s removed and blah, blah.\u2019 And I\u2019m like \u2018Yo, they brought a fake girlfriend on the show for me. This guy leaves his actual girlfriend for the show but yet he\u2019s the Bachelor because of that, but DeMario does it and it\u2019s different,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, come on people,\u201d Jackson said on the podcast. \u201cCome on, I mean, you can\u2019t have this \u2026 old guy with all these 23-year-olds who just want fame and Instagram followers \u2026 Like, that\u2019s common sense.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole-2.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-on-bachelor-in-paradise.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/demario-jackson-calls-chris-harrison-hole/", "title": "DeMario Jackson Calls Chris Harrison an \u2018A\u2014hole\u2019: Listen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "DeMario Jackson clearly holds a grudge against \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 host Chris Harrison, calling him an a--hole in a new interview \u2014 listen here", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "DeMario Jackson Calls Chris Harrison an 'A--hole': Listen", "description": "DeMario Jackson clearly holds a grudge against \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 host Chris Harrison, calling him an a--hole in a new interview \u2014 listen here", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/demario-jackson-calls-chris-harrison-hole/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:35+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-25T20:29:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:35+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "DeMario Jackson clearly holds a grudge against \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 host Chris Harrison, calling him an a--hole in a new interview \u2014 listen here", "title": "DeMario Jackson Calls Chris Harrison an 'A--hole': Listen", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson-chris-harrison-asshole-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508963368.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
