The polarising nature of his legacy.\n\nFor, while some commend him for maintaining his position as one of the world\u2019s biggest stars, many cite his declining pure sales and quality of his new material as grounds for their refusal to name him one of the greats.\n\nWorrying, as he now finds himself forced to look on as Beyonce, Rihanna, Bruno Mars and Drake elevated to heights his critics believe he will never reach.\n\nYou can tell Chris Brown writes his own music. 1. Bc it\u2019s repetitive 2. It\u2019s basic. He\u2019s not living up to his potential, and he had chances to do so, but being rich since an early teen kinda hinders your growth as person. Or so I\u2019ve heard. \u2014 ehhhh (@muhfugginjkells) February 11, 2018\n\nNow, the critical mass has launched a scathing attack on his art after he took to Twitter to reveal that he\u2019d like to tour with the first three artists mentioned above.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe public\u2019s estimation of Chris\u2019 career below\u2026\n\nLmao Chris brown really has been making the same cheap ass music for years. I always felt like I was alone in that \u2014 Angela Renay (@angie_goodwood) May 10, 2017\n\ny\u2019all smokin crisp dick if you think Chris Brown could bring anything to a Beyonce/Rihanna/Bruno concert. \u2014 kit es muy frio (@kxxvik) February 10, 2018\n\nI\u2019m so tired of yall hyping up Chris Brown and his dancing. Like that nigga is gassed up way too much just to be doing some simple ass pop/lock and flips. If he were to EVER get the opp to go on tour with Bruno,\n\nRihanna, or Beyonce, he\u2019d be opening for them IN THAT ORDER. pic.twitter.com/4ZE0BkU2BW \u2014 \ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf6f\ud83c\udf4b (@virgheaux_) February 12, 2018\n\n.@chrisbrown you should\u2019ve said a world tour with Usher, not Beyonce. You no where near her level. Whoever gassed you up, lied to you Beyonce has more #1 albums and #1 hits than you.\n\nBeyonce doesn\u2019t lip sync. And she can sing & dance at same damn time! Something you can\u2019t do \u2014 Kayla\u2019s Dad (@Byron_mk7r) February 12, 2018\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 Chris Brown fans so delusional some think he\u2019s a better performer than Beyonc\u00e8 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Beyonc\u00e8 sells out stadiums world wide stoppppp itttt \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 aunt veev (@veevgabrielle) February 13, 2018\n\nChris Brown has an entire swarm of DELUSIONAL fans who don\u2019t buy his music . They been in my mentions all day with these alternative facts pic.twitter.com/sPL3tRY9Kw \u2014 tony (@gawdcompIexx) February 12, 2018\n\nyall really trying to convince people that chris brown has classics and is on par with beyonce? delusional \u2014 camille (@camilllionairre) February 12, 2018\n\nChris Brown fans are by far the actual dumbest, most delusional people I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure to interact with. pic.twitter.com/OaeUjTuGbm \u2014 Damiyonc\u00e9 (@macaDAMIANut_) February 12, 2018\n\nThe only time Beyonc\u00e9 was inspired by Chris Brown pic.twitter.com/pWeEOio2eZ \u2014 Beys Industry (@BeysIndustry) February 12, 2018\n\nRihanna is a full-out mogul. Beyonc\u00e9 is hailed as the greatest living entertainer by legends. Bruno has done with 3 albums what Chris Brown still hasn\u2019t achieved after 8. Are you trying to drag him yourself or are you really this delusional? https://t.co/ao5wa3AxRd \u2014 ladies is pimps too (@ultimatenegro) February 10, 2018\n\nchris brown really put himself in the same category as rihanna, beyonce, and bruno mars. i\u2019m logging off. \u2014 king crissle (@crissles) February 9, 2018\n\nChris Brown\u2019s boxscores from his recent tour. Struggled to sell out arenas, but somehow he\u2019s on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s lvl and surpassed Michael Jackson. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/9gj6L440Zz \u2014 TenNumber-OnesBish (@BeyonceStanBish) February 12, 2018\n\ny\u2019all just be retweeting anything. Rihanna has 14 #1 hits, Bruno Mars has 7 #1 hits, Beyonc\u00e9 has 6 #1 hits and Chris Brown only has 2. That nigga ain\u2019t no where close to their level and y\u2019all need to stop boosting him pic.twitter.com/sAMoZJTMvG \u2014 reggie (@1942bs) February 11, 2018\n\nBeyonc\u00e9: *Serves SUPERIOR vocals, performs without running out of breath, has 22 Grammys, 6 #1\u2019s, all albums #1, gives outstanding performances, has a Peabody award, has ASCAP writing award, last album has over 100 awards* Ashy twitter: \u201cChris Brown can do a backflip tho\u201d \u2014 \ud83c\udf43 (@zaddyyonce) February 12, 2018\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffe You\u2019re a real Chris Brown fan. Wasn\u2019t no way in hell I was gone listen to his voice for 4 hours \u2014 King of the Amazons\ud83e\udd34\ud83c\udffe (@BlackSupaMon) February 13, 2018\n\nTotally unfair.\n\nHowever, with so many agreeing with the messages above, we hope the undeniably gifted Brown uses the criticism as motivation to deliver music and videos just as brilliant he is.\n\nBruno\u2019s first & 2nd album went 6x platinum. None of CBs done that. Which is why he can sell out arenas dolo and CB as of late needs all his friends on the card. He got lazy and now reduced to being on rap hooks w/ 2012 Wayne bars being sung \u2014 Just Be You (@WalkLikeWalt) February 12, 2018\n\nYour thoughts?", "images":
