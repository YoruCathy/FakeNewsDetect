Kramer has denied the allegations.\n\nHer account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time\u2019s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film \u201cTrue Lies.\u201d According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he \u201claid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.\u201d Kramer would have been 36 at the time.\n\nDushku alleges that he \u201cmethodically built my and my parents\u2019 trust, for months grooming me,\u201d and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel\u2019s pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he \u201cdisappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.\u201d\n\nKramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku\u2019s allegations were \u201cabsolutely not true.\u201d According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku\u2019s stunt double. Afterwards, he took her to her first ever sushi meal, and then took her home.\n\nAfter the alleged assault, Dushku wrote, he suggested they should \u201cbe careful,\u201d referring to talking about the incident.\n\nDushku also wrote that while in a taxi back to her hotel, Kramer held her on his lap in the backseat. According to Kramer, he drove the car to take her home.\n\nShe also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of \u201cTrue Lies,\u201d referring to it as \u201cno small coincidence\u201d when she was injured on-set after a \u201ctough adult female friend\u201d faced him about the alleged assault.\n\n\u201cWith broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming \u2018True Lies,\u2019 it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.\u201d\n\nShe also wrote that Kramer would call her \u201cJailbait,\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the \u201cover-the-top special attention he gave me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve really struggled as I\u2019ve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.\u201d\n\nDushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been \u201cfound out\u201d and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.\n\n\u201cAnd a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.\u201d\n\nShe expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.\n\nKramer stated that he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d and \u201cfloored\u201d by the allegations, and that he \u201cnever molested her\u201d and was \u201cnever nude in front of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,\u201d he said.\n\nKramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d and \u201cFurious 7,\u201d said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was \u201calways asking questions\u201d about him, which caused him to feel he had to \u201chandle her with kid gloves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,\u201d he said. \u201cWe treated her like family, she was part of our crew.\u201d\n\nHe referred to the allegations as \u201cabsurd,\u201d asserting that it would have made no sense for him to act in the manner he accused her of. \u201cWho in their right mind would do something like that, when you\u2019re a high-profile coordinator on a shoot like that with months left of shooting?\u201d\n\nDushku\u2019s legal guardian on the set of \u201cTrue Lies,\u201d Sue Booth-Forbes, issued a statement supporting Dushku\u2019s account to Deadline Hollywood.\n\n\u201cEliza Dushku is telling the truth,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI was on the \u2018True Lies\u2019 set for three weeks and reported Joel Kramer\u2019s inappropriate sexual behavior towards 12-year-old Eliza to a person in authority. I was met with blank stares and had the sense that I wasn\u2019t telling that person anything they didn\u2019t already know.\u201d", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Feliza-dushku-molested-stunt-coordinator-joel-kramer-1202663967%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202663967&comment_count=75", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/eliza-dushku.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/eliza-dushku.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Nyren"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/eliza-dushku-molested-stunt-coordinator-joel-kramer-1202663967/", "title": "Eliza Dushku Says \u2018True Lies\u2019 Stunt Coordinator Sexually Assaulted Her When She Was 12", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old.
