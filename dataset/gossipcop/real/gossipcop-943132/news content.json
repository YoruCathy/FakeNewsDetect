So, if Mandy Moore felt passionate about a certain eyeliner, it's probably the best eyeliner of the bests.\n\nIn her Instagram stories yesterday, the 34-year-old actress and singer (has her \"This Is Us\" career usurped her \"Candy\" days? Maybe, but I'm still holding on) expressed a strong sentiment about the eyeliner she had on.\n\nShe wrote, \"When you 3>\n\nImage zoom Instagram\n\nThe eyeliner of note? Moore's makeup artist was nice enough to divulge to me that he used Mac's Fluidline in Delineate ($18; bloomingdales.com).\n\nThe Fluidline shade that Matin used has, unfortunately, been discontinued\u2013fortunately, however, he employed different products for a color scheme in the same vein (also, he notes, Mac has a Fluideline color called Macroviolet that's plum). That night, Moore appeared on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" looking incredible in a red dress with blush over-the-knee boots and color-coordinated makeup.\n\nBecause she loved the earlier color so much, Matin said, \"We decided to keep the look for the eve monochromatic in the plummy tones.\"\n\nOf course, the products Matin used to create Moore's beautiful look last night are only a piece of the plum-hued equation.\n\nHe revealed some of his technique, telling me, \"To create the little bit of smoke and contour, I used the two pale lavender shades [of Mac's Pro Eye Palette: The Romantic ($40; maccosmetics.com)] and pumped up the color with the plum/ reddish tone.\" So... that's how you get an eyeshadow color that leaves Instagram swooning.\n\n\"I warmed up the cream on my hand and then applied to her lid with my ring finger,\" he said of the application process. \"I liked the top thicker again and a thinner line on the bottom but extended both lines past her eyes without closing the two lines. I left a 3mm gap between the top and bottom liner to create the illusion of a longer eye shape.\"\n\nAs an if-I-were-stranded-on-a-desert-island-I'd-take-mascara-over-food person, Matin's last steps caught me a little off-guard.\n\nThe makeup pro revealed, \"I used [the eyelash extensions] Lashify but no mascara. Mascara only on the bottom lashes.\"\n\nWhew, ok. I mean, if anything were going to have me attempting a no-mascara look, it'd be Mandy Moore's plummy gaze.\n\nIf you're wondering about the rest of her flawless face, I've got you. For her other makeup, Matin used Cle Cosmetics\u2013and you can see the collection here, on neimanmarcus.com.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2Fthe-best-eyeliner-mandy-moore.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B500%2C751%5D&w=1000&h=524&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2Fthe-best-eyeliner-mandy-moore.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-image.realsimple.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fportrait_435x518%2Fpublic%2Fshrimp-leek-pasta.jpg%3Fitok%3DMSRiE2hs&w=800&q=85", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-image.realsimple.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fportrait_435x518%2Fpublic%2Fwhite-bra-pink-box.jpg%3Fitok%3DJ7OxIOh6&w=800&q=85", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-image.realsimple.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fportrait_435x518%2Fpublic%2F1458053724%2Fgreens-sarah-whit.jpg%3Fitok%3Di6gcKokO&w=800&q=85", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2Fmandy-moore-says-this-is-the-best-eyeliner.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B500%2C751%5D&w=1000&h=524&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F23%2F2018%2F06%2F07%2Fthe-best-eyeliner-mandy-moore.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Claudia Fisher"], "canonical_link": "https://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/best-eyeliner-according-to-mandy-moore", "title": "Is This the Best Eyeliner?
