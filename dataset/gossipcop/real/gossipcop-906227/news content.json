Gimple is being elevated to Chief Content Officer, overseeing the entire Dead universe, including The Walking Dead, Fear the Walking Dead and potential franchise extensions on a variety of platforms.\n\nExecutive Producer Angela Kang, who has been a writer/producer on the show since 2011, is being promoted by Gimple to showrunner of The Walking Dead, beginning with season nine.\n\nBinge the First Eight Episodes of The Walking Dead Season 8\n\n\u201cThe Walking Dead is a special show which started in an entirely different era of TV, and continues, in this new era, to confidently take chances to tell compelling stories that excite audiences and make them deeply connect with its characters, adapting Robert Kirkman\u2019s brilliant comic book,\u201d Gimple said.\n\n\u201cAs the show closes in on its tenth year, I can\u2019t wait to keep working with the talented, dedicated people behind and in front of the camera to make it all it can be, while expanding the world of The Walking Dead with new narratives like Fear the Walking Dead and a whole host of truly cool stories ahead. Angela is a big part of the heart and soul of The Walking Dead, and I\u2019m thrilled to help facilitate her vision of the show\u2019s next era.\u201d\n\nThe Walking Dead returns Sunday, February 25 at 9/8c on AMC.
