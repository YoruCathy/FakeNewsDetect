That's as far as I know,' she posted on Twitter.\n\nI think a T but a K is an option as well.

I think I want a K or a T.'\n\nOn Monday, the 33-year-old took to her app to explain her vision of how she hopes to bring up her first child.\n\nOn the app, she explained she wanted her baby to inherit the Kardashian family's 'loyalty and family unity', won't be afraid to 'make new friends' and form strong relationships with sisters Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's newborns, Chicago West and Stormi Webster.\n\nLost track of all of the Kardashian/Jenner family's children?
