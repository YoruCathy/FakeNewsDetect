Though the actress is still alive and well, she has retired from the business\u2014so creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan were unable to include her in NBC\u2019s revival series. But they still felt obligated to give the beloved character a goodbye befitting her stature within the show. As Karen said in her eulogy Thursday night, Rosario spent eight seasons being much more than a maid. She was Karen\u2019s \u201csparring partner,\u201d her \u201cbest friend,\u201d her \u201ceverything.\u201d\n\nUntil Thursday, the show had written around Rosario\u2019s absence\u2014but now, it\u2019s permanent. Rosario collapses at Karen\u2019s house and dies of complications during surgery. Karen decides to make Rosario\u2019s funeral the quincea\u00f1era she never got to have as a teenager, but is too overcome by grief to show up at the event until the very end, when the room is empty. The episode welcomed back Karen\u2019s frequent bartender, Smitty (played by multiple actors during the original series), and Minnie Driver\u2019s Lorraine Finster, a.k.a. onetime mistress to Karen\u2019s husband. And there was one final revelation, which the show\u2019s creators and show-runners say will be addressed this year in further detail: Grace\u2019s mother, Bobbi, played in the show\u2019s original run by Debbie Reynolds, also passed away sometime between the original series and the revival. (Reynolds herself died in December 2016.)\n\n\u201cThe character felt too much a part of the fabric of the show to just dismiss it with a line or two or an explanation,\u201d Kohan told Variety, speaking about Rosario. \u201cIt felt like it merited more of a loving farewell.\u201d\n\nSo Will & Grace scripted Rosario a fitting send-off, with Kohan and Mutchnick only making one edit to the writers\u2019 original funeral monologue for Megan Mullally: they removed all of the jokes.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be as funny as Megan Mullally without having the inverse ability, and that\u2019s just something you know if you work with actors that are very good: the best ones can easily do both very well,\u201d Mutchnick said. \u201cAnd Megan is just someone who\u2019s displayed this one side. But as soon as we knew we had a chance to do something heavy, we knew we had the actress that could deliver the most dramatic episode we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nThe show-runners told Variety that even during her first cold read, Mullally drove them to tears. The same thing happened during rehearsal\u2014and during shooting.\n\nSeeing Karen get serious gave extra shades to the character, a woman whose bravado usually masks her vulnerability. On Thursday night, her emotions were on full display\u2014even as she used a cleaning spray from inside Rosario\u2019s coffin to buff out a spot on the casket, and Rosario\u2019s dress to do the wiping.\n\n\u201cWe want people to know how much Karen loved this character, that all of the fighting and all of the bluster and all the attitude was really just her showing her affection\u2014or masking her affection,\u201d Kohan told The Wrap. That\u2019s probably why, before the cleaning thing, Karen gave Rosario an heirloom ring that belonged to her mother.\n\n\u201cI want you to have something,\u201d she said on the show. \u201cIt was my mother\u2019s. It makes sense you should have it . . . Lord knows you\u2019ve been eyeing it for years.\u201d\n\nHer parting words? \u201cTe amo, mami.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cab9d9df8524309461f0fd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-review.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cd5e7aaa27f92b091aeaed/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-premiere.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599da913b0fade3511cdf9cf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tv-characters-subway-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599da91398f198592affadd3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tv-characters-subway-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59ce7cef854b87118a8cf055/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/will-and-grace-ratings.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599da913d3dd2e2d51611c12/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/tv-characters-subway-ss01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle", "Richard Lawso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/will-and-grace-rosario-death-max-mutchnick-david-kohan-interview", "title": "How Will & Grace Gave Rosario the Farewell She Deserved", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan on the sitcom\u2019s most heartbreaking half-hour yet.", "id": "59fc6156a5d94677ed93ca56", "keywords": "television,will & grace,nbc", "news_keywords": "television,will & grace,nbc", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59fc6156a5d94677ed93ca56", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan on the sitcom\u2019s most heartbreaking half-hour yet.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan on the sitcom\u2019s most heartbreaking half-hour yet.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "How Will & Grace Gave Rosario the Farewell She Deserved", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/will-and-grace-rosario-death-max-mutchnick-david-kohan-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan on the sitcom\u2019s most heartbreaking half-hour yet.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59fc7be320b9796d7f0bf143/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Will-and-Grace-Rosario.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "How Will & Grace Gave Rosario the Farewell She Deserved"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
