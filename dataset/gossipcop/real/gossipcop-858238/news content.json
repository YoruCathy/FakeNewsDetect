This was not an easy decision for either of us because we do love each other very much but sometimes God has other plans,\u201d the pair tell PEOPLE in an exclusive statement. \u201cThis is the route we have decided to take, and all we request is that you respect our privacy in this delicate matter. Divorce is never easy for anyone, especially not such a public one.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nImage zoom Courtesy A&E\n\nThe pair add that they \u201cremain best of friends and will always be there for each other even if we are not married. We plan to continue to grow our relationship, just without a piece of paper binding us together. We appreciate all the love and support you have all shown us during our marriage and hope you continue to support us during this time.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Courtesy A&E\n\nAfter their split was announced, Vilchez shared the couple\u2019s joint statement to Instagram \u2014 where she added \u201c@tomyachts Still love you though!\u201d \u2014 and also opened up about their decision to call it quits.\n\n\n\n\u201cSomeone can be madly in love with you and still not be ready. They can love you in a way you have never been loved and still not join you on the bridge. And whatever their reasons you must leave. Because you never ever have to inspire anyone to meet you on the bridge,\u201d she penned in her post.\n\n\u201cYou never ever have to convince someone to do the work to be ready. There is more extraordinary love, more love that you have never seen, out here in this wide and wild universe. And there is the love that will be ready,\u201d she concluded.\n\nFROM PEN: Christina and Tarek El Moussa\u2019s Divorce Has Not Stopped Their Business Relationship\n\nVilchez, a 25-year-old real estate agent, and Wilson, a 29-year-old yacht interior specialist, met for the first time as they walked down the aisle on Lifetime\u2019s hit social experiment show (produced by Kinetic content).\n\n\u201cThey tried to make it work. They really, really did,\u201d a source close to the couple \u2014 who wed on April 2, 2016 \u2014 tells PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen two people fight for their marriage like they have, but at the end of the day they realized they are moving in different directions. On paper, they are truly the perfect match but life got in the way.\u201d\n\nThough the duo certainly had many sweet moments as newlyweds, they also butted heads over their future together, with Vilchez often feeling insecure about her husband\u2019s commitment to their marriage.\n\nThe current season of Married at First Sight airs Thursdays (9 p.m. ET) on Lifetime.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/married-first-sight-tom-wilson-lillian-vilchez-divorce/", "title": "Married at First Sight Divorce: Tom Wilson & Lillian Vilchez Announce Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Exclusive,Married at First Sight,News,TV,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,Married at First Sight,News,TV,TV Watch", "description": "The fan-favorite couple from season 4 are pulling the plug on their marriage after more than a year together, PEOPLE can exclusively reveal", "og": {"title": "Married at First Sight, Divorced 14 Months Later: Tom Wilson & Lillian Vilchez Announce Split", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/married-first-sight-tom-wilson-lillian-vilchez-divorce/", "description": "Married at First Sight\u2018s&nbsp;Tom Wilson and Lillian Vilchez are calling it quits on their marriage. \u201cAfter much thought and reflection, and after being married for&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-2.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/married-first-sight-tom-wilson-lillian-vilchez-divorce/", "description": "The fan-favorite couple from season 4 are pulling the plug on their marriage after more than a year together, PEOPLE can exclusively reveal", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/married-first-sight-tom-wilson-lillian-vilchez-divorce/", "title": "Married at First Sight, Divorced 14 Months Later: Tom Wilson & Lillian Vilchez Announce Split", "description": "The fan-favorite couple from season 4 are pulling the plug on their marriage after more than a year together, PEOPLE can exclusively reveal", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
