In the new sequence, which makes its official debut in tonight\u2019s episode, Rebecca Bunch (co-creator and star Rachel Bloom) takes on several pop star personas, channeling different strains of crazy: A Carrie Underwood\u2013type, swinging a Louisville slugger; a sultry diva who\u2019s crazy in love; a rock star who likes a woman who\u2019s \u201ccrazy in bed\u201d; and a rapper who warns you to stay away from a girl who\u2019s \u201ccrazy in the head.\u201d To be crazy or not to be crazy? That\u2019s the question at the center of the theme, but of course, there\u2019s no clear answer\u2014the personalities conflict, and a cut at the end to Rebecca herself, sitting on the toilet and watching it all go down on her phone, reveals she\u2019s more confused than ever.\n\nHonestly, the whole thing is confusing to me, too. The song, which feels clearly inspired by Underwood\u2019s \u201cBefore He Cheats,\u201d is disjointed and plodding, flying by quickly and ending abruptly. It never really registers as a cohesive opener, and that\u2019s probably the point\u2014Bloom told E! that pop\u2019s obsession with the word crazy inspired the aesthetic: \u201cIt\u2019s probably the most common word used in pop music, and if you\u2019re like my character, who\u2019s trying to live her life by those things, it would be very confusing to get guidelines from listening to different pop songs.\u201d It\u2019s a great concept, especially considering that Season 3 is where Crazy Ex-Girlfriend officially begins to earn its title, with Rebecca seeking the utmost revenge on Josh after he\u2019s left her at the altar. But the execution is unsatisfying\u2014this is also the season that is filtering its motif through movie tropes (Bloom has described it as \u201cfunny Fatal Attraction\u201d and the second episode, airing tonight, includes a 50 Shades of Grey plot line and a musical ode to Gene Kelly), and the pop theme is jarringly inconsistent in this light. Also, it\u2019s just not that catchy.\n\nThe Season 1 opening credits sequence is catchy, and does what so many of the best TV theme songs have done: It cleverly lays out the show\u2019s premise in a way that complements the script and the spirit of the season. Rebecca\u2019s rash decision to move her entire life from New York City to West Covina, Ca. after running into her summer-camp boyfriend from high school is breezily chronicled in the lyrics and then instantly commented upon by the chorus. \u201cShe\u2019s the crazy ex-girlfriend! (What? No I\u2019m not!)\u201d Rebecca is in denial for everyone, herself included, and this plays out slowly throughout the season until she finally attempts to seek therapy for her mental health issues and admits to Josh aloud that she made the move explicitly for him. The theme is subversive and provocative, cheerful and animated, while revealing our protagonist to be more than a little not OK. In delivery, it\u2019s spot-on, and Season 1 does in fact live up to its promise\u2014its take on the \u201ccrazy woman\u201d trope is \u201ca lot more nuanced than that.\u201d\n\nSeason 2\u2019s theme, however, raised the bar for what Crazy Ex-Girlfriend could convey in a mere 30 seconds. In the Busby Berkeley-inspired musical number, Rebecca sings innocently about just being \u201ca girl in love\u201d who \u201ccan\u2019t be held responsible for my actions\u201d; she\u2019s \u201ccertifiably cute and adorably obsessed.\u201d It\u2019s perfect from beginning to end, a bubbly singalong that belies Rebecca\u2019s darker, deeper spiral into willful ignorance of her problems, and how those problems affect those around her. The chorus members call her an ingenue\u2014fitting, since the season is all about taking the romantic comedy genre\u2019s celebration of doing outrageous things in the name of \u201clove\u201d and exposing it for the disturbing mess it can actually be in real life. (Paula questions her friendship with Rebecca, whose selfishness leaves her high and dry when she needs her most; Rebecca runs over Josh\u2019s new girlfriend\u2019s cat.) And that final moment, of Rebecca\u2019s head busting (blam!) through the heart-shaped image of Josh\u2019s face, with the camera lingering for just a beat longer than feels comfortable\u2014if Season 1 Rebecca was charming and highly functional while still exhibiting a steady loss of control, Season 2 Rebecca is much more unsettling in the most fascinating of ways.\n\nHeld up against these two previous examples, Season 3\u2019s theme is a bit of a letdown. It makes smart points\u2014women are frequently told that one of the worst things to be is \u201ccrazy,\u201d except when in bed with a man, and then it\u2019s encouraged\u2014but doesn\u2019t really subvert them through imagery. (One would expect something at least a bit more fun coming from Joseph Kahn, the director behind the music video for \u201cThe Thong Song.\u201d) Based on the three new episodes I\u2019ve seen, it doesn\u2019t seem like cause to worry for the fate of this season, as Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is still very much a delightful and thought-provoking journey. But when the four strains of \u201ccrazy\u201d pop stars collectively offer \u201cWe hope this helps!\u201d to Rebecca, it\u2019s hard not to answer with, \u201cNo, no. It does not.\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18406752&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fw53_-Tq3MNK1.gif", "https://slate.com/media/components/adblock-message/slate-plus-promo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=166975463695820&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://compote.slate.com/images/ca12ec69-e598-4fd2-a015-f138341a14c5.png"], "top_img": "https://compote.slate.com/images/ca12ec69-e598-4fd2-a015-f138341a14c5.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aisha Harris"], "canonical_link": "https://slate.com/culture/2017/10/assessing-crazy-ex-girlfriends-three-opening-credits-sequences-video.html", "title": "Which Is the Best Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Opening Credits Sequence So Far?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Which Is the Best Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Opening Credits Sequence So Far?", "url": "https://slate.com/culture/2017/10/assessing-crazy-ex-girlfriends-three-opening-credits-sequences-video.html", "description": "Carrie Underwood clearly inspired the Season 3 theme.", "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/ca12ec69-e598-4fd2-a015-f138341a14c5.png", "site_name": "Slate Magazine", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Which Is the Best Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Opening Credits Sequence So Far?", "description": "Carrie Underwood clearly inspired the Season 3 theme.", "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/ca12ec69-e598-4fd2-a015-f138341a14c5.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@slate"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-20T16:19:00+00:00", "tag": "/content/slate/blogs/browbeat", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "description": "Carrie Underwood clearly inspired the Season 3 theme.", "news_keywords": "/content/slate/blogs/browbeat", "author": "Aisha Harris", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Slate", "application-name": "Slate", "msapplication-TileColor": "#660033", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://slate.com/media/sites/slate-com/icon.144x144.png", "theme-color": "#2c0022", "dfp-cache-buster": "7b1b9fb6f55280c03edfe3d6def54723514811de"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/GPpKC0v5_h0?rel=0&enablejsapi=1", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lph_EfoAn-A?rel=0&enablejsapi=1", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdjvjsPAQgk?rel=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1508516340.0, "source": "https://slate.com", "summary": ""}
