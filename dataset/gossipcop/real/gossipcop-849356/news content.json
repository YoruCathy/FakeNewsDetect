THIS YEAR IT'S ALL ABOUT PIPPA'S INCREDIBLY TONED ARMS! Pippa made quite the splash at her big sister's wedding when her pert bottom made headlines all around the world. But this year, all eyes have been firmly focused on the bride's incredibly toned arms. Pippa wore a capped-sleeve dress to highlight her very shapely arms earlier today and she has even caught the eye of professional personal trainers. Monty Simmons, a personal trainer based London, said: 'It's clear she's been keeping a balanced diet that's high in protein, to help reduce body fat and feed the muscles so they develop, tone and shape. Pippa made quite the splash at her big sister's wedding when her pert bottom made headlines all around the world (left). But this year, all eyes have been firmly focused on the bride's incredibly toned arms 'If the body fat isn't addressed through great nutrition, the muscle will be covered; much like an iron bar wrapped in cotton wool. 'It's rumoured she's undergone bodyweight training in the lead-up which is a fantastic way of developing lean, sculpted and toned upper arms. 'Known for her athletic prowess, Pippa is no stranger to keeping in shape, having taken part in big scale sports events, including a 3,000-mile charity bike race in San Diego and a 33-mile cross-country ski race in Norway. Sport based activities create brilliant results for the upper arms. 'I particularly recommend boxing, rowing, indoor rock climbing, mixed martial arts and swimming. Not only are they great for overall toning, they focus hugely on the upper body, helping burn body fat and toning muscles. They're also an effective stress reliever which plays a big part in losing body fat also!'\n\nPippa Middleton arrives for her wedding to James Matthews in a vintage car with her father\n\nA cheeky pageboy flicks the V at the cameras whilst he waits to head into the church with the rest of the bridal party\n\nA beaming James Matthews, second from right, arrives at the church flanked by ushers James Middleton, third from left, and brother Spencer as he awaits his bride\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge cut it fine as they set off from Kensington Palace with just a few hours to spare ahead of Pippa Middleton's wedding today.\n\nThe couple, who were dressed to impress in their wedding outfits, were seen driving through London as they made the 50 mile journey to St Mark's Church in Berkshire.\n\nPrince William, who looked dapper in a satin waistcoat and red tie, drove his family-of-four in their Range Rover to the society wedding of the decade.\n\nKate, meanwhile, gave a hint of her outfit and donned a peach fascinator - a colour she often plumps for when dressing for formal events.\n\nPippa picks Kendall Jenner's favourite designer Giles Deacon for her show-stopping wedding dress (and it bears striking similarities to Kate's bridal gown) The world's most esteemed designers were bending over backwards to dress her but Giles Deacon was the man entrusted with dressing Pippa Middleton on her big day. Six years after she stole the show as her sister's bridesmaid at the Royal wedding, Pippa ensured her gown was equally memorable by plumping for a couture dress made by Giles Deacon, who has designed clothes for Ann Summers and New Look. While Kate opted for a long-sleeved lace number by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen on hr big day, her younger sister ensured her newly-toned arms were on full display today with a cap-sleeved frock and glittering tiara. Pippa enters St. Mark's Church in Englefield this morning. Miss Middleton's designer Giles Deacon said of her gown (left): 'The bespoke silk cotton lace was hand appliqued to create the illusion of the dress having no seams' Both sisters opted for brilliant white rather than ivory, popular among brides, with full, sweeping skirts to ensure all eyes were on them. Pippa's stunning guipure lace number with a nipped-in waist and low back showed off to perfection the flawless figure has been tirelessly honing at the gym, while the high neck gave her look a modern twist. Pippa's designer Deacon, 47, originally from County Durham where the Middletons' ancestors hail from, is one of the most acclaimed British designers and experts say one of his made-to-measure dresses was likely to have set Pippa back around \u00a340,000. Giles, pictured with models Jourdan Dunn and Cara Delevingne at his fashion week event, has forged a close circle of famous friends. He is reported to have first met with Pippa and mother Carole last summer to discuss dress options He said: 'I was thrilled to work with Pippa on her wedding dress. The dress is constructed with a cap sleeve, high neckline and features a corseted bodice with draping to the front and heart-shaped detail at the back.' Deacon added: 'The bespoke silk cotton lace was hand appliqued to create the illusion of the dress having no seams. 'The lace bodice is embroidered with pearl detailing over an organza and tulle underskirt. It's a privilege to show the craftsmanship that my team produces in London.' 'I wanted that 'how-was-that-done?' factor,' he told Business of Fashion. Pippa also wore a Maidenhair Fern tiara. Phillipa Lepley, couture bridal designer added: 'Pippa's high neck is very unusual and elegant - more coverage is less, and very sexy. The fresh raglan cap sleeves (which will be slightly padded) contrast with the neckline beautifully - very fresh and modern! 'An all-over embroidered fabric like this is very flattering. The dress has quite a voluminous full skirt, which contrasts Pippa's tiny waist. A simple silk tulle veil has been thrown over, which does not detract from the details of the dress beneath.' Deacon is famed for his dramatic gothic creations and has made full skirts, huge ruffles and playful shapes his signature with fashion critics noting he creates clothes for 'women who want to be noticed'. He has dressed Helena Bonham Carter and Lady Gaga, but his most famous bride was model Strictly winner Abbey Clancy, who wore a strapless, corseted lace dress that flared out below the knee.
