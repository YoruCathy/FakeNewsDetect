Earlier it was reported by Consequence of Sound that Eminem and The Weeknd would be joining Beyonc\u00e9 for this year's festival, but requests for confirmation of the new headliners were not returned from producers.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9, who has made guest appearances at Coachella with husband Jay-Z and her sister, Solange, was supposed to headline at last year's music festival, but had to postpone after becoming pregnant with twins.\n\nPasses go on sale at noon PT Friday at coachella.com. General admission passes are $429, including fees and taxes, while the Festival Pass and Shuttle Combo is $504. VIP Festival Passes are $999 and VIP parking is $150.\n\nAdditional general admission passes traditionally go on sale for Coachella Valley residents a few days before each show, but that hasn't been announced.\n\nThe new emphasis on hip-hop and R&B, which have supplanted rock as the most popular pop music forms, includes rappers like Tyler the Creator, Vince Staples, Migos, Post Malone and new sensation, Cardi B, who currently has her first three releases in the top 10 of the Billboard charts, becoming only the third artist to debut with three singles in the top 10 along with The Beatles and Ashanti.\n\nEminem, one of the biggest Grammy Award-winning rap artists of all time, returns to Coachella on a Sunday night after making a guest appearance with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in 2012 in the now legendary set featuring a hologram of Tupac Shakur.\n\nAppearing on the same day as Eminem is the saxophone player who made a name for himself with Kendrick Lamar, the jazz-steeped Kamasi Washington.\n\nTop R&B artists on the bill besides Beyonc\u00e9 and The Weeknd include SZA, who recently headlined Saturday Night Live, Grammy winner Miguel and Daniel Caesar, who is breaking this year out of Canada. Appearing as somewhat of a godfather of that genre is Chic, featuring the influential Nile Rodgers, which had R&B dance hits such as Everybody Dance and Le Freak in the 1970s.\n\nVarious genres of rock are represented by the return of War On Drugs, the sister group HAIM, the Brian Wilson-influenced Fleet Foxes and Portugal. the Man. All have played previous Coachellas, although Portugal. the Man finally broke into the pop upper echelons this year with its mega-hit Feel It Still.\n\nThe godfather of that genre making an appearanceis David Byrne, the leader of the new wave band the Talking Heads, who have been high on the wish list for a Coachella reunion since the festival's inception in 1999.\n\nElectronic music also has been drawn bigger crowds at Coachella in recent years than rock and its mix with pop music well represented with Kygo, Chromeo and ODESZA.\n\nOther noteworthy artists of that genre include Petit Biscuit, a French DJ and music producer who turned 18 less than two months ago. He is half of the indie-pop duo Mount Dreams, but released his first solo album, Presence, in 2017. He'll perform on Sunday, as will British house DJ and music producer Hannah Wants, a former professional women's soccer player.\n\nThe lineup appears to have been booked with a sensitivity to increasing female participation and ethnic diversity. An interesting booking is Los Angeles Azules, a Mexican group fusing traditional cumbia and electronic music.\n\nThe festival has become known in the industry for its leadership in fine art and cuisine, and this year will again offer the four-course Outstanding in the Field dinner in the VIP Rose Garden for $225 a person.\n\nCoachella has dominated industry polls as the top outdoor music event since it began in 1999. It was recently named the Billboard Top Festival of the Year. It grossed a record $114 million in 2017, marking the first time a recurring festival franchise has crossed the $100 million mark at the box office.\n\nMore:News & views: Coachella and festival fashion is so clich\u00e9, it's no longer fashion\n\nThe full list of the Coachella 2018 lineup as announced today includes:\n\n6LACK\n\nA Perfect Circle\n\nAC Slater\n\nAlan Walker\n\nAlina Baraz\n\nAlison Wonderland\n\nalt-J\n\nAlvvays\n\nAmin\u00e9\n\nAngel Olsen\n\nAURORA\n\nAvalon Emerson\n\nB Boys\n\nBane\u2019s World\n\nBarclay Crenshaw\n\nBedouin\n\nBelly\n\nBenjamin Booker\n\nBenjamin Clementine\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\nBig Thief\n\nBlack Coffee\n\nblackbear\n\nBleachers\n\nBoogarins\n\nB\u00d8RNS\n\nBROCKHAMPTON\n\nBuscabulla\n\nBusy P\n\nCardi B\n\nCarpenter Brut\n\nCash Cash\n\nCherry Glazerr\n\nChic ft.
