Nikki Bella joked about her split from John Cena on TV, and audience members had a surprising reaction.\n\nThe 34-year-old Total Bellas star appeared on the Wednesday, July 25, episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon with sister Brie Bella, during which they explained what\u2019s different about growing up with a twin. \u201cWell, when we were young, we would breakup with boyfriends for each other. That was a plus,\u201d Nikki told Jimmy Fallon.\n\nBrie, also 34, added: \u201cWe never had to go through like the emotions of a breakup because I was like, \u2018You wanna dump the guy? Cool.\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Hello? Yeah, not into you. Sorry.\u2019 And then I would just go on with my day, no hurt feelings, and she\u2019d be like, \u2018Did you do it?\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah, you\u2019re good.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Nikki quipped, \u201cWhere were you a few months ago?\u201d The Tonight Show audience appeared to not be on board with her joke, letting out an overwhelming groan. The reality star tried to recover with a \u201cjust kidding\u201d and \u201csorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would\u2019ve been a hard phone call,\u201d Brie pointed out.\n\nNikki later referenced her breakup again when discussing the difficulties of watching her relationship end on the E! reality series. \u201cThis season\u2019s been really painful for me,\u201d she noted. \u201cTo like just relive, it\u2019s been super tough.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly broke the news in April that the couple had broken off their engagement after six years together. Nikki insisted that she and Cena, 41, are not back together during a Bella Twins vlog earlier this month. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re just friends,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cWe are both working on each other and trying to work on us, and we talk every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Cena told Entertainment Tonight shortly after the two called it quits. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to say [it]. I love Nicole with all my heart, and that\u2019s that.\u201d\n\nFor now, Nikki and the Trainwreck actor are focused on repairing their romance. \u201cThere has been no discussion about a wedding. They\u2019re not officially engaged again,\u201d a source close to the pair told Us in June. \u201cThey are working on their relationship day by day. There\u2019s nothing going on more than them trying to figure out their situation.\u201d\n\nNikki revealed during the Sunday, July 22, episode of Total Bellas that wedding planning put a strain on her relationship: \u201cAnything that\u2019s wedding-related, it just\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m continuing to grow more apart from John and I should be growing closer to him.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Cena-and-Nikki-Bella.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Cena-and-Nikki-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Nikki-Brie-Bella-Jimmy-Fallon.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Cena-and-Nikki-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nikki-bella-jokes-about-john-cena-split-on-tv-audience-groans/", "title": "Nikki Bella Cracks a Joke About John Cena Split on TV \u2014 Audience Groans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Nikki Bella made a joke about her split from John Cena during the Wednesday, July 25, episode of \u2018The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u2019 and the audience was not here for it \u2014 watch the cringe-worthy moment", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nikki Bella Cracks a Joke About John Cena Split on TV \u2014 Audience Groans", "description": "Nikki Bella made a joke about her split from John Cena during the Wednesday, July 25, episode of \u2018The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u2019 and the audience was not here for it \u2014 watch the cringe-worthy moment", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nikki-bella-jokes-about-john-cena-split-on-tv-audience-groans/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-26T15:47:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Cena-and-Nikki-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Cena-and-Nikki-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-26T15:50:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-26T15:47:25+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Nikki Bella made a joke about her split from John Cena during the Wednesday, July 25, episode of \u2018The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\u2019 and the audience was not here for it \u2014 watch the cringe-worthy moment", "title": "Nikki Bella Cracks a Joke About John Cena Split on TV \u2014 Audience Groans", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/John-Cena-and-Nikki-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532620256.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
