Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, powerhouse performers, have recently garnered a ton of media attention for their marital troubles and three adorable children.\n\nThe family of five may seem like an enigma, but we have some details about the couple, their kids, and the heartwarming thing that Blue Ivy told her father (page 6). Plus, Jay-Z credits this one trip as the thing that saved his life (page 7).\n\n1. They keep things pretty private\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z share private details about their lives only when they feel ready. | Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z share private details about their lives only when they feel ready. | Beyonc\u00e9 via Instagram\n\nIt\u2019s a long-standing joke with a level of truth to it: Beyonc\u00e9 controls the media. She released a visual album without so much as a single leak or peep and spread the news of Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King before the multibillion-dollar company could.\n\nThis privacy extends to her personal life. She and husband Jay-Z welcomed twins Rumi and Sir into the world in 2017. We know next to nothing about the twins short of their birth announcement and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s internet-breaking photos.\n\nNext: How the couple does choose to share their story\n\n2. They lay everything out through their music\n\nThey leave hidden clues in their music. | Jason Miller/Getty Images They leave hidden clues in their music. | Jason Miller/Getty Images\n\nUntil his recent interview with David Letterman, the world only assumed Jay-Z cheated on Beyonc\u00e9 by deciphering their music with a fine-toothed comb. In early 2017, Jay-Z released 4:44 and Beyonc\u00e9 released Lemonade.\n\nHer song \u201cHold Up\u201d gave the most obvious clues with the lyrics; \u201cWhat a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you/I smell your secrets and I\u2019m not too perfect to ever feel this worthless.\u201d Jay-Z nearly confirmed the adultery on his track \u201c4:44\u201d claiming \u201cAnd if my children knew, I don\u2019t even know what I would do.\u201d\n\nNext: What we know for sure about the family\n\n3. Jay-Z cheated on Beyonce\n\nJay-Z admitted to doing this. | Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images Jay-Z admitted to doing this. | Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images\n\nThe singers both referenced a \u201cBecky\u201d on their albums \u2014 alluding to the woman Jay-Z allegedly had an affair with. Jay-Z spoke with late-night talk show host David Letterman to clear up the rumors surrounding his alleged affair.\n\n\u201cI want to have the emotional tools that it takes to keep my family together,\u201d Jay-Z told Letterman on an episode of the Netflix show My Guest Needs No Introduction. \u201cAnd, much like you, I have a beautiful wife who is understanding and knew that I\u2019m not the worst of what I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nNext: One of Jay-Z\u2019s kids already takes after him\n\n4. Sir already takes after Jay-Z\n\nThe proud grandma shared some sweet information about their twins. | Emma McIntyre/Getty Images The proud grandma shared some sweet information about their twins. | Emma McIntyre/Getty Images\n\nBeyonce\u2019s mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, couldn\u2019t help but fawn over her grandchildren. Sir, her only grandson and twin to Rumi, apparently \u201ctwins\u201d with another member of the family \u2014 Jay-Z.\n\n\u201cOther than the boy [Sir] has a stare, like a mean mug, like Jay sometimes, which is so cute, and the girl [Rumi], she\u2019s just so happy all the time and so sweet. They are just adorable!\u201d Knowles-Lawson also called the twins\u2019 personalities \u201cso different\u201d and \u201cwonderful.\u201d\n\nNext: One of their kids is already a style star.\n\n5. Blue Ivy has become a child fashion icon of sorts\n\nBlue Ivy\u2019s outfits make fashion lovers go crazy. | Christopher Polk/Getty Images Blue Ivy\u2019s outfits make fashion lovers go crazy. | Christopher Polk/Getty Images\n\nMajor fashion publications \u2014 Vogue, Elle, and Harper\u2019s Bazaar among them \u2014 have deemed Blue Ivy Carter \u201cbest dressed\u201d and a style star, even compared to full-grown women. She even has her own section on InStyle.com!\n\nThe six-year-old wears custom Gucci dresses, Dior to the Grammys, and gets to match Beyonc\u00e9 on a regular basis. What more could you want?\n\nNext: The heartwarming thing Blue Ivy told Jay-Z.\n\n6. She told her father how she felt\n\nA touching and memorable moment for Jay-Z. | Robyn Beck/Getty Images A touching and memorable moment for Jay-Z. | Robyn Beck/Getty Images\n\nJay-Z expressed frustration at Blue Ivy one morning before school. \u201cShe was asking a thousand questions and we had to leave for school,\u201d he told Letterman during their interview. He recalled hearing a \u201clittle voice\u201d while driving.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dad?\u2019 I turn around and she\u2019s like, \u2018I didn\u2019t like when you told me to get in the car the way you told me. It hurt my feelings,'\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most beautiful thing you ever said to me,\u201d Jay-Z responded.\n\nNext: The trip Jay-Z believes changed his life.\n\n7. Jay-Z believes a trip to London spared him from jail\n\n| Mark Davis/Getty Images | Mark Davis/Getty Images\n\nJay-Z traveled to London in 1989 to visit EMI Records. He told Letterman the label \u201cwanted the association\u201d but for that very reason, the deal couldn\u2019t go through. When Carter realized it \u201cwasn\u2019t about the music,\u201d he was out.\n\n\u201cDuring that time,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was a secret indictment and they swept up and grabbed 30 of my friends. Everyone got locked up and went to jail.\u201d Par for the course, Jay-Z used music to tell the story long before an interview. He raps in Pusha T\u2019s song Drug Dealers Anonymous; \u201cGoogle me, baby, you crazy/\u201989 in London pull the Benz up.\u201d\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-holding-her-twins.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Tina-knowles-640x434.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-looks-at-Blue-Ivy-640x418.png?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/JayZBlueIvy-640x320.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-holding-her-twins.png?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BeyonceJayZgame-640x300.png?x62514", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/JayZ-640x300.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Blue-Ivy-and-Jay-Z-640x407.png?x62514"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Beyonce-holding-her-twins.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Bleznak"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/inside-jay-z-and-beyonces-family-including-the-most-beautiful-thing-blue-ivy-ever-said-to-her-father.html/", "title": "Inside Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Family of 5, Including the \u2018Most Beautiful\u2019 Thing Blue Ivy Ever Said to Her Father", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/inside-jay-z-and-beyonces-family-including-the-most-beautiful-thing-blue-ivy-ever-said-to-her-father.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "The power couple has one of the most talked-about families in the world, but how much do you really know about them?
