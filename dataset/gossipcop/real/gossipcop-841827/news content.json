He was 90 years old.\n\nRickles died on Thursday of kidney failure at his Los Angeles home.\n\nThe stage comedian headlined casinos in Las Vegas and frequently appeared on late-night television talk shows.\n\nSarcastically nicknamed \"Mr Warmth,\" Rickles was known for his sharp-tongue, comedic insults, mocking celebrities like Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope.\n\nHe burnished his reputation for skewering stars during appearances on the NBC programme The Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts, which ran during the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan, Lucille Ball, Kirk Douglas and Sammy Davis Jr were among the celebrities he took aim at.\n\nHe also made frequent appearances on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.\n\nRickles was also featured in moves including the 1970 film Kelly's Heroes with Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese's 1995 film Casino.\n\nHe voiced the beloved character of Mr Potato Head in Disney's Toy Story films.\n\n\"I can't please the world. When you're standing out there doing comedy, not everybody thinks you're funny. But in my case, I've gained a great deal of respect for my age to still be going,\" he said in 2012.\n\nComedian Billy Crystal called Rickles' death a \"giant loss\".\n\nActor George Takei tweeted: \"Don Rickles, you kept us laughing for so many years. We will miss you dearly. Thanks for the zingers. You were one of a kind.\"\n\nRickles, who was born in Queens, New York, is survived by his wife of 52 years, Barbara; his daughter, Mindy Mann; and two grandchildren, Ethan and Harrison Mann.\n\nHe would have turned 91 on May 8.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1188/production/_95488440_424d0278-362a-43ce-bbed-748b747b08e3.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=world::us_and_canada::news.world.us_and_canada.story.39520006.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:397acf18-c3f1-214b-9184-4b4eca7fc0b6]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1188/production/_95488440_424d0278-362a-43ce-bbed-748b747b08e3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1188/production/_95488440_424d0278-362a-43ce-bbed-748b747b08e3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39520006", "title": "Legendary US comedian Don Rickles dies at 90", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"Mr Warmth\" was best remembered for his comedic insults and late-night talk show appearances.", "x-country": "hk", "x-audience": "Asia", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Asia", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 301457738, "og": {"title": "US comedian Don Rickles dies at 90", "type": "article", "description": "\"Mr Warmth\" was best remembered for his comedic insults and late-night talk show appearances.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39520006", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1188/production/_95488440_424d0278-362a-43ce-bbed-748b747b08e3.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
