And it\u2019s a private wedding, so not on TV \u2014 just a close group of friends. Probably 100 guests.\u201d\n\nAsked whether they felt like they were rushing things, Burnham said if they could \u201cget married tomorrow we would.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just really happy with each other and we vibe well together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re best friends, so we\u2019re just ready for that next step.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Less than two months after proposing to finalist Becca Kufrin, Luyendyk Jr. realized he was still in love with his runner-up, Burnham. He ultimately decided to break things off with Kufrin, 28, to pursue a relationship with Burnham \u2014 and proposed to her on live television during the two-hour After the Final Rose special on March 6.\n\nImage zoom Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham on The Bachelor\n\nSince then, all three parties involved have moved on. Kufrin is engaged once again, this time after wrapping production on The Bachelorette (her season premieres Monday on ABC), and Luyendyk Jr. and Burnham have moved in together in his hometown of Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in our condo now and we just bought a new house,\u201d Burnham said on The View. \u201cThings are moving pretty quickly and everything\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nThe couple also admitted that they have yet to watch their season finale \u2014 including the painfully raw footage of Luyendyk Jr. ending things with Kufrin.\n\n\u201cI think going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn\u2019t a popular decision. But it was a decision I had to make for myself. \u2026 I knew that Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with,\u201d said Luyendyk Jr. \u201cI never watched the finale, so we don\u2019t really know how that breakup looked on TV. But breakups are hard, and I think that everyone handles it in a different way. They say it was unedited, but it was edited. You\u2019re not in control of the editing room and you can\u2019t really control what they show.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy breakup was taped, everyone else\u2019s was, and that\u2019s just kind of the name of the game,\u201d added Burnham.\n\nAnd Luyendyk Jr. said he thinks his relationship with Burnham is even more solid because of what they went through.\n\n\u201cI think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn\u2019t change it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy. When we go out in public, it\u2019s all positivity. And that\u2019s cool to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur relationship is so unique and it\u2019s nothing that I\u2019ve ever had before,\u201d added Burnham. \u201cSo the fact that he was willing to take that risk and all of America hating him to be with me, that means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nOpening up exclusively to PEOPLE after the scandal, Luyendyk Jr. admitted he wholeheartedly regretted proposing to Kufrin while he was still in love with Burnham.\n\nImage zoom Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham Jana Cruder\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is I made a huge mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cI made what I thought was a good choice, but my heart wasn\u2019t in it. I felt the enormous pressure and the enormity of the show and production, and I felt I should lead with my head and go through with it.\u201d\n\nOnce reconciled with Burnham, he said he felt like \u201ca huge weight lifted off my shoulders.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: All About the 3.5-Carat Engagement Ring Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. Gave Lauren Burnham\n\nBurnham told PEOPLE she \u201ctotally\u201d respected Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s decision \u201cto follow his heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame him for it, and I think it\u2019s made us stronger in the end,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was worth risking getting hurt again to see where it could go. We\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about it, and I know he won\u2019t change his mind again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes things easier for me knowing that he was able to be with Becca outside of this experience and he still knew that wasn\u2019t what he wanted,\u201d she added. \u201cIt gives me confidence in our relationship knowing that he truly wants to be with me and he took this huge risk to make it happen.\u201d\n\nAnd both agreed that they were \u201cvery excited about marriage and starting a family\u201d \u2014 in fact, Luyendyk Jr. said he wants two to four kids.\n\n\u201cIf we get lucky, maybe we\u2019d have twins!\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2F148181_4326-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1499&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fbachelor-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fbachelor-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1499&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fbachelor-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-arie-luyendyk-jr-lauren-burnham-announce-hawaii-wedding-date/", "title": "Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham Announce Wedding Date and Location", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Arie Luyendyk Jr.,Celebrity Weddings,Couples,Lauren Burnham,News,The Bachelor,The View,TV,Weddings", "news_keywords": "Arie Luyendyk Jr.,Celebrity Weddings,Couples,Lauren Burnham,News,The Bachelor,The View,TV,Weddings", "description": "The Bachelor couple will graduate from fianc\u00e9s to husband and wife", "og": {"title": "It's Official!
