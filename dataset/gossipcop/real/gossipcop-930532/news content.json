It will also come with an unexpected twist: instead of running a newsmagazine, as she did in the original series, Candice Bergen\u2019s title heroine will now anchor a morning news show\u2014and her son, Avery, will be her top competitor\u2014at a conservative network.\n\nBergen and the cast celebrated the comedy\u2019s revival on stage Wednesday at CBS\u2019s Upfront presentation at Carnegie Hall. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to hear so many Americans actually cheering a bunch of journalists,\u201d Bergen said as she took the stage with her co-stars. \u201cWe want to stay really topical, which is why we didn\u2019t shoot a pilot. If we had, we\u2019d already be a dozen major headlines and several Stormies out of date. . . The world of cable news is fast-paced and populated with all kinds of characters\u2014from the Hannitys of the world to, well, actual journalists. Like Murphy Brown, the competition is fierce.\u201d During his own monologue after the cast left the stage, CBS\u2019s star late-night host, Stephen Colbert, offered a gently snarky take: \u201cIn addition to the big hit MacGyver, this fall CBS will have the reboot of Magnum P.I. and, as you saw, Murphy Brown\u2014guaranteeing that we will be the No. 1 network in 2018 and 1988.\u201d\n\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, the former staff of the newsmagazine FYI is now running a morning show on cable, titled Murphy in the Morning. According to New York Times TV reporter John Koblin, Corky Sherwood (Faith Ford) will co-host with Murphy, while Miles Silverberg (Grant Shaud) will produce the program. CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl confirmed to reporters that the dynamic between Murphy and her son\u2019s programs will be comparable to the one that exists between Morning Joe and Fox & Friends.\n\nAvery\u2019s presence on a conservative news show is a little ironic\u2014not just in the world of the series, but also in the real world; the original show\u2019s most memorable moment came when it responded directly to a real-world criticism from Dan Quayle over Murphy\u2019s decision to have her child out of wedlock. Still, the move could allow Murphy Brown to tackle some of the modern political issues that ABC\u2019s revived Roseanne has played with\u2014perhaps in a more organic way. Since Avery was a child when the original Murphy Brown first wrapped, his political leanings are, more or less, a blank slate. By making him a conservative, Murphy Brown will be able to examine the same fraught family dynamics that viewers have seen in Roseanne\u2014without re-writing any of the original series\u2019s history or changing characters into unrecognizable versions of their former selves.\n\nThe revived Murphy Brown is set to air on Thursdays at 9:30 P.M., in a comedy lineup that begins with Big Bang Theory, then moves on to Young Sheldon and Mom.\n\nOne thing CBS is certainly hoping to imitate? Roseanne\u2019s record ratings. When asked if the ABC comedy had raised his own network\u2019s ratings\u2019 hopes for Murphy Brown, Kahl stopped short of claiming to expect the same earth-shattering success. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely hopeful,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019d love to get Roseanne numbers. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to get Rosanne numbers.\u201d It\u2019s smart not to count on such monumental ratings, but it\u2019s safe to say CBS is sure hoping for them.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ad7afbd417d2e416ae8b6d2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Roseanne.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc2a450774fa5f3ff3a20f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/book-club-review.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abd5890a2ccd9543522eb61/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/letters-from-la-murphy-brown-cagney-and-lacey-04-2018-lede.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle", "Rebecca Keega", "Richard Lawso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/murphy-brown-cbs-fall-schedule-conservative-son-fox-and-friends-morning-joe", "title": "Murphy Brown Is Coming Back Sooner Than We Thought\u2014And with a Twist", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Maybe we should call the upcoming revival Brown vs. Brown.", "id": "5afc3e74378e5c678a725c0f", "keywords": "television,murphy brown", "news_keywords": "television,murphy brown", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5afc3e74378e5c678a725c0f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Maybe we should call the upcoming revival Brown vs. Brown.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Maybe we should call the upcoming revival Brown vs. Brown.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Murphy Brown Is Coming Back Sooner Than We Thought\u2014And with a Twist", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/murphy-brown-cbs-fall-schedule-conservative-son-fox-and-friends-morning-joe"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Maybe we should call the upcoming revival Brown vs. Brown.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afc4b710774fa5f3ff3a217/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/murphy-brown-son.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Murphy Brown Is Coming Back Sooner Than We Thought\u2014And with a Twist"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
