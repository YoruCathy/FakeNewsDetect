If you don\u2019t, grab one anyway\u2014because this is the most exciting thing you\u2019re going to read all day. It turns out the movie Twitter dreamt up about Rihanna and Lupita Nyong\u2019o playing a pair of genius scammers is actually coming to life.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reported Monday that Netflix has secured a deal for the concept at the Cannes Film Festival after a \u201cdramatic negotiation session.\u201d Rihanna and Nyong\u2019o will star, Ava DuVernay will reportedly direct, and Issa Rae will write the script. Rae\u2019s team confirmed to Vanity Fair that the project is in the works, adding that the original Twitter users who imagined the concept for this film will be credited and included in some form.\n\nDuVernay also seemed to confirm the news on Twitter, tweeting, \u201cWe deserve nice things,\u201d and sharing a link to the movie news on Twitter Moments.\n\nThe prospective movie was inspired by a photo of Rihanna and Nyong\u2019o side by side at a Miu Miu fashion show in 2014.\n\nThe picture went viral on Tumblr shortly after it was taken, then took the Internet by storm again recently when Twitter user 1800SADGAL tweeted it out, joking that in the image, \u201cRihanna looks like she scams rich white men and lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scans.\u201d\n\nAfter that, several more Twitter users tweeted about the hypothetical project, dreaming up storylines for a fictional film and imagining who should join the behind-the-scenes team\u2014tagging DuVernay and Rae in the process. Things took a more serious turn when Nyong\u2019o herself tweeted their work at Rihanna, saying, \u201cI\u2019m down if you are.\u201d Rihanna tweeted back, saying, \u201cI\u2019m in Pit\u2019z.\u201d You know things are getting real when celebrities start using nicknames.\n\nFrom there, DuVernay and Rae tweeted their approval of the project, getting everyone\u2019s hopes up for this fictional idea to start becoming a reality. Now it is.\n\nThe project is still in the early stages and will potentially begin production in 2018, per EW. Representatives for Rihanna, Nyong\u2019o, and DuVernay have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%25202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/590b4c4357983038bdeec74b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-05-05-dakota.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58fe037a6b7e687456747ea3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/rihanna-lupita-movie%2525202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57d19ae0672442710750f91d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/insecure-issa-rae-melina-matsoukas-01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/590b63ad57983038bdeec75a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-05-05-rihanna-b.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%2525202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58fe022279025369056b2f3b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/rihanna-obsessed-with-queen-bday.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/590b4c426231b140f4d5c2c8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/week-in-fashion-05-05-elle.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%25202.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta", "Yohana Dest", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/rihanna-lupita-movie-netflix", "title": "That Twitter-Inspired Rihanna-Lupita Heist Movie Is Actually Happening", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Hold on, Twitter\u2014you might\u2019ve just done something good.", "id": "5923431952a3f44dc6f3a87c", "keywords": "movies,rihanna,lupita nyong'o,ava duvernay,issa rae", "news_keywords": "movies,rihanna,lupita nyong'o,ava duvernay,issa rae", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5923431952a3f44dc6f3a87c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Hold on, Twitter\u2014you might\u2019ve just done something good.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%202.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%202.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Hold on, Twitter\u2014you might\u2019ve just done something good.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%25202.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "That Twitter-Inspired Rihanna-Lupita Heist Movie Is Actually Happening", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/rihanna-lupita-movie-netflix"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Hold on, Twitter\u2014you might\u2019ve just done something good.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59234ae752a3f44dc6f3a87f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lupita-Nyongo-Rihanna%25202.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "That Twitter-Inspired Rihanna-Lupita Heist Movie Is Actually Happening"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
