A number of legal experts have said Kardashian may have potentially violated the state's revenge porn laws.\n\nLisa Bloom, the women's rights lawyer who represented Mischa Barton in her recent successful civil suit against an ex to prevent revenge-porn images of her from being released, weighed in on the furore on Twitter, saying: \"Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off\".\n\nIn October 2013, the California Governor signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible prison time for those who post naked photos of their ex-partners. In 2014, the first person was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for violating the law.\n\nThe former couple, who have a daughter called Dream, announced their engagement last April.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They have their own reality TV series on popular US entertainment channel E! called Rob and Chyna.\n\nIn the slew of posts, Kardashian claimed Chyna, a model and former stripper, sent him a video of her cheating with another man.\n\nHe wrote: \"Today Chyna sent me a video after I just bought her 250K of jewellery. She sends me this video... of another man in our bed.\"\n\nKardashian also made a series of other claims about Chyna before having his Instagram account suspended. He accused her of taking drugs and having plastic surgery after the birth of Dream Ren\u00e9e Kardashian last November.\n\nChyna responded to the allegations with a Snapchat post, which has since been deleted. It said: \"Rob you did all this but you beat me up and try act it never happen !!!!! You put hand on me I swear on god !!!!! On my kids but I'm supposed to be quiet because you're a Kardashian.\"\n\nKardashian, who is known for his appearances on reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians alongside his family, later continued his rant on Twitter after having his Instagram account deactivated. He reposted the video he claims Chyna sent to him.\n\nRepresentatives for Chyna and Kardashian did not immediately respond to request for comment.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/06/10/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/06/10/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-nude-photots-criminal-charges-revenge-porn-reality-tv-ex-girlfriend-a7826531.html", "title": "Rob Kardashian 'could face criminal charges' after posting nude photos of Blac Chyna on Instagram", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-nude-photots-criminal-charges-revenge-porn-reality-tv-ex-girlfriend-a7826531.html", "title": "Rob Kardashian could go to jail over revenge porn pics of Blac Chyna", "description": "'We are considering all legal options and recourses at this time,' says Chyna\u2019s lawyer", "updated_time": "2017-07-06T19:49:58+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/06/10/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/7826531"}, "description": "Rob Kardashian could face criminal charges for posting a series of explicit photos of his former fianc\u00e9e Blac Chyna on Instagram according to legal experts.
