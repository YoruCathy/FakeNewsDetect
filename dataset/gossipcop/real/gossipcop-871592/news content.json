From Tina Fey\u2019s mind came a high school comedy that was all too real when it came to social cliques. With a line of Mean Girls Burn Book makeup brushes in the works and a Broadway musical happening *this* year, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re all still obsessing over the movie. That\u2019s why it\u2019s no surprise that Twitter is going crazy over this Regina George lookalike.\n\nA high schooler named April\u2019s senior photos went viral after Twitter mistook her for the Queen of Plastics, Regina George.\n\nBlonde hair, blue eyes, and a striking smile were enough for Twitter to go crazy with their comparisons. Honestly, we see the resemblance! But in an interview with E! News, April says she doesn\u2019t see it.\n\nApril says her tweet caught like wildfire and spread quickly.\n\nIm laughing so hard pic.twitter.com/hFpHYuWyWB \u2014 \u1d0d\u1d00\u1d05 \u01eb\u1d1c\u1d07\u1d07\u0274 \ud83e\udd84 (@madieofthekings) August 4, 2017\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, she can definitely sit with us.\n\nThat pink shirt on the right better have been worn on wednesday if not ' you can't sit with us!' \u2014 nat \u263e (@natalliieexo) August 4, 2017\n\nAnd, like the rest of the internet, we think she\u2019s really pretty!\n\nBless the internet.
