Which recent movies will become classics? Show all 21 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Which recent movies will become classics? 1/21 Birdman - Undoubtedly Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s masterpiece will surely be remembered for years to come - fiercely original in its concept, brave in its single take(esque) format and the perfect satire of a very specific and bizarre era of cinema we find ourselves in. What perhaps was so astonishing about this Best Picture Oscar winner was that in spite of its experimental format and lofty intentions, it still also managed to be hugely entertaining, and is eminently rewatchable. - Christopher Hooton Fox Searchlight Pictures 2/21 There Will Be Blood - Potentially Inherent Vice feels like it\u2019s been forgotten already, The Master was great but too weighty for some, but There Will Be Blood is the Paul Thomas Anderson film that comes up time and time again in pub film conversations, whether they\u2019re between cinephiles or more casual fans. A blank yet brutal indictment of lucre, Daniel Day Lewis gave one of his best ever performances as oil man Daniel Plainview, and Jonny Greenwood\u2019s fearsome score is still being performed live several years after its release. But mainly, \u201cI DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE! I DRINK IT UP!\u201d - CH 3/21 Avatar - Probably not It\u2019s undeniable that James Cameron\u2019s gargantuan blockbuster Avatar will find its place in the cinematic history books. With a worldwide gross of over 2.7 billion, it\u2019s currently the highest earning film of all time - even Star Wars' The Force Awakens return couldn't topple it. But will it actually be remembered fondly? Its ground-breaking special effects already betray the first signs of aging, and though its use of 3D was revolutionary at the time, it\u2019s now so pedestrian as to be found in a Glee concert movie. What is there to revere then? The patronising narrative re-hash of the plot to Dances With Wolves? Or the bit where two cat-aliens had sex by plugging their hair braids into each other? - Clarisse Loughrey 4/21 Whiplash - Within its own genre at least Whiplash was perhaps the most buzzy, \"have you seen it yet?\" film of 2014, and winning major Oscars off a budget of $3.3 million was no mean feat. Damien Chazelle managed to make a film about drumming absolutely edge-of-your-seat stuff, and succeeded by not patronising his audience - trusting that even if they didn\u2019t understand the music theory detail, they would still be able to revel in it. Unfortunately, it might just be too small a film to be remembered as a \u2018classic\u2019, but will certainly be circling the top of \u2018best movies about music\u2019 lists for some years to come. - CH 5/21 Skyfall \u2013 Depends who\u2019s Bond next Best Bond of all time? Skyfall\u2019s slick, true, but its status as an icon seems heavily premature. We\u2019re still clinging onto the Craig era, and it\u2019s hard to argue that Skyfall doesn\u2019t do the same; trading its entire dramatic tension on the premise that we\u2019ve long been deeply attached to this grizzled Bond and equally grizzled M. In Silva\u2019s personal vendetta, or in the neat metaphors of Skyfall Lodge\u2019s crumbling exteriors and Bond\u2019s crumbling interiors of a post-Vesper Lynd world; it\u2019s only once the franchise has moved on to new pastures that we\u2019ll truly start to see whether Skyfall can go the distance. Doesn\u2019t help that Spectre was a bit of a disappointment, though. -CL 6/21 Mad Max: Fury Road - A gutsy yes Yes, it\u2019s a madly confident move to already claim Fury Road\u2019s going to a bonafide classic within its first year of release, but Fury Road is a mad movie. 36 years after its original incarnation, George Miller returned to the wasteland to conjure the greatest adrenaline hit of the cinematic decade. Breathlessly edited, hued with the colours of dust and dirt and rage; packed to the brim with practical stunt work unseen in the digital age. Plus, it\u2019s a film that actively dismantles the patriarchy through a gun-slinging, metal-armed Charlize Theron. If it\u2019s not remembered as one of the greatest blockbusters of its time, it\u2019ll certainly be remembered as one of the gutsiest. - CL 7/21 The Great Beauty - No, but it damn well should be It won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2014, but this Paolo Sorrentino masterpiece is still unknown to most. It centres on a group of aging intellectuals partying on rooftops across Rome to Eurodance, and within this frame of superficiality it manages staggering profundity. The dialogue is rich, the cinematography sumptuous, and if Fellini is considered classic, this fellow Italian\u2019s work certainly should be too. - CH 8/21 Little Miss Sunshine - Within its own genre, yes The \u2018Sundance Effect\u2019 has unfortunately developed a near plague of insufferable, self-conscious mawkishness over the years. Misfit boys finding new meaning to their existence in the arms of pink-haired manic pixie dream girls; sun-dappled bike rides as the latest band to feature a ukulele solo play softly in the distance. Some have indeed come off this false and cloying (Zach Braff\u2019s Garden State), others smarter and keener (last year\u2019s Me and Earl and the Dying Girl); but as the fires of kook devour all in sight, there will always remain one film left standing in the ashes: Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris\u2019 Little Miss Sunshine. One scene that guarantees its elevation above the rabble sees teenager Dwayne (Paul Dano) realise he\u2019s colour-blind, and thus will never be able to achieve his dream of becoming a jet fighter. Dano\u2019s meltdown here is so raw, and so positively tragic, that it\u2019ll be a hard job to ever forget that epic f-bomb as the years pass. - CL 9/21 Lost in Translation - I'll still be watching it in my 80s at least Really a perfect movie. The casting couldn't have been better and Sofia Coppola conveys the choking feeling of an overly air-conditioned hotel room like no-one else. So many of the shots were beautiful in their simplicity. Bill Murray making a nice crisp, clean golf shot before walking off down the course. The flower arranging scene. Bill lightly grabbing Scarlett Johansson's foot and this subtly serving as the film's 'kiss'. It's the unconventional romance at the heart of the film that makes it so great, though, which is as much about companionship as physical and emotional love. - CH 10/21 Crash - Hahahahahahahahaha Seriously, how did it win that Oscar? Even the director doesn't know. - CH 11/21 Pan\u2019s Labyrinth - Absolutely Guillermo del Toro dreams on celluloid; he\u2019s a weaver of fairy tales in an age where innocence is presumed dead. It\u2019s through innocence, through innocent eyes, that we witness the darkest excesses of human nature in a way that so exposes the incomprehensibility of evil committed in the pursuit of power. Through young Ophelia\u2019s perspective we watch the horrors of Franco\u2019s Spanish regime play out, the barbaric cruelty of her stepfather Captain Vidal; she fears not the horned faun who lives in the labyrinth when it\u2019s so clear her own patriarchal figurehead is the true monster. And though its finale may be heart-breaking, del Toro still allows innocence a certain victory. Victory through Ophelia\u2019s eyes, those pure and hungry enough to see beyond the borders of her bleak reality to find an escape from the seemingly unstoppable monstrosities of adulthood. - CL Warner Bros. 12/21 I\u2019m Still Here - When everyone realises its genius Initially admonished for being exploitative of Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s \u2018condition\u2019, it was astonishing that, when this Casey Affleck-directed mockumentary was revealed to be a hoax, most critics didn\u2019t give it a second review, and those who did still disliked it. In hindsight this was so much more than a prank. Phoenix stayed in character as a failed actor turned hip-hop artist for months on end. This dedication wasn\u2019t for nothing either (unlikely say, DiCaprio in The Revenant), I\u2019m Still Here is actually a very funny, moving and subtly satirical film, and definitely original. - CH 13/21 Boyhood - I doubt it While it too was an unprecedented piece of cinema, Boyhood for me faded from the memory very quickly. Dismissing this film as essentially a \u2018puberty timelapse\u2019 might be a little harsh, but the set-up did ultimately come off gimmicky and as a coming of age story it failed to resonate. Admirable, but not a \u2018classic\u2019 - CH Universal Pictures 14/21 The Social Network - Yes I was less than thrilled at the prospect of a movie about Facebook, but then pleasantly surprised upon watching it. A holy production trinity of David Fincher (director), Aaron Sorkin (screenwriter) and Trent Reznor (score) told a story that changed all of our lives with such panache. Texting, the internet, social media etc are so prosaic that many authors and filmmakers disingenuously leave them out of their stories, but here they were central and yet still the film was engrossing, stylish and human. - CH 15/21 Django Unchained - Hell yeah/hell maybe Swiping its titular character\u2019s name from a 1966 Spaghetti Western directed by Sergio Corbucci, Tarantino utilised his trademark flair for ultra-violence and nihilistic humour to create the perfect meeting point between revisionism and classicism. Django channeled brutality in the name of righteous fury, allowing the freedom fighting slaves of a pre-Civil War Deep South their own legendary cowboy of the John Wayne or Clint Eastwood type. - CL 16/21 The Tree of Life - A few people will kid themselves it\u2019s classic Terrence Malick\u2019s experimental drama couldn\u2019t really have been more ambitious or tried to chip away at a bigger chunk of existence. As such, it was automatically lauded by many who didn\u2019t really know what to make of it, but looking back, was it worthy of the praise? The Brad-Pitt-is-a-family-man-in-the-50s plot strand was actually pretty unremarkable, and were it not for the brazenness of the extended shots of the universe being formed I doubt it would have made top ten lists the way it did. - CH 17/21 Her - Yes, as a historical document Films depicting the future remain fascinating decades later because they show, in retrospect, how we wanted the world to progress and what developments we simply couldn\u2019t have conceived. As such Her will definitely still be getting talked about in years to come, whether or not we do indeed end up falling in love with our computers. (Also see: Ex Machina) - CH 18/21 Any of the space movies? Maybe Interstellar We seem to get a big budget space movie annually these days, and while none of them really have the creativity of Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar stands a chance of staying atop VOD libraries. Gravity and The Martian, while technically brilliant, were pretty forgettable, and don\u2019t get me started on Sunshine. Interstellar was very impressive though, and if a Christopher Nolan film\u2019s going to stand out I\u2019d rather it be this one than\u2026 - CH 19/21 Inception - Please no Yes, it\u2019s insanely watchable and the plot zips along nicely, but seriously, can we stop pretending people falling backwards off chairs and out of camp, alpine sub-dream worlds amounts to anything more than an overly convoluted, albeit pretty, action movie? - CH 20/21 The Wolf of Wall Street - Not compared to Scorsese\u2019s earlier work If there\u2019s a burden of the artistic revolutionary, it\u2019s that revolution is only ever momentary in its form; Martin Scorsese made his mark back in 1973 with Mean Streets, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s been difficult to paint over in the 43 years which have since passed. The Wolf of Wall Street faults itself only in being pure Scorsese; it\u2019s a film which trades purely in the breathless, macho style already so entrenched in cinematic culture. Essentially, Scorsese\u2019s own genre-defining genius has doomed to obscurity any latter work which dares to fold into the director\u2019s own natural form of expression; it\u2019s made derivative any work which doesn\u2019t actively rebel against what he\u2019s been most celebrated for. A tough reality, but a reality nonetheless. - CL Paramount Pictures 21/21 Nymphomaniac - Maybe if Part II hadn\u2019t happened Even the truest of arthouse directors are culpable for the whims of Hollywood franchises. Yes, with his dual Nymphomaniac films, Lars von Trier managed to ruin the potential classic of his career by needlessly stretching his narrative across two films; churning out the NC-17 answer to Peter Jackson\u2019s Hobbit trilogy in the process. Strip Nymphomaniac of the controversy and media hysteria surrounding its use of pornographic actors in its sex scenes; and there\u2019s a torn, throbbing soul at its centre. For all its salaciousness, von Trier\u2019s exploration of the crippling effects of shame society burdens those, especially its women, who dare seek sexual pleasure is genuinely haunting. That\u2019s in Part I, however; by the time Joe\u2019s life story sees her grow from Stacy Martin into Charlotte Gainsbourg, von Trier\u2019s epic dissolves into the bang of a drum in continuous, endless cycles. She\u2019s horny and sad; we got it, Lars. - CL 1/21 Birdman - Undoubtedly Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s masterpiece will surely be remembered for years to come - fiercely original in its concept, brave in its single take(esque) format and the perfect satire of a very specific and bizarre era of cinema we find ourselves in.

Unfortunately, it might just be too small a film to be remembered as a \u2018classic\u2019, but will certainly be circling the top of \u2018best movies about music\u2019 lists for some years to come. - CH 5/21 Skyfall \u2013 Depends who\u2019s Bond next Best Bond of all time? Skyfall\u2019s slick, true, but its status as an icon seems heavily premature.
