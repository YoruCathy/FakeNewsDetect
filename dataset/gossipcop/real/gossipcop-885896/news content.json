She is also an executive producer on the comedy series, which follows longtime best friends Raven (Raven-Symon\u00e9) and Chelsea (original \u201cThat\u2019s So Raven\u201d star Anneliese van der Pol) who are each divorced with kids of their own and living in one household. Unbeknownst to the kids, Raven still catches glimpses of the future, and unbeknownst to Raven, her son has discovered he has the same ability to see into the future.\n\nAbout one year ago, Raven-Symon\u00e9 departed \u201cThe View,\u201d on which she was a co-host from 2015-2016, to develop \u201cRaven\u2019s Home\u201d with Disney Channel, which required her to move from New York to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly proud of our first season and the fact that Raven has returned home to Disney Channel in a very big way.

Since premiering, the show has performed strongly in its Friday 8 p.m. timeslot and has become Disney Channel\u2019s No.1 streamed series with nearly 4.5 million viewers on YouTube and 10 million VOD views.\n\n\u201cRaven\u2019s Home\u201d was developed by Scott Thomas and Jed Elinoff, and created by \u201cThat\u2019s So Raven\u201d creators Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman.
