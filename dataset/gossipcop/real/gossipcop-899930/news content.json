I would have fizzled away into the sunset,\" Stamos said.\n\nThe actor explained that, for a long time in his life, he thought that being a husband and a father was something he'd never get the chance to experience.\n\nJohn Stamos Says Life as a Dad Is 'More Beautiful Than I Imagined' (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

And we have a beautiful baby boy now.\"\n\n\"It's better than I ever imagined,\" he added.\n\nSoon after welcoming their son, Stamos' wife told ET that the couple were already thinking about having more kids \"ASAP.\" According to the Full House alum, McHugh wasn't exaggerating.\n\n\"Caitlin wants one tonight!\" Stamos joked. \" This chocolate is an aphrodisiac, so I'm going to try for twins.\"\n\nAll kidding aside, Stamos said he feels the same as his wife, sharing, \"It would be great to have more kids for sure.\"\n\nFor more on the happy couple's adorable family, check out the video below.\n\nJohn Stamos Says His Son Billy Is Only Showing One of His Signature Traits So Far (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
