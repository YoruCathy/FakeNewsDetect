But to our surprise, they do.\n\nAnd, it\u2019s true.\n\nAccording to some new and special reports, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Kate and William do everything they can to ensure that their three children live as normal lives as possible.\n\nA royal insider, told The Royal UK that:-\n\n\u201cPrince William and Kate Middleton very much prioritize bringing up their lovely children in as normal as environment as possible\u201d.\n\nApparently, this kind of normality takes precedence throughout the day, and starts from first thing in the morning. Some reports suggest that Prince George is driven to his school, Thomas\u2019s of Battersea in London, by either his mother or his father.\n\nAlso read: Why Kate Middleton And Prince William Don\u2019t Have Custody Of Their Children?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Charlotte, whose nursery is within walking distance of the family home, is walked there by one of her parents too.\n\nInstead of enlisting a member of staff with these duties, the royal couple, William and Kate endeavour to put their children first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame kind of normality is there at their home too.\n\nWhen it comes to their home in Kensington Palace\u2019s Apartments, Charlotte is apparently a great hostess. As per our royal source: \u201cShe\u2019ll come up to guests and ask them if they want tea or coffee or offer them sweets\u201d.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Kate and William have seen trying to keep their children\u2019s lives normal. Earlier this month, Kate was spotted doing some back-to-school shopping with the kids, as they looked for new school shoes.\n\nAlso read: How Queen Elizabeth And The Duchess Of Cambridge, Kate, Differ As Mothers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd well, this we all know that the Duchess of Cambridge, has often been seen grocery shopping for the family, too.
