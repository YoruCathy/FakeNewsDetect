Can you warm up the orchestra for me? Text me back and let me know you got this.' He wasn't really a stalker. He must have worked at a studio or something because he had a lot of people's numbers.\n\n\"Jen and I texted for a year before we actually met. As she was driving to my house, she thought, Oh, my God, what if it's John the Orchestra Guy? And I thought, Oh, my God, what if it's John the Orchestra Guy?\" she added.\n\n\"So Jen calls me and says, 'I just want to make sure you're not John the Orchestra Guy.' I wasn't. And we met. It's our adorable love story.\"\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history.", "images": ["https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d1ff5e815795a1d3938e094a320a1865",
