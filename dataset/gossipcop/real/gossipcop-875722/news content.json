Or, for $55, there is the \u201cheart-activating\u201d rose quartz egg, for those who want more positive energy and love. Until recently, a page on Goop's website promised that the eggs would \u201cincrease vaginal muscle tone, hormonal balance, and feminine energy in general.\"\n\nAD\n\nThose claims were, well, a stretch, with no grounding in real science, according to a consumer protection lawsuit filed by state prosecutors representing 10 California counties. On Wednesday, state officials and Goop announced that they had settled the suit, with Paltrow's company agreeing to pay $145,000 in civil penalties.\n\nAD\n\nSpecifically, the suit called out Goop's jade egg, its rose quartz egg and its \u201cInner Judge Flower Essence Blend\u201d as products \u201cwhose advertised medical claims were not supported by competent and reliable science,\u201d according to the Santa Clara County district attorney's office. For example, the flower essence blend had been marketed as a blend of essential oils that could ward off depression.\n\nAnd the jade eggs? They had developed a reputation \u2014 and a backlash \u2014 of their own. Last year, the Goop website published a Q&A with \u201cbeauty guru/healer/inspiration/friend Shiva Rose\u201d touting the products under the headline \u201cJade Eggs for Your Yoni.\u201d Rose described the use of the eggs as \u201can incredible, secret practice\u201d by concubines in ancient Chinese temples.\n\nAD\n\n\"This practice is nearly as old as time \u2014 many find value in it, even if modern-day research hasn\u2019t caught up yet (or the practice will never catch its attention),\" the page stated, simultaneously brushing off any critics and creating an aura of protective mysticism around the eggs. Further down in the Q&A, Rose recommends tips for maintaining a jade egg: \u201cIf you feel like it\u2019s been drained of energy, recharge it in the full moon just the way you would a crystal.\"\n\nAD\n\nLast year, a California OB/GYN wrote a lengthy open letter to Paltrow, blasting the eggs and their purported benefits as \u201cthe biggest load of garbage I have read on your site since vaginal steaming.\"\n\n\"But hey, you aren\u2019t one to let facts get in the way of profiting from snake oil,\u201d Jen Gunter wrote. \u201cThe claim that they can balance hormones is, quite simply, biologically impossible. Pelvic floor exercises can help with incontinence and even give stronger orgasms for some women, but they cannot change hormones. As for female energy? I\u2019m a gynecologist and I don\u2019t know what that is!?\"\n\nGunter also warned that sleeping with a jade egg in one's vagina could lead to bacterial vaginosis or toxic shock syndrome \u2014 and that it was an equally bad idea to walk around with them inside.\n\nAD\n\n\"Overenthusiastic Kegel exercises or incorrectly done Kegel exercises are a cause of pelvic pain and pain with sex in my practice,\u201d Gunter wrote. \u201cImagine how your biceps muscle (and then your shoulders and then your back) might feel if you walked around all day flexed holding a barbell? Right, now imagine your pelvic floor muscles doing this.\"\n\nAD\n\nIf Paltrow was moved by the professional medical advice, it wasn't reflected on Goop's website last year, which published a follow-up letter to the editor titled \"12 (More) Reasons to Start a Jade Egg Practice\u201d that hit back at jade egg critics for \u201csexually shaming a woman for sharing her personal experience.\"\n\nA year later, the consumer protection lawsuit in California may have finally succeeded in persuading Goop to tone it down. Although the eggs are still available for sale on Goop's website, gone are the claims on the product pages themselves that they will balance hormones or regulate your menstrual cycles.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to California officials, those who purchased either of the eggs or the flower essence from Goop between Jan. 12 and Aug. 31 of last year are entitled to full refunds, if they contact customerservice@goop.com or 1-844-WTF-GOOP. (Yes, that is the real phone number.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe health and money of Santa Clara County residents should never be put at risk by misleading advertising,\u201d Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement. \u201cWe will vigilantly protect consumers against companies that promise health benefits without the support of good science \u2026 or any science.\"\n\nHowever, the Q&A with Rose and the letter to the editor recommending people start using jade eggs remain on Goop's website. Although not technically part of the product pages, the Q&A and other articles on Goop.com continue to claim that the eggs \u201ccultivate sexual energy, clear chi pathways in the body, intensify femininity, and invigorate our life force. To name a few!\u201d Disclaimers at the bottom of the articles, added before the settlement, states they are for informational purposes only and not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Goop maintained in a statement that the settlement does not indicate any liability on their part but, rather, an \u201chonest disagreement\u201d that the company wanted to settle \u201cquickly and amicably.\"\n\nAD\n\n\u201cGoop provides a forum for practitioners to present their views and experiences with various products like the jade egg. The law, though, sometimes views statements like this as advertising claims, which are subject to various legal requirements,\u201d Goop chief financial officer Erica Moore said in a statement. \u201cThe [California Food, Drug and Medical Device Task Force] assisted us in applying those laws to the content we published, and we appreciate their guidance in this matter as we move from a pioneer in this space to an established wellness authority.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Goop has drawn negative attention for dubious health claims about its serums, vitamins, crystals, \u201cdetox\u201d regimens and other products. The nonprofit group Truth in Advertising has documented more than 50 examples of Goop claiming that the products it sells or promotes \u201ccan treat, cure, prevent, alleviate the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments, ranging from depression, anxiety, and insomnia, to infertility, uterine prolapse, and arthritis, just to name a few.\"\n\nAD\n\nAbout a third of those products \u2014 or simply their misleading claims \u2014 have since been taken down, the group reported.\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/9deae4bf-86c8-4f49-8658-ce5f2f4b2a30.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KeKOuQACDqWmhzjL2wdIztBNzpE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOZE3NDOLYI6RNGY5L3Y2TCUJQ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KeKOuQACDqWmhzjL2wdIztBNzpE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOZE3NDOLYI6RNGY5L3Y2TCUJQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2018/09/05/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-touted-benefits-putting-jade-egg-your-vagina-now-it-must-pay/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop touted the \u2018benefits\u2019 of putting a jade egg in your vagina.
