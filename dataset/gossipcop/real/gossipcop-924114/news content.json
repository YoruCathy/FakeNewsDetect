My last relationship started when I was 18 and ended a year ago. And I definitely did the dating thing for a minute and was like, \u2018I need to take time for myself.\u2019 And it was the most monumental time in my life, which was both scary, terrible and amazing,\u201d Pope revealed.\n\n\u201cI did go on an app called Raya; there were some hilarious people on there. It was fun. Honestly, it was just the flirting that was what made me think, \u2018Okay I can do this.\u2019 Because when you get out of that long a relationship, you\u2019re like, \u2018Will I ever find somebody again?'\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cYou think this irrational thought: \u2018I\u2019m never going to find anybody\u2019 and then you feel desired by people and you\u2019re just like, \u2018Oh, okay I can do this. This is going to be fine.\u2019 And that was a really silly, fun time and I never did anything like that. I resisted it. Then I got tired and didn\u2019t want to do this anymore and things fell into place.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cThink of You\u201d star will be back to her old stomping grounds shortly as she returns to The Voice \u2014 which she won in 2012 \u2014 as Kelly Clarkson\u2018s adviser. Pope is scheduled to appear April 2, 3 and 9.\n\nPope will release her latest song, \u201cTake You Home,\u201d Friday at midnight. \u201cCan\u2019t wait for you all to hear it,\u201d she captioned a video on Twitter, sharing a behind the scenes clip.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fcassadee-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fcassadee-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fcassadee-pope-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Fcassadee-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/cassadee-pope-sam-palladio-super-easy-breezy-romance-dog-park-date/", "title": "Cassadee Pope Talks 'Super Easy Breezy' Romance with Sam Palladio", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Cassadee Pope,Couples,Music News,Nashville,News,Sam Palladio", "news_keywords": "Cassadee Pope,Couples,Music News,Nashville,News,Sam Palladio", "description": "\"When you get out of that long a relationship, you're like, 'Will I ever find somebody again?'\" the singer said of moving on from her broken engagement", "og": {"title": "Cassadee Pope's 'Super Easy Breezy' Romance with\u00a0Sam Palladio Began with Bonding over Dogs", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/cassadee-pope-sam-palladio-super-easy-breezy-romance-dog-park-date/", "description": "Cassadee Pope&nbsp;is opening up about her new relationship with Nashville star Sam Palladio.
