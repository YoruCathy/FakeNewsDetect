She also added Anthony Rapp, after Tomei mentioned the actor as well. \u201cAll of you,\u201d Tomei concluded, \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\nThe two then presented the award to Nicole Kidman, who added one more trophy to her collection for her performance in HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "title": "Rosanna Arquette, Marisa Tomei thank 'silence breakers' at SAG Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Marisa Tomei,Rosanna Arquette", "news_keywords": "Marisa Tomei,Rosanna Arquette", "description": "Rosanna Arquette, herself a voice who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, thanked 'silence breakers' alongside Marisa Tomei at the 2018 SAG Awards", "og": {"title": "Rosanna Arquette, Marisa Tomei thank 'silence breakers' at SAG Awards", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "description": "While presenting the nominees for Best Actress in a Limited Series at the SAG Awards Sunday night, actors Rosanna Arquette and Marisa Tomei took a&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "description": "Rosanna Arquette, herself a voice who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, thanked 'silence breakers' alongside Marisa Tomei at the 2018 SAG Awards", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/sag-awards/2018/01/21/rosanna-arquette-marisa-tomei-sag-awards-silence-breakers/", "title": "Rosanna Arquette, Marisa Tomei thank 'silence breakers' at SAG Awards", "description": "Rosanna Arquette, herself a voice who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein, thanked 'silence breakers' alongside Marisa Tomei at the 2018 SAG Awards", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fgettyimages-908523566-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516464000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
