But this year, when it comes to the hot new dos it seems all bets are off and the look of the season is anything but predictable. Not only are a number of your favs suddenly dyeing their hair a vibrant shade of ros\u00e9, but people like Katy Perry, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Cara Delevingne, and Kristen Stewart are all chopping their hair into pixie cuts or going all in and shaving it off completely. And the latest star to jump aboard that bandwagon is the most surprising yet as Gigi Hadid tries her hand at Kris Jenner\u2019s signature coif in the latest Stuart Weitzman campaign.\n\nThe model returned as the face of the high-end shoe brand for their Fall/Winter 2017 in a series of stark, minimalist black and white images shot by the legendary photographer and personal friend of Gigi, Mario Testino. In the first image, the Vogue cover star wears a black trench coat slung around her shoulders paired with the brand\u2019s over-the-knee white, heeled Tiemodel boot and in the second wears a white button-down with the It-Girl-approved Cling ankle boot.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nImage zoom Mario Testino/Stuart Weitzman\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Gigi Hadid Puts on a Puzzling Pants Parade During N.Y.C. Heat Wave\n\nBut there\u2019s something else striking about these images aside from the footwear\u2013Gigi\u2019s brand new beauty look! For the campaign, Weitzman decided to switch things up, putting their favorite model in a pixie cut wig by Shay Ashual. The faux style was meant to evoke Jean Seberg\u2019s character in the iconic French New Wave film Breathless, giving the images a 1960s feel as well as \u201ca chic and modern twist on her fourth consecutive Stuart Weitzman campaign.\u201d Now the only question is, will this photo shoot convince Gigi to finally take the plunge and make the cut for real? It could really help her and Zayn take their couple twinning to all new heights.\n\nWhat do you think of Gigi\u2019s new look? Which boot is your favorite?
