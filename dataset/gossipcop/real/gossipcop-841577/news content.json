Traditionally minded in her approach to acting and highly idealistic, she clashes with GLOW's director Sam Sylvia due to his cynical demeanor and often unconventional work style. Ruth discovers early on that Sylvia has employed her former best friend, retired soap opera actress Debbie Eagan to star in the show. Ruth and Debbie had fallen out with one another after Ruth had an affair with her husband, Mark, who she then divorced. The tension between the two women promises either to make or break the developing show. The series follows the personal and professional lives of the fictional show's numerous cast and crew as they navigate the 1980s in Southern California and Southern Nevada.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nThe show's cast features several real-life professional wrestlers, most prominently Kia Stevens (Tamm\u00e9), who has wrestled as Awesome Kong in TNA and as Kharma in WWE. Others with formal experience include:\n\nHulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and Gorgeous George appear in archived video footage in episodes 1 and 4.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally released 1 10 June 23, 2017 ( ) 2 10 June 29, 2018 ( ) 3 10 August 9, 2019 ( )\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nThe idea for the series came when Flahive and Mensch, who at the time were looking to make a new female-centric show, came across the 2012 documentary GLOW: The Story of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.[19][20] Before this, neither woman had heard of the GLOW wrestling promotion, and they became intrigued by the premise of producing a fictionalized version of it.[20] Both women found the storyline intriguing as a way of exploring the aftermath of the 1970s Woman's Liberation Movement, with Flahive telling Rolling Stone, \"We wanted to look back on the 1970s, coming out of the women's movement, and into the 1980s, and ask the question: Did it work? Did things get better?\"[19] To this end, it was important for the series to maintain a tension between whether the league was exploiting women or empowering them.[19]\n\nUrsula Hayden, the owner of the GLOW company, served as a consultant on the series and helped Flahive and Mensch with creating the show. Hayden was also on the original 1980s promotion as Babe, the Farmer's Daughter.[21]\n\nChavo Guerrero Jr. of the famous Guerrero wrestling family also served as a consultant on the series and helped train the actresses. His uncle Mando Guerrero had served in the same role for the original series.[22]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nThe series has filmed in several locations in Los Angeles; mainly in the San Fernando Valley. Chavo's Boxing Gym, which is GLOW's training grounds, was a combination of two locations: the interior was a studio set while the exterior was the rear of the San Fernando Masonic Lodge. The Pink Motel in Sun Valley was used as a stand-in for The Dusty Spur Motel, GLOW's sleeping quarters. Other notable locations include the Mayan Theater and the Hollywood Palladium.[23]\n\nPrincipal production on season 2 commenced in October 2017.[24]\n\nMarketing [ edit ]\n\nFor the Spain market, Netflix Espa\u00f1a released a series of promo videos featuring singers Marta S\u00e1nchez and Vicky Larraz.

Jeanne Basone, who wrestled in the promotion as \"Hollywood\", commented that \"Some of the training and the gym and the outfits they get correct.\" Patricia Summerland, who played \"Sunny the California Girl\" in the promotion, saw Marc Maron's character Sam Sylvia as a stark contrast to original GLOW director Matt Cimber. Eileen O'Hara, who was known as \"Melody Trouble Vixen (MTV)\", felt that the series did not properly represent the promotion.[39] Lisa Moretti, who competed as \"Tina Ferrari\" and would go on to the greatest fame among GLOW alumni as Ivory in the WWF/WWE as a three-time WWF Women's Champion during the Attitude Era, said that she was relieved that the series isn't a documentary because it was more entertaining to have a mix between fact and fiction.[40]\n\nMore positive reception came from mainstream wrestling figures including Kurt Angle.[41] Ethan Sapienza of Slate noted accurate comparisons between the series and WWE as well as the various regional promotions that made up the National Wrestling Alliance during its heyday.[42]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nComic book [ edit ]\n\nA four-issue comic book series based on the show was released in March 2019 by IDW Publishing, written by Tini Howard and illustrated by Hannah Templer.
