Abrams\u2019 survivalist drama Lost, had long been fond of the weepy but compelling soap operas that are a staple in his native land. He decided to take a chance and optioned a popular series that debuted in 2013 about an autistic young doctor trying to navigate his way through his first job at a hospital.\n\nThe plot didn\u2019t seem a likely fit with American network television. Moreover, apart from the long-standing Grey\u2019s Anatomy, hospital dramas since the halo era of George Clooney in ER were no longer in vogue.\n\nWhich makes The Good Doctor one of this television season\u2019s most intriguing success stories. It underlines the big-money politics of creating a hit in the era of peak television where perseverance, talent, the burden of race and not a little luck can make or break a show. And the story also has a key Canadian connection in showrunner David Shore, who adapted the series for American audiences.\n\nIn his first attempt as an executive producer, Kim produced a massive hit right out the gate. Or perhaps more appropriately in the afterglow of the Olympics in Pyeongchang, the rookie scored pure television gold.\n\nThe show is the most watched drama on network TV. In Canada, it beats out other highly hyped drama juggernauts such as This Is Us. In recent ratings it was the fourth most watched show in Canada after the Academy Awards, Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon. The season finale airs Monday at 10 p.m. on CTV.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\n\u201cAt this point I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d says the soft-spoken Kim, 49, in an interview. \u201cI realize how difficult it is to get any show on the air, let alone one as successful as this one. I\u2019ve been knocking on wood every day.\u201d\n\nBut Kim says the show really started to develop quickly with the input of London, Ontario\u2019s Shore, who viewers may remember from the last medical series he created, House starring Hugh Laurie as the acerbic Dr. Gregory House.\n\nThe Good Doctor \u201cdidn\u2019t strike me as a Korean show that I could turn into an American show. It struck me as a good universal story,\u201d says Shore, 58, in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing that people really tell stories in very similar ways. We are not as different as we think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had never seen a character living with autism on American TV. The humanity of those characters on the Korean show was what I was interested in, not just living with autism,\u201d says Kim. \u201cHe was a three-dimensional human being, not a polemic. And I was lucky to be working with David, who really put everything into focus. When we brought him on board that\u2019s when it became a competitive situation.\u201d\n\nIronically, even with Shore on board, the show was turned down by CBS, the same seemingly tone-deaf network that refused to give Kim an equal pay raise, even though he brought the series there first. It was ABC that gave Kim a chance.\n\nYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...\n\nWhen all was said and done, CBS lost a talented actor and potential hit to a competitor. But when asked if he sees any irony in the outcome, Kim is diplomatic.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t think of it in those terms. My work as an actor is completely separate from my work as a producer,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had still been working as an actor and it had gone another way I could still have been out there trying to produce this. Maybe things work out for a reason.\u201d\n\nLeaving the successful Hawaii Five-0 wasn\u2019t an easy decision for Kim. The actor has been low key in interviews discussing his resignation. But the Star asked whether he thinks it\u2019s time for Hollywood to be called out over its representation of women and people of colour. Recently, Variety reported that The Crown star Claire Foy, who played the Queen, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.\n\n\u201cThe idea of parity and equality is something that is resounding throughout the industry,\u201d says Kim. \u201cNot just in the form of race, but in gender equality and in general equality of treatment everywhere. It\u2019s part of a larger awareness of simply treating people with respect. If what happened to me last year is a small part of that conversation, then I\u2019m happy about that.\u201d\n\nIt took three years for Kim to develop the story of young Dr. Shaun Murphy, the good doctor of the title. Murphy, played with earnestness by Bates Motel\u2019s Freddie Highmore, is endlessly curious, never mean-spirited. He could well be the alter ego of Dr. House, a darker creature with a deep well of cynicism topped by intellectual arrogance.\n\n\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t want to do the House character again,\u201d says Shore, who won an Emmy Award for his writing on that show. \u201cIn fact I didn\u2019t want to do a medical series again. I felt I had told those stories. But then it was about responding to a character and exploring the world through that character in a different way through different eyes. They have diametric points of view. But they are asking similar questions.\u201d\n\nAs one of Hollywood\u2019s most successful producers, Shore is typically inundated with project ideas, but somehow he managed to find time to watch most of the original Korean soap opera.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not something I always get. I don\u2019t normally watch the tapes. But I phoned up the development executive and immediately said I wanted to do the show,\u201d says Shore.\n\nIn some ways the success of the show also speaks to the need for \u201cfeel-good\u201d dramas in a tough and divisive political environment in the United States.\n\nGet more of the Star in your inbox Never miss the latest news from the Star.

But we are living in a time that we\u2019re living in,\u201d says Shore, a trained lawyer who graduated from the University of Toronto law school. \u201cAnd perhaps it is relevant that people are responding to something that is somewhat hopeful. There is so much uncertainty out there.\u201d\n\nWith the chart-topping viewership of The Good Doctor, you can pretty much expect a slew of copycat medical dramas over the next few seasons. But whatever the reason for the show\u2019s hit status, producer Kim seems to have found one way to create his own personal success.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s important is for people of colour to be creating story and to get into positions of power,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s an easy thing. But we have to remember how important that is, to create our own stories so we don\u2019t perpetuate the cycle or become victims in our own industry, to go out there and push for your own vision.\u201d", "images": ["https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nuz9l&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://images.thestar.com/OG3PyCw6ld6akyXK5a9Gm5t8j-I=/1086x724/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor/daniel_dae_kim_on_the_set_of_the_good_doctor.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005674&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.thestar.com/27YPp6ezkT4MonFTZHXJ9pbKs5g=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor/daniel_dae_kim_on_the_set_of_the_good_doctor.jpg", "https://images.thestar.com/aRj6-aIaR_5zGtFk8-GpCPVg-14=/100x100/smart/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/columnist_logos/Wong_Tony_logo2015.JPG", "https://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/app-store.svg", "https://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/brandmark-thestar.svg", "https://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/google-play.svg", "https://www.thestar.com/assets/img/loading-spinner.svg", "https://www.thestar.com/assets/svg/logo-thestar.svg", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nuz9l&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0"], "top_img": "https://images.thestar.com/27YPp6ezkT4MonFTZHXJ9pbKs5g=/1200x800/smart/filters:cb(2700061000)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor/daniel_dae_kim_on_the_set_of_the_good_doctor.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Wong", "Television Critic"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/23/daniel-dae-kim-left-hawaii-five-o-over-a-pay-dispute-he-came-back-to-produce-tvs-biggest-drama-the-good-doctor.html", "title": "Daniel Dae Kim left Hawaii Five-0 over a pay dispute.
