Before Meghan Markle stole Prince Harry\u2019s heart \u2014 and America\u2019s as Rachel Zane on Suits \u2014 she was a briefcase model on Deal or No Deal.\n\nMarkle\u2019s job as one of the models on stage was to reveal the amount of money in the briefcase after the contestant picked a number. The bride-to-be appeared on the former NBC game show during the 2006-2007 season.\n\nThe Suits actress, 36, opened up about her time doing odd jobs during an interview with Esquire before getting her role on the USA hit in 2011.\n\n\u201cI would put that in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet. I went from working in the U.S. Embassy in Argentina to ending up on Deal,\u201d Markle told the publication in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s run the gamut. Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing.\u201d\n\nMarkle also spoke about working as a freelance calligrapher.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning. I didn\u2019t wait tables. I did calligraphy for the invitations, for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton\u2019s wedding.\u201d\n\nMarkle met Harry, 33, in July 2016, but the newly engaged pair did not confirm their relationship until that November. Palace officials revealed in a statement on Tuesday, November 28, that Markle and Harry will get married at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle in England in May 2018.\n\nDuring her first joint interview with Harry on Monday, November 27, Markle revealed she would be retiring from acting.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s been so exciting [transitioning] out of my career and into, as you said, the causes I can focus even more energy on, very early out of the gate, [is that you] have a voice that people listen to, a lot of responsibility,\u201d Markle said.\n\n\u201cI see it is a new change, a new chapter,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my show seven years, we were so fortunate to have that longevity, and I feel like I checked that box and am very proud of the work I\u2019ve done there.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal.jpg?crop=318px%2C25px%2C1439px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal.jpg?crop=318px%2C25px%2C1439px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-markle-was-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal/", "title": "Meghan Markle Was a Briefcase Model on \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Before she engaged to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle was a briefcase girl on the former NBC game show \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch: Meghan Markle Was a Briefcase Model on \u2018Deal Or No Deal\u2019", "description": "Before she engaged to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle was a briefcase girl on the former NBC game show \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/meghan-markle-was-a-briefcase-model-on-deal-or-no-deal/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal.jpg?crop=318px%2C25px%2C1439px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal.jpg?crop=318px%2C25px%2C1439px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Royals", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-28T18:32:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:25+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Before she engaged to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle was a briefcase girl on the former NBC game show \u2018Deal or No Deal\u2019 \u2014 watch", "title": "Watch: Meghan Markle Was a Briefcase Model on \u2018Deal Or No Deal\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal.jpg?crop=318px%2C25px%2C1439px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511893922.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
