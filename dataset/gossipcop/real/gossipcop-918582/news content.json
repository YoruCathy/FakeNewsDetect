Until a movie like Bridesmaids or Airplane! gets a Best Picture win or even a nomination, it\u2019s all conspicuously incomplete. Get Out is a breath of fresh air to be sure, but it\u2019s the exception,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nHorror film Get Out won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay yesterday \u2014 and some on Twitter were quick to point out that in fact, Bridesmaids scored two nominations back at the 84th Oscars, one for Best Supporting Actress and another for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nMacFarlane also provided examples of comedies over the years that have deserved a Best Picture nod, nominating Arthur, Tootsie, Little Shop of Horrors, Groundhog Day and Back to the Future as worthy contenders.\n\nWhen one follower pointed out that at least two of this year\u2019s Best Picture nominees, Lady Bird and Three Billboards, had comedic elements, MacFarlane tweeted: \u201cComedic elements for sure, but still a dramatic story first. Im talking about an unabashed comedy.\u201d\n\nComedy winners of the Best Picture Oscar have indeed been few and far between over the years, but include musical comedy Going My Way in 1944, Woody Allen rom-com Annie Hall in 1977 and silent film The Artist in 2011.", "images": ["https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/bf03ecdb18be0b720617695104de8ebd",
