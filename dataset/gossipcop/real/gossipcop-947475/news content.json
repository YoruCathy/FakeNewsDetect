Now, Amber Tamblyn, best known for her role in The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants movies, is adding her name to the growing pack of actresses who are done with Hollywood\u2019s unfair beauty standards.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times writer Jodi Kantor on Tuesday, the 35-year-old actress and activist opened up about her experience with size discrimination in the entertainment industry. Specifically, Tamblyn recalled one conversation with her agent who was told by a Warner Bros. executive that Tamblyn had the chance to become a huge star after 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2\u2033\u2014if she lost weight.\n\n\u201cI think at that point I was 128 pounds and I\u2019m 5-7. I remember my agent saying to me and she was a woman, \u2018You have a real choice here. You can either be Nicole Kidman or you can be a character actress,'\u201d Tamblyn said. \u201cAnd at that time, I was like 21 years old, so if you look at that and use that as an example and imagine that for over two decades, forms of that from when you\u2019re a child to all the way up, it does something to you.\u201d\n\nTamblyn, who is a vocal member of the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, believes that the moment was indicative of the discrimination that women face in Hollywood to be \u201cshut out\u201d of certain opportunities if they don\u2019t meet the industry\u2019s beauty standards.", "images": ["https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/chris-harrison.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=stylecaster.com&path=%2Famber-tamblyn-lose-weight-sisterhood-of-traveling-pants%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=739643", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tiger-king-netflix-1.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/blackpink-jisoo.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1130306277008218&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/5814f0acb4e987d10d263e3e6210e2a8.jpeg?resize=%2C", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/amber-tamblyn.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/prince-harry.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/amber-tamblyn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/amber-tamblyn-lose-weight-sisterhood-of-traveling-pants/", "title": "Amber Tamblyn Recalls Being Told to Lose Weight After \u2018Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Actress Amber Tamblyn opens up about being told to lose weight after \"The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants\" movies to become a star.
