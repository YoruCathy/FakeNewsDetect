The government ultimately refused to allow Margaret to marry him unless she gave up her royal privileges. She chose the privileges. \"I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Captain Peter Townsend,\" she said in a statement in 1955. \"I have been aware that, subject to my renouncing my rights of succession, it might have been possible for me to contract a civil marriage. But, mindful of the Church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have decided to put these considerations before any others.\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/royal-family-scandals-1524501151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/1-gettyimages-113917770-1524090567.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.978xh;0,0.0222xh&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/marg-1514562750.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/diana-charles-camilla-1524177687.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/royal-family-scandals-1524501151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gregory E.
