Fashion editors, stylists, influencers, and of course celebrities have already traveled from the rainy streets of New York, to London for Riccardo Tisci\u2019s Burberry debut, to Milan, where Prada was a standout. Now it\u2019s time for Paris, where everyone is patiently awaiting the debut of Hedi Slimane at Celine. Celine that is, without the accent. Meanwhile, quite a few labels have hopped the pond to show in Paris this season\u2014including Gucci (for a one-time-only affair), London\u2019s Marques\u2019 Almeida, Altuzarra and Thom Browne, who both bucked the trend of American designers coming back to New York Fashion Week. Dior kicked off Paris Fashion Week with a runway show and performance at the Hippodrome Longchamp Paris, while Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s Louis Vuitton will close out the Spring 2019 collections.
