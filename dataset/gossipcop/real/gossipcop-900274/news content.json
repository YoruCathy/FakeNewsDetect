If you look closely, you can see a small scar on the upper left part of her stomach where the incision was made.\n\nImage zoom Amanda Edwards/WireImage\n\nRELATED: Selena Gomez Tearfully Honors Francia Raisa for Life-Saving Kidney Donation\n\nTwo weeks ago, Gomez accepted the Billboard Woman of the Year Award and tearfully thanked her BFF in a touching speech. \"To be honest, I think Francia should be getting this award because she saved my life,\" the singer began her emotional speech. \u201dI would like to thank my amazing team and family because they stuck with me through some really hard times.\"\n\nWe're so thankful that they're both doing great.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121417-francia-raisa.jpg%3Fitok%3DPSyTOj_d", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121417-francia-raisa.jpg%3Fitok%3D0KqKCKtV"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121417-francia-raisa.jpg%3Fitok%3D0KqKCKtV", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Davis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/francia-raisa-kidney-transplant-scar-grownish-red-carpet", "title": "Francia Raisa Shows Off Kidney Transplant Scar on the Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,Red Carpet,Celebrity,Selena Gomez", "news_keywords": "selena gomez, selena gomez kidney transplant, francia raisa, francia raisa kidney scar", "description": "The actress displayed her kidney transplant scar from her procedure to save Selena Gomez's life on the red carpet.", "og": {"title": "Francia Raisa Glowed as She Showed Off Her Kidney Transplant Scar\u00a0on the Red Carpet", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/francia-raisa-kidney-transplant-scar-grownish-red-carpet", "description": "Francia looks so healthy post-surgery.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121417-francia-raisa.jpg%3Fitok%3D0KqKCKtV"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/francia-raisa-kidney-transplant-scar-grownish-red-carpet", "description": "The actress displayed her kidney transplant scar from her procedure to save Selena Gomez's life on the red carpet.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121417-francia-raisa.jpg%3Fitok%3D0KqKCKtV"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/francia-raisa-kidney-transplant-scar-grownish-red-carpet", "title": "Francia Raisa Glowed as She Showed Off Her Kidney Transplant Scar\u00a0on the Red Carpet", "description": "Francia looks so healthy post-surgery.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121417-francia-raisa.jpg%3Fitok%3D0KqKCKtV"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
