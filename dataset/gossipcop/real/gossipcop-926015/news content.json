Martin may be rocking cherry red hair in the shot, but she still looks identical to her famous mom.\n\n\"Happy #nationaldaughtersday Apple Martin, it\u2019s like I conjured you from a dream, you make my life,\" Paltrow wrote.\n\nThe Goop founder shares Apple and 12-year-old son Moses with her ex-husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. Paltrow rarely shares details about her kids, but she recently posted a photo of them hanging out in her backyard at the end of summer, writing, \"Noooooo summer don\u2019t go.\"\n\nFor Apple's 14th birthday in May, she wrote a heartfelt message along with a close up of her all-grown-up daughter. \"Happy birthday, my darling girl. You make everyday feel like Christmas morning,\" Gwyneth said. \"You are the most vibrant, hilarious, twirling all over the place, beautiful (inside and out) young woman. You are an amazing thinker and an incredible songwriter. Thanks for still hanging out with me, even though you are 14.\"\n\nApple is a musician just like her father, and even performed a duet of Ariana Grande's song \"Just A Little Bit Of your Heart\" with him at an event in 2016.\n\nAlthough Paltrow and Martin \"consciously uncoupled\" in 2014, the two remain close friends and often spend time together with their kids.\n\nPaltrow is currently engaged to TV producer and writer Brad Falchuk, who also gets along well with her ex, according to her Instagram. She even described them as a \"modern family\" in a post last November.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isabel Greenberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23488545/gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-apple-martin-instagram/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Daughter Apple Martin Look Like Twins in Instagram Photo", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Her 14-Year-Old Daughter Look Like Twins", "description": "Apple Martin is all grown up!", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23488545/gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-apple-martin-instagram/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-09-27 11:09:51", "published_time": "2018-09-27 06:00:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Daughter Apple Martin Look Like Twins in Instagram Photo", "description": "Like mother like daughter. \ufeffGwyneth Paltrow, 46, and her 14-year-old daughter Apple Martin truly look like twins in a rare photo, which Paltrow shared on Instagram yesterday in honor of National Daughters Day.", "keywords": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Apple Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow daughter, Brad Falchuk, Moses Martin, Gwyneth Paltrow kids, Goop, Christ Martin, Coldplay, Gwyneth and Chris", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest", "sailthru.date": "2018-09-27T18:00:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-gwyneth-paltrow-daughter-1538089569.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Her 14-Year-Old Daughter Look Like Twins", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537999200.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
