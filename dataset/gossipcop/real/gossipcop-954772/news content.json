The team that crafted it explains how. by Peter Marks\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 What sentient being doesn\u2019t know the six-decade story of her career? What\u2019s left to tell? From \u201cI Got You, Babe\u201d and the Bob Mackie gowns so provocatively sewn, to the divorce, then the other divorce, then the Oscar-winning movie career (\u201cSnap out of it!\u201d), she is always rising up from a recent trip down. The nadir of hair-product infomercials vs. the thrill of the dance-floor comeback. It should be a required part of the SAT: Write 150 words about the life of Cher. Use examples.\n\nThe curtain drops, the audience screams, the beat kicks in and the diva descends on a tiny platform strung from the rafters of the Park MGM theater on a recent Wednesday night. She\u2019s dressed in a golden glamazon bustier, with a massive wig of bright orange ringlets cascading from her shiny crown. She belts out lyrics about the glory of living in a woman\u2019s world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Her dressing room has rooms. Wings, even. It\u2019s not so much a changing area as a backstage chateau. This is Reba McEntire\u2019s sanctuary when she plays Caesars Palace in the town\u2019s longest-running country music show. She\u2019s the reigning Okie on the Strip.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the best,\u201d she says. She swings her cowboy boots over an armchair; they\u2019re from the REBA by Justin line, naturally. \u201cYou have to have that special something that connects with the audience.\u201d\n\nIt took McEntire seven hard years of honky-tonks and dance halls to break through. So even as she emerged as one of country\u2019s top-selling and most influential female artists, McEntire resolved not to remain dependent on the mood swings of Nashville\u2019s Music Row. Instead, she seized opportunity everywhere: movies, Broadway, a television series (two, actually), Carnegie Hall, a clothing line, a gig as the first female Colonel Sanders. She Reba-fied our world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead the full story: Reba McEntire never needed to be the best. She simply had to want it most. by Karen Heller\n\nNEW YORK\u2014 Philip Glass is hard to pin down. Not that he has airs; on the contrary, he\u2019s one of the most straightforward composers you\u2019re likely to meet. \u201cI\u2019m a very bad celebrity,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in it at all.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t act like one. In conversation, he asks your opinion about things, and when he chuckles at one of his own punchlines, he looks at you hopefully, waiting for a laugh. Yet he\u2019s still hard to pin down, because there have been many different Philip Glasses over the composer\u2019s 81 years. If you think you know who Philip Glass is, you probably don\u2019t.\n\nAD\n\nYou\u2019ll know the outlines, of course. Glass is one of the most popular and prolific composers alive. His output is veritably Bach-like in its range and quantity. To some people, Glass is \u201cKoyaanisqatsi,\u201d the pulsing, mind-bending film in which Glass\u2019s music and Godfrey Reggio\u2019s images play equal parts. To some, he\u2019s \u201cEinstein on the Beach,\u201d the breakout avant-garde opera he created with director Robert Wilson in 1976. Some would name the symphonies he wrote based on the albums David Bowie recorded in Berlin in the late 1970s, \u201cHeroes\u201d and \u201cLow.\u201d (He\u2019s currently working on a symphony \u2014 his 12th \u2014 based on Bowie\u2019s third Berlin album, \u201cLodger.\u201d)\n\nAD\n\nIn the new-music world, some hail his masterpiece as \u201cMusic in 12 Parts,\u201d the four-plus-hour work he wrote in the early 1970s as a summation of his distinctive musical language. Operagoers might name the 2015 revision of \u201cAppomattox,\u201d covering a century of American history, from the Civil War to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. And \u201ca lot of people like \u2018The Hours,\u2019\u201d Glass says, referring to the score of the 2002 film with Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore, one of three of his film scores nominated for an Oscar. \u201cWhy not? Beautiful women, and a nice story, and all that.\u201d\n\nRead the full story: If you think you know who Philip Glass is, you probably don\u2019t. by Anne Midgette\n\nLOS ANGELES\u2014 Wayne Shorter says he doesn\u2019t really believe in beginnings or endings, so let\u2019s just parachute into 1985, when the garrulous jazz sage felt the need to explain himself to an interviewer who couldn\u2019t keep up with his oratorical playtime: \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who jumps around when he talks because everything is connected.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat ability to connect the most disparate of dots has helped Shorter become one of the finest composers in the history of American jazz \u2014 and when he receives the Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday night, he\u2019ll be recognized for all of that, and then some. Because when you listen to the sweep of his music \u2014 whether he made it with Miles Davis, or in Weather Report, or on his own \u2014 you can practically hear Shorter\u2019s concept of \u201ceverything\u201d growing wide enough to include what lies beyond our perception.\n\n\u201cThere are colors we can\u2019t see, but they\u2019re connected to the ones we can,\u201d he says, gesturing toward an open window on a breezy October afternoon in his California living room. \u201cThere\u2019s a connection between everything.\u201d\n\nRead the full story: Jazz icon Wayne Shorter can play anything.
