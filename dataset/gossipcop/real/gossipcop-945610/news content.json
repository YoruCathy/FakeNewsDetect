Her husband confronts her captor in Canada. She delivers her own baby. Even though people died to help her escape at the beginning of the season, she\u2019s determined now to stay in Gilead, because I guess Season 3 has to be about something. One read is that there\u2019s no escaping the suffocation of a subjugating regime. Except within the show, there actually is escaping it \u2014 and yet June has decided not to.\n\nSeason 2 has been dutifully brutal, complete with ample torture, rapes, executions and murders. It gave in to every one of the show\u2019s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development or new interiority. Every inch of existence is awful. Cookies are inedible. Oprah is in exile. We\u2019re at the North Pole of misery and being told to walk north.\n\nSo all the show can do is walk in circles. June\u2019s primal wound is being separated from her daughter Hannah. That can\u2019t be heightened on, so instead, Season 2 just repeats it. This, too, could seem eerily resonant, given the human rights crisis at the Mexican border that saw immigrant children being separated from their parents. But not entirely, because one essential flash point of present-day America \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d ignores is race and ethnicity. Our United States definitely does not.\n\nJune\u2019s trauma repeats, and so does everyone else\u2019s. June\u2019s pal Emily (Alexis Bledel), who last season was punished by having her clitoris cut off, was sent to the gulag, as was Janine (Madeline Brewer), who last season had her eye removed. After they toiled for a few episodes, it was back to Gilead for them both \u2014 back to desultory trips to the market and conspiratorial whispers. Would Nick\u2019s child bride ruin everything? No; she was executed, and then everything was back to bad-normal.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Margaret Lyons"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/television/handmaids-tale-season-2.html", "title": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Season 2 Is Brutal and Not Much Else", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-07-11T16:48:02.000Z", "modified": "2018-07-11T20:14:00.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/margaret-lyons", "tag": "Hulu.com", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006000437, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/27a0cd2b-b412-5996-be8a-7e590e9118e1", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/8707c812fb0c4b23a6ec2e08286b796d", "description": "The second season gave in to the Hulu series\u2019s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Margaret Lyons", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "news_keywords": "TV,The Handmaid's Tale,Hulu.com", "pdate": 20180711, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/television/handmaids-tale-season-2.html", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Season 2 Is Brutal and Not Much Else", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "Elisabeth Moss in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which wrapped up its second season on Wednesday."}, "description": "The second season gave in to the Hulu series\u2019s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/television/handmaids-tale-season-2.html", "title": "\u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019 Season 2 Is Brutal and Not Much Else", "description": "The second season gave in to the Hulu series\u2019s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/arts/11handmaids/11handmaids-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "alt": "Elisabeth Moss in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d which wrapped up its second season on Wednesday."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/27a0cd2b-b412-5996-be8a-7e590e9118e1"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "television", "CN": "pop-culture", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "Review", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/television/handmaids-tale-season-2.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/27a0cd2b-b412-5996-be8a-7e590e9118e1", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/television/handmaids-tale-season-2.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/television/handmaids-tale-season-2.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531238400.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
