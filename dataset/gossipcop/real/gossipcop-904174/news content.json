More recently, some men, including Dwayne Johnson, announced plans to join them. The protest comes after numerous allegations of sexual harassment and assault against men in Hollywood and other industries, beginning with those against movie producer Harvey Weinstein in October.\n\nStylist Cristina Ehrlich told TIME Friday that she would be joining the effort by dressing Penelope Cruz, Greta Gerwig and Laura Dern in black.\n\n\u201cThe red carpet is watched globally and is therefore an incredible platform for and the perfect place for this sort of demonstration. Where in the past the red carpet has been about glitz and glamour, this year it isn\u2019t about standing out, it\u2019s about standing together and speaking out,\u201d she said.\n\nThe sartorial choice is being positioned as a way to call attention to the effort to end sexual misconduct. It\u2019s organized by Time\u2019s Up, a new initiative to eradicate sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, which includes the creation of a legal defense fund. Time\u2019s Up, which has also provided pins to be worn on the red carpet, is backed by more than 300 women in the entertainment industry, including Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and Meryl Streep.\n\nThis is not the first time stars have used fashion to start a conversation. Take, for example, the blue ACLU ribbons Karlie Kloss and Barry Jenkins, among others, wore to last year\u2019s Oscars, or the Planned Parenthood pin Emma Stone sported while picking up her Best Actress statuette at the same ceremony.\n\nTIME Person of the Year 2017: The Silence Breakers\n\nThis year\u2019s red-carpet protest has been subject to some criticism, with some suggesting that sporting a dress in solidarity feels like a superficial or passive way to address a problem. Actor Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, sounded off on the protest in a now-deleted tweet: \u201cYOUR SILENCE is THE problem. You\u2019ll accept a fake award breathlessly & affect no real change. I despise your hypocrisy. Maybe you should all wear Marchesa.\u201d (Marchesa is the high-end brand designed by Weinstein\u2019s wife Georgina Chapman, who announced her separation from the producer shortly after the allegations came to light.)\n\nActivist April Reign, who created the viral #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, suggested that it might send a stronger message if the actors didn\u2019t attend the Golden Globes at all.\n\nIn response to the debate, Actor Rashida Jones told InStyle that the choice to wear black dresses on the red carpet is hardly, in her estimation, a \u201csilent protest.\u201d Instead, she said, it\u2019s an opportunity to speak up and demand structural change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think why we wear black is divisive as much as it is being discussed and debated without all the facts,\u201d she said. \u201cMany women on the red carpet will discuss what\u2019s important to them about their choice to protest and wear black. We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time\u2019s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It\u2019s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
