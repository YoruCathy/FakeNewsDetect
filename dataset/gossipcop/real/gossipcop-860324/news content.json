The new trailer highlights the abuse Jose inflicted upon his sons, as well as Kitty\u2019s inability to protect her sons or stop her husband. In quintessential Lifetime movie fashion, the trailer boasts a scene in which Kitty looks nervously into a mirror in a dark room while whispering in a voice over, \u201cJust get through this day Kitty, tomorrow will be different.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the clip, the Menendez brothers plot and carry out their parents\u2019 murder and enjoy a surprise respite of freedom before the swift hammer of justice comes down \u2013 which of course prompts some furious telephone smashing in a seedy motel room.\n\nThe Menendez brothers\u2019 trial became became a national sensation as the brothers testified about their father\u2019s history of abuse. After a deadlocked jury and mistrial, Erik and Lyle were retried and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder.
