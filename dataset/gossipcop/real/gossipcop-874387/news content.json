Gilead [the fictional country in the show] and Scientology both believe that all outside sources (aka news) are wrong and evil\u2026it\u2019s just very interesting.\u201d\n\nBut Moss, who is famously hush-hush about being a Scientologist, responded, \u201cThat\u2019s actually not true at all about Scientology. Religious freedom and tolerance and understanding the truth and equal rights for every race, religion and creed are extremely important to me. The most important things to me probably. And so Gilead and \u2018THT\u2019 hit me on a very personal level.\u201d\n\nThe 35-year-old thanked the fan for the interesting question, ending the comment with a winking emoji blowing a kiss.\n\nMoss, who was raised in the church, told Vulture in 2014, \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about it anymore. I said what it meant to me, and anyone can go and look at that if they want to know what I feel. But now it\u2019s private, off limits.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/moss.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/moss.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/moss.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/08/18/elisabeth-moss-makes-rare-comment-about-scientology/", "title": "Elisabeth Moss makes rare comment about Scientology", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
