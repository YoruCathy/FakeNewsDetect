Although doctors prescribed various prescription drugs to help her deal with the side effects of treatment, she took the advice of singer and close pal David Crosby and instead turned to medicinal marijuana.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Melissa Etheridge Defends Brad Pitt, Says She \u2018Lost a Friend\u2019 When He Married Angelina Jolie\n\n\u201cIt was a wake-up call for me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I used it as medicine, it became so clear to me that it has been maligned and misunderstood, and I really wanted to help people who are suffering. Going through chemotherapy is suffering\u2026 and cannabis helps so many parts of just that. That\u2019s just the beginning of what it does medicinally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI smoked to be normal. I smoked to be out of pain. I smoked to lighten myself because you\u2019re poisoning yourself with chemo,\u201d she added. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about being high. It was just [getting] to a place where I could communicate with my children, to where I could get up, to where I could eat, where I didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital. It was great medicine.\u201d\n\nDespite beating cancer, Etheridge added that she still gets high today to maintain the \u201chealth benefits,\u201d like easing stress and sleeping better.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Melissa Etheridge Opens Up About Surviving Breast Cancer\n\nThe musician, who is married to Linda Wallem, also noted that the drug has been \u201cthe best marital aid.\u201d\n\n\"When it's date night ... it takes down your inhibition; your sexual desires are enhanced,\u201d she said. \u201cWe take a bath every night and smoke and talk and wind down and sleep a very, very good night's sleep -- and sleep is extremely important.\"\n\nSee Etheridge discuss her battle with cancer below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAA=", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/1280_et_melissaetheridge_041717.png?itok=aHdfI44-"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/1280_et_melissaetheridge_041717.png?itok=aHdfI44-", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leena Tailor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/215388_melissa_etheridge_smokes_weed_with_her_kids_it_brings_you_closer", "title": "Melissa Etheridge Smokes Weed With Her Kids: 'It Brings You Closer'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Melissa Etheridge Smokes Weed With Her Kids: 'It Brings You Closer' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/215388_melissa_etheridge_smokes_weed_with_her_kids_it_brings_you_closer", "title": "Melissa Etheridge Smokes Weed With Her Kids: 'It Brings You Closer'", "description": "The singer says marijuana has enhanced both her marriage and her relationship with her children.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/1280_et_melissaetheridge_041717.png?itok=aHdfI44-", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The singer says marijuana has enhanced both her marriage and her relationship with her children.", "title": "Melissa Etheridge Smokes Weed With Her Kids: 'It Brings You Closer'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Leena Tailor", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/215388_melissa_etheridge_smokes_weed_with_her_kids_it_brings_you_closer", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-04/1280_et_melissaetheridge_041717.png?itok=aHdfI44-"}, "description": "The singer says marijuana has enhanced both her marriage and her relationship with her children.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Music, Melissa Etheridge", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
