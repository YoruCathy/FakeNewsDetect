You need to be prepared to let everything hang out for the world to see.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t just mean exposing your emotional vulnerabilities, either. Actors often have to peel off their clothes and pretend to get intimate with folks who are, for the most part, strangers.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered what\u2019s going through an actor\u2019s head when they\u2019re filming sex scenes, you\u2019re not alone. Thankfully, more than one actor has spoken out about this strange situation. Keep going to hear what they have to say about filming sex scenes!\n\n1. Rosamond Pike on Gone Girl: \u201cYou are alone with a man who\u2019s not your husband; he\u2019s in his underwear, you\u2019re in your underwear, and you\u2019re sort of dry humping on a bed\u2026 we think, \u2018OK, we should be professional about this. We should film this on an iPhone and see how it looks.\u2019 Then you watch this thing back and it looks like we\u2019re making some sort of super creepy home porn movie.\u201d\n\n2. Justin Timberlake on Friends With Benefits: \u201cIt\u2019s actually kind of annoying. You\u2019re there for 12 hours; it\u2019s exhausting,\u201d Timberlake told BBC Newsbeat. \u201cAll those scenes revolve around the dialogue and physical humor is so tiring.\u201d\n\n3. Amy Schumer on Trainwreck: \u201cThe sex scenes that are funny, I don\u2019t care, but the ones that are actually sexual, it\u2019s like these people are seeing me be really vulnerable,\u201d Schumer told The New York Times. \u201cFrank, who\u2019s holding the boom, is seeing, \u2018Oh, this is what Amy is like when she really means business.\u2019 In between every single take, I think I screamed, \u2018It\u2019s so embarrassing!'\u201d\n\n4. Michael Fassbender on Shame: \u201cYou talk with your partner and say, \u2018What are you comfortable with? What are you not comfortable with?\u2019 And then you go for it. You try and throw away the safety nets and not worry where the camera\u2019s gonna be or how you\u2019re gonna look or worry about looking ugly.\u201d\n\n5. Jennifer Lopez on The Boy Next Door: \u201cThose scenes are embarrassing. They are uncomfortable, but your job as an actress or an actor is to make it believable, and this movie in particular \u2026 hinges on if that was believable, that it was enough to make this guy go insane.\u201d\n\n6. Hugh Grant on Four Weddings and a Funeral: \u201cThe conventional response to sex scenes is that they\u2019re horrible and not sexy and it\u2019s all so unnatural. But I\u2019ve always found filming sex scenes to be quite a turn-on. I like the experience of being in a sexual position when you\u2019re not supposed to be in one.\u201d\n\n7. Mindy Kaling on The Mindy Project: Kaling isn\u2019t afraid to get real about fake sex. \u201cObviously on-screen sex is not actual penetrative sex, but as any religious high-schooler will tell you, simulating sex can be pretty damn enjoyable as well.\u201d\n\n8. Jake Gyllenhaal on Love & Other Drugs: \u201cIt\u2019s not awkward; it\u2019s our job,\u201d he said with loads of sarcasm in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the tough life of being an actor in the movie business nowadays. It\u2019s exhausting.\u201d It must be, Jake; most of us will never know.\n\n9. Jennifer Lawrence on Passengers: \u201cI called my mom, and I was like, \u2018Will you just tell me it\u2019s OK?\u2019 It was just very vulnerable. And you don\u2019t know what\u2019s too much. You want to do it real, you want everything to be real, but then\u2026 that was the most vulnerable I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\n10. Ashton Kutcher on No Strings Attached: \u201cThere is sort of always this awkward state of, \u2018Is this OK? Is that OK?\u2019 And then in between, it\u2019s like, just, \u2018Let\u2019s act like nothing happened.\u2019 And then you see how good of an actor you really are.\u201d\n\n11. Dakota Johnson on Fifty Shades of Grey: \u201cFilming a sex scene is not a sensual or pleasurable environment. It\u2019s really hot\u2014not in a steamy, sexual way. It\u2019s just sweaty and it\u2019s not very comfortable. And on top of that, my hands and legs were tied, and I was blindfolded, and I was being hit with this bizarre tool.\u201d\n\n12. Ryan Reynolds on The Change-Up: \u201cThe scene is over now\u2026 And I reflexively, like an idiot, just put my hands right back on her breasts. And I think I\u2019m doing it to cover them up, but I\u2019m realizing now that it\u2019s a very fine line between chivalry and, you know, workplace sexual assault.\u201d\n\n13. Issa Rae on Insecure: \u201cYoung black people have sex. Sometimes it\u2019s good sex, sometimes it\u2019s bad sex, sometimes it\u2019s revenge sex. There\u2019s so many different facets. It\u2019s such a privilege to show that and it feels so real. The writer in me is always excited to write those scenes.\u201d\n\n14. James McAvoy on Wanted: He\u2019s one of the male stars who gets nervous. \u201cIt\u2019s sweaty and uncomfortable. My paranoia is, the girl I\u2019m doing the sex scene with will think I\u2019m getting off on her, I have nightmares about that, I really do.\n\n15. Kristen Stewart on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 2: \u201cOn Twilight we had to do the most epic sex scene of all time. It had to be transcendent and otherworldly, inhuman, better sex than you can possibly ever imagine, and we were like, \u2018How do we live up to that?\u2019 It was agony. Which sucks, because I wanted it to be so good.\u201d\n\n16. Dave Franco on Neighbors: \u201cYou meet each other and then you\u2019re grinding\u2014you don\u2019t even know her name, barely. You have 20 crew members who are also watching you do it. And then, of course, for me, I woke up that morning and I had a giant pimple on my ass\u2026 It sucks, right?\u201d\n\n17. Mila Kunis on Black Swan: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to have a sex scene, period. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a friend, a male, a female. You\u2019re with 100-something crew members, lighting you, re-positioning you, there\u2019s no comfort whatsoever.\u201d\n\n18. Jonathan Rhys Meyers on Dracula: \u201cSex scenes, first of all, are very easy to do, because you\u2019re usually given somebody to work with who is very beautiful and attractive, so that makes it much easier, do you know what I mean? I\u2019m telling you, you do two days of shooting sex scenes on a film set, you\u2019ll be exhausted after it.\u201d\n\n19. Viola Davis on How to Get Away With Murder: \u201cIf I\u2019m in a sex scene, I want to play the sex scene. I want to say, \u2018This is why I\u2019m attracted to you. It\u2019s gotten to this point. This is what my body looks like. I saw it as an opportunity way bigger than doing good work. I saw it as an opportunity for a dark-skinned actress of 50 to be in a role that\u2019s sexualized, not sexy.\u201d\n\n20. Ryan Gosling on Blue Valentine: \u201cActors become very professional and proficient about watching out for each other\u2019s light and not stepping on each other\u2019s lines. All of these things are artificial, and you have to strip that away if you\u2019re going to achieve a sense of intimacy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n21. Natalie Dormer on Game of Thrones: \u201cThe choreography of sex scenes is so unsexy and un-glamourous. It\u2019s all about camera angles; you have to recreate the moment so many times. It\u2019s just timing and technical.\u201d It seems like the same things some actors hate, others love\u2026\n\n22. Henry Cavill on The Tudors: \u201cIt\u2019s actually acutely uncomfortable being naked in a roomful of people. The very last thing it is is sexy. The actual physicality is very uncomfortable. All you\u2019re doing is smacking your nuts against someone, and nothing is going in.\u201d\n\n23. Margot Robbie on The Wolf of Wall Street: For Margot, it\u2019s all in a day\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, \u2018This is what you need to do. Get on with it.\u2019 The sooner you do it, the sooner you can stop doing it. It\u2019s so awkward.\u201d\n\n24. Charlie Hunnam on Sons of Anarchy: \u201cI try to be sensitive to the fact that we\u2019re doing something intimate, but also keep a clear boundary. Because I\u2019m in a very committed relationship, and I\u2019m also cognizant that it\u2019s not my girlfriend\u2019s favorite part of my job.\u201d\n\n25. Lena Dunham on Girls: \u201cI used to wear this patch, but\u2026 this patch\u2014you glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don\u2019t care\u2026 I never understand when people say, \u2018Sex scenes are so mechanical; it doesn\u2019t feel like anything.\u2019 It feels like someone f\u2013king you! It\u2019s confusing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n26. Jon Hamm on Bridesmaids: \u201cI mean, sure, there\u2019s an awkwardness about being in a weird flesh-colored thong, bouncing on top of an actress. And I am not a small human being. I weigh at least 200 pounds and I\u2019m 6-foot-2.\u201d\n\n27. Emilia Clarke on Game of Thrones: \u201cI get a lot of crap for having done nudes scenes and sex scenes. That, in itself, is so antifeminist. Women hating on other women is just the problem. That\u2019s upsetting, so it\u2019s kind of wonderful to have a scene where I was like, \u2018There you go!'\u201d\n\n28. Liam Hemsworth on The Dressmaker: \u201cIt\u2019s always pretty awkward when you have to take off your pants in front of the crew and other actors and all that stuff. During the scene, it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t feel uncomfortable whilst the cameras are rolling.\u201d\n\n29. Nicole Kidman on Big Little Lies: \u201cThe worst is a sex scene where the sex is non-consensual. I was just lying there, sort of broken and crying, and I remember at one point my director coming over and just sort of placing a towel over me because I was just lying there in half-torn underwear and just basically on the ground with nothing on.\u201d\n\n30. Luke Evans on The Girl on the Train: \u201cI got us drunk before our big sex scene. I thought we should have a little drink just to take the edge off. We were tipsy. We were show-tunes-singing-drunk while having fake sex. We sang Lion King.\u201d\n\n31. Anne Hathaway on Love & Other Drugs: \u201cThese are people who have no trouble taking their clothes off\u2014in a way their bodies are their currency. But they\u2019re terrified of exposing their vulnerability\u2014of becoming emotionally naked.\u201d\n\n32. Daniel Radcliffe on Kill Your Darlings: \u201cThe toughest was my first gay sex scene. Basically, gay sex, especially for the first time, is really f\u2013king painful. And my director said that he had never seen that portrayed accurately on film before. He wanted it to look like an authentic loss of virginity.\u201d\n\n33. Kristen Dunst on The Beguiled: \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like it. To be honest, I\u2019m like, \u2018Let\u2019s get this over with as fast as possible.\u2019 At least my last director was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to get this done quick. We\u2019re just gonna shoot it here, we\u2019ll do three takes, be done.'\u201d\n\nIt sounds like shooting a sex scene on camera is, for the most part, kind of awkward\u2014but also fun in certain ways. Will you ever look at sex scenes the same way?\n\nShare this post with your friends below!", "images":
