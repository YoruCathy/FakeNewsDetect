Some (okay, Fox News) jumped to defend Barr's right to free speech, an idiotic argument when no government body was involved in the cancellation of her show. What happened is Barr learned that there are consequences for spewing racist shit across Twitter. She lost her show, she lost people's respect, and she lost money. A lot of it.\n\nWith the cancellation of Roseanne, Barr is taking a multi-million-dollar hit. Variety reports that she made an estimated $250,000 per episode in the first rebooted season, of which there were nine episodes. That got her $2.25 million for one season of work. We don't know how long Roseanne would have stayed on the air, but we do know ABC ordered 13 more episodes for a second rebooted season before the Twitter incident, per Time. That means Barr likely cost herself at least $3.25 million, based on her current rate. (The details of Barr's contract with ABC are not public.)\n\nBarr was also dropped by her talent agency, which will make booking future gigs more difficult.\n\nBarr's net worth is estimated to be $80 million. She'll be fine for the time being. Hell, she might join forces with other maligned comedians and go on a sad sack tour of America to recoup the costs. She might hold out hope for another network to swoop in and save the show, Brooklyn Nine-Nine style\u2014even though her coworkers have sworn off working with her\u2014or offer her a lucrative guest role. Anything is possible in a world where Last Man Standing is back from the dead and Charlie Sheen is calling for a Two and a Half Men reboot.\n\nFor now, it appears Barr has decided to tweet through the pain. Isn't it great to learn from mistakes?\n\nUpdated: Roseanne Barr responded to anger over her racist tweet by thanking racists and conspiracy theorists for defending her, suggesting Michelle Obama had directed ABC to fire her, and writing, \"i feel bad for @POTUS-he goes thru this every single day\" https://t.co/ckYSZ9TKuH \u2014 Robert Mackey (@RobertMackey) May 30, 2018", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/768x384/landscape-1520286613-roseanne-behind-the-scenes-drama.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/new-new-index-gettyimages-937219244-1527687569.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/roseanne-1522847154.jpg?crop=1xw:0.9950248756218906xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Rense", "Sarah Rense Is The Associate Lifestyle Editor At Esquire", "Where She Covers Tech", "Food", "Drink", "Home"], "canonical_link": "https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/money/a20961831/roseanne-barr-salary-contract-money-lost/", "title": "Roseanne Barr Just Lost Herself So Much Money", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Esquire", "title": "Roseanne Barr Just Lost Herself So Much Money", "description": "Along with her pride and respect.", "url": "https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/money/a20961831/roseanne-barr-salary-contract-money-lost/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 171874009543995, "pages": 84169421673}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Esquire", "modified_time": "2018-05-30 04:30:28", "published_time": "2018-05-30 02:06:00", "section": "Money & Career", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Esquire", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "1vf5i9wM7chlCFc_0XI_e-oCfDf4sEvp32sTGKoaukQ", "title": "Roseanne Barr Salary Loss After 'Roseanne' Cancellation - Roseanne Barr Net Worth", "description": "With the cancellation of Roseanne, Barr is taking a multi-million-dollar hit.", "keywords": "roseanne, cancellation, salary, money, twitter, net worth, roseanne barr, contract", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.144xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Lifestyle,lifestyle,money", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-30T14:06:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/barr-1527686985.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.144xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Roseanne Barr Just Lost Herself So Much Money", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527617160.0, "source": "https://www.esquire.com", "summary": ""}
