(She is already a mom to daughter Marley Rae, 3\u00bd, with ex Kevin McCall.)\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Marley, would you like to have a little brother or sister?\u2019 And she said, \u2018Yes, Mom, but you know what? Maybe a baby brother. Make it a brother,\u2019 \u201d she recalled of her sweet conversation with her little girl.\n\n\u201cI thought that was adorable, but at the time, I had no idea what I was having, so my fear [about] this extremely expressive and outgoing young girl [was] if this baby came out to be a little girl, that might not be a great situation for Marley,\u201d added Marcille with a laugh.\u201cHowever, I found out soon after that I was having a boy, and I felt like she willed it in her favor. I\u2019m beyond elated to be having a boy.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=715&h=374&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Feva-marcille.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=715&h=374&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Feva-marcille.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Corriston"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/eva-marcille-is-engaged/", "title": "Eva Marcille Is Engaged to Michael Sterling", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Engagements,Eva Marcille,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Couples,Engagements,Eva Marcille,News,TV", "description": "Eva Marcille is expecting a baby boy with\u00a0fianc\u00e9\u00a0Michael Sterling", "og": {"title": "ANTM and RHOA's Eva Marcille Is Engaged: 'I Said Yes!!!!'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/eva-marcille-is-engaged/", "description": "Santa (okay, her boyfriend) brought TV personality Eva Marcille an extra special gift this year: a proposal!
