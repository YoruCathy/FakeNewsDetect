You will get your bodies back,\" Garner promised. \"You will get your lives back. You can still travel. You can still have fun. You can still go back to work, or not. You can breastfeed or not. You will be best friends with your kid, and then someday you\u2019re going to realize you\u2019re actually angry with them, and that\u2019s OK. And you\u2019re going to be great, because it\u2019s your experience, and it\u2019s your baby and it\u2019s your body and it\u2019s your body and it\u2019s going to happen the way you want it to when you\u2019re starting your families. It\u2019s going to be beautiful.\"\n\nMom Advice Music Video\n\nGarner loves being a mom so much she wrote a song and made a cheesy music video full of advice for \"all the pregnant ladies at 'The Ellen Show.'\"\n\n\"Imagine squeezing something about the size of a watermelon/ how much pain is that? There'll be a lot of swellin,'\" Garner rapped. \"And breastfeeding? It ain't simple/ one false move, you've got a cracked nipple.\"\n\nThe mom rap is, perhaps, even more charming than that time Garner dressed up in full marching-band gear to play Reese Witherspoon \"Happy Birthday\" on the saxophone.\n\nFarm Animal Noises\n\n\"You know how you're always telling me you do really great impressions of farm animals?\" Ellen asked her co-host, who responded with a firm, \"No.\"\n\n\"Yeah, just go with this,\" Ellen instructed Garner before asking for a pig, horse and goat impression.\n\n\"You're such a jerk,\" Garner said while laughing.\n\nIt was a goofy set up to introduce Once Upon a Farm, a company Garner co-founded to make fresh, organic baby food that can be found in the refrigerated section of grocery stores across the country.\n\nMother's Day Scare\n\nWhat \"Ellen\" episode would be complete without a guest nearly having a heart attack on the air? Despite the wholesome theme, the comedian squeezed in a scare while Garner was busy describing all of the free gifts the audience was getting.\n\nFast forward to the 2:40 mark in the video above to see how Ellen delivered the jolt this time.\n\nView Photos", "images": ["https://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/elite-daily-logo-1.png", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/skeleton.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/05/10/jennifer-garner-ellen-scare-ellentube-1200x630.jpg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rsss-justjared-logo-cut-v2.gif", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/cdl-260x30-for-tmz3-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/19/newsletter-logo-v2-1.png", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png"], "top_img": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/05/10/jennifer-garner-ellen-scare-ellentube-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toofab Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://toofab.com/2018/05/10/jennifer-garner-scared-raps-motherhood-co-hosting-ellen/", "title": "Jennifer Garner Gets Scared, Raps About Motherhood and Does Farm Animal Impressions While Co-Hosting 'Ellen'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"toofab": 116547240, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@toofab", "title": "Jennifer Garner Gets Scared, Raps About Motherhood and Does Farm Animal Impressions While Co-Hosting 'Ellen'", "description": "Jennifer Garner helped Ellen DeGeneres entertain an audience of pregnant women Thursday for the daytime talk show's Mother's Day episode.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/05/10/jennifer-garner-ellen-scare-ellentube-1200x630.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "description": "Jennifer Garner helped Ellen DeGeneres entertain an audience of pregnant women Thursday for the daytime talk show's Mother's Day episode.", "robots": "index,follow", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://toofab.com/2018/05/10/jennifer-garner-scared-raps-motherhood-co-hosting-ellen/", "site_name": "toofab", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Garner Gets Scared, Raps About Motherhood and Does Farm Animal Impressions While Co-Hosting 'Ellen'", "description": "Jennifer Garner helped Ellen DeGeneres entertain an audience of pregnant women Thursday for the daytime talk show's Mother's Day episode.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/05/10/jennifer-garner-ellen-scare-ellentube-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116046798441464, "pages": 324392354652}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TooFab"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fyhIDqPTS60", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c8MNU8_wfxk", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kNgZcY02y2I", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fw7P5kLm-lk"], "publish_date": 1525881600.0, "source": "http://toofab.com", "summary": ""}
