But St. Angie\u2019s halo has well and truly slipped.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much charity work you do,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the Jolie-Pitt family. \u201cIf you drive a wedge between a father and his children, you\u2019re an a\u2013hole.\u201d\n\nOver the past few weeks, Jolie, 43, and her lawyers have claimed that Pitt, 54, has failed to pay any \u201csignificant\u201d support for their six children. (Pitt\u2019s camp insists that the actor has paid out $9.3 million since the couple\u2019s 2016 split.) Jolie has, as a Hollywood source close to the Jolie-Pitts told The Post, tried to paint her ex as a \u201cdeadbeat dad\u201d and created a rift between the actor and his kids.\n\nIn court documents, Pitt\u2019s lawyers called out Jolie and her lawyers for filing papers that are \u201ccalculated to increase the conflict\u201d and are a \u201cthinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.\u201d\n\nJust this month, she was playing mind games. Around August 1, Pitt asked Jolie, through lawyers, to end the marriage as soon as possible, even before the high-profile couple has worked out a custody schedule and financial agreement.\n\nThrough her team, Jolie asked her ex to wait a week to consider his request \u2014 then filed her own motion, requesting the exact same thing.\n\n\u201cAngelina filed with the judge to make it look like she wanted the early \u00addivorce before Brad [did],\u201d said Los Angeles divorce attorney Peter Walzer, who has cases up against one of Jolie\u2019s lawyers, Laura Wasser.\n\nSome say it\u2019s an act of revenge by Jolie, who was, of course, the first to make the public strike in the split.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want Brad to move on,\u201d said the family source.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s furious that he\u2019s not chasing after her \u2014 and [that fury is] now ruining her image.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s latest round of fire also comes this month when she hired two new attorneys \u2014 Hollywood bigwig Joseph Mannis, who has represented celebrities Halle Berry and Dennis Hopper in contentious family cases \u2014 and San Francisco-based Samantha Bley DeJean.\n\nThey join Wasser, who, according to the family source, advised the star not to go nuclear on Pitt.\n\n\u201cI think Angelina thought, \u2018I don\u2019t like where this is going, let\u2019s get tough,\u2019 \u201d Walzer said of the actress\u2019 decision to bring in more hired guns. \u201cSeveral things have happened that have caused [her] to say \u2018I better . . . hire some lawyers in who are going to be aggressive.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Hollywood source said Jolie was also provoked to wage war by two of her friends: Lady Arminka Helic, a Bosnian foreign-policy expert and a member of the UK House of Lords; and Chloe Dalton, who worked as former UK Foreign Secretary William Hague\u2019s speechwriter.\n\nThe trio all met through Hague, who a close confidant of Jolie\u2019s, and with whom she set up a sexual-violence-prevention initiative for women in Bangladesh.\n\n\u201cThey played a big role in all of this, telling Angelina, \u2018You\u2019re the greatest\u2019 \u201d the Hollywood source said of the friends.\n\nPart of Jolie\u2019s strategy to protect her own persona, insiders say, has been to publicly shame Pitt since they announced their divorce in September 2016.\n\n\u201cShe filed for divorce out of the blue, then people connected to her floated information to the media that [Pitt] had punched one of their kids on a flight in a drunken, high rage,\u201d said the family source. According to TMZ, Jolie told a social worker that Pitt had struck their son Maddox, then 15, on a private jet.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services investigated and cleared Pitt of the child-abuse allegations. In November 2016, Pitt was also cleared by the FBI of any wrong\u00addoing.\n\nThe family source added, \u201cAngelina kicked the s\u2013t out of Brad at the beginning. Then she tried to make other threats and said he was going to be \u00adarrested. She really started a whispering campaign against Brad that was \u00addemonstrably false.\u201d\n\nJolie was further left fuming, according to the Hollywood source, when her ex was given a standing ovation by the audience at the January 2017 Golden Globes after months out of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cAngelina went crazy. That\u2019s why she insisted on releasing a joint statement two days later,\u201d added the Hollywood source. \u201cShe was trying to attach herself to him, so people wouldn\u2019t view her \u00adunfavorably.\u201d\n\nIn the joint statement, released on January 10, 2017, Jolie and Pitt said they were hiring a private judge and would handle their divorce in a private forum, while working to reunify their family.\n\nBut then, the family source said, \u201cAngelina believed the only way to win was to go in for the kill.\u201d Jolie\u2019s team publicly leaked court documents, alongside a statement about a lack of child support, to NBC News earlier this month.\n\n\u201cShe went on the attack,\u201d the family source said. \u201cEssentially, Angelina\u2019s calling Brad a deadbeat dad, when he pays for the kids\u2019 security, hotels and private jets. All he wants is to see his kids.\u201d\n\nInsiders also told The Post that Jolie has made that difficult.\n\n\u201cIn the past two years, Angelina has driven a wedge between [Pitt] and the kids, from controlling [their] phone calls to telling the kids they don\u2019t need to see him and picking times he can see them when she knows he\u2019s working,\u201d said a source with intimate knowledge of the divorce.\n\nIn June, Judge John Ouderkirk (who also presided over the couple\u2019s August 2015 civil wedding ceremony) told Jolie that if the children \u201cremain closed down to their father,\u201d she faced losing custody of them.\n\nThe actress was ordered to give Pitt the numbers for all the kids\u2019 phones, as well as to refrain from monitoring any conversations between him and the children.\n\nCurrently, Pitt gets visitation with Maddox, 17, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12 and twins Vivienne and Knox, 10, for four hours every other day and 12 hours over the weekend. There is one exception: The court is allowing Maddox to decide how much time he spends with his father.\n\nOn Wednesday, news leaked that Jolie and Pitt had come to terms on an interim custody agreement. However, a source close to Pitt said that the couple have the same interim agreement that has been in place for a while, with a more permanent custody deal still to be decided.\n\n\u201cThere was no new agreement. This was totally made up,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe biggest joke is that she continues to be awful toward him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngie has these wild mood swings,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe [had] launched this aggressive tone, which backfired, saying she\u2019s poor when she\u2019s making $25 million a movie, and saying Brad\u2019s not paid child support. This week, she came back all mellow and super nice \u2014 it\u2019s a direct reaction to the fact that people did not react well to her [previous] blow.\u201d\n\n(Jolie\u2019s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAs for financial support, Pitt\u2019s lawyers have reiterated that he loaned Jolie $8 million so she could buy a $19 million home \u2014 the estate of legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille \u2014 and has paid out more than $1.3 million in child \u00adsupport.\n\nFor Pitt, said the Hollywood source, \u201cIt\u2019s really the alienation from his kids that\u2019s the worst.\u201d\n\nWalzer said Jolie needs to be careful about her behavior ahead of a custody hearing, which will be followed by family visits with a court-appointed psychologist.\n\n\u201cWhen somebody is in the throes of this kind of custody proceeding, they\u2019re not always rational,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf you look uncooperative, it could be worse for you. If you look like you\u2019re the alienating parent, then you\u2019re putting yourself at risk \u2014 do you really want to do that?\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Jolie\u2019s public reputation.\n\nThis is certainly not the first time Jolie has puppeteered her image and the lives of those around her.\n\nShe became truly famous, after years of under-the-radar movie roles, when she stole the show in the 1999 movie \u201cGirl, Interrupted.\u201d At that point, Jolie was Hollywood\u2019s ultimate bad girl. She dressed in witchy black, was using drugs (as she would admit to years later) \u2014 including \u00adgoing to Disneyland while on acid \u2014 and shocked the world when she shared an uncomfortably intimate kiss with her brother James at the 2000 Oscars, where she won Best Supporting Actress.\n\nThat year, she married Billy Bob Thornton \u2014 who allegedly dumped fianc\u00e9e Laura Dern to be with her \u2014 and took her reputation into overdrive when the two hit the red carpet wearing vials of each other\u2019s blood.\n\nBut by 2003, the couple had split and she was ready to reinvent. She became a mom on her own to a son, Maddox, adopted from Cambodia. Hooking up with Pitt in 2004 on the set of \u201cMr. and Mrs. Smith,\u201d she was seen as the vixen who stole the man of America\u2019s sweetheart, Jennifer Aniston.\n\nThere was nowhere to go but up. So the transformation to St. Angie kicked into high gear as she adopted more children and pursued an interest in human rights.\n\n\u201cAngelina did one of the greatest jobs ever in developing a new persona ,\u201d said the Hollywood source.\n\nOne step at a time, Jolie showed her softer side. The couple was seen taking their multiracial brood of six around the world. Jolie became a special envoy to the United Nations. And she publicly, and poignantly, spoke of her mother\u2019s death from ovarian cancer and her own decision to have a double mastectomy and surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes after discovering she tested positive for the BRCA1 gene.\n\n\u201cAngie was controlling her own narrative,\u201d said the Hollywood source. \u201cShe was a role model \u2014 there was a relatability about her and her health issues. She did a great job to combine all of these things.\u201d\n\nBut, it seems, Jolie may have finally lost control.\n\n\u201cUltimately, she almost got too comfortable [acting as a role model],\u201d added the Hollywood source. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t able to adapt to some of the realities of her marriage and her life.\n\n\u201cShe just assumed that people would follow whatever she said, including her husband, and so when they had marital issues, she . . . believed she could just bully him into whatever she wanted.\u201d\n\nAfter her marriage to Pitt came apart, \u00adJolie employed a master stroke of public relations \u2014 breaking her silence on the split while in Cambodia promoting a movie she had directed, \u201cFirst They Killed My \u00adFather.\u201d\n\nLooking upset, she told the BBC in February this year it had been a \u201cvery difficult time . . . We are a family and we will always be a family, and we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Jolie insider said, the actress was beset by old demons. \u201cYou can try to change as much as you want, but you\u2019re always going to go back to who you truly are. She can\u2019t help herself.\u201d\n\nAccording to Page Six, Jolie is also fuming that she has been usurped as the world\u2019s most glamorous humanitarian by Amal Clooney, the stylish human-rights lawyer who is married to George Clooney.\n\n\u201cAngelina hates all the attention that Amal is getting,\u201d said a Jolie insider. The brunette reportedly feels Amal has pulled a \u201csingle white female\u201d and stolen her identity. The insider added: \u201cAngie can\u2019t understand why she herself has become so \u00adunpopular in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Pitt has given only one interview since the split, to GQ in May 2017, in which he detailed how he had given up the alcohol and marijuana that he had used as \u201ca crutch.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of his fears for his children and said: \u201cIt is a drag to have certain things drug out in public and misconstrued. I worry about it more for my kids, being subjected to it and their friends getting ideas from it.\u201d\n\nThis, said the Hollywood source, is why he just wants to finalize things as quietly and peacefully as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s not having the best time, but he\u2019s hanging in there. He\u2019s hopeful this will all be resolved.\u201d\n\nBut Hollywood\u2019s former golden couple is now reduced to barely speaking to each other, added the Hollywood source. \u201cThey talk some, but [not] very much. Once you go down this road, and s\u2013t gets flung about, then it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/angelina-jolie-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/angelina-jolie-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/angelina-jolie-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/08/25/angelina-jolie-is-no-longer-the-saint-she-set-out-to-be/", "title": "Angelina Jolie is no longer the saint she set out to be", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
