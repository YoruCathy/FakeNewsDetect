(\u201cIt like had to be something that wasn\u2019t, like, far-out celebrity baby name, but it also couldn\u2019t be a generic name,\u201d Konner says about the name Grover. \u201cShe knew he had to be the only one in the class with that name.\u201d)\n\nThe last episode of Girls flashes forward five months to Hannah and Marnie co-parenting Grover together. Hannah is struggling to bond with her son, can\u2019t get him to breastfeed, and is breaking down over the anxiety of it all. Marnie, in her Type A way, picks up all the slack, which overwhelms her to the point that she calls Hannah\u2019s mom, Becky Ann Baker\u2019s Loreen, to come give Hannah a wake-up call.\n\nAmid Hannah ignoring Grover\u2019s crying, napping all day, and wandering the streets with no shoes or pants on\u2014of course\u2014Loreen tells her, \u201cYou made the choice to have this child, and guess what? It\u2019s the first one you can\u2019t take back.\u201d\n\nAs for the all-important final shot, of which there was much speculation about going in to Sunday night, particularly in terms of what music would play, it\u2019s of Hannah\u2019s reaction after Grover finally latches onto her breast, after which she starts singing Tracy Chapman to herself. \u201cJenni was like, \u2018I wonder if anyone\u2019s guess is \u2018Fast Car\u2019 lightly mumbled,\u2019\u201d Dunham laughs.\n\nSo with the finale finally having aired, here\u2019s our conversation with Dunham and Konner about the choices made, why last week\u2019s penultimate episode purposefully felt like more of a series finale, whether they ever considered Hannah having an abortion, and how think piece culture affected the end of the show.\n\nYou named the baby Grover.\n\nJenni and Lena, in unison: We diiiiid!\n\nI imagine there\u2019s a certain amount of pressure in naming Hannah\u2019s baby. Why Grover?\n\nJenni: Lena literally showed up one day and walked into the writer\u2019s room and was like, \u201cHis name is Grover.\u201d And we were all like, \u201cYeah that sounds about right.\u201d\n\nLena: We did not have a baby name list. We were just like, \u201cThat seems like what she would name her baby.\u201d\n\nJenni: It like had to be something that wasn\u2019t, like, far-out celebrity baby name, but it also couldn\u2019t be a generic name. She knew he had to be the only one in the class with that name.\n\nI would venture he\u2019ll be the only Grover Horvath.\n\nLena: It couldn\u2019t be trendy but it also couldn\u2019t freak you out.\n\nJenni: The truth is that when we shot Riz [Ahmed], we went back to that. That was a little improv on the day where it was, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s his idea?\u201d\n\nLena: Jenni walked into that little funny set we had for his hotel room, and was like, \u201cLet\u2019s try a version where he says Grover would be a great name for the baby.\u201d It\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t think we even told Riz that was the baby\u2019s eventual name. Jenni just fed him that line and he did it. I only told him recently that the baby\u2019s name was Grover and he was like, \u201cShe took my suggestion!?\u201d\n\n[Jenni cracks up]\n\nJenni: The great part, too, is that Lena just realized\u2014this wasn\u2019t in our minds when we did it\u2014that she bets he got it from Sesame Street.\n\nLena: There\u2019s no way that guy knows the name Grover from anything else. He\u2019s definitely not talking about Grover Cleveland.\n\nA lot of people thought last week\u2019s episode could have worked as a series finale in its own right. What was behind the decision to focus the last half-hour on Hannah and the baby?\n\nJenni: We had a lot of story we wanted to tell. Judd was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you make a finale that\u2019s a finale, like a satisfying \u2018here\u2019s where everybody ends up,\u2019\u201d but we didn\u2019t want to skip the part where Hannah becomes a mother. Like, how unfair to spend this whole season wondering what kind of mother Hannah would be and then never show it?\n\nLena: Also, our show\u2019s never been about the traditional, tidy wrap-up. We wanted to be able to enjoy that beautiful musical montage moment [from last week\u2019s episode] that\u2019s given us chills and so many other people chills. But we\u2019re also ending the way we\u2019ve always ended everything, which is just like without a massive and clean conclusion.\n\nIt does feel appropriate.\n\nLena: We really felt like we got the best of both worlds and it was really fun because Nisha Ganatra, a director we love but had never worked with came and did episode nine and lent a very different feeling to it, and had the vision for the Hannah moving vs. party intercutting. And then Jenni got to come in and do an off-kilter but totally committed version of the energy that our show traditionally has.\n\nSome TV creators have an ending in mind as early as when they pitch a show. At what point did you realize that this is how you wanted the series to end, with Hannah having her baby and confronting motherhood?\n\nJenni: I have to say Lena\u2019s been talking about it for a long time.\n\nLena: I said something about it pretty early, I think sometime between seasons one and two. I mean Jenni and I started talking about endings the night we premiered at SXSW. We were at a hotel in Austin, hotel rooms upstairs and downstairs from each other but obviously talking on our cell phones. We basically talked until we fell asleep about what would become of every character, what the rest of her life would look like, how she would die, and I feel like somewhere in that conversation we said something like, \u201cWho would be the first person to have a baby?\u201d And we were like, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s Hannah.\u201d It always felt oddly natural to us, and it\u2019s really been an interesting litmus test. We\u2019ve gotten some beautiful emails from women who have chosen or not chosen, who have been forced into single motherhood for various reasons.\n\nJenni: Really moving.\n\nLena: And I\u2019ve gotten some really moving emails from women who got pregnant and not chosen to have it. Last week I got a donation in my name to Planned Parenthood with a letter from a woman who said she chose to have an abortion, but that watching Hannah\u2019s journey had made her feel more confident in her own decision. And, like, that\u2019s the kind of thing that you can\u2019t believe how lucky you are when you can spur anyone to think or feel that way. Then there\u2019s definitely been the people who have been like, \u201cThis women could never have a baby, she\u2019s going to drop it on its head, what the hell are you doing?\u201d Probably one of my favorite lines of Jenni\u2019s of all time is when I said there are a lot of people who would be worse mothers than Hannah, and Jenni said, \u201cYeah, like anyone on any Showtime show.\u201d It was a great Showtime inside baseball joke.\n\nI think there were people who were surprised when the pregnancy storyline was introduced that it wasn\u2019t used to make a statement about abortion. Was that a route you ever considered?\n\nJenni: I mean we\u2019ve tackled abortion, you know? It would have been such a weird move, in my opinion, to, this late in our series, write that she gets pregnant and has an abortion. She\u2019s right on that line of it could happen or it couldn\u2019t happen, and the fact that Joshua [Patrick Wilson\u2019s character] assumes it\u2019s going to happen is very offensive to her. I think what\u2019s interesting about the growth of these characters is that the second episode of the show is Jessa\u2019s pregnant and there\u2019s not a conversation for a second whether she would keep it or not.\n\nLena: Not at all.\n\nJenni: It\u2019s not in the realm of possibility.\n\nLena: Mimi Rose had an abortion and we didn\u2019t even know she was pregnant.\n\nJenni: Now we get to a place where it\u2019s a few years later and it becomes a conversation, and that seemed like a really interesting idea of growth to us.\n\nLena: Completely. Plus I was like, you can not like our storyline but you certainly can\u2019t come for my and Jenni\u2019s pro-choice bona fides.\n\nThe line that lingered with me most from the finale was when Hannah\u2019s mom says, \u201cYou made the choice to have this child, and guess what? It\u2019s the first one you can\u2019t take back.\u201d\n\nJenni: I think that line is what the entire finale is about. Here\u2019s this girl who\u2019s been accused by everyone in the world\u2014in her world, in the world of viewers, everyone\u2014of being narcissistic so constantly. She\u2019s a girl who quits a job she doesn\u2019t like and leaves a relationship she doesn\u2019t like. This is the first thing she can\u2019t take back. We\u2019re saying to you: this is it. This is Hannah with high stakes. Now we\u2019re showing you high stakes.\n\nLena: I remember right before I made Tiny Furniture I very spontaneously quit a job as a hostess.\n\nJenni: Which we see in the movie!\n\nLena: Yep! My dad yells at me, like, \u201cThis is so irresponsible. If you had a baby or anyone depending on you, you wouldn\u2019t be allowed to just go around quitting jobs!\u201d And I remember looking and going, \u201cYeah! But I don\u2019t!\u201d It was this moment where I was like, I don\u2019t, and I\u2019m going to keep quitting things as long as I can. I\u2019m gonna take all the naps I want and quit all the things I want. And this is the moment when Hannah can\u2019t take all the naps she wants and quit all the things she wants. She truly can\u2019t anymore.\n\nThere was a lot of curiosity about what song would play over the credits of the final episode, to the point that articles were written speculating about it.\n\nJenni: I know! We\u2019ve been seeing all these articles. I was like, I hope no one turns it off too fast because you can hardly hear the song.\n\nLena: Jenni was like, \u201cI wonder if anyone\u2019s guess is \u2018Fast Car\u2019 lightly mumbled.\u201d\n\nHow did you land on \u201c\u2018Fast Car\u2019 lightly mumbled?\u201d\n\nJenni: This is a Judd thing. We decided not to use really almost any music through the episode, so that\u2019s scary and unusual for us. I knew I wanted to hear Allison singing \u201cFast Car.\u201d That was just a fantasy of mine, so we did it there. We were trying to figure out how to do the end and Judd said, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s just Hannah kind of mumble-humming \u2018Fast Car\u2019 in this weird way?\u201d We called her up. She recorded it on her phone, sent it to us, and it was absolute perfection. We didn\u2019t even change it for the final mix.\n\nDo you think the microscope the show has been under throughout its run and the culture of think pieces surrounding it influenced how you wrapped the show up at all?\n\nJenni: I mean it had to have seeped in, because we\u2019re not made of wood. But I do think that this is an idea that we had so early on that we weren\u2019t in think piece territory quite yet, and the internet bombardment either. I\u2019ve always said I\u2019d rather have people loving or hating than yawning. We\u2019re really lucky that we go that, and especially this season that people cared so much, like with the Matthew Rhys episode, writing so much about it. And caring so much about last week\u2019s penultimate episode. As much as we were not trying to cater to people, it feels really heavenly to have people understand what we\u2019re trying to do and really appreciating it. It\u2019s been a nice thing to go out with so much positivity.\n\nLena: The thing I was going to say about the think piece aspect is that I think we did a really successful job of in some ways cocooning ourselves. We made really intentional choices to seclude ourselves and we always had our work to return to in this really beautiful, private way. That really sustained me and made it feel possible to make choices outside of what the internet might be demanding. By the way, the internet is such a terrible psycho beast, where they want to tell you what to do but if you actually did what they told you to do, the bullies would then call you a weakling because you did what they told you to do.\n\nWe\u2019re talking on Friday evening. How are you spending the airing of the finale Sunday night?\n\nJenni: We\u2019re in separate cities. Lena and Allison and her parents are going to watch it. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. Maybe I\u2019ll watch it with Judd.\n\nLena: Not being with Jenni is super weird, and I would be on her sofa in two seconds. But we have to be in different cities right now. Being with Allison will be really special and emotional. She\u2019s basically crying already and has already asked what I want to eat, two extremely Allison qualities. I think there will be a lot of texting Jenni pictures of whatever my face is doing.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2561,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494008926/articles/2017/04/16/girls-series-finale-lena-dunham-and-jenni-konner-explain-that-surprise-ending/170414-fallon-girls-tease_bgey5e", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2561,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494008926/articles/2017/04/16/girls-series-finale-lena-dunham-and-jenni-konner-explain-that-surprise-ending/170414-fallon-girls-tease_bgey5e", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779074/author/Kevin-Fallon.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2561,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494008926/articles/2017/04/16/girls-series-finale-lena-dunham-and-jenni-konner-explain-that-surprise-ending/170414-fallon-girls-tease_bgey5e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/girls-series-finale-lena-dunham-and-jenni-konner-explain-that-surprise-ending", "title": "\u2018Girls\u2019 Series Finale: Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner Explain That Surprise Ending", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "\u2018Girls\u2019 Series Finale: Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner Explain That Surprise Ending", "keywords": "Television", "og": {"title": "\u2018Girls\u2019 Series Finale: Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner Explain That Surprise Ending", "description": "Lena Dunham and co-showrunner Jenni Konner discuss the untraditional \u2018Girls\u2019 finale, the episode\u2019s unexpected last scene, and the show\u2019s legacy.
