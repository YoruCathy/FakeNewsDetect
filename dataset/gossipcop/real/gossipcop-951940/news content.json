Taylor Swift bore witness to a real-life \u201cLove Story\u201d on Friday, July 13, as two attendees of her concert in Philadelphia got engaged during a meet-and-greet with the 28-year-old singer.\n\nThe couple, identified by USA Today as Anthony Yannuzzi and Stephanie Pysher, say they met at a Taylor Swift concert five years ago, when the singer was touring in support of her album Red. Now Swift is on her Reputation stadium tour, and Yannuzzi has been covertly plotting his proposal since June with the Twitter handle @TSphilaPROPOSAL. \u201cI NEED YOUR HELP!\u201d he tweeted on June 3. \u201cI want to give my girlfriend the proposal of her dreams! Help me spread the word so Taylor can see this.\u201d\n\nFortuitously, Yannuzzi and Pysher were randomly selected to take a photo with Swift during a meet-and-greet backstage. Yannuzzi got down on bended knee, Pysher said yes, and Swift watched the proposal with mouth agape. The singer later shared a photo of the happy occasion on Instagram, captioning the pic with the hashtag \u201c#thirdwheel.\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s concert in Philadelphia the following night made headlines, too, since a stage malfunction trapped her in a \u201csparkly basket\u201d in midair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m stuck up here,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice view, though.\u201d\n\nAfter she finished performing her song \u201cDelicate,\u201d Swift kept the crowd entertained as stagehands tried to fix the glitch. \u201cSo what you just saw was me going, like, straight up and down in this sparkly basket,\u201d she said, according to Billboard. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to take me to the other side of the stadium. So what happens now is basically I\u2019m just chilling waiting to figure out what happens next.\u201d\n\nSwift then joined the audience in an a cappella version of her 2007 track \u201cOur Song\u201d before getting into another floating basket and resuming the show.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swift-proposal-fans.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swift-proposal-fans.jpg?crop=0px%2C4px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swift-proposal-fans.jpg?crop=0px%2C4px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-shocked-fan-proposal-reputation-tour/", "title": "Taylor Swift Is Shocked as Couple Gets Engaged in Front of Her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Two fans got engaged in front of Taylor Swift during a meet-and-greet with the pop star in Philadelphia on Friday, July 13 \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift Shocked as Fans Get Engaged in Front of Her", "description": "Two fans got engaged in front of Taylor Swift during a meet-and-greet with the pop star in Philadelphia on Friday, July 13 \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-shocked-fan-proposal-reputation-tour/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-16T19:09:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swift-proposal-fans.jpg?crop=0px%2C4px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swift-proposal-fans.jpg?crop=0px%2C4px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "omg", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-16T16:07:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-16T19:09:50+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Two fans got engaged in front of Taylor Swift during a meet-and-greet with the pop star in Philadelphia on Friday, July 13 \u2014 details", "title": "Taylor Swift Shocked as Fans Get Engaged in Front of Her", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/taylor-swift-proposal-fans.jpg?crop=0px%2C4px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531757262.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
