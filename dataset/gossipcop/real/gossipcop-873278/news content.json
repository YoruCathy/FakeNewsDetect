Littlefinger, meanwhile, did not. He was standing calmly in Winterfell\u2019s great hall, believing he was about to watch the execution of Arya Stark \u2013 something he\u2019d been wheedling Sansa into for several episodes \u2013 when Sansa suddenly turned the tables on him and revealed that she\u2019d been playing him all along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans are, of course, happy about the demise of the dastardly Lord Baelish \u2013 but they\u2019re also confused about how the narrative of the Winterfell subplot stitches together across the episodes of season 7. In a much-upvoted post, Redditor DarkSun09 wrote: \u201cI guess the Stark girls were just acting like they had turned against one another in order to fool Littlefinger. What I don\u2019t understand is why. Why did they have to fool Littlefinger in the first place? What purpose did that serve? They had Bran and, presumably, all the evidence they needed against Littlefinger already, so why not just drag him out, expose his crimes, and execute him? Why did they have to do all that acting in front of him?\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d they continue, \u201call they did was accuse him of a bunch of stuff, which he simply denies. Then they just killed him anyway without actually producing any evidence to prove him wrong. I don\u2019t get the point of any of this. Someone please explain.\u201d\n\nAnother Redditor replied that the showrunners \u201csay they were solely focused on making the viewer believe the Starks would turn on each other before twisting it at the end. It doesn\u2019t seem like they were concerned with in-character explanations, they were just concerned with selling the viewer on the fake-out. That\u2019s why the plot seems weird and difficult to parse, because there isn\u2019t really an in-universe explanation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of opposition to this storyline \u2013 but there is some sense in it. Let\u2019s go through the scenes one by one to try and sort it out:\n\nArya returns home (Episode 4)\n\nWhat it tells us: The \u2018hard feelings\u2019 Arya and Sansa display towards one another in episodes 5 and 6 can only be a ruse.\n\nWhen Arya returns to Winterfell in episode 4 \u2013 before she even realises that Littlefinger is there too \u2013 she heads down to the crypts to find the tomb of her father, Ned. Sansa comes to find her there, and they\u2019re completely alone. Arya tells Sansa that being lady of Winterfell \u201csuits you\u201d. When Arya asks if Sansa killed Joffrey says she \u201cwishes\u201d she had, proving to Arya straight away that she hated her former fianc\u00e9. There is a lot of affection in this interaction, and no mistrust: unlike the staged argument they have a couple of episodes later, there\u2019s no beef here about how Sansa \u201cdid nothing\u201d when Ned was executed, and in this scene they\u2019re literally standing in front of a statue of their dead father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prMqY9W08II\n\nArya berates Sansa (Episode 5)\n\nWhat it tells us: Arya is faking it \u2013 she told Sansa in episode 4 that being Lady of Winterfell \u201csuits\u201d her.\n\nArya comes to Sansa\u2019s room and loudly tells Sansa off for moving herself into their parents\u2019 room, for having \u2018nice things\u2019 and for aspiring to hold the power that Jon has. In hindsight, we can view this as the point where Arya and Sansa begin acting out a disagreement to see what Littlefinger does \u2013 because they know he\u2019s spying on them. By faking it, they\u2019re able to make him play his hand and cause him to incriminate himself irreversibly.\n\nArya steals from Littlefinger (Episode 5)\n\nWhat it tells us: Arya lets Littlefinger see her steal the note because she wants him to think she is planning to take down Sansa.\n\nIt\u2019s only after Arya and Sansa\u2019s first staged argument that Littlefinger asks Winterfell\u2019s Maester to find the incriminating message Sansa sent to Robb, where she asked him to bend the knee to her evil fianc\u00e9 Joffrey Baratheon, after her father was accused of treason and awaiting execution by the Lannisters. By taking the \u2018bait\u2019 of this message, Arya is tricking Littlefinger into thinking she wants leverage with which to take down Sansa.\n\nArya and Sansa argue again (Episode 6)\n\nWhat it tells us: The staged fight continues.\n\nOut on the balcony of Winterfell\u2019s courtyard, Arya and Sansa have another, even more public staged argument, where Arya reads out the note Littlefinger wanted Arya to find. It says:\n\n\u201cRobb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt. Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert\u2019s brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King\u2019s Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa.\u201d\n\nArya then says: I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxwaMM2RiHc\n\nSansa then pretends to get uppity, boasting about her contribution in the Battle of Bastards: \u201cYou didn\u2019t win [Winterfell] back, Jon didn\u2019t win it back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knights of the Vale have won the battle and they rode north for me.\u201d Arya then takes the argument a step further by threatening to show the message to the Northern Lords.\n\nLittlefinger tries to pit Sansa against Arya with Brienne (Episode 6)\n\nWhat it tells us: Littlefinger is beginning to show his hand: he wants Arya dead, because she poses a danger to his \u2018control\u2019 over Sansa.\n\nAt this news, Littlefinger makes his first real error: he suggests Sansa use Brienne as a bodyguard in case Arya tries anything. It becomes clear he wants Arya dead, because she is only a threat to him. Either Arya will kill him, or she will kill Sansa \u2013 thereby removing what he sees as his \u2018control\u2019 over the north.\n\nIn order to destabilise Littlefinger further, Sansa ignores his advice, sending Brienne away to King\u2019s Landing. Littlefinger is later forced to suggest more explicitly that Sansa get rid of Arya, which proves to Sansa that he\u2019s no use to her any more.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFZgyJZObOI&t=6s\n\nArya proves her loyalty by giving Sansa her dagger (Episode 6)\n\nWhat it tells us: The sisters are plotting together \u2013 what they\u2019re saying aloud doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nWhen Sansa enters Arya\u2019s room at the end of this episode and discovers her bag full of faces, Arya makes a speech that appears to threaten her, before handing her the dagger. Redditor summyg writes \u201cWe have no indication of what her handing the dagger meant other than \u2018maybe it meant something.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt seems that what the showrunners were really trying to show us here is that Arya and Sansa have been in cahoots the whole time. Their conversations sound terrible to the casual listener \u2013 like a spy at the door, for instance \u2013 but really they\u2019re just acting.\n\nLittlefinger again hints at getting rid of Arya (Episode 7)\n\nWhat it tells us: Littlefinger is sure Sansa wants to kill Arya.\n\nLittlefinger says to Sansa: \u201cAfter [Arya] murders you, what does she become? Lady of Winterfell.\u201d Like us, Sansa knows Arya has never wanted to be a lady, but Littlefinger thinks this is the way to coax Sansa into killing Arya.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that Littlefinger has used up all his chances: Sansa knows he is only trying to sow more chaos, and will only ever continue to do so. This is when she decides he is no longer an asset, and gets rid of him with the piles of evidence she, Bran and Arya have on him.\n\nThe big twist (Episode 7)\n\nWhat it tells us: Sansa and Arya were working together the entire time \u2013 with Bran\u2019s help.\n\nThis is where the decision only to show us scenes of disagreement between Sansa and Arya comes to fruition. Surprise! Littlefinger\u2019s been busted \u2013 he\u2019s done himself out of a job by trying to pit the Starks against each other. Not only have Arya and Sansa been working to take him down, but they\u2019ve also had Bran to help. Littlefinger\u2019s tricks don\u2019t work on the Starks, and he\u2019s reduced to begging for mercy. He gets none.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister?\u201d Sansa asks aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019ve always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That\u2019s what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa, and that\u2019s what you tried to do to us.\u201d He pleads to the contrary, but he knows it\u2019s true. He\u2019s been played \u2013 just like most of Game of Thrones\u2018 viewership.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoVWZrhd05o\n\nWhat do you reckon? Were you confused by the Winterfell storyline?
