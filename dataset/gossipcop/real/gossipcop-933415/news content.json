Yet they lost their humanity and believed that killing people was their mission. As heinous as their crimes were, and even when they confessed their guilt, justice wasn\u2019t denied. That\u2019s the thankless, exhausting job of defending the indefensible. Attorneys for infamous criminals tell their stories in Oxygen\u2019s four-part documentary series In Defense Of, premiering Monday, June 25. These lawyers are true believers in the justice system, though not necessarily in their clients\u2019 innocence.", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jzae4DKexko/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352527215457645&ev=PageView\n  &noscript=1", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/MediaVillage_head_logo.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/ws_95-01.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/AD_logo_95x95.svg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VV2dpl565kg/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/tomorrow_televised95.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.255/img/main-mv-logos/Footer.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-87PTHBI0gAVCI.gif", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.255/img/main-mv-logos/Header.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/tt-50x50_loUf1cL.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/Jacqueline_Cutler_1_HHpr8fr.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/Group.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/tv-square.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/3_ILlMnbq.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/AdvancingDiversity_Podcast.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/fofm_gy1Q3vd.svg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2tyr92K218M/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/Aging-square_2.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.255/img/icons/subscribe-mail.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/Steve_Gidlow_H0szL5P.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/The_Myers_Report.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/authors/Jacqueline_Cutler.jpg.100x100_q85_box-97%2C0%2C998%2C902_crop.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1440x1000_q85_box-0%2C15%2C640%2C459_crop_detail.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/sherunsit95.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/Frame_tM2Kg6t.svg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/72WMprLONBQ/hqdefault.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/ainsley_channel_logo.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/the_Update_logo_abL6ch4.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/landingemail.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/Lunch_at_Michaels_1.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/Multicultural_TV_logo_LrkS6Oh.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1200x630_q85_box-0%2C13%2C640%2C348_crop.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/ll_BPWPDG2.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/tv.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/tv.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/II-Podcast-Final-1.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/4.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/1st-five_iTz6rTi.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/PEd95.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1200x630_q85_box-0%2C13%2C640%2C348_crop.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacqueline Cutler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mediavillage.com/article/in-defense-of-oxygen-series-looks-at-lawyers-who-defend-the-indefensible/", "title": "\u201cIn Defense Of\u201d: Oxygen Series Looks at Lawyers Who Defend the Indefensible", "meta_data": {"copyright": "MediaVillage, 2020.
