The two tied the knot on Saturday (Dec. 2) during a beachside ceremony in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\nAccording to People magazine, the bride wore a gown by Berta and bare feet down the aisle, while her Aussie groom wore a tux by Joseph Abboud. Their David Yurman rings each had customized messages engraved inside.\n\nIn a previous CMT.com interview, Ballerini said one of her favorite things about their relationship is that they bring out the best in each other.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re each other\u2019s biggest fans,\u201d Ballerini said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re able to be transparent with each other. And it\u2019s cool because he has helped me with live music because he\u2019s been touring since he was 14, and I help him with U.S. radio because I\u2019ve been doing it for a couple of years. \u2026 We\u2019re just able to help each other in our strengths.\u201d\n\nIn a separate CMT.com interview, Evans said he looks forward to living a beautiful and musical life together with Ballerini.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the thing in our house now,\u201d he said, \u201cI used to try to write the best song in the world. Now I just want to write the best song in our house that day. Then I feel like I\u2019m doing OK.\u201d\n\nThe two met in March 2016 while co-hosting the CMC Awards show in Australia. Ballerini wrote the title song of her current album Unapologetically about Evans three weeks after they met. Nine months after their initial introduction, Evans proposed with a custom engagement ring over breakfast at home.\n\n\u201cIt was a special moment,\u201d Evans told People of the proposal. \u201cIt was just right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was the sweetest thing ever,\u201d she added.", "images": ["http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:269893?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270", "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:269893?width=1200&height=675&.jpg"], "top_img": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:269893?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Tingle"], "canonical_link": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1789135/kelsea-ballerini-and-morgan-evans-marry-in-mexico/", "title": "Kelsea Ballerini and Morgan Evans Marry in Mexico", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "cmt.com"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.cmt.com:1789135"}, "og": {"site_name": "CMT News", "title": "Kelsea Ballerini and Morgan Evans Marry in Mexico", "url": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1789135/kelsea-ballerini-and-morgan-evans-marry-in-mexico/", "image": {"identifier": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:269893?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "The two met in March 2016 while co-hosting the CMC Awards show in Australia.
