News, met his wife Carla on a flight from San Diego back home to Seattle in May 2016. Both doctors, they hit it off immediately and, in fact, called their respective moms after they landed to tell them they had just met the person they would marry.\n\nJust two months later, Macedo decided to pop the question during a trip to Disneyland. He originally planned to ask Carla inside Beast\u2019s library at Disney California Adventure, but instead managed to convince employees to let them into the VIP sections during the nightly fireworks show where they were given more privacy.\n\nHis proposal went something like this: \u201cOn May 29th, I left my heart in the hands of the most beautiful woman I have ever met on Delta flight [number], so now I want to spend the rest of my life protecting your heart the way you\u2019ve protected mine.\u201d\n\nSigh!\n\nOf course, Carla said yes and the couple tied the knot in December. But the fairytale only gets better from there!\n\nFor Carla\u2019s birthday this year, Macedo came up with the brilliant (and swoon-worthy) idea of buying the actual Disneyland bench he proposed on the year before. He called up Disneyland and explained his somewhat odd request to employees.\n\n\u201cThe first several people had no idea what I was trying to do,\u201d he told E! News, \u201cbut I finally got a hold of the right person that said, \u2018Well, the same bench is put in that same spot every night\u2019. And I said, \u2018I want it disassembled and I want it mailed to me. I\u2019ll pay whatever it costs\u2019.\u201d\n\nSince Disney is in the business of making dreams come true, they were able to follow through with Macedo\u2019s request. The bench was shipped to Macedo\u2019s home and he quickly went about re-assembling it in their backyard. When Carla arrived home, he blindfolded her and surprised her with what she instantly recognized as \u201ctheir\u201d bench.\n\nAnd the best part? Disney had custom-designed a placard that read, \u201cOnce upon a time in a magical kingdom in front of an enchanted castle on this very bench on July 18, 2016, Ryan asked Carla to be his bride. Fireworks shot through the sky, with tears in her eyes Carla said yes. Ryan was overcome with joy and they lived happily ever after\u201d.\n\nSee? Fairytales are real. Now the only thing for Macedo to do is to buy the plane they met on.", "images": ["http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/icons/LinkedIn.png", "https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/sliders/DHTours.jpg", "http://portal.criticalimpact.com/user/25875/image/logo_travelweek-daily.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/_images/logo_tw_short.png", "https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/This-is-what-agents-are-responsible-for-in-the-wake-of-Coronavirus-TICO-300x190.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/_images/widgetBlock_Orange.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/07.20_Disney_CloseUP.jpg", "https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/sliders/magazine_subscriptions_NEW.gif", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/icons/Twitter.png", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/icons/Facebook.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=986898634685104&ev=PageView\n\t&noscript=1", "http://www.travelweek.ca/news/real-life-prince-charming-buys-wife-disney-bench-proposed/ https:/www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Books-open-for-Crystal-Endeavor\u2019s-2021-expeditions-556x353.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/_images/widgetBlock_Blue.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/icons/Instagram.png", "http://www.travelweek.ca/news/real-life-prince-charming-buys-wife-disney-bench-proposed/ https:/www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Air-Canada-reconfigures-aircraft-to-carry-over-89-tonnes-of-medical-equipment-3-556x353.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/_images/widgetBlock_Pink.jpg", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/950151753/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/icons/GooglePlus.png", "http://www.travelweek.ca/news/real-life-prince-charming-buys-wife-disney-bench-proposed/ https:/www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tories-ask-Liberals-for-plan-for-extra-help-for-tourism-and-hospitality-sectors-2-556x353.jpg", "https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/07.20_Disney.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/news/real-life-prince-charming-buys-wife-disney-bench-proposed/ https:/www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/07.20_Disney-673x427.jpg", "http://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/themes/travelweekmaster/icons/YouTube.png", "http://www.travelweek.ca/news/real-life-prince-charming-buys-wife-disney-bench-proposed/ https:/www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Getting-through-this-together-318x219.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.travelweek.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/07.20_Disney.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travelweek Group"], "canonical_link": "https://www.travelweek.ca/news/real-life-prince-charming-buys-wife-disney-bench-proposed/", "title": "Real-life Prince Charming buys his wife the Disney bench that he proposed on", "meta_data": {"language": "english", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale = 1.0", "contact": "support@travelweek.ca", "copyright": "Copyright (c)2009-2020 Travelweek Group, All Rights Reserved", "keywords": "Travel,News,Jobs,Agent,Consultant,Deals", "DC.language": "en", "DC.source": "http://www.travelweek.ca/", "DC.title": "Real-life Prince Charming buys his wife the Disney bench that he proposed on -
