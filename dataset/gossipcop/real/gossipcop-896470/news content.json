Clearly, the California-born former TV actress is comfortable being a new global superstar.\n\nMeanwhile, her sister-in-law Kate Middleton has been back home in the U.K., continuing her more low-key but self-assured return to royal duties after taking six months\u2019 maternity leave following the birth of her third child, Prince Louis, in April.\n\nIt turns out that Kate\u2019s recent moves may be more consequential than Meghan\u2019s in the long term. That\u2019s because Kate is married to William, second in line to the British throne, while Meghan\u2019s new husband Harry was bumped down to sixth in line of succession after Louis was born.\n\nOnce William becomes king, Kate becomes Queen Catherine \u2014 queen consort officially, Town and Country reported.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge also is the mother of at least one other future monarch, Prince George. And it looks like, after seven years of marriage and numerous royal appearances, she\u2019s grown comfortable with this \u201csenior\u201d position \u2014 especially with Meghan taking over the \u201cprincess-in-training\u201d role with her marriage in May to Harry, according to Vanity Fair.\n\nRoyal observers added to Vanity Fair that Meghan\u2019s arrival into \u201cThe Firm\u201d gives it four massively popular figures as its representatives to the world, just as Queen Elizabeth II enters her mid-90s and Charles reportedly takes over more of the duties of being head of the family.\n\nKate is now \u201cfully a senior royal\u201d within the apparatus \u2014 no longer the \u201ccommoner\u201d who\u2019s just married into the royal family, Vanity Fair added. That\u2019s now Meghan\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge turning point,\u201d Susan E. Kelley, owner and editor of the blog What Kate Wore, told Vanity Fair. \u201cI think this is where Kate gets to make her mark.\u201d\n\nIn certain ways, Kate\u2019s seemingly more confident moves since returning to royal duties show the influence of her new sister-in-law, the Duchess of Sussex. Since marrying William in 2011, Kate has been seen as a bit prim and proper in what she wears and how she presents herself. To the royal press corps, she has often come off as \u201cstandoffish\u201d or \u201chaughty.\u201d\n\nMeghan\u2019s demeanor, on the other hand, is more relaxed and down-to-earth, probably reflecting her American upbringing and her experience in Hollywood. The former \u201cSuits\u201d actress and humanitarian certainly knows how to work the press, the cameras and the crowds.\n\nVanity Fair and other publications noted that Kate\u2019s first royal outing since returning from maternity leave allowed her to show a more relaxed side, as well as an interest in supporting disadvantaged children. She visited inner-city children at a London wildlife garden and school. Rather than turn up in a modest-length skirt, with her signature nude pumps and panty hose, she came dressed casually in jeans, a khaki jacket and leather boots. During her visit, she was photographed bending down to bond with the young children and to read them a story.\n\nKate followed up that photo op by showing some rare PDA with William at Princess Eugenie\u2019s Oct. 12 wedding at Windsor Castle. She let William put his hand on her back at one point, while she rested her hand on his upper thigh while watching Eugenie marry Jack Brooksbank in St. George\u2019s Chapel.\n\nKate Middleton and Prince William were feeling the love at Princess Eugenie's #RoyalWedding! https://t.co/tpwasT5lI2 \u2014 ET Canada (@ETCanada) October 12, 2018\n\nKate also showed up in what Vanity Fair called one of the most \u201cfashion-forward dresses of her career\u201d \u2014 a tweed Erdem with a shoulder-baring asymmetrical neckline \u2014 at an Oct. 10 solo appearance at the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nFinally, she dazzled last week at a state dinner at Buckingham Palace, wearing an ice-blue Alexander McQueen gown and the Lover\u2019s Knot tiara \u2014 a favorite of the late Princess Diana.\n\nThe Alexander McQueen gown also was sleeveless; Kate hasn\u2019t worn many dresses, including evening gowns, that show off her slender arms. Meghan, however, has shown less traditional modesty when it comes to fashion, sometimes baring her shoulders or going sleeveless, including recently in Australia where she wore an eco-friendly U.S.-made sundress with a thigh-high slit.\n\nMeghan, with Harry, also easily ditched royal protocol, removing her shoes to join some surfers/mental health advocates on a Sydney beach. Kate, on the other hand, kept her shoes on while visiting another Sydney beach in 2014, the Express pointed out.\n\n\u201cA couple of years ago, you might still have seen (Kate) being a little bit timid,\u201d Kelley added to Vanity Fair. \u201cNow, she seems like she\u2019s in a more take-charge position. I\u2019m beginning to see the person who\u2019s going to be the queen emerging.\u201d\n\nKaitlin Menza, co-host of the Royally Obsessed podcast, added to Vanity Fair, \u201cAfter that long break, (Kate) has certainly come back with a bang. I think that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to convey: \u2018I\u2019m back, baby.'\u201d\n\nRoyal observers put aside any ideas of a behind-the-scenes Kensington Palace rivalry between Kate and Meghan.\n\nVanity Fair\u2019s royal correspondent Katie Nicholl said that Kate actually is \u201cquite grateful\u201d to Meghan for relieving her of some of \u201cthe relentless scrutiny\u201d that comes from being in the royal family.\n\n\u201cPeople who are often saying \u2018Well, is she jealous of Meghan?\u2019 She\u2019s really not,\u201d Nicholl said.\n\n\u201cKate is happier in her life now than she ever has been,\u201d Nicholl continued. \u201cShe has everything she wants. She has William, she has three beautiful children . . . she is where she always wanted to be.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KateMeghanWimbledon1.jpg?w=1024&h=682"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KateMeghanWimbledon1.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
