Brad Goreski married TV producer Gary Janetti aboard a luxury cruise ship in the Caribbean on Tuesday, December 26.\n\nThe intimate ceremony was officiated by Seabourn Sojourn captain Tim Roberts at sunset. The Fashion Police cohost, 40, wore a custom royal blue suit by Isaia, while his 51-year-old groom donned a gray suit that was also designed by the Italian menswear brand. Their wedding rings were crafted by David Yurman.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re married!\u201d Goreski gushed on Instagram. \u201cAfter over 16 years together @garyjanetti and I finally tied the knot aboard the @seabourncruise Sojourn with our close family in attendance! We couldn\u2019t be happier! Thank you @isaia for our custom suits and @davidyurman for our custom wedding bands.\u201d\n\nThe longtime couple met in Athens, Greece, and became engaged in August 2014.\n\nGoreski previously said his successful career in reality TV helped bring him closer to Janetti, who is best known for his work on Family Guy, Will & Grace and the British sitcom Vicious. \u201cThe strange thing is, [my career] made our relationship so much better because now we have this really weird, strange experience that we\u2019ve been through together,\u201d the celebrity stylist said during an interview on HuffPost Live in February 2016. \u201c[Janetti is] very, very funny and also so easy to live with. There are way more things that I love about him than things that drive me crazy.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married-2.jpg?w=187", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married-3.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married.jpg?w=242", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-polices-brad-goreski-marries-tv-producer-gary-janetti-caribbean-cruise-ship/", "title": "Brad Goreski Marries Gary Janetti on a Caribbean Cruise Ship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Fashion Police\u2019 cohost Brad Goreski married TV producer Gary Janetti aboard a luxury cruise ship in the Caribbean on Tuesday, December 26, after 16 years together \u2014 photos", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Goreski Marries Gary Janetti After 16 Years Together: Details", "description": "\u2018Fashion Police\u2019 cohost Brad Goreski married TV producer Gary Janetti aboard a luxury cruise ship in the Caribbean on Tuesday, December 26, after 16 years together \u2014 photos", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fashion-polices-brad-goreski-marries-tv-producer-gary-janetti-caribbean-cruise-ship/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:07:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-12-27T18:42:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:07:30+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Fashion Police\u2019 cohost Brad Goreski married TV producer Gary Janetti aboard a luxury cruise ship in the Caribbean on Tuesday, December 26, after 16 years together \u2014 photos", "title": "Brad Goreski Marries Gary Janetti After 16 Years Together: Details", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/brad-goreski-and-gary-janetti-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1095px%2C575px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514400151.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
