At the time, Lauren and Thomas Rhett had been trying to get pregnant with no luck, and had just begun to consider adoption.\n\n\u201cWhen I met Willa, her story was pretty intense,\u201d Lauren says of the toddler, who\u2019d been brought to the children\u2019s home soon after her birth in November 2015. \u201cAll orphans have heart-wrenching stories, but it felt like this specific baby was ours. I think that the Lord knew what he was doing when he did not let us get pregnant.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Her life was going to be at the children\u2019s home unless someone else tried to give her a home,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018We need to find her a home.\u2019 I thought we\u2019d be the helpers \u2014 and then Thomas Rhett said, \u2018We\u2019ll do it!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd with those words, the couple began their year-long adoption journey. It took Thomas Rhett some time to find a break in his touring schedule long enough to travel to Uganda to meet the baby who had captured their hearts, and admits laughingly, \u201cWhen I did, she didn\u2019t want anything to do with me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI reached for her and she was like, \u2018Who the crap are you with that beard?\u2019 But I was astonished at how quickly I bonded with her \u2014 and how immediately, she just felt like she was my child.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Kailey Dickerson\n\nRELATED: How Thomas Rhett and Wife Lauren Spent Daughter Willa\u2019s First Day Home from Uganda: She Had \u201cNever Seen Dogs Before\u201d\n\nBut the couple soon learned that making Willa their child legally would be far more complicated. To comply with Uganda\u2019s complex adoption laws, they were required to foster the baby in country over the course of a year. That meant nearly a dozen trips back and forth to the East African nation \u2014 each time not knowing how long they would stay because of legal requirements, and tearful farewells after every one.\n\n\u201cI went over with Lauren in December for about seven weeks, and the room we were staying in with Willa almost started to feel like home,\u201d the singer says. \u201cThe hardest part was never knowing when it was going to end. I\u2019m pretty sure every flight was booked a day before we left either place, because you can\u2019t plan it. We\u2019d get there and realize we had to be there another two weeks. Things moved at a snail\u2019s pace.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Akins Family\n\nFROM PEN: Adoption Holds a Special Place in Katherine Heigl\u2019s Heart\n\nThe couple would stay with Willa in a guest house near the children\u2019s home and parent her as best they could during their visits before returning her to the children\u2019s home when they had to leave. \u201cIt was hard \u2014 it\u2019s totally different parenting there,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cThe babies are being taken care of sometimes by a 10-year-old.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cYou want to instill your own values and rules and make sure she eats certain things, and that was out of the question while we were fostering her. But you think, \u2018The Lord has gotten us this far, and I\u2019m just going to have to trust that he\u2019s going to take care of the rest.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn the meantime, life in America became a little more \u2014 wonderfully \u2014 complicated as well. The couple learned they were pregnant (with a girl, due in August), which meant Lauren\u2019s window for travel was closing.\n\nAnd then finally, in March, they received good news: It looked like they were getting close to being able to bring Willa home. Lauren, approaching the third trimester of her pregnancy, traveled back to Uganda once again \u2014 this time with her mother, hoping that she\u2019d be flying back with a toddler in her arms.\n\nImage zoom Kailey Dickerson\n\nImage zoom Kailey Dickerson\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Inside Thomas Rhett & Wife Lauren\u2019s Sweet Love Story\n\nAs the days and the red tape ticked by, Thomas Rhett flew out to join his wife for the one week he had off between shows. \u201cWhen I left Uganda, it was a terrifying moment,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I had to go play shows, but Lauren and her mom Lisa were literally there indefinitely.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cThat\u2019s a scary place to be in as the husband \u2014 being 7,000 miles away from your 25-week-pregnant wife and your daughter, not knowing if they were going to come home in two weeks or two months.\u201d\n\nBut the couple knew that no matter how long it would take to finalize the adoption, they couldn\u2019t leave Willa again. \u201cWilla was so attached to me and Lauren, and Lauren\u2019s mom, that to bring her back to the orphanage at that point would have been completely detrimental,\u201d the singer says.\n\n\u201cHer whole life has been nothing but being passed around. Different caretakers every day, different kids picking her up. Bringing her back to the orphanage wasn\u2019t an option.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Courtesy Akins Family\n\nImage zoom Lauren Akins/Instagram\n\nRELATED: Thomas Rhett and Wife Lauren Expecting a Baby \u2013 and Adopting a Child from Africa\n\nNearly a month after Lauren arrived in Uganda, they learned that Willa would, at last, be legally theirs. \u201cI think the judge knew my time was running out,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cBless his heart, I\u2019m so thankful. I wanted to run up and hug him so hard when he gave us the court ruling.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe changed her life and our lives,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe knew how long we had been working with the children\u2019s home and he knew that our family is a family and that our roots are in Uganda too and that we\u2019ll be back. But for a while, I thought I\u2019d be there forever.\u201d\n\nLauren knew they were close to their happy ending, but finalizing the last legal details of the adoption meant that she was getting into dangerous territory with her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt had been a little over six weeks since my last checkup and I just didn\u2019t want to think something could go wrong. My doctor really wanted me to come home and make sure everything was okay,\u201d she says. So, with only days until Willa would be ready to travel, Lauren had to return, leaving her mother to bring the toddler home.\n\nRELATED: Thomas Rhett and Wife Lauren Welcome Daughter Willa Gray: \u201cEveryone Is Where They\u2019re Supposed to Be\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt weird leaving one daughter and making sure the other one is okay. But I couldn\u2019t do it another way,\u201d Lauren adds. \u201cIt killed me not being able to bring [Willa] home, but looking back, I think it was a blessing in disguise because I got to be home and nest before she got here \u2014 and catch up on my sleep so I wasn\u2019t so jet-lagged!\u201d\n\nLauren\u2019s dad, an airline pilot himself, joined her mom in Uganda, and the two made the 7,000-mile journey to Nashville with their new granddaughter on May 11.\n\n\u201cSeeing her there felt like a dream,\u201d Lauren recalls of her first glimpse of Willa when her parents drove up to the private hangar where they met.\n\nRELATED: Thomas Rhett Talks \u201cGetting Into Daddy Mode\u201d on the ACMs Red Carpet with Pregnant Wife Lauren\n\nBut one more unexpected complication was awaiting the new family at the airport. \u201cThe Predators, Nashville\u2019s hockey team who had made it to the finals, had tweeted out the night before to fans telling them to meet the team at the hangar right next door for a sendoff,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo we pulled up in the car and expected it to be low key, but holy crap, half of Nashville was there!\u201d\n\nA few fans noticed Thomas Rhett, but Willa and Lauren\u2019s mom were able to slip by unnoticed before the new family headed home at last.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked for and hoped for for so long and it\u2019s just a dream come true,\u201d Lauren says. \u201cShe really does live up to her nickname in Uganda: She is just the biggest little Blessing that ever has walked the earth.\u201d\n\nFor more from Thomas Rhett\u2019s new family of three \u2014 soon to be four!
