They also have the power to resume the distribution of funds to the person if and when \"examinations indicate no such use for 12 months\" and when the \"Trustee in their discretion determine that the beneficiary is able to care for himself or herself\" and manage their financial affairs.\n\nThe Playboy impresario died on Sept. 27 at the age of 91 from cardiac arrest. According to Hefner's death certificate, obtained by ET at the time, secondary causes included respiratory failure, septicemia and drug-resistant E. Coli. The E. Coli was listed as being from an \"undetermined etiology,\" meaning the origin of the highly dangerous bacteria could not be confirmed.\n\nA source close to Hefner's family told ET after his death, \"Hef hadn't been doing well for the last year. [His death] wasn't shocking to the family.\"\n\n\"Everyone is obviously sad, but they feel he lived a very fulfilling and long life,\" the source added.\n\nFor more on the iconic publisher's life, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nHugh Hefner's Death Certificate Reveals Drug-Resistant E.
