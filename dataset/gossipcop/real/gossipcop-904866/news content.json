I feel like it's kind of a service to do that.\u201d\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE'S HALF-SISTER SLAMS PRINCE HARRY'S CLAIM THE ROYALS ARE THE FAMILY SHE 'NEVER HAD'\n\nGrant, who shares a father with Markle, also defended the title for her upcoming book, \u201cThe Diary of Princess Pushy\u2019s Sister,\u201d saying it wasn\u2019t \u201cnegative\u201d and that she didn\u2019t write \u201ca slamming tell-all.\u201d\n\n\"I chose the title because I was more making a mockery of tabloids who, at one point, called my sister \u2018Princess Pushy,\u2019\u201d Grant said. \u201cThe opposite is true. And so I thought, you know, to make fun of that and illustrate that she really is not, I'm going to choose that title and run with it.\u201d\n\nGrant said she thought it was \u201cfunny\u201d that the public has taken the \u201cPrincess Pushy\u201d title \u201cso literally.\u201d\n\nThe half-sister also told \u201cThe Wright Stuff\u201d she wasn\u2019t offended by Prince Harry\u2019s comment saying Markle was getting \u201cthe family I suppose that she\u2019s never had.\u201d\n\n\"I think he was referring to the family all being in one place \u2014children running around, a large gathering. It's lovely that she can have that,\" Grant said. \"So, it was more a matter of timing and geography and getting together in one place than having a family per se.\"\n\nMEGHAN MARKLE: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PRINCE HARRY'S FIANC\u00c9E\n\nMarkle's mother Doria Ragland and father Tom Markle divorced in 1987 when the actress was 6-years-old.\n\nGrant previously wrote on Twitter that Markle \u201chas a large family who were always there with her and for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur household was very normal and when dad and Doria divorced, we all made it so it was like she had two houses. No one was estranged, she was just too busy,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nGrant said on Monday that her social media comments were \u201cvery positive, verbatim, and taken far out of context. It was never slamming. It was never negative.\u201d\n\nThe \"Suits\" actress reportedly has an estranged relationship with her older sister. Grant has spoken ill of Markle in the past, saying, \"Hollywood has changed her. I think her ambition is to become a princess\u2026The truth would kill her relationship with Prince Harry.\"\n\nWhen asked about being invited to the royal wedding -- set for May 19 at St. George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor Castle -- Grant responded: \u201cInvitations haven\u2019t gone out yet, but I hope so. Of course I would like to be there.\u201d\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/65a631b5-1514471287860.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mafia-Hit-Man.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/meghan-markle-mom-reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/12/21/694940094001_5689411445001_5689403020001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20104012734692.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/65a631b5-1514471287860.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/270/152/RT-Hollywood-sign.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e4bdc6f3-8d06-4623-b934-f4a25899cb6c/dc192956-9929-4f64-abb4-d9b8827a6fac/1280x720/match/270/152/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/65a631b5-1514471287860.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
