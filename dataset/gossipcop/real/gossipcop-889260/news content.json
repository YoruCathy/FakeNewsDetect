Ross Butler was tall, muscular, and incredibly hunky, making him an ideal casting choice.\n\nvia @rossbutler\n\nButler was also cast in the controversial Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why as Hannah Baker's friend/kind of love interest, Zack. While Butler balanced both shows in their premiere seasons, he ultimately decided to leave the Riverdale cast to focus on 13 Reasons Why full time.\n\nRecasting can often be a pain in the ass. Once audiences are familiar with a certain actor playing a character, it's harder for them to like the re-casted actor. Audiences like familiarity, especially after seeing the same actor or actress for a long time. With big franchises like The Fresh Prince of Bell-Air or Halloweentown - the recasting of Aunt Viv and Marnie went pretty horribly. Audiences were angry and confused as to why the re-casting took place. But since Riverdale was only one season in, the Reggie Mantle re-casting went beautifully. Literally, look at Charles Melton.\n\nvia @_melton_\n\nvia @_melton_\n\nMmmm yeah that's the stuff. I'm going to go on record in saying, hotter than old Reggie. And when it comes to Riverdale? A better fit, too. Don't just take my word for it - K.J. Apa aka Archie Andrews says the two connected basically immediately, making their on-screen chemistry all the better.\n\nvia @_melton_\n\n\"He teaches me Korean and I teach him Samoan,\" says Apa. \"K.J. calls me hyeong, which translates to brother from Korean,\" Melton agrees. The two have had a great time connecting both on and off screen, whether it's grabbing coffee, drinks, or working out really hard.\n\nvia @kjapa\n\n\"I think you can tell a lot about someone by how hard they work in the gym. I think it's awesome to play with someone who works out as hard as you,\" says K.J. He and Charles regularly break a serious sweat at Equinox Vancouver and occasionally on a charity soccer field.\n\nvia @kjapa\n\nMe & the water boy A post shared by Charles Melton (@_melton_) on Sep 17, 2017 at 11:34am PDT\n\n\"We're very similar, very competitive.\" KJ reveals that the dynamic between Reggie and Archie is what he's most excited for fans to see this season. \"Charles is a legend. We're really really good mates. He completely emulates everything about Reggie. He's the perfect Reggie. Fans are going to love that dynamic. I think we have great chemistry.\"\n\nMan KJ is a beast A post shared by Charles Melton (@_melton_) on Oct 16, 2017 at 12:10am PDT\n\nIt seems like the feeling is mutual for Charles, too. I mean check out this adorable selfie Charles posted of KJ. Can you say couple goals?? Long live this bromance, I hope it lasts a million years.", "images": ["https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p640x640/20759157_115813249078819_7651191144960753664_n.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/21827424_342536362866385_1084426555876179968_n.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18729422&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2017/10/26/2466e46ca3a1632cd0f4a6b1fb5f1fc76597fe0e.png_1200x630.png", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/15538896_238643006564773_981783894133047296_n.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18645123_249593285516761_3936377908066516992_n.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/19985680_333952077027272_4325998237145104384_n.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=RT5wq1rcy520uW", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22278097_114454949310576_8641815554962751488_n.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.narcity.com/u/2017/10/26/2466e46ca3a1632cd0f4a6b1fb5f1fc76597fe0e.png_1200x630.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/sorry-bughead-fans-kj-apa-and-charles-melton-are-riverdales-cutest-couple", "title": "Sorry Bughead Fans, KJ Apa And Charles Melton Are 'Riverdale's Cutest Couple", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "template": "Polemos", "fb": {"app_id": 1468563456738953, "pages": 784042488306600}, "description": "No spoilers, I promise.", "title": "Sorry Bughead Fans, KJ Apa And Charles Melton Are 'Riverdale's Cutest Couple", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "No spoilers, I promise.", "title": "Sorry Bughead Fans, KJ Apa And Charles Melton Are 'Riverdale's Cutest Couple", "site": "@NarcityCanada", "image": "https://www.narcity.com/u/2017/10/26/2466e46ca3a1632cd0f4a6b1fb5f1fc76597fe0e.png_1200x630.png"}, "article": {"section": "Gossip", "publisher": "Narcity", "author": "https://www.narcity.com/author/paige-mcphee", "published_time": "2017-10-26T01:48:02.580Z"}, "og": {"title": "Sorry Bughead Fans, KJ Apa And Charles Melton Are 'Riverdale's Cutest Couple", "description": "No spoilers, I promise.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.narcity.com/u/2017/10/26/2466e46ca3a1632cd0f4a6b1fb5f1fc76597fe0e.png_1200x630.png", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/sorry-bughead-fans-kj-apa-and-charles-melton-are-riverdales-cutest-couple"}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/sorry-bughead-fans-kj-apa-and-charles-melton-are-riverdales-cutest-couple", "app_store_id": 1291431733, "app_name": "Narcity"}, "android": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/sorry-bughead-fans-kj-apa-and-charles-melton-are-riverdales-cutest-couple", "package": "com.narcitymedia.narcity", "app_name": "Narcity"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/sorry-bughead-fans-kj-apa-and-charles-melton-are-riverdales-cutest-couple"}}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bd738d22d4fc40cea547f834666b428f"}, "ir-site-verification-token": "-1910751629"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508982482.58, "source": "https://www.narcity.com", "summary": ""}
