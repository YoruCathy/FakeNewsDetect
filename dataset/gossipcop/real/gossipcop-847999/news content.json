I can't go backwards. Like, life is always going to be different. Now I just have to be like, super aware of everything that I do and who I share it with,\" the 36-year-old reality star answers. \"So I have to go to New York from Costa Rica, from our family trip, to go meet with the French judge, so that I don't have to go to Paris.\"\n\n\"Knowing that it's a possibility that people close to me were involved makes me feel like I can't trust anyone, and that really sucks,\" Kim later says to the camera. \"It just opened up my eyes that this happens and that there's, you know, really bad people in this world. I can still live my life, but just on edge.\"\n\nSee the promo below:\n\n\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!\n\n\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian Panics During First Public Appearance After Paris Robbery in New 'KUWTK' Promo -- Watch!\n\nA source told ET in January that Kim was \"deeply relieved to know that this horrible ordeal will all come to an end soon,\" after 17 suspects were detained by police for being tied to the October robbery that lost the reality star millions in cash and jewelry.\n\nSee more in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-03/1280_kim_kardashian_aftermath_KUWTK.jpg?itok=B2EgCiay", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_kim_kardashian_aftermath_KUWTK.jpg?itok=Xfw2iW46"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_kim_kardashian_aftermath_KUWTK.jpg?itok=Xfw2iW46", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tv/216779_kim_kardashian_says_she_on_edge_after_paris_robbery_arrests_new_kuwtk_promo_i_can_t_trust_anyone", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says She's 'On Edge' After Paris Robbery Arrests in New 'KUWTK' Promo: 'I Can't Trust Anyone'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Kim Kardashian Says She's 'On Edge' After Paris Robbery Arrests in New 'KUWTK' Promo: 'I Can't Trust Anyone' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tv/216779_kim_kardashian_says_she_on_edge_after_paris_robbery_arrests_new_kuwtk_promo_i_can_t_trust_anyone", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says She's 'On Edge' After Paris Robbery Arrests in New 'KUWTK' Promo: 'I Can't Trust Anyone'", "description": "'Now I just have to be like, super aware of everything that I do,' the reality star tells her sister, Kourtney.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_kim_kardashian_aftermath_KUWTK.jpg?itok=Xfw2iW46", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Now I just have to be like, super aware of everything that I do,' the reality star tells her sister, Kourtney.", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says She's 'On Edge' After Paris Robbery Arrests in New 'KUWTK' Promo: 'I Can't Trust Anyone'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tv/216779_kim_kardashian_says_she_on_edge_after_paris_robbery_arrests_new_kuwtk_promo_i_can_t_trust_anyone", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_kim_kardashian_aftermath_KUWTK.jpg?itok=Xfw2iW46"}, "description": "'Now I just have to be like, super aware of everything that I do,' the reality star tells her sister, Kourtney.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, News, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Keeping Up With The Kardashians", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4JAIfTCiAY?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
