US Weekly caught up with the \u201cJersey Shore Family Vacation\u201d star at the premiere party.\n\nIt was revealed earlier this year that Danity Kane singer Aubrey O\u2019Day was involved in an affair with Donald Trump Jr. while he was married to his soon-to-be ex-wife, Vanessa.\n\nVanessa allegedly found emails between Aubrey and her husband where he promised he would be leaving his marriage for her.\n\nThis happened in 2012 after the two met on the set of \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d but only recently made headlines which is why Pauly was asked if it contributed to their split.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t address that at all. Yeah, I didn\u2019t know anything about that. I guess [the news broke] after or something like that,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the show taped a year ago which is why he was in the dark about it.\n\nAs to why they did break up, the reality star wants you to tune in to see what happens.\n\n\u201cYou know, some people just aren\u2019t right for each other and we learned that. It\u2019s probably kind of cool because you guys can watch it and see why. That\u2019s why you have to tune in and find out exactly what went wrong, and then you get to live it with me.\u201d\n\nIn the trailer for the relationship show, it seems that Pauly and Aubrey have the most tumultuous relationship in the group. O\u2019Day accuses the 38-year-old of cheating which he vehemently denies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you think DTJ was serious about being with the singer? Will you be watching \u201cMarriage Boot Camp?\u201d", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_35_1498426437-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tyga-Kylie-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Aubrey-and-Pauly.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Angelina-and-JW-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mike-The-Situation-Sorrentino-Teams-Up-With-The-State-Of-New-Jersey-For-COVID-19-PSA-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/JWoww-and-Zack-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Aubrey-and-Pauly.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ricki Mathers", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/did-dj-pauly-d-and-aubrey-oday-split-because-of-her-affair-with-donald-trump-jr-186306/", "title": "Did DJ Pauly D And Aubrey O\u2019Day Split Because Of Her Affair With Donald Trump Jr.?", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ricki Mathers", "news_keywords": "aubrey o'day, jersey shore, marriage boot camp, Pauly D,", "keywords": "celebrity news, aubrey o'day, jersey shore, marriage boot camp, Pauly D,", "description": "DJ Pauly D and Aubrey O'Day started dating in 2016 after meeting on the set of \"Famously Single.\" The two split in 2017 but decided to head to", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Did DJ Pauly D And Aubrey O\u2019Day Split Because Of Her Affair With Donald Trump Jr.?", "description": "DJ Pauly D and Aubrey O'Day started dating in 2016 after meeting on the set of \"Famously Single.\" The two split in 2017 but decided to head to", "url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/did-dj-pauly-d-and-aubrey-oday-split-because-of-her-affair-with-donald-trump-jr-186306/", "image": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Aubrey-and-Pauly.jpg", "site_name": "Breaking Celebrity News, Entertainment News, and Celebrity Gossip - Celebrity Insider"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-31", "modified_time": "2018-08-31", "author": "https://celebrityinsider.org/author/rickimathers/", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Pauly D"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1646073299040160}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CelebInsiderorg", "site": "@CelebInsiderorg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cropped-favincon-270x270.png", "theme-color": "#dedede"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535644800.0, "source": "http://celebrityinsider.org", "summary": ""}
