Like doctors, they've seen it all: acne, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and rosacea. The main difference is you're probably not going to book a facial if you're having an eczema flare-up. While facialists certainly see their fair share of skin concerns, it's their job not to prescribe drugs, but rather to provide treatments that help soothe and transform the skin over time. What's more: Said treatments are usually super tranquil and administered on a sleep-inducing spa table.\n\nAside from the relaxation factor, another tempting reason to see a facialist (interchangeably called aesthetician), is the personalized approach. Most of the time these complexion caregivers work by meticulously examining your skin and treating it with whatever it needs, whether it's a heavy dose of hydration, uncomfortable extractions, or a dose of LED light therapy. Celebrities, bloggers, and beauty editors (not to mention everyday folks who crave a clear complexion) rely on aestheticians for balanced, soothed skin that glows \u2014 without the highlighter.\n\nBut, I wonder: How do these skin whisperers care for their own complexions? Because I couldn't shake the curiosity, I decided to ask. Ahead, find the skin-care routines and secrets of seven top facialists.\n\nCourtesy of Sofie Pavitt/brands\n\nMorning:\n\nBefore heading to her cozy skin-care studio on the Lower East Side, facialist Sofie Pavitt wakes up her skin with a splash of toner \u2014 and that's that. \"My skin is quite dry so I don't wash my face in the morning \u2014 instead, I go straight to toning. I'm a big fan of the Circumference Active Botanical Refining Toner, which is hydrating,\" she says.\n\nStraight after toner, she slathers on a vitamin C serum \u2014 and just like so many skin-care devotees, SkinCeuticals's C E Ferulic Serum is her chosen one. \"It's an OG classic because it's so effective without being irritating,\" says Pavitt. Post-serum, she layers on Soleil Toujours' Organic Daily Sunless Tanning Serum to warm up her winter complexion. \"Like everyone, my skin can look a little dull in the winter and this helps brighten it up,\" she says. \"I add a couple of drops to my face a few days a week which gives me a nice glow.\"", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba2cffe2d62302afb583a7a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/shani.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5e2775d7cb9f72000964f607/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/skin%2525203.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef1d2fa192d41f6b382/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Joanna%252520C.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba5371fb5e7a66397ad1757/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Lede-Facialist.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef0d2fa192d41f6b380/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Joanna%252520V.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef1135b333b10dff073/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Angela.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5e84c19041364700089bfefe/master/h_180%2Cc_limit/laura-mercier-translucent-loose-setting-powder-gwp.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef0a91abf2160df1ac9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Melissa.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba28ef1a91abf2160df1acb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Georgia.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaleigh Fasanella", "Kaleigh Fasanell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/aesthetician-skin-care-routine-tips", "title": "7 Top Aestheticians Reveal Their Skin-Care Routines", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kaleigh Fasanella", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Facialists, aka aestheticians, spend all day caring for their clients' skin, but how do they care for their own complexions? \"Allure\" spoke with six top facialists, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to expert, to find out the products and treatments they use to keep their skin in tip-top shape.", "id": "5ba1505b3cc30050d29e6891", "keywords": "skin,facialists,best facialists,skin care routines,skin-care products,dermarolling,shani darden,joanna czech,joanna vargas,kim kardashian,skin conditions,rosacea,breakouts,acne", "news_keywords": "skin,facialists,best facialists,skin care routines,skin-care products,dermarolling,shani darden,joanna czech,joanna vargas,kim kardashian,skin conditions,rosacea,breakouts,acne", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ba1505b3cc30050d29e6891", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Facialists, aka aestheticians, spend all day caring for their clients' skin, but how do they care for their own complexions? \\\"Allure\\\" spoke with six top facialists, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to expert, to find out the products and treatments they use to keep their skin in tip-top shape.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba5371fb5e7a66397ad1757/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Lede-Facialist.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba5371fb5e7a66397ad1757/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Lede-Facialist.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Seven skin whisperers, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to guru, told us the products and treatments that keep their complexions in tip-top shape.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "How Top Aestheticians Take Care of Their Skin", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/aesthetician-skin-care-routine-tips"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Seven skin whisperers, including Kim Kardashian West's go-to guru, told us the products and treatments that keep their complexions in tip-top shape.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ba53aa00ac6c654eca1f78b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facialists-skin-care-products-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "How Top Aestheticians Take Care of Their Skin"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
