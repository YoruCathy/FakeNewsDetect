Mr. Dassey, 28, was convicted of participating with his uncle Steven Avery in the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer in Manitowoc, Wis.\n\nThe 10-part Netflix series by the filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos suggested that police investigators unfairly questioned Mr. Dassey when he was 16 without a lawyer or parent present. He appeared scared and unaware of the gravity of his situation on camera, and his lawyers say he had a low IQ in the seventh percentile of children his age, making him susceptible to suggestion.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not offer a reasoning for its decision.\n\nIn a statement, Laura Nirider, a lawyer for Mr. Dassey, said, \u201cWe will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Victor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/brendan-dassey-supreme-court.html", "title": "Supreme Court Won\u2019t Hear Appeal of \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Subject Brendan Dassey", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-06-25T18:09:22.000Z", "modified": "2019-10-02T15:27:24.505Z", "section": "U.S.", "tag": "Making a Murderer (TV Program)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005973787, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1b34aa46-b5c9-522e-a153-4d5682665c3f", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/3cc65c01b284403db8af72999d623bd3", "description": "Lawyers for Mr. Dassey, whose murder conviction was documented in the 2015 Netflix series, say investigators improperly coerced his confession.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Daniel Victor", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Confessions,Decisions and Verdicts,Supreme Court;SCOTUS,Brendan Dassey,Teresa Halbach,Manitowoc,Steven Avery,Making a Murderer", "pdate": 20180625, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/brendan-dassey-supreme-court.html", "type": "article", "title": "Supreme Court Won\u2019t Hear Appeal of \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Subject Brendan Dassey", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Brendan Dassey in court in 2007.
