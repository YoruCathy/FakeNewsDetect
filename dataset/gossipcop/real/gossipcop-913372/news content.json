News after closing the Anna Sui fashion show with her sister Bella Hadid.\n\n\"I've loved my body when I was just diagnosed and I loved [it] going through it and I love my body now,\u201d the 22-year-old model said backstage at the show. \u201cIt's just about everyone accepting their body as it matures and knowing that it's not always going to look the same and you can love yourself in all different sizes.\"\n\nHadid added that she\u2019s speaking about her battle with the autoimmune disease because \u201ca lot of people can connect with it.\u201d\n\nGIGI HADID HITS BACK AT CRITICS CALLING HER 'TOO SKINNY' AT NEW YORK FASHION WEEK\n\nThe supermodel revealed in December 2016 she was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, which affects the thyroid gland. In a series of tweets on Sunday, Hadid said she would \u201cnot further explain\u201d her weight after several people commented about her skinny frame at fashion week.\n\n\u201cFor those of you so determined to come up w why my body has changed over the years, you may not know that when I started @ 17 I was not yet diagnosed w/Hashimoto\u2019s disease; those of u who called me \u2018too big for the industry\u2019 were seeing inflammation & water retention due to that,\u201d Hadid tweeted Sunday night.\n\nHadid also said she prefers not to use drugs, but underwent a holistic medical trial to help balance her thyroid levels.\n\nShe added, \u201cI will not further explain the way my body looks, just as anyone, with a body type that doesnt suit ur \u2018beauty\u2019 expectation, shouldnt have to. Not to judge others, but drugs are not my thing, stop putting me in that box just because u dont understand the way my body has matured.\u201d\n\nHadid concluded by asking social media users to empathize with people before criticizing them. She said the public should use energy to \u201clift those that you admire.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/270/152/Jana-Kramer-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/Gwyneth-Paltrow-GETTY-cropped.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/LA-Premiere-of-5EThe-G_Admi.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/rtx4u5eo.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/270/152/Brad-Paisley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/rtx4u5eo.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/rtx4u5eo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
