The airy look was by Off-White, and the model fittingly brought designer Virgil Abloh as her date to the fashionable f\u00eate.\n\nHer gauzy ensemble didn't quite fit with the theme for the evening (\"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"), but it did turn heads for a surprising reason: it's seriously reminiscent of the look Kim Kardashian wore to last year's event.\n\nBoth sisters rocked dreamy, cream off-the-shoulder ensembles and had their hair parted right down the middle:\n\nGetty Images\n\nKim's dress last year, courtesy of Vivienne Westwood, was also unexpectedly simplistic for the Comme des Gar\u00e7ons-themed occasion. Nevertheless, she slayed\u2014and Kendall did this year, too.\n\nThough her look didn't immediately match the dress code, it was still chock-full of delicate details, like ruched sheer sleeves, which were connected to gloves. The extra touches also appeared in her beauty look, as Jenner appeared to be wearing extensions in an extra-long ponytail.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSome attendees wore luxe, never-ending trains on the red carpet, but Kendall didn't miss out on the fun just because she sported trousers. Even her pant legs came with little trains that cascaded (kind of) on the staircase.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe twinning moment between Kim and Kendall comes as a surprise, since it's usually Kim and Kylie whose styles are deemed similar for their body-hugging silhouettes and neutral color palettes. But this just shows how versatile the Kardashian-Jenner wardrobes can be.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/red-carpet-dresses/a20271696/kendall-jenner-channels-kim-kardashian-met-gala-2018/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Channels Kim Kardashian at the 2018 Met Gala", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Kendall Jenner Just Channeled Kim Kardashian's Met Gala Look from Last Year", "description": "It runs in the family.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/red-carpet-dresses/a20271696/kendall-jenner-channels-kim-kardashian-met-gala-2018/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-05-08 01:52:01", "published_time": "2018-05-08 01:44:00", "section": "Red Carpet Dresses", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Kendall Jenner Channels Kim Kardashian at the 2018 Met Gala", "description": "On the Met Gala red carpet, Kendall Jenner wore a look reminiscent of Kim Kardashian's little white dress from last year's ceremony.", "keywords": "kendall jenner, kendall jenner kim kardashian, kendall jenner met gala, kendall jenner style, kim kardashian, kim kardashian met gala, met gala, met gala 2018, met gala red carpet, off-white, vivienne westwood", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,red-carpet-dresses,vivienne westwood,kendall jenner kim kardashian,kim kardashian met gala,kendall jenner met gala,met gala 2018,Off White,kendall jenner style,met gala red carpet,Kendall Jenner,met gala,kim kardashian", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-08T01:44:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-met-gala-kendall-jenner-kim-kardashian-index-1525740855.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kendall Jenner Just Channeled Kim Kardashian's Met Gala Look from Last Year", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525715040.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
