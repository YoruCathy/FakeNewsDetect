Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn\u2019t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed from blue to yellow to green to gone, I will be healthy.\u201d\n\nBut her condition took a turn after the Met Gala, and she thanked fans for their support after her hospital stay.\n\n\u201cThank you for all the love & concern that\u2019s been pouring in since Tuesday,\u201d Dunham wrote on Instagram. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m much healthier than I was a year ago, complications arose from my most recent endometriosis surgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be proud of those Met Gala pics \u2014 not just because I felt beautiful, surrounded by art and magic, hugging my best friend tightly, but because they\u2019re evidence that women contain steely multitudes.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20172'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F03%2Flena-dunham3-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1166&h=610&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F03%2Flena-dunham3-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1166&h=610&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F03%2Flena-dunham3-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/bodies/lena-dunham-cancels-lenny-tour-endometriosis-complications/", "title": "Lena Dunham Cancels Lenny Tour Due to Endometriosis Complications", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bodies,Bodies News,Celebrity Bodies,Fitness & Health,Health,Lena Dunham,Medical Conditions,News,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Bodies,Bodies News,Celebrity Bodies,Fitness & Health,Health,Lena Dunham,Medical Conditions,News,TV Watch", "description": "Lena Dunham cancelled her planned Lenny tour across the country due to her endometriosis surgery complications", "og": {"title": "Lena Dunham Cancels Lenny Tour Due to Endometriosis Complications", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/lena-dunham-cancels-lenny-tour-endometriosis-complications/", "description": "Lena Dunham regretfully announced that she has to cancel her planned Lenny speaking tour across the country due to complications from her endometriosis surgery.
