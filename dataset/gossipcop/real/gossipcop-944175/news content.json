During his first engagement to Tristan Prettyman in 2011 (they later broke it off six months later), the then-couple vowed to not tie the knot until gay marriage became legal. He was also the first-ever straight man on the cover of Instinct magazine in 2012, recognized for his efforts in support of LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe singer eventually went on to marry his girlfriend, Christina Carano, in October 2015, once same-sex marriage became legal in the U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, the Waitress actor also released his new single, \"Unlonely,\" which will be featured on his upcoming album, Know, set to be released on Aug.10.\n\nFor more on Mraz, watch below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJason Mraz Finds Making His Broadway Debut in \u2018Waitress\u2019 Less Grueling Than Going on Tour (Exclusive)\n\nJason Mraz Surprises 'America's Got Talent' Winner Grace VanderWaal -- See Her Amazing Reaction!\n\nJason Mraz Gets Secretly Married -- See the Stunning Wedding Pic!\n\nJason Mraz Marries Longtime Love Christina Carano in Secret Ceremony This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
