Rebecca Hall, Timothee Chalamet and, reportedly, Selena Gomez have all donated their salaries from Allen's A Rainy Day In New York to the Time's Up campaign. Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page have also saidthey regret working with the film-maker.\n\nTheir actions come amid a Hollywood movement against sexual harassment, exploitation and assault, which began with the Harvey Weinstein scandal in October 2017. Allen's adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, published an open letter in December 2017, reiterating claims that Allen sexual assaulted her when she was seven-years-old - a claim he has consistently denied. Allen was also never found guilty of child sex abuse.\n\nYesterday, Farrow gave her first televised interview on CBS This Morning again detailing her account of the alleged sexual assault. Allen has since responded, repeating his denial. In a new statement given to CBS, he also accused the Farrow family of \u201ccynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time\u2019s Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation\u201d.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/sites/harpersbazaar/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/clo9n-firth-1516353699.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ellen-page-1516277571.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.756xh;0,0.0660xh&resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/clo9n-firth-1516353699.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ella Alexander"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a15396451/colin-firth-wont-work-with-woody-allen-again/", "title": "Colin Firth vows never to work with Woody Allen again", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Colin Firth vows never to work with Woody Allen again", "description": "The actor is the latest to distance himself from the controversial director", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/culture/culture-news/a15396451/colin-firth-wont-work-with-woody-allen-again/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/clo9n-firth-1516353699.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 214308048603671}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/harpersbazaaruk", "modified_time": "2018-03-27 10:09:08", "published_time": "2018-01-19 11:39:00", "section": "Culture News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@BazaarUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/clo9n-firth-1516353699.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Colin Firth vows never to work with Woody Allen again", "description": "\u200bColin Firth\u200b says he will never work with Woody Allen\u200b again.
