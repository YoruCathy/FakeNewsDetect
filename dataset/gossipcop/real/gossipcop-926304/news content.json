I just feel like I\u2019ve been letting people down for some reason. I feel guilty [by having anxiety]. Obviously, my meds aren\u2019t working. I have to force myself to get in the shower and put makeup on.\u201d\n\nTyler, who has also struggled with depression, expressed his self-doubt, telling Catelynn, \u201cIt\u2019s gotta be something with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! It has nothing to do with you Tyler. It\u2019s my inner childhood s\u2014,\u201d Catelynn told him. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, it\u2019s nothing to do with what you do. It\u2019s me being a f\u2014\u2014 12-year-old and my dad leaving or me being 8 and my mom drinking all the time and not being there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my own s\u2014, it\u2019s just coming out with thing going on in life. It\u2019s nothing to do with you, you\u2019re awesome, you\u2019re supportive,\u201d she continued.\n\nCatelynn added that she was certain she needed to seek treatment again as Tyler looked at her and struggled to keep a supportive front.\n\nRELATED: Pregnancies, Arrests and Heartbreak: A Guide to All the Teen Mom Stars You Should Know\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even want to tell you that I was going back,\u201d Catelynn said. \u201cI just thought, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t blame Tyler, like seriously, if you wanted to just divorce me.\u2019 I put you through so much. You\u2019re an awesome husband, seriously, to stand by me through all this s\u2014. I\u2019m sure a lot of guys would just throw in the f\u2014\u2014 towel.\u201d\n\nTyler hugged her and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think those guys are true husbands. I\u2019m not ever leaving, I\u2019m not going anywhere. Don\u2019t think like that.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nCatelynn Baltierra\n\nLater, the father of two told his sister, Amber, that he felt as though \u201csomething was off\u201d with Catelynn when she announced her desire to return to rehab.\n\n\u201cIt was just unexpected what she told me. Like we\u2019re there? We\u2019re there. I thought we were at more like, \u2018Hey, I need to do therapy three times a week instead of one,\u2019 \u201d said Tyler.\n\nAmber agreed with him, saying outpatient treatment would be the \u201cnormal thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just jump the gun and get on a plane and go to Arizona. You really [have to] try to do the outpatient [therapy],\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED: Teen Mom\u2018s Tyler Baltierra Says He Feels \u2018Empty\u2019 and \u2018Alone\u2019 as Wife Catelynn Sleeps by His Side\n\n\u201cI just wasn\u2019t expecting that. It\u2019s kind of pissed me off a little bit only because there wasn\u2019t like a process of, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s figure this out.\u2019 I felt like she did not weigh any options,\u201d Tyler said.\n\nHe added that his concern for their 3-year-old daughter Novalee Reign was a major reason why he was resisting the idea of Catelynn leaving again so soon.\n\nImage zoom\n\nTyler Baltierra\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more or less like, dude, our kid, our kid. Does that even cross in your head at all?\u201d he said. \u201cMy opinion, as her father, is that outpatient [treatment] is what\u2019s best for her and inpatient [treatment] is what\u2019s best for you. And [Catelynn] looked at me and said she\u2019ll manage.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

What do you mean she\u2019ll manage?\u201d he said about his daughter Nova. \u201cShe\u2019s f\u2014\u2014 3, she can\u2019t manage nothing. It reminds me exactly of what dad said to us when we were kids.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Tyler Baltierra Champions Wife Catelynn as She Enters Treatment\n\n\u201cI just think this whole miscarriage thing really f\u2014\u2013 her head up,\u201d Amber explained. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s just really intimidated and really scared that she can\u2019t talk to you or open up.\u201d\n\nTyler shook his head at Amber\u2019s reasoning, and said, \u201cWell, then maybe [Catelynn] should not be with me. Maybe I\u2019m not the right guy for [her] is what I\u2019m saying.
