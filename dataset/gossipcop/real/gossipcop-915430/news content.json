To make sure she has the option, she goes through the egg freezing process, which includes hormone shots that make her crazy emotional.\n\n\u201cI just feel like this is for safety,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope that going through all of this is worth it. I don\u2019t want to put my body through something like this again. The emotions of it all are just a lot.\u201d\n\nShe and ex Scott Disick have three children together: Mason, Penelope, and Reign. They are adorable, and sometimes they wear matching pajamas. Case in point:\n\nDuring the preview, she shows her two friends all the bruising on her stomach from the injections, and it looks v painful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so up and down emotional,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like crazy. I feel like I want to jump out of my skin. I\u2019m so crazy, I can\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nShe did the shots while she was still dating Younes Bendjima, and she explains that the rollercoaster of the process had an impact on their relationship and made Younes think he was the problem.\n\n\u201cThe injections themselves weren\u2019t really a big deal because I have a really high pain tolerance,\u201d she says in a confessional after the fact. \u201cBut I think everything was just really heightened. Some days I would feel so anxious. it\u2019s just very emotional, so that I think is the hard part.\u201d\n\nSounds miserable, TBH. I guess the big question now is...will Scott be the father? Because that's Kim's evil plan apparently, LOL.\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=1.00xw:0.513xh;0,0.148xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=1.00xw:0.513xh;0,0.148xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Baty", "Emma Baty Is The Associate Entertainment Editor At Cosmopolitan Who Focuses On Movies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a25359188/kourtney-kardashian-kids-egg-freezing/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Freezes Eggs So She Can Have More Kids", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Just Said Having More Kids Isn't off the Table", "description": "Hello, yes, Scott Disick??", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a25359188/kourtney-kardashian-kids-egg-freezing/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=1.00xw:0.513xh;0,0.148xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-11-30 05:31:54", "published_time": "2018-11-30 04:52:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=1.00xw:0.513xh;0,0.148xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian Freezes Eggs So She Can Have More Kids", "description": "In a preview for the upcoming episode of \ufeffKUWTK\ufeff, \ufeffKourtney Kardashian talks about potentially wanting more kids some day.", "keywords": "kourtney kardashian, kourtney, kuwtk, kourtney and scott, kourtney kardashian egg freezing, kourtney kardashian kids, mason, reign, penelope, kuwtk season 15", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=0.979xw:1.00xh;0.0112xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs", "sailthru.date": "2018-11-30T16:52:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=1.00xw:0.513xh;0,0.148xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-11-30-at-11-15-37-am-1543594546.png?crop=0.979xw:1.00xh;0.0112xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kourtney Kardashian Just Said Having More Kids Isn't off the Table", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543524720.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
