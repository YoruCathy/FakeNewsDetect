The show announced on Tuesday that it\u2019s found a permanent replacement for longtime host Aisha Tyler, who exited the series last season.\n\nAfter a brief guest-hosting stint in October, the daytime talk series has decided to make Grammy-winning artist Eve Jeffers Cooper, known to her fans simply as \u201cEve,\u201d the fifth co-host for Season 8.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Eve to the table as she brings a fun and fresh perspective to our already diverse panel,\u201d said Angelica McDaniel, CBS\u2019 executive VP of daytime, in a statement. \u201cThe great success of \u2018The Talk\u2019 is due to the undeniable chemistry and bond of friendship between the hosts. Eve is an accomplished and dynamic performer, musician, wife, and stepmother who fits in seamlessly, while also adding a new layer to the show as we continue to evolve season to season.\u201d\n\nIn June, Aisha Tyler announced that she\u2019d be leaving the show after six years to focus on acting and directing. She\u2019ll continue to appear as a series regular on CBS\u2019 \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d as well as hosting The CW\u2019s revival of \u201cWhose Line Is It Anyway?\u201d She also does a voice on the FX comedy \u201cArcher.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of them told me that they believed in me, and I believe in them,\u201d she told People ahead of her last show in August. \u201cThese women made me feel brave, they made me feel bold and energized and ready to pursue my dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Talk\u201d has had a difficult year since Tyler left. Unlike its counterpart, \u201cThe View\u201d which sees hosts change regularly, the panel has remained relatively similar for years with hosts Julie Chen, Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osbourne and Sheryl Underwood. However, in an effort to find a replacement for Tyler, the series saw stars like Shemar Moore, Chris O\u2019Donnell, Eric Christian Olsen and Wilmer Valderrama fill in the host chair temporarily.\n\n\u201cIt is a new career move for me,\u201d Eve tells Variety. \u201cI am interested in hosting, and specifically on this show, because I feel as though I can express myself in a way people haven\u2019t seen me before, and be able to engage in great discussions [and] have some fun,\u201d Eve told Variety. \u201cI\u2019m just in a place in my life where I was looking for a platform to express myself.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ronnie-wood-mick-jagger-keith-richards-rolling-stones.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/evethetalk1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20110019543582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/evethetalk1.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/evethetalk1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/the-talk-sees-panel-shakeup-as-eve-replaces-aisha-tyler", "title": "'The Talk' sees panel shakeup as Eve replaces Aisha Tyler", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The table on CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Talk\u201d is shaking up once again.
