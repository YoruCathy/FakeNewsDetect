It\u2019s the great time machine of human emotion, with the power to turn the past into the present, the present into the past, and time itself into something timeless. \u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d a sequel set 30 years after the first film, isn\u2019t the immortal children\u2019s movie that the singular, luminous, slightly screw-loose Disney original was. Yet it\u2019s a rapturous piece of nostalgia \u2014 a film that devotes itself, in every madly obsessive frame, to making you feel happy in the guileless way a movie still could back in 1964.\n\nDirected by Rob Marshall, it\u2019s a lavishly high-spirited and, at times, nearly fetishistic recreation of a \u201960s studio-back-lot musical, with cobblestone-streets-of-London sets that look like sets, dance numbers driven by a touch of Gene Kelly athletic-hoofer exuberance, and, more than that, a tone of whimsical sincerity that even the most innocent children\u2019s films of today are a tad too slick and jaded to try for. From the opening moments, when Lin-Manuel Miranda, as Jack the cockney lamplighter, raises his puppy-dog eyes and pure-heart grin to sing \u201c(Underneath the) Lovely London Sky,\u201d you\u2019ll likely find yourself in the grip of the film\u2019s old-is-new, stodgy-is-soulful elation.\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a paradox built into \u201cMary Poppins Returns.\u201d Nearly everything in the film is designed to evoke a song, a visual flourish, or a story detail from the original \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d So in more ways than you can count, it\u2019s \u201cjust like\u201d the earlier film. But, of course, when you first watched \u201cMary Poppins\u201d (and I\u2019m old enough to have seen it when it came out \u2014 in fact, I saw it five times), you weren\u2019t thinking, \u201cLook! It\u2019s just like that classic we love so much!\u201d Nostalgia, in \u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d is a transporting emotion, yet the movie is as calculated a piece of re-enactment as \u201cThe Force Awakens.\u201d Even as it throws off sparkles of sweetness and light and vaudeville fairy dust, the more the movie mimics \u201cMary Poppins\u201d the less it can be \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d\n\nBut what it can be is something else: a 1960s movie, cleansed of shadow, improbably delivered into the present day. \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d doesn\u2019t have to replace \u201cMary Poppins\u201d in our affection to be more than a spoonful of sugar. The movie overflows with delirious good vibes. And the key to what works about it is that it lets you access and celebrate something that\u2019s deeply square. The songs are square (though frankly, while good enough, not nearly as timeless as the Sherman brothers\u2019 classics from the earlier film), the orchestrations are square (and, in fact, brilliantly retro), the plot is square, the whole look of the movie is square, and when Michael Banks (Ben Whishaw), the boy from \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d now grown up with three children of his own, stands in the attic of the Banks townhouse singing \u201cA Conversation\u201d (addressed to his late wife), the tear that will roll down your cheek is square. This is lump-in-the-throat filmmaking that feels like an antidote to every bad thought you had in 2018.\n\nOf course, many of the children who see \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d will have no knowledge of the original. And it\u2019s a mark of the film\u2019s ingenuity that it will seem enthralling \u2014 and, in its way, exotic \u2014 to them. It takes panache to make a movie as defiantly corny and stylistically out-of-date as this one and not have it feel stilted, and Marshall has staged \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d with great care and skill; it\u2019s easily the best thing he\u2019s done since \u201cChicago.\u201d Marshall, in his way, taps deeply into the time-machine spirit of the thing.\n\nSo how is Emily Blunt? Gliding down from the clouds, she\u2019s practically perfect in every way, though let\u2019s be clear that of all the things in the original \u201cMary Poppins\u201d that can\u2019t be entirely duplicated, the first and foremost is Julie Andrews\u2019 incandescent sparkle of benevolence. Andrews, in her way, may be the most snobbishly underrated movie star of the 20th century, because in just two films (\u201cMary Poppins\u201d and \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d), she did more to turn goodness into a mythological force than any actress since Lillian Gish. Emily Blunt has a slightly more acerbic presence. Her Mary possesses the same tartly irresistible combination of qualities we remember: She\u2019s an angel, a disciplinarian, a devotee of the imagination, a tutor of delight, and also a bit vain (she spends a little more time than she should throwing glances at mirrors).\n\nBut Andrews had a smile that lit up the world, and Blunt, in her gleeful and slightly devious way, is more circumspect; you would much more want to see the soap opera of this Mary Poppins\u2019 life (and could, in fact, imagine it existing). Yet Blunt inhabits Mary Poppins\u2019 snappishly entrancing spirit, and in the musical numbers she generates her own spit-spot radiance. She initiates the Banks children into the world of imagination by inviting them to dive into the bathtub and out the other side (resulting in a snazzy underwater fantasia), and the film gets totally rolling when she, Jack, and the kids literally enter the surface of their mother\u2019s cracked decorative bowl, leading to an updated version of the live-action-meets-drawn-cartoon sequence of \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d which is wonderfully executed here, hitting that same note of colliding daffiness.\n\nJust about every song in \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d has a 1964 antecedent. \u201cCan You Imagine That?,\u201d the bathtub-into-the-ocean number, echoes \u201cA Spoonful of Sugar,\u201d and once the characters arrive in animation land the tongue-twisting \u201cThe Royal Doulton Music Hall\u201d is the film\u2019s nod to \u201cSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\u201d Later on, the lamplighters join in a ladder-and-torch chorus of \u201cTrip a Little Light Fantastic\u201d that\u2019s the film\u2019s equivalent to \u201cStep in Time,\u201d and the finale, \u201cNowhere to Go But Up,\u201d is \u201cLet\u2019s Go Fly a Kite\u201d with human-levitating balloons. Meryl Streep, in a triumphant scene, shows up as Mary\u2019s cousin, who resembles a gypsy version of the Mad Hatter and sings a song called \u201cTurning Turtle\u201d in a voice that sounds like Madame Blavatsky meets \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d Now that\u2019s showbiz.\n\nThe story has an elegant heart-tug simplicity. Michael, an aspiring artist who\u2019s been working as a bank teller at Fidelity Fiduciary and raising his kids with the help of his sister, Jane (Emily Mortimer), learns that the Banks house along the cozy half circle of Cherry Tree Lane is about to be repossessed. The home-equity loan he took out needs to be paid back in five days, and Michael\u2019s only hope is to find the lost record of the bank shares his father got for him. (Colin Firth, as the dastardly and secretly smirking Fidelity executive Mr. Wilkins, pretends to help.) So this is yet another tale of \u201csaving Mr. Banks.\u201d Except that Whishaw\u2019s Michael, who rather disarmingly resembles Charlie Chaplin, is a softie who turns into a hard case only because he\u2019s terrified of losing everything.\n\nAt two hours and 10 minutes, \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d is a bit long, yet just when you think it\u2019s flagging, which for me was during the \u201cTrip a Little Light Fantastic\u201d number (sorry, but I never loved \u201cStep in Time\u201d that much either), Marshall pulls it all together with a sensational sequence in which Jack and his fellow leeries scale Big Ben to slow down the clock by five minutes. When Miranda\u2019s Jack is hovering over the city, and Mary comes to the rescue via her umbrella, the entire movie soars. And that\u2019s before Dick Van Dyke shows up for a cameo sharp enough to remind you of the life force he was in \u201cMary Poppins.\u201d \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d never stops looking back. That\u2019s the film\u2019s essential quality \u2014 its majestic cornball MO. Yet in recreating, with so much meticulous love, the sensory and emotional contact high of \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d the movie does something that points forward instead of back. It says: What if we could actually feel this way now? Maybe we could come out the other side.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mary-poppins-returns-teaser.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mary-poppins-returns-teaser.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Freviews%2Fmary-poppins-returns-review-emily-blunt-1203085530%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1203085530&comment_count=25", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mary-poppins-returns-teaser.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Owen Gleiberman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/mary-poppins-returns-review-emily-blunt-1203085530/", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Emily Blunt is practically perfect in a 'Mary Poppins' sequel that uncannily recreates the studio-system sincerity of the original.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1203085530, "author": "Owen Gleiberman", "pmc-category": "Reviews", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-12-12T09:00:46"}, "pmc-tag": "Emily Blunt,Lin-manuel Miranda,Mary Poppins,Mary Poppins Returns", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film", "pmc-primary-category": "Reviews", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/mary-poppins-returns-review-emily-blunt-1203085530/", "description": "Nostalgia is a quaint word, one that summons visions of things that are toasty, comfy, wholesome, reassuring \u2014 all qualities, as it happens, that we associate with the 1964 Walt Disney nanny-from-h\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mary-poppins-returns-teaser.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) returns to the Banks\u2019 home in Disney\u2019s original musical, MARY POPPINS RETURNS, a sequel to the 1964 MARY POPPINS  which takes audiences on an entirely new adventure with the practically perfect nanny and the Banks family."}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-12T17:00:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-19T17:22:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@OwenGleiberman", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "Film Review: \u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mary-poppins-returns-teaser.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "Mary Poppins (Emily Blunt) returns to the Banks\u2019 home in Disney\u2019s original musical, MARY POPPINS RETURNS, a sequel to the 1964 MARY POPPINS  which takes audiences on an entirely new adventure with the practically perfect nanny and the Banks family."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Film Review: \u2018Mary Poppins Returns\u2019", "description": "Emily Blunt is practically perfect in a 'Mary Poppins' sequel that uncannily recreates the studio-system sincerity of the original."}, "author": "Owen Gleiberman", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1203085530, "title": "Film Review: 'Mary Poppins Returns'", "published_at": "2018-12-12 09:00:46", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mary-poppins-returns-teaser.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 25, "tags": "Mary Poppins Returns", "topics": "Reviews", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "Nostalgia is a quaint word, one that summons visions of things that are toasty, comfy, wholesome, reassuring \u2014 all qualities, as it happens, that we associate with the 1964 Walt Disney nanny-from-heaven musical \"Mary Poppins.\" Yet nostalgia can also be a magical thing.
