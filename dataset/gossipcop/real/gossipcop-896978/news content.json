Uh, maybe not use hurricane because so many people are being affected right now. But the best place is right in the middle of the pain.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s where we were sitting. And it was uncomfortable. And we had a lot of conversations,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know. [I was] really proud of the music she made, and she was really proud of the art I released. And, you know, at the end of the day we really have a healthy respect for one another\u2019s craft. I think she\u2019s amazing. You know, most people walk away, and like divorce rate is like 50 percent or something \u2019cause most people can\u2019t see themselves. The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone\u2019s face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cSo, you know, most people don\u2019t want to do that. You don\u2019t want to look inside yourself. And so you walk away.\u201d\n\nOn the title track of his album, Jay-Z, who shares kids Blue Ivy, 5, and 5-month-old twins Sir and Rumi with the singer, rapped, \u201c\u2018You did what with who?\u2019 / What good is a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois when you have a soulmate? / \u2018You risked that for Blue?\u2019\u201d The rapper, whose real name is Shawn Carter, also references his wife\u2019s 2016 hit song \u201cSorry,\u201d in which she tells a cheating man to \u201ccall Becky with the good hair.\u201d In a seemingly direct response to the lyric, Jay-Z mentions the same name in his song \u201cFamily Feud.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll f\u2013k up a good thing if you let me / Let me alone, Becky. A man that don\u2019t take care his family can\u2019t be rich,\u201d he says.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jay-z-beyonce.jpg?crop=54px%2C0px%2C1665px%2C874px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jay-z-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jay-z-beyonce.jpg?crop=54px%2C0px%2C1665px%2C874px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jay-z-listening-to-beyonces-lemonade-was-very-uncomfortable/", "title": "Jay-Z: Listening to Beyonce\u2019s \u2018Lemonade\u2019 Was \u2018Very Uncomfortable\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jay-Z discussed opening up about his marriage on his \u20184:44\u2019 album in a new interview \u2013 find out what he said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jay-Z: Listening to Beyonce\u2019s \u2018Lemonade\u2019 Was \u2018Very Uncomfortable\u2019", "description": "Jay-Z discussed opening up about his marriage on his \u20184:44\u2019 album in a new interview \u2013 find out what he said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jay-z-listening-to-beyonces-lemonade-was-very-uncomfortable/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:13:53+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jay-z-beyonce.jpg?crop=54px%2C0px%2C1665px%2C874px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jay-z-beyonce.jpg?crop=54px%2C0px%2C1665px%2C874px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-29T23:22:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:13:53+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jay-Z discussed opening up about his marriage on his \u20184:44\u2019 album in a new interview \u2013 find out what he said", "title": "Jay-Z: Listening to Beyonce\u2019s \u2018Lemonade\u2019 Was \u2018Very Uncomfortable\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jay-z-beyonce.jpg?crop=54px%2C0px%2C1665px%2C874px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511997722.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
