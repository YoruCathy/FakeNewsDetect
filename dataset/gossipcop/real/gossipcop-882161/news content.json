The devastation is beyond belief,\u201d said 48-year-old Lopez from her dressing room at her Las Vegas residency.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

New York, to Puerto Rican parents, reminded fans that the island had already been hit hard by Hurricane Irma before Hurricane Maria ravaged it, demolishing homes and killing at least 2 people.\n\n\"What\u2019s foremost on my mind and many others is trying to figure out the best way to help,\" she said. \"Puerto Rico has been hit by two of the most devastating hurricane we have ever seen \u2014 Irma and Maria.\"\n\nJ.Lo then urged fans to donate to relief efforts organized by Beatriz Areizaga, the First Lady of Puerto Rico. \"Together we can help rebuild our island, and the Caribbean,\" she said.\n\nJust prior to sharing the video, the mom of two reposted a similar video made by her ex-husband, Marc Anthony, who also called on fans to help.\n\nTo donate to relief efforts
