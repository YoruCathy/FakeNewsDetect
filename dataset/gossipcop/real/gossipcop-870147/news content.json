In May, she shared another topless photo on Instagram and revealed that she thinks \u201cbeing naked is part of what makes us human.\u201d\n\n\"I'll say it again for those questioning what I stand for and how I express myself. Nudity started as a movement for \u2018going back to nature\u2019, \u2018expressing freedom\u2019, \u2018being healthier\u2019 and was even called a philosophy. Being naked is part of what makes us human,\" Jackson wrote. \"For me, it helps me feel more connected to mama gaia. I'm usually naked when i garden.\"\n\n\"It's actually a beautiful thing and you don't have to make it sexual the way many Hollywood stars (and the media) do,\" she continued. \"Not only is your body a temple and should be worshiped as so, but also part of feminism is being able to express yourself in your own way, whether it's being conservative and wearing lots of clothes or showing yourself.\"\n\n\n\nRELATED: Paris Jackson Dresses Way Down at MTV Movie & TV Awards -- See the Look!\n\n\n\n\"The human body is a beautiful thing and no matter what 'flaws' you have, whether it be scars, or extra weight, stretch marks, freckles, whatever, it is beautiful and you should express yourself however you feel comfortable,\" Jackson said. \"If this makes some of you upset I completely understand and I encourage you to maybe no longer follow me, but I cannot apologize for this in any way. It is who I am and I refuse to shy away and keep my beliefs a secret.\"\n\nHear more in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-01/1280_paris_jackson_631284140_010917.jpg?itok=-0cJG117", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_paris_jackson_631284140_010917.jpg?itok=TdFGS1QT"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_paris_jackson_631284140_010917.jpg?itok=TdFGS1QT", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hillary Bautch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/222648_paris_jackson_goes_topless_during_spiritual_retreat", "title": "Paris Jackson Goes Topless During Spiritual Retreat", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Paris Jackson Goes Topless During Spiritual Retreat | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/222648_paris_jackson_goes_topless_during_spiritual_retreat", "title": "Paris Jackson Goes Topless During Spiritual Retreat", "description": "The 19-year-old model isn't afraid to show her body.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_paris_jackson_631284140_010917.jpg?itok=TdFGS1QT", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 19-year-old model isn't afraid to show her body.", "title": "Paris Jackson Goes Topless During Spiritual Retreat", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Hillary Bautch", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/222648_paris_jackson_goes_topless_during_spiritual_retreat", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_paris_jackson_631284140_010917.jpg?itok=TdFGS1QT"}, "description": "The 19-year-old model isn't afraid to show her body.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Paris Jackson", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
