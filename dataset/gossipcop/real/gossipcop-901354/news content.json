Photo: Getty Images\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry have just wrapped up their first official royal tour (as parents-to-be), which entailed 16 days of traveling across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga for diplomatic (and also apparently fashion) purposes.\n\nLuckily for us, the royal couple attended more than 70 engagements total during their tour, with Meghan wearing around 30 different ensembles over the course of the trip. Fittingly, as soon as Meghan and Prince Harry landed in Sydney on October 15, the Duchess of Sussex immediately drew even more attention than usual with her sartorial choices \u2014 although in fairness, she was carrying binders at first, which was confusing.\n\nBut with so many events, outfit changes, and of course, her pregnancy, all eyes were on Meghan. Here\u2019s a look at all of Meghan\u2019s outfits from the tour.\n\nMeghan landed in Sydney on October 15 in a black-and-maroon jacket, black heels, a black turtleneck, and black tailored pants (and binders).\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry in Sydney.

Crew, and perhaps most notably, a $145 gray blazer from her friend Serena Williams\u2019s line.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry.

At the time, though, the pics of the dress were taken from far away, so this appearance was our first clear image of the navy Antonio Berardi dress.\n\nMeghan Markle.
