A Duggar family spokesperson told E! News exclusively that Jessa is not pregnant.\n\nEarlier this week, a report from In Touch reported that Jessa was four months along and would be making an announcement in April, according to an anonymous source. It should be noted no one in the Duggar family confirmed that report.\n\nAs it turns out, Jessa and Ben are too busy parenting their two kids, Henry, 13 months, and Spurgeon, 2, to think about more kids.\n\n\"Right now we have two kids and there\u2019s two of us, so it\u2019s man-to-man coverage. When we have more, we\u2019ll have to switch it up to a zone defense!\u201d Ben joked to PEOPLE magazine last year, with Jessa adding that they may be expanding their family in non-biological method\n\n\"It will be a little while since we just had a baby, but adopting and fostering to adopt is very much in our hearts,\" Jessa said.\n\nSome fans think they are \"overdue\" for another pregnancy and even insisted that Ben's hand placement on Jessa's stomach in a Duggar family photo signified that baby number three was on the way.\n\nIn the photo, Ben is seemingly cradling Jessa's stomach \u2014 and paired with a loose-fitting dress, fans are convinced that Jessa is sporting what would be her third baby bump.\n\n\"So when will Jessa be making her announcement too? She totally looks preggers too!\" a fan commented on Facebook.\n\nMeanwhile, Jessa's sister, Jinger (Duggar) Vuolo is expecting her first child with husband Jeremy Vuolo, with Kendra Caldwell and Joe Duggar welcoming their first baby as well. Plus, Joy-Anna (Duggar) and Austin Forsyth already welcomed their first child in February.\n\nIn February, Jinger shared an 18-week baby bump update on Instagram, revealing that baby Vuolo is about the size of a bell pepper.\n\nJinger and husband Jeremy Vuolo first announced they were expecting their first child together in January, revealing soon after their July 2018 due date. The couple was married in November 2016.", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2018/03/16/jessa-duggar-seewald-not-pregnant-counting-on-ben-seewald/", "title": "Jessa Duggar Not Pregnant With Baby No. 3", "meta_data": {"description": "The Duggar family is setting the record straight on a rumor buzzing around the internet.Jessa (Duggar) and husband Ben Seewald are not expecting their third child, despite earlier reports.
