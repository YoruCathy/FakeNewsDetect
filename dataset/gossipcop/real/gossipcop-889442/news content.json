Proceed at your own risk.\n\nIf you spent last weekend binge-watching Stranger Things 2 instead of going to Halloween parties, you\u2019re not alone. Buzz around the second installment of Netflix\u2019s nostalgic sci-fi hit has been building steadily since last summer, leading some to question whether season 2 could possibly live up to the hype. But judging by the new episodes\u2019 critical acclaim and record-breaking social media impact, it seems the Duffer brothers have done it again \u2014 and that includes the costumes.\n\n\u201cWe definitely felt the pressure to make sure whatever we did was up to par,\u201d says costume designer Kim Wilcox, who was tasked with taking over the sartorial world built by Kimberly Adams-Galligan and Malgosia Turzanska in season 1. Her first order of business? Brightening up the show\u2019s wardrobe a bit.\n\n\u201cI wanted to infuse more of the colors of the early \u201980s,\u201d she says, \u201cso while we kept a lot of that earthy palette \u2014 the tans and browns and blues \u2014 we also added in some pastels and slightly poppier colors. The tones are a little happier-looking.\u201d\n\nEven though the events of Stranger Things 2 are, for the most part, anything but happy. Below, Wilcox discusses Eleven\u2019s Madonna-inspired punk makeover, Max\u2019s California skater-girl style, the joys of dressing Bob, and much more.\n\nWhat was your biggest costume challenge heading into Stranger Things 2?\n\nFiguring out what Eleven would wear after the pink dress was something that the Duffers and I spent a lot of time thinking about. It\u2019s such an iconic look that Kimberly created, and you see it in flashbacks throughout season 2.\n\nWhen we first find her in Hopper\u2019s (David Harbour) cabin, she\u2019s watching television \u2014 [both] to learn the language and to learn about culture outside of the lab. She hasn\u2019t been a normal child at all; her exposure to the world is through commercials and soaps. So at first, we were like, \u201cIs she into the classic \u201980s girly-girl looks? Would she wear something that felt really feminine?\u201d But when we tried it on, it just felt forced.\n\n[So I started thinking,] how would she have gotten her clothes? In my head, Hopper had been giving her clothes he already had in boxes in his cabin, and then maybe making a run to the next county to go to a thrift store and buy stuff for a boy, as a disguise. When we put all that together, it just made more sense to us. So that\u2019s why Eleven looks the way she does for much of the season; nothing really fits well.\n\nIn episode 7, \u201cThe Lost Sister,\u201d she gets a major makeover, though. How did you settle on the look for \u201cpunk Eleven?\u201d\n\nWell, she\u2019s found this new group of people, and for the first time she can be open about her powers. We wanted her to become part of the gang, to absorb part of that look, to be this rougher person. So half of her costume is still made up of things she would\u2019ve brought with her \u2014 her famous Converse, her socks, her jeans \u2014 but we felt that the top half would\u2019ve been borrowed from the others, and that it\u2019d be fun to combine a torn T-shirt with a tweedier element.\n\nI was looking back to pictures of punks in the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, of photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna in blazers with rolled-up sleeves. Madonna actually stole a lot of her looks from punk and made them her own; I remember going to thrift stores and buying 1960s blazers, rolling the sleeves and popping the collars. You\u2019d put a bandana in your hair, and all of a sudden, you were Madonna!\n\nI was thinking that the jacket might\u2019ve been something they\u2019d found in a warehouse, or stolen from somebody, and then gave to Eleven. The shoulders on the jacket give Millie a much bigger silhouette, too, and for this moment where she\u2019s becoming a more powerful person, it felt appropriate that you\u2019d see that in her silhouette. And wearing a bandana tied around your arm or your ankle as a badge was very popular at that time.\n\nIs that blazer a vintage piece?\n\nWe knew we might need multiples, so we couldn\u2019t use vintage. That\u2019s the thing about working with vintage: You can find the perfect piece, but on a series like this where there\u2019s a lot of action \u2014 and people are growing! \u2014 it gets really tricky. It\u2019s very, very hard to find multiples of vintage clothing.\n\nNancy Wheeler\u2019s amazing sweaters have to be vintage though, right? If not, I must know where to get them!\n\nUnfortunately, those are mostly vintage one-offs that we were lucky enough to either rent or buy. But we actually created the green turtleneck she wears for a large portion of season 2 based off of a vintage piece. We were very lucky to find a similar fabric, because we needed about six multiples of that sweater. We made a lot of her clothes for this season.\n\nIt was nice to take Nancy from skirts to jeans. In season 1, she was very prim and proper; now, she\u2019s trying to keep up this fa\u00e7ade, and it\u2019s just not working for her! The Duffers and I said that she\u2019d probably try to keep up her old look until the party scene \u2014 that\u2019s when she kind of loses it, when her relationship with Steve starts to unravel.\n\nSpeaking of the Halloween party episode, what was it like designing costumes for all those guests?\n\nThere were about 100 people at that high school party, so it was a feat! Plus we had to do costumes for all the younger trick-or-treaters, too. But it was so much fun to look back at the movies and music from that time and say, okay, we need to make a Madonna, we need to make a Terminator... I think there\u2019s a Michael Jackson somewhere in that crowd, too! My crew was really delighted to be able to get crafty and have a little fun.\n\nLet\u2019s switch gears and talk about Billy (Dacre Montgomery), because his look is incredible. What \u2014 or, rather, who \u2014 inspired it?\n\nWith Billy, I wanted to hark back to classic Americana. He\u2019s into hot rods, he drives a Camaro, he\u2019s dangerous \u2014 so how do you show that [through clothing]? I was thinking about Rebel Without a Cause, Johnny Depp in the \u201980s, and Rob Lowe, who was a huge heartthrob at the time.\n\nThat denim-on-denim look can be so sexy; these days, if you don\u2019t do it right, it looks a little silly, but if it\u2019s weathered and fits you perfectly, it can be wonderfully masculine. And the earring is something that Dacre was really adamant about; the idea for that came from this old photo of Rob Lowe that our hair designer had found and was using as inspiration for his mullet. I just love the moment when the Camaro first pulls out, his boot comes out of the car and hits the ground, and all the girls are staring. It\u2019s so \u201980s!\n\nHis jeans must\u2019ve been tailored to within an inch of their life...\n\nActually, they weren\u2019t tailored at all! They\u2019re vintage Levi\u2019s from 1979, very difficult to find. We actually only had one pair for most of the season, and we were terrified they were going to rip. Because, you know, Billy gets into some stuff! But towards the end of the season, I got so lucky: I was looking on eBay and Etsy \u2014 we get a lot of our clothes online \u2014 and I found one more pair! They came, and they fit like a glove. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nHow about Billy\u2019s skateboarding stepsister, Max (Sadie Sink)? I loved her colorful track jackets.\n\nWith Max, I was thinking about what it was like to shop for clothes as a young woman in the early \u201980s. Colors weren\u2019t really divided by gender as much [back then]; it wasn\u2019t this world of pink we\u2019re living in now. I wanted Max to be someone who is an outsider, who\u2019s her own person, who chooses her own clothes and goes for what she likes. She doesn\u2019t fit into a nice little box.\n\nI actually grew up in a beach town myself, and the surfers and skateboarders I knew were really into Hang Ten and Ocean Pacific (Op). So we were riffing off of those brands; the windsurfer sweatshirt we created for her is actually inspired by an Op one we found on Etsy. It\u2019s nice to have someone who can give the boys a run for their money. She\u2019s so much cooler than they are!\n\nWho was your absolute favorite character to dress this season?\n\nI have to say, working with Sean Astin was just a dream. And Bob is our Barb this season! He works at RadioShack and is just this simple, very smart guy, and a wonderful partner for our hero, Joyce.\n\nI pulled up all these old photos of actual RadioShack employees [as inspiration]. They didn\u2019t really wear uniforms, usually just a suit or a sport coat and slacks. And a lot of polyester! So that boring brown-on-tan [look] \u2014 we were just like, \u201cthis is it.\u201d His jeans are so \u201970s, too. Bob definitely hasn\u2019t changed his style in a very long time. [Laughs]\n\nBob went all out with his Halloween costume, too; you get the feeling that he probably did that kind of thing every year. And [Sean] loved his vampire makeup and teeth. It was really fun to play with the campiness of that, not to mention working with someone who was in The Goonies. I mean, it\u2019s the dream!\n\nStranger Things is a huge hit in the fashion world: Topshop has a collection dedicated to the show, Louis Vuitton made a Stranger Things T-shirt, and Millie Bobby Brown is a muse for Calvin Klein. What\u2019s it like seeing that sort of response?\n\nIt\u2019s wild! And sort of funny, too, because the clothes are very true to what people actually wore at the time. It\u2019s stuff that fashion wouldn\u2019t have considered fashion back then!\n\nThe fan base is just so vast; people have really latched on to these characters and their wonderfully human, emotional relationships. Because they\u2019re real! You can remember yourself having friends like this and having those moments where you just needed someone to sit down and talk you through a problem, like Mike (Finn Wolfhard) does with Will.\n\nI also think that something about the \u201980s is especially appealing right now, because life is really difficult for a lot of people. Our country is at odds. But in the world of Stranger Things, things seem a little bit simpler. There\u2019s hope, even though the characters are going through a dark time. That\u2019s the thing about Stranger Things: It reminds you of how fun \u201980s movies were, but it\u2019s also there to hold your hand.\n\nAll episodes of Stranger Things 2 are now streaming on Netflix.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LxvkXWdbppQTORIEqphI2JPZYUc=/0x0:6720x4480/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9569965/stranger_things_eleven.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t3UH9XW4eAb6PcXF8EjFtwaFPZY=/0x0:8000x3720/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:8000x3720):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9570135/stranger_things_kids.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLIcY3uepCLdCBD0hyphy0R8MtQ=/0x0:6720x4480/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:6720x4480):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9570343/stranger_things_bob_joyce.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E8los3wFfL3Eh7RAEfMjiX7NhME=/0x0:2000x1333/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2000x1333):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9570189/stranger_things_eleven_makeover.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8p3hghfHXshl_ti6MOPoOpgbMJM=/0x399:2768x1848/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9571251/stranger_things_.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0bBtQ2LQcAt2WKzTJ37SWB2Nwu8=/0x0:8000x3720/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:8000x3720):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9570175/stranger_things_nancy_jonathan.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ivsDj8JdzUCm9inMKOJByWHQU80=/0x390:2768x1848/1200x675/filters:focal(1170x972:1612x1414)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57401877/stranger_things_.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/coCU1K5QIM0Y_sUGxzp4ZHvzsq4=/0x0:8000x3720/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:8000x3720):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9570149/stranger_things_billy.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8p3hghfHXshl_ti6MOPoOpgbMJM=/0x399:2768x1848/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9571251/stranger_things_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elana Fishman", "Oct"], "canonical_link": "https://www.racked.com/2017/10/31/16571754/stranger-things-2-costumes", "title": "All About Eleven\u2019s\u2019 \u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 Makeover, From the Show\u2019s Costume Designer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Racked", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rackednational", "published_time": "2017-10-31T10:47:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-31T10:47:02-04:00"}, "author": "Elana Fishman", "style-tools": "https://www.racked.com/style/community/522/0d59761c475a67bd70b8e919399b75c2/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "\"I was looking back to photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna...\"", "og": {"description": "\"I was looking back to photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna...\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8p3hghfHXshl_ti6MOPoOpgbMJM=/0x399:2768x1848/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9571251/stranger_things_.jpg", "alt": "Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things 2.", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Racked", "title": "The Story Behind Eleven\u2019s \u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 Makeover", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.racked.com/2017/10/31/16571754/stranger-things-2-costumes"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.racked.com/2017/10/31/16571754/stranger-things-2-costumes", "title": "The Story Behind Eleven\u2019s \u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 Makeover", "description": "\"I was looking back to photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna...\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8p3hghfHXshl_ti6MOPoOpgbMJM=/0x399:2768x1848/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9571251/stranger_things_.jpg", "alt": "Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in Stranger Things 2."}, "site": "Racked"}, "sailthru.title": "How Eleven\u2019s Bitchin\u2019 \u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 Makeover Came Together", "sailthru.tags": "general,racked,front-page,shopping,entertainment", "sailthru.description": "\"I was looking back to photos of Siouxsie Sioux and Madonna...\"", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-31T10:47:02-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OoLe2LsqXXEnhjwefCQ2gyarHc=/95x390:2687x1848/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57401875/stranger_things_.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g8YaQFkJmzBLwCuYD1eTYwml8nU=/662x390:2120x1848/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57401875/stranger_things_.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10131605/144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FF0080", "outbrainsection": "shopping"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509379200.0, "source": "https://www.racked.com", "summary": ""}
