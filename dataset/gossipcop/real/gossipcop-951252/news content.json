We\u2019re having the baby and we\u2019re doing it next month.\u2019 And then the next, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s wait a year.\u2019 It\u2019s hard because I want them to be close in age and at the same time, maybe I need a little more time in between.\u201d\n\nFellow Hills alum Kristin Cavallari is a proponent of having kids back-to-back. \u201cI talked to Kristin about it and she\u2019s like, \u2018Just knock \u2018em out!\u201d Heidi said. (Cavallari and Jay Cutler are parents of Camden, 6, Jaxon, 4, and daughter Saylor, 3.)\n\nEarlier this month, Justin Bobby Brescia told Us a pregnancy might be coming\u201d on the Hills revival. When Montag was asked on Saturday if she is the cast member with a bun in the oven, she replied: \u201cMaybe. That I know of yet, but who knows. You never know!\u201d\n\nMontag, Peratt and their Gucci-clad toddler (his nickname is \u201cGucci Gunner!\u201d) all showed up to support jewelry designer Stephanie\u2019s latest milestone. Her accessories for MeMe London will now be available at Switch Boutique. Montag doesn\u2019t need any more pieces.\n\n\u201cI have, like, every bracelet,\u201d she quipped. \u201cI love MeMe London. I\u2019ve had her stuff for years.\u201d\n\nMontag and Pratt eloped in Mexico in November 2008.\n\nThe Hills: New Beginnings is set to premiere in 2019.\n\nWith reporting by Kayley Stumpe", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/stephanie-pratt-meme.jpg?w=211", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/stephanie-pratt-heidi-montag.jpg?w=229", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/heidi-pratt-cavallari.jpg?crop=184px%2C0px%2C1816px%2C953px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/heidi-pratt-cavallari.jpg?crop=230px%2C0px%2C1747px%2C986px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/heidi-pratt-cavallari.jpg?crop=184px%2C0px%2C1816px%2C953px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/heidi-montag-kristin-cavallari-gave-me-advice-for-having-baby-no-2/", "title": "Heidi Montag: Kristin Cavallari Gave Me Advice for Having Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Heidi Montag turned to former \u2018Hills\u2019 costar Kristin Cavallari for advice on when to have another baby \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Heidi Montag: Kristin Cavallari Advised Me on When to Have Another Baby", "description": "Heidi Montag turned to former \u2018Hills\u2019 costar Kristin Cavallari for advice on when to have another baby \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/heidi-montag-kristin-cavallari-gave-me-advice-for-having-baby-no-2/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-12-17T21:13:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/heidi-pratt-cavallari.jpg?crop=184px%2C0px%2C1816px%2C953px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/heidi-pratt-cavallari.jpg?crop=184px%2C0px%2C1816px%2C953px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-12-17T21:12:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-17T21:13:31+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Heidi Montag turned to former \u2018Hills\u2019 costar Kristin Cavallari for advice on when to have another baby \u2014 find out more", "title": "Heidi Montag: Kristin Cavallari Advised Me on When to Have Another Baby", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/heidi-pratt-cavallari.jpg?crop=184px%2C0px%2C1816px%2C953px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545081123.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
