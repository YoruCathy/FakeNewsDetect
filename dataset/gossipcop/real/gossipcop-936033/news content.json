Her boyfriend said he swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid him and hit a concrete barrier.\n\nHe said Samantha hit the windshield and fell to the floor mat. Samantha, who has MS, was unable to lift herself up. He said her foot was twisted backward.\n\nHe drove Samantha to the emergency room, where doctors are treating her.\n\nAs TMZ previously reported, Samantha and Meghan\u2019s father just got out of surgery to repair his heart after a serious heart attack.\n\nSamantha\u2019s boyfriend Mark said the paparazzo fled the scene after the incident.", "images": ["https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-74774335.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/fence2.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gettyimages-1211397123.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/gov.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/markle.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=225&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/untitled-31.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1180624688.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kc1-3.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/markle.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/markle.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=770", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18314522&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/ss2-4.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1199256012.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/fl1.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gettyimages-453983795.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1176004905.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/localtv-2/img/witi/logo-gray.png", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1192406417.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/nick-gordon-bobbi-kristina-brown-whitney-houston.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1194850687.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/hypatia-h_2d7249602692c05450ebba675a778e72-h_3607798549ae3c4a7c3dd558c4dc7662.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/gettyimages-1200603760.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/markle.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Delong"], "canonical_link": "https://fox6now.com/2018/05/16/tmz-meghan-markles-half-sister-samantha-hospitalized-with-possible-broken-ankle/", "title": "TMZ: Meghan Markle\u2019s half-sister Samantha hospitalized with possible broken ankle", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334682375", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "FLORIDA -- Meghan Markle's half sister,\u00a0Samantha, is in the hospital after suffering what appears to be a broken ankle and a fractured knee after a confrontation with the paparazzi, TMZ is reporting.", "keywords": "news, meghan markle, prince harry, samantha markle, thomas markle", "google-site-verification": "iXLB9DCJ8o44w3SHddEhtmvCXRUfxQCVRXXMHkyL6jI", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "p": {"domain_verify": "6234caa106890daf4037e63d88245e14"}, "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TMZ: Meghan Markle\u2019s half-sister Samantha hospitalized with possible broken ankle", "url": "https://fox6now.com/2018/05/16/tmz-meghan-markles-half-sister-samantha-hospitalized-with-possible-broken-ankle/", "description": "FLORIDA -- Meghan Markle's half sister,\u00a0Samantha, is in the hospital after suffering what appears to be a broken ankle and a fractured knee after a confrontation with the paparazzi, TMZ is reporting.\r\n\nSamantha's boyfriend, Mark, told TMZ they were driving in Florida near a toll booth when they had a \"paparazzi confrontation.\" He said the photographer veered in front of them, trying to get a clear shot.
