It\u2019s going to be a very weird mixture to have everyone, so I don\u2019t know.

I don\u2019t want to leave my fianc\u00e9. Nicole also has her two kids and she\u2019s so busy with her TV show [Great News], and I\u2019m so busy.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt would be so much fun if we both weren\u2019t basically married with me having a kid soon as well. We\u2019re both so busy, but it would be hilarious. Nobody is as funny as Nicole.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fparis-hilton-11.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fparis-hilton-21-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fparis-hilton2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fparis-hilton2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne Tracy"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-strong-resilient-cheating-scandal-paris-hilton-coachella/", "title": "New Mom Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Is a 'Strong, Resilient Woman' Amid Cheating Scandal, Says Paris Hilton", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Coachella,Exclusive,Kardashians,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,News,Paris Hilton,TV", "news_keywords": "Coachella,Exclusive,Kardashians,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,News,Paris Hilton,TV", "description": "Paris Hilton says her longtime friend Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is a \"natural\" when it comes to motherhood", "og": {"title": "New Mom Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Is a 'Strong, Resilient Woman' Amid Cheating Scandal, Says Paris Hilton", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-strong-resilient-cheating-scandal-paris-hilton-coachella/", "description": "Paris Hilton couldn\u2019t be happier for new mom&nbsp;Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.
