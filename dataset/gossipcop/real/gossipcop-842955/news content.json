Bob Harper revealed the surprising star that reached out to him following his heart attack during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Tuesday, April 11. Watch the video above!\n\n\u201cHoward Stern. Him and [his wife] Beth, they reached out to me,\u201d Harper, 51, told host Cohen, 48, and fellow guest Rachel Dratch. \u201cThen Howard sent me a video of naked men doing yoga. Beth was like, \u2018You\u2019re gonna give him another heart attack!\u2019 I love him.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he received well-wishes from any Biggest Loser stars, he added: \u201cI heard from almost everyone.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the personal trainer stopped breathing after he finished a workout with friends at the gym on February 12. He was given CPR and was rushed to a nearby hospital.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that you had cardiac arrest I didn\u2019t know that meant that you technically died,\u201d Cohen said on Tuesday night. \u201cI technically died,\u201d Harper replied. \u201cThere was a piece of paper from the doctor that said, \u2018Cause of death: cardiac arrest.\u2019 That\u2019s a wake up call!\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Harper said on the Today show that he had a \u201c6 percent survival rate\u201d and that he didn\u2019t take prior warning signs seriously enough.\n\n\u201cI fainted one time in the gym, I started having these dizzy spells and I just kind of overlooked them,\u201d he recalled to Cohen. \u201c[I] just adapted, which was just the dumbest [thing to do]. I kicked myself over and over again about that.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/481876130_howard-stern-beth-ostrosky-zoom-cf1904d2-d705-4300-b50e-11c206673d35.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/rachel-dratch-bob-harper-zoom-eaa2c1e5-3155-4722-9696-567ec4f888c9.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bob-harper-zoom-48222037-016d-4a35-8236-3f12f8b0219e.jpg?crop=57px%2C0px%2C431px%2C227px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bob-harper-zoom-48222037-016d-4a35-8236-3f12f8b0219e.jpg?crop=57px%2C0px%2C431px%2C227px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bob-harper-howard-stern-reached-out-to-me-after-my-heart-attack-w476291/", "title": "Bob Harper: Howard Stern Reached Out to Me After My Heart Attack", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bob Harper opened up about his heart attack scare during 'Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen' on Tuesday, April 11 \u2014 watch the video", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bob Harper: This Surprising Star Reached Out to Me After My Heart Attack", "description": "Bob Harper opened up about his heart attack scare during 'Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen' on Tuesday, April 11 \u2014 watch the video", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bob-harper-howard-stern-reached-out-to-me-after-my-heart-attack-w476291/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:17:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bob-harper-zoom-48222037-016d-4a35-8236-3f12f8b0219e.jpg?crop=57px%2C0px%2C431px%2C227px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bob-harper-zoom-48222037-016d-4a35-8236-3f12f8b0219e.jpg?crop=57px%2C0px%2C431px%2C227px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-12T13:04:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:17:03+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bob Harper opened up about his heart attack scare during 'Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen' on Tuesday, April 11 \u2014 watch the video", "title": "Bob Harper: This Surprising Star Reached Out to Me After My Heart Attack", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bob-harper-zoom-48222037-016d-4a35-8236-3f12f8b0219e.jpg?crop=57px%2C0px%2C431px%2C227px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492002240.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
