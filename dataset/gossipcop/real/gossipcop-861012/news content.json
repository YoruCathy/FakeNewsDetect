How cute would that be?\n\nIn a recent interview with Marie Claire, Chrissy talked about recovering from postpartum depression and said that she\u2019s already thinking about what adding to her family would look like, whether that means adopting or fostering.\n\n\u201cI would definitely adopt or have foster children.

It couldn\u2019t be any worse than it was\u2014could it?\u201d she said in the Marie Claire interview.\n\nSo far, Chrissy\u2019s been pretty real about her pregnancy and postpartum depression experiences.
