The singer recently shared an emotional post about his sexual orientation just a few hours before news broke that he split from girlfriend Madison Parker.\n\nA source close to the couple tells Us that the 29-year-old singer is \u201crelieved\u201d he got out of the relationship. \u201cMadison was not a good influence on Aaron, and Aaron is better off without her,\u201d the source tells Us. \u201cHe\u2019s able to live an authentic life for the first time. He\u2019s finally free and doesn\u2019t have the anxiety he was having.\u201d\n\nThe pair, who began dating at the end of last year, were living together before their breakup. \u201cMadison moved out a week ago,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cAaron asked her to leave and helped her pack her things, but she was angry and calling him names when she was leaving.\u201d\n\nThe source tells Us that Carter\u2019s sexuality caused tension between the couple: \u201cMadison really was not supportive of Aaron\u2019s sexuality and didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\nIn the August 5 note, Carter explained he\u2019s been attracted to both men and women. \u201cWhen I was around 13-years-old I started to find boys and girls attractive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere were years that went by that I thought about it, but it wasn\u2019t until I was 17-years old, after a few relationships with girls, I had an experience with a male that I had an attraction to who I also worked with and grew up with.\u201d\n\nAfter Carter and Parker called it quits, the photographer joked on Twitter that the \u201cI Want Candy\u201d singer was getting married to his male publicist after Carter posted a photo with his team member. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to come to the wedding,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe source tells Us that the joke upset Carter: \u201cHere she is joking online that he and his publicist are having a wedding after he came out about something in such a pure, honest way.\u201d\n\nDespite the jab, the pop star received tons of support from his fans and other celebs, including Boy George and Paris Jackson, the insider says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know how his coming out would be received. It was really scary for him. It was a huge risk,\u201d the source says. \u201cEveryone was really so positive and he needed the support.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/630056820_aaron-carter-madison-parker-zoom-ccf37cb7-8b9b-4eee-af31-d6a66a1ffd1b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/630056820_aaron-carter-madison-parker-zoom-ea003ac4-fd16-4e71-904b-d052c3b59a43.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/630056820_aaron-carter-madison-parker-zoom-ccf37cb7-8b9b-4eee-af31-d6a66a1ffd1b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-carter-is-relieved-after-split-with-girlfriend-madison-parker-w497174/", "title": "Aaron Carter Is \u2018Relieved\u2019 After Split With Girlfriend Madison Parker", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Aaron Carter is \u2018relieved\u2019 after his split from Madison Parker because she \u2018was not a good influence,\u2019 a source tells Us \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Aaron Carter Is \u2018Relieved\u2019 After Split With Girlfriend Madison Parker", "description": "Aaron Carter is \u2018relieved\u2019 after his split from Madison Parker because she \u2018was not a good influence,\u2019 a source tells Us \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-carter-is-relieved-after-split-with-girlfriend-madison-parker-w497174/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:47:15+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/630056820_aaron-carter-madison-parker-zoom-ccf37cb7-8b9b-4eee-af31-d6a66a1ffd1b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/630056820_aaron-carter-madison-parker-zoom-ccf37cb7-8b9b-4eee-af31-d6a66a1ffd1b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-10T21:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:47:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Aaron Carter is \u2018relieved\u2019 after his split from Madison Parker because she \u2018was not a good influence,\u2019 a source tells Us \u2014 read more", "title": "Aaron Carter Is \u2018Relieved\u2019 After Split With Girlfriend Madison Parker", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/630056820_aaron-carter-madison-parker-zoom-ccf37cb7-8b9b-4eee-af31-d6a66a1ffd1b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502399700.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
