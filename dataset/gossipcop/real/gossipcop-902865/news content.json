I know that when I come back I definitely want to be competing for championships. I am definitely looking forward to getting back out there,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201dI am taking it one day at a time. I am going to assess everything with my team before deciding.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old Williams took time off after winning the Australian Open last January while pregnant. She gave birth to her first child, a girl named Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., on Sept. 1. She married Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian in November.\n\nWilliams struggled with her serve in the 67-minute match at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship. But, after nearly a year away from the game, she did win a set against the world\u2019s No. 7 player\n\n\u201dI don\u2019t think I am going to rate my performance,\u201d Williams said. \u201dI have plenty of comebacks, from injuries, from surgeries, but I\u2019ve never had a comeback after actually giving birth to a human being. So, in my eyes, I feel it was a wonderful, wonderful match for me.\u201d\n\nWilliams insisted she has a lot more tennis to play.\n\n\u201dKnowing that I have won 23 Grand Slam titles and several other titles, I don\u2019t think I have anything more left to prove,\u201d she said. \u201dBut I am not done yet.\u201d\n\nWilliams won her opening game, breaking Ostapenko. But she was nowhere near her best in the first set before fighting back and winning the second.\n\nAfter the initial break, Ostapenko latched onto Williams\u2019 weak serves and capitalized on several unforced errors to go up 4-1 with two breaks.\n\nWilliams again struggled with her serve in the second set. But she went ahead 3-0 with a couple of early breaks and hit with more confidence, including several crowd-pleasing double-handed passing shots. Another break in the ninth game gave her the set.\n\n\u201dIn the beginning, it felt a little tough. But as the match moved on, I was less afraid. I knew I was not going to fall over and break,\u201d she said. \u201dThe more I played, the more confident I felt that I would be able to go for shots that I was afraid to go for in the first set.\u201d\n\nIn the super tiebreaker, Ostapenko raced to an 8-2 lead before halting a brief recovery by Williams.\n\n\u201dFor me, it is all about physical, how I am feeling physically. \u2026 I am just proud being out here and playing in Abu Dhabi and to be able to just compete,\u201d Williams said. \u201dI have had a tough few months and I am just excited to be able to play again.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time a women\u2019s match had been played in the traditionally men\u2019s only exhibition.\n\nU.S. Open runner-up Kevin Anderson defeated Spain\u2019s Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 7-6 (0) in the men\u2019s final. The 14th-ranked Anderson immediately broke Bautista Agut and was never in danger of losing serve in the first set.\n\nIn the second set, Bautista Agut broke in the second game, but the South African broke back immediately. An aggressive Anderson swept the tiebreaker.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2019/07/newsletter-epg2x.vresize.170.100.high.51.jpg", "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.1200.630.high.3.jpeg", "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.480.270.high.3.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.1200.630.high.3.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxsports.com/tennis/story/serena-loses-in-exhibition-comeback-after-giving-birth-123017", "title": "Serena loses in exhibition comeback after giving birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "ad-refresh-count": 0, "theme-color": "#003364", "parsely-author": "AP", "parsely-section": "tennis", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-12-30T16:00:35Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.1200.675.high.3.jpeg", "parsely-title": "Serena loses in exhibition comeback after giving birth", "parsely-type": "article", "parsely-link": "https://www.foxsports.com/tennis/story/serena-loses-in-exhibition-comeback-after-giving-birth-123017", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":\"internal-dev-ap-article,tennis/wta/athletes/323,tennis/wta/athletes/484,tennis\",\"image_url\":\"https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.161.73.high.3.jpeg\",\"clean_image_url\":\"https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.jpeg\",\"clean_image_version\":\"3\",\"type\":\"article\",\"description\":\" ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Serena Williams lost in her return to tennis after giving birth in September, beaten by French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition Saturday and still unsure if she will defend her Australian Open title.\",\"origin\":\"AP\",\"docid\":\"WP-2496404\",\"blurb\":\" ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Serena Williams lost in her return to tennis after giving birth in September, beaten by French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition Saturday and still unsure if she will defend her Australian Open title.\",\"publish_date\":\"2017-12-30T16:00:35Z\"}", "parsely-tags": "internal-dev-ap-article,tennis/wta/athletes/323,tennis-wta-athlete-323,Jelena Ostapenko,tennis/wta/athletes/484,tennis-wta-athlete-484,Serena Williams,tennis,Tennis,page-type:article", "description": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Serena Williams lost in her return to tennis after giving birth in September, beaten by French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition Saturday and still unsure if she will defend her Australian Open title.", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Serena loses in exhibition comeback after giving birth", "description": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Serena Williams lost in her return to tennis after giving birth in September, beaten by French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition Saturday and still unsure if she will defend her Australian Open title.", "url": "http://www.foxsports.com/tennis/story/serena-loses-in-exhibition-comeback-after-giving-birth-123017", "site_name": "FOX Sports", "updated_time": "2017-12-30T15:26:50-04:00", "image": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.1200.630.high.3.jpeg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/foxsports", "tag": "Tennis", "section": "Tennis", "published_time": "2017-12-30T11:00:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-30T15:26:50-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 380390622023704}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP)  Serena Williams lost in her return to tennis after giving birth in September, beaten by French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in an exhibition Saturday and still unsure if she will defend her Australian Open title.", "title": "Serena loses in exhibition comeback after giving birth | FOX Sports", "site": "@foxsports", "image": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/12/201712300938347232016-p2.vresize.440.220.high.3.jpeg", "creator": "@foxsports"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514646035.0, "source": "https://www.foxsports.com", "summary": ""}
