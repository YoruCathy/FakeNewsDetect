What's more, it appears that the two plaintiffs have gained a significant share of royalties. Before the lawsuit, 100 percent of the work was controlled by BMI, which administers the public performance of McDaid's works, but now that percentage has dropped to 82.5 percent as Leonard has an ASCAP affiliation.\n\nHarrington and Leonard, along with their publishing company HaloSongs, filed the lawsuit in June 2016, alleging that \"Photograph\" derived from their 2009 work \"Amazing,\" which was recorded and released as a single by Matt Cardle, the winner of the 2010 season of the television competition show The X Factor. They were represented in court by Richard Busch, the attorney who prevailed at trial on behalf of the Marvin Gaye family in the copyright lawsuit over \"Blurred Lines.\"\n\nThe complaint, which charged \"verbatim, note-for-note copying,\" and included sheet music to prove it, was initially challenged on pleading standards and jurisdiction, but in January a judge let it move forward.\n\nThe defendants were represented by Michael Niborski and Ilene Farkas at Pryor Cashman.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect new information from BMI's database.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/04/eriq096-1_0.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2017/02/ed.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/02/ed.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_hollywoodesq.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/02/ed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eriq Gardner", "Eriq.Gardner Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/ed-sheeran-settles-copyright-lawsuit-photograph-992354", "title": "Ed Sheeran Gives Up Part Ownership of 'Photograph' in Settling Copyright Lawusit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "After suing over the hit song, songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard are now listed as co-writers.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/ed-sheeran-settles-copyright-lawsuit-photograph-992354", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Ed Sheeran Gives Up Part Ownership of 'Photograph' in Settling Copyright Lawusit", "description": "After suing over the hit song, songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard are now listed as co-writers.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/02/ed.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Ed Sheeran Gives Up Part Ownership of 'Photograph' in Settling Copyright Lawusit", "description": "After suing over the hit song, songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard are now listed as co-writers.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/ed-sheeran-settles-copyright-lawsuit-photograph-992354", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/02/ed.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Ed Sheeran Gives Up Part Ownership of 'Photograph' in Settling Copyright Lawusit", "sailthru.description": "After suing over the hit song, songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard are now listed as co-writers.", "sailthru.author": "Eriq Gardner", "sailthru.channel": "THR, Esq.", "sailthru.vertical": "Esq.", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-10 07:24:30", "sailthru.tags": "THR, Esq., Music"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491780270.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
