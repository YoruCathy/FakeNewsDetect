Michael has also worked with Real Housewives stars Danielle Staub, Tamra Judge and Peggy Sulahian.\n\n\"The last time I grew my hair out was when I had [daughter] Delilah Belle. So, 19 years ago!\" Rinna told the magazine. \"It was time, what the hell!\"\n\n\"I think spending the last two years with Erika Jayne has rubbed off on me,\" she added, referencing her co-star. \"She has the most fabulous hairdos. And in September, Julius and I did my hair off my face and it was really fun. This seemed like the next thing to try!\"\n\nRinna achieved her look with 14-inch clip-in hair extensions. She debuted her new hairstyle on Tuesday's episode of Watch What Happens Live, and also posted a photo of her look on Instagram.\n\n\"Hey,\" the star captioned the picture.\n\nHey. A post shared by Lisa Rinna (@lisarinna) on Jan 23, 2018 at 9:02pm PST\n\nRinna joined The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in Season 4, and was made a series regular in Season 5. The show co-stars Jayne, Lisa Vanderpump, Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley and Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave.", "images": ["https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9991587218736/2020/upi/e2ceb60b972b27e2394b8feebfc635ad/v1.5/The-Weeknds-After-Hours-tops-US-album-chart-for-3rd-week.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1111587129343/2020/i/15871309561206/v1.2/Luann-de-Lesseps-not-drinking-amid-COVID-19-pandemic.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1291587136758/2020/upi/809790ea4a25950f73b24cc353303048/v1.2/What-to-stream-this-weekend-One-World-concert-blackAF.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6251587255665/2020/upi/3bb1b0855f3f250535a8381fef4e722b/v1.2/Charlie-Puth-jokes-about-his-Together-at-Home-unmade-bed.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6721587233293/2020/upi/41bcc1e0006fc6829503ae990df9516a/v1.2/Cedric-the-Entertainer-to-host-viral-video-special-for-CBS.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6411587059298/2020/i/15870604067320/v1.2/Angelyne-Emmy-Rossum-plays-LA-icon-in-first-trailer.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/expand_gallery.svg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/related/8771586963363/6/v1.2/b6cfb469313494590bc4f6eae0e58cfb/upi/Moments-from-Selena-Gomezs-career.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1781587223393/2020/upi/f99e64c11a72d8bd1a8f5bfd7681e1e9/v1.2/HBO-Max-orders-Justice-League-Dark-Overlook-series.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/3821587148655/2020/i/15871489794813/v1.2/Party-of-Five-reboot-canceled-after-one-season.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1251587126970/2020/upi/b0e8239e4c2c33ecea10ca7606289941/v1.2/Bob-Odenkirk-talks-sons-experience-with-COVID-19-on-Late-Late-Show.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/svc/sv/upi/7101516816785/2018/1/12b4e0db6ed3daba9a70076ca6dfe17e/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7711587220507/2020/upi/cb484d04052fbe969f58b072a61907e5/v1.5/Comic-Con-International-San-Diego-canceled-for-2020.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8781586912884/2020/upi/b5af9d33eea072a9500324334f56a1ee/v1.5/Famous-birthdays-for-April-18-Britt-Robertson-Maria-Bello.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6071587053988/2020/upi/2406335e766078d416fd02526b069e2c/v1.5/Technology-makes-romance-messy-in-Endings-Beginnings.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/7101516816785/2018/1/12b4e0db6ed3daba9a70076ca6dfe17e/v1.5/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle.jpg", "https://www.upi.com/img/photo_gallery_icon.svg", "https://www.upi.com/img/clear.gif", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9521587123442/2020/upi/da492cdf36234ba02257748b7ad694f3/v1.2/Kelly-Clarkson-says-Aretha-Franklin-made-her-cry-tears-of-joy.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9601587055607/2020/i/15870576674970/v1.2/90-Day-Fiance-The-Other-Way-Season-2-trailer-introduces-cast.jpg", "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1291587136758/2020/upi/809790ea4a25950f73b24cc353303048/v1.5/What-to-stream-this-weekend-One-World-concert-blackAF.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/7101516816785/2018/1/12b4e0db6ed3daba9a70076ca6dfe17e/v1.5/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2018/01/24/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle/7101516816785/", "title": "Lisa Rinna swaps her signature shag for long hairstyle", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star Lisa Rinna debuted new, longer locks after 19 years with a bob.", "keywords": "Entertainment, TV, Lisa Rinna", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, TV, Lisa Rinna", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1304339835", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "\"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star Lisa Rinna debuted new, longer locks after 19 years with a bob.", "url": "https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2018/01/24/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle/7101516816785/", "title": "Lisa Rinna swaps her signature shag for long hairstyle", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/7101516816785/2018/1/12b4e0db6ed3daba9a70076ca6dfe17e/v1.5/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle.jpg", "width": 502, "height": 333}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660, "pages": 101911273177707}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPI", "creator": "@littlemannie", "title": "Lisa Rinna swaps her signature shag for long hairstyle", "description": "\"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" star Lisa Rinna debuted new, longer locks after 19 years with a bob.", "image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/7101516816785/2018/i/15168177512420/v2.1/Lisa-Rinna-swaps-her-signature-shag-for-long-hairstyle.jpg?lg=4"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.upi.com", "summary": ""}
