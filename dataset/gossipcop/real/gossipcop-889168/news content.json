And yes, she cares very little about what men think of her. What a joy to play! https://t.co/d0LZKTHCfL \u2014 Tessa Thompson (@TessaThompson_x) October 21, 2017\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s bi. And yes, she cares very little about what men think of her. What a joy to play!\u201d Tessa tweeted.\n\nShe was responding to a fan thread where one user was complaining that Valkyrie has been turned into a \u201ctypical sexless marvel tomboy\u201d compared to her comicbook counterpart.\n\nnope sorry. not valkyrie. typical sexless marvel tomboy..oh but with wisecracks ???? and 'attitude'. she used to be cool and sexy ???? pic.twitter.com/f15H4iqqsR \u2014 Greg Martin (@GregSelkirk) October 21, 2017\n\nTessa Thompson stars alongside Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk in Marvel\u2019s latest blockbuster instalment.\n\nCate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum both star too in the intergalactic adventure, which will be in cinemas on 24 October in the UK and 3 November in the US.\n\nThere\u2019s still no word on whether the big screen portrayal of Korg can be considered the MCU\u2019s first gay character in a movie, as in the comics he was in a gay relationship with another member of the Warbound called Hiroim.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to change the idea of what a hulking guy made of rocks could be. He\u2019s huge and heavy, but with a light soul,\u201d director Takia Waititi previously said, who also voices the CGI creation.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make him funny and a relatable entry point into this world. And Thor needs friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/GT/assets/svg/menu.svg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/thor-flex-teaser-trailer.jpg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ics-codablock-blood-bag_sample-368x228.jpg", "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/GT/assets/svg/gt-mag-2018.svg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scott-Evans-368x228.jpg", "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/GT/assets/svg/search.svg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Queen-Latifah-368x228.png", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Liam-Payne-368x228.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1461995550793670&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/GT/assets/svg/gt-logo-2018.svg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RuPaul-2-368x228.png", "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/GT/assets/svg/close.svg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jackie-Cox-368x228.png", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Raveena-header-368x228.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-wA8e1442Gqemv.gif", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Johanna-Metzger-368x228.png", "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/themes/GT/assets/svg/comments.svg", "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GREYSON-COVER-tiny.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/thor-flex-teaser-trailer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/90817/thor-ragnarok-features-marvels-first-ever-lgbt-character-movie/", "title": "Thor: Ragnarok features Marvel's first ever LGBT+ character in a movie", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "_globalsign-domain-verification": "lQgTOD8dWU_8nHyzjHGJ39ncrI45HenuNvKKTckDhn", "description": "After 16 film releases over nine years, we finally have the LGBT+ character we've been waiting for.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Thor: Ragnarok features Marvel's first ever LGBT+ character in a movie", "description": "After 16 film releases over nine years, we finally have the LGBT+ character we've been waiting for.", "url": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/90817/thor-ragnarok-features-marvels-first-ever-lgbt-character-movie/", "site_name": "Gay Times", "updated_time": "2017-10-24T09:41:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/thor-flex-teaser-trailer.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/thor-flex-teaser-trailer.jpg", "width": 784, "height": 489}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/gaytimes", "tag": "Editor's Picks", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2017-10-24T09:39:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-24T09:41:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "After 16 film releases over nine years, we finally have the LGBT+ character we've been waiting for.", "title": "Thor: Ragnarok features Marvel's first ever LGBT+ character in a movie", "site": "@gaytimesmag", "image": "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/thor-flex-teaser-trailer.jpg", "creator": "@LewisCorner"}, "fb": {"app_id": 177720826866, "admins": "285700419 508932795 575514229 716858948", "pages": 30540151272}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/culture/90817/thor-ragnarok-features-marvels-first-ever-lgbt-character-movie/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d2d2ekni7prhwy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cropped-new-favicon-3-270x270.png", "msapplication-config": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ue80QwXMRHg"], "publish_date": 1508837945.0, "source": "https://www.gaytimes.co.uk", "summary": ""}
