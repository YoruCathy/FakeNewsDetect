While talking to her, McKinnon said she realized she and Aidy Bryant were \u201cMidwestern toads\u201d next to the \u201cMediterranean goddess\u201d that is Gadot.\n\nSee Video: 'SNL': Gal Gadot Reprises Her Wonder Woman Role, Kisses Kate McKinnon\n\n\u201cEverything she says is a prophecy,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cEverything she said was magic.\u201d\n\nShe then revealed that the cast went to their weekly dinner with Gadot (every Tuesday, the \u201cSNL\u201d cast hits a restaurant with that week\u2019s host) and Gadot asked everyone to tell her something they have never told anyone before.\n\nSee Video: 'SNL': Kate McKinnon's Jeff Sessions Tells Roy Moore He's 'Too Alabama' in Cold Open\n\n\u201cNo really, we have to do this,\u201d Gadot said, according to McKinnon. Even Lorne Michaels, the creator and producer of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d weighed in.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images":
