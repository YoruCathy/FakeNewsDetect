This means that star Rose McIver has a fairly huge acting challenge every week\u2014and some weeks are harder than others.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t so much a compilation of our favorite episodes\u2014or even of the episodes you must watch before season three premieres tomorrow. (Tip: watch as many of them as you can. They\u2019re on Netflix.) No, this is a list of iZombie\u2019s very best brains.\n\n10) Clive Jordan, \u201cMethod Head\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \u201cMethod Head,\u201d an actor on Liv\u2019s favorite TV show\u2014Zombie High, natch\u2014dies when a prop knife gun (oops, sorry) is substituted for a real one. Liv eats Jordan\u2019s brain and almost instantly becomes a walking stereotype of actors. She talks about finding \u201ctruth\u201d and how to access real emotions for characters. The whole joke was the show making fun of itself and the industry it\u2019s a part of, and it is great. Plus, Liv\u2019s apple-eating mime deserves a 10 out of 10.\n\n\n\n9) The Fog, \u201cCape Town\u201d\n\nLiv eats the brain of a costumed vigilante and decides to visit the local crime boss in full costume. It\u2019s fun and there\u2019s a bit of bleed through between the idea of a superhero and Liv\u2019s actual, zombie-given powers. Plus, Ravi (Rahul Kohli) has a list of possible names for Liv that are fabulous: \u201cSuper Dead,\u201d \u201cDoctor Power,\u201d \u201cDead Power,\u201d \u201cDoctor Dead,\u201d and \u201cSnow Woman.\u201d\n\n\n\n8) Wendell Gordon Gale, \u201cGrumpy Old Liv\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe season two premiere showed that even though some things in Liv\u2019s life were changing, the basic premise of the show would stay the same. And Liv eating the brain of a horrible old racist showed that she was still going to consume brains and solve the murders of not-quite-perfect victims.\n\n\n\n6) Harry Cole, \u201cMax Wager\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiv eats the brain of a compulsive gambler, which leads to her wagering on everything. But the scene that really gets to how much the brain drives Liv is when she invents an excuse to go back and place a bet with her meal\u2019s former bookie.\n\n\n\n5) Marvin Webster, \u201cThe Exterminator\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat should be a simple brain\u2014that of a family man\u2014becomes much creepier when Liv discovers after eating it that Webster was a hit man and a sociopath. This happened early in season one, and resulted in less of a broad comedy brain than we\u2019d see in later episodes. The sociopath brain not feeling emotional pain also dovetailed nicely with Liv wanting to avoid how she feels about being a zombie.\n\n\n\n4) Chad Wolkof, \u201cZombie Bro\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI hate that I still laugh about this. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9, sure, but it\u2019s such a fun clich\u00e9 that I am okay with it. The comedy in this brain is superior and I love it. Liv\u2019s frat bro brain made every scene she was in a comedy master class.\n\n\n\n3) Scott E., \u201cAstroburger\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott E. had hallucinations, which lead to one of the best brain episodes ever. The whole episode has Liv working with someone who claims to be related to the victim, giving her information that helps her solve the crime. But, of course, he\u2019s a hallucination, too. I wish the show had done more with the idea that the brains Liv relies on information for aren\u2019t totally reliable. It\u2019s not just the mood swings, it\u2019s that she\u2019s experiencing things as they would, and that\u2019s not always the whole truth.\n\n\n\n2) Taylor Fowler, \u201cReal Dead Housewife of Seattle\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcIver does some truly amazing work in this episode, \u201clunching on a lady who lunches.\u201d There are moments of high comedy in this one\u2014like this slap and her throwing water in the face of her nemesis\u2014that are great. But the brain and Liv herself are also desperately lonely in a way that really gives nice shading to both characters. The twist at the end is lovely in showing how alone Liv feels. This is one of the best connections between brain and underlying emotional arc that show has ever done.\n\n\n\n1) Syd Wicked, \u201cAbra Cadaver\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI am on record as thinking that there was something truly perfect about the magician episode of iZombie. But the anchor is Liv\u2019s transformation into a magician, courtesy of eating the brains of the totally-not-at-all-inspired-by-Criss-Angel illusionist. All of those gags are great, but it\u2019s the denouement\u2014in the classic \u201cgather all the suspects in the parlor\u201d style of mysteries, where a very dramatic Liv explains things\u2014that makes this the best brain she\u2019s ever eaten.\n\n\n\niZombie returns April 4 to the CW.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/j2dximbzq3brbcfcfca3.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/j2dximbzq3brbcfcfca3.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://io9.gizmodo.com/izombies-10-best-brains-1793908671", "title": "iZombie's 10 Best Brains", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "Y4KzRYvFDIszZROrGQfpcKGpEMqT5ncYtgHhRW8D7P0", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/eh1hvjxamru5z6aobgwc.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/eh1hvjxamru5z6aobgwc.png", "keywords": "superlist, izombie, television, cw, io9", "news_keywords": "superlist, izombie, television, cw, io9", "twitter": {"url": "https://io9.gizmodo.com/izombies-10-best-brains-1793908671", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@io9", "title": "iZombie's 10 Best Brains", "description": "The major conceit of iZombie, the lovely and addictive CW show about a zombie, her friends, and the crimes they solve, is that the main character eats the brains of murdered people and then starts to act like them.
