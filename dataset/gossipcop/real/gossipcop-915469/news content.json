The reality TV personality recently claimed the late rapper \u201ctook over\u201d her body after he died in 1996.\n\n\u201cI was gonna ask you how did this, like, sweet, beautiful Utah girl turn into, like, this cool, hood chick?\u201d Jenny McCarthy asked the Bravo star during an interview on SiriusXM\u2019s The Jenny McCarthy Show on Wednesday, February 21. \u201cLike on Instagram and stuff your Snapchats are so sexy, funny, but they\u2019re hood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that comes from. I mean I am a firm believer that when Tupac died he took over my body. I know you\u2019re laughing but I\u2019m being for real,\u201d Kent, 27, explained. \u201cI recently just got \u2018thug life\u2019 tattooed on me and I feel so happy about it. It\u2019s by my \u2026 the inside ankle on my left and it\u2019s up and down in my handwriting, it looks like a prison stamp.\u201d\n\nThe SUR hostess continued to say that while there are differences between her and the \u201cHit Em Up\u201d rapper, she truly believes he is \u201cinside\u201d her body.\n\n\u201cAnd the thing is I\u2019ve never been in a fight before. I am as boujee and white as they come, but I gets to clapping sometimes, pretend, you know?\u201d Kent said. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m sure he is not thrilled with his new body casing, but I\u2019m not thrilled about the temper.\u201d\n\nWhile Vanderpump Rules fans may be surprised by Kent\u2019s latest declaration, they certainly know that she is not afraid to get into a fight. The Give Them Lala Beauty creator recently opened up to Us Weekly about her feud with cast member James Kennedy and called their friendship \u201cnonexistent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have him blocked from my cellphone to all social media. You know you come for me, but when you come for my man, game over,\u201d Kent, who is dating producer Randall Emmett, exclusively told Us on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, my man has a mom and a dad and two kids, and that\u2019s the way you\u2019re speaking about him? Not happening.\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lala-kent-tupac.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lala-kent-tupac.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lala-kent-tupac.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lala-kent-thinks-tupac-took-over-her-body-after-his-death/", "title": "Lala Kent Thinks Tupac 'Took Over' Her Body After His Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 star Lala Kent revealed in a new interview on Wednesday, February 21, that she thinks Tupac Shakur \u2018took over\u2019 her body after his death \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pump Rules\u2019 Lala Kent Thinks Tupac 'Took Over' Her Body After His Death", "description": "\u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 star Lala Kent revealed in a new interview on Wednesday, February 21, that she thinks Tupac Shakur \u2018took over\u2019 her body after his death \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lala-kent-thinks-tupac-took-over-her-body-after-his-death/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-22T18:56:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lala-kent-tupac.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lala-kent-tupac.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-22T18:56:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-22T18:56:41+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 star Lala Kent revealed in a new interview on Wednesday, February 21, that she thinks Tupac Shakur \u2018took over\u2019 her body after his death \u2014 details", "title": "Pump Rules\u2019 Lala Kent Thinks Tupac 'Took Over' Her Body After His Death", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lala-kent-tupac.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519325793.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
