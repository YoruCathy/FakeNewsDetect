Her happy place is Michaels craft store.\n\nCongratulations are in order for Rachel McAdams \u2014 the 39-year-old actress is reportedly going to be a first-time mom!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough she has not personally confirmed the baby news, E! News reported that Rachel is expecting her first child with her 37-year-old boyfriend, screenwriter Jamie Linden. The pair has reportedly been dating since 2016 but has never gone public with their relationship.\n\nRachel famously dated her The Notebook co-star Ryan Gosling in the mid-2000s. She has since kept her personal life very private. Her most recent public appearance was in September 2017, at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel opted out of appearing at the Game Night premiere in Los Angeles on February 21, 2018, despite starring in the film. This has fueled rumors of her pregnancy.\n\nRachel has previously opened up about the possibility of being a mother. \u201cPart of me is very attached to the idea of having children,\u201d she told InStyle magazine, \u201cToo often, you think, \u2018I just want to have a baby,\u2019 but your thoughts don\u2019t include the person you\u2019re going to actually be making these little beings with. So, I think it\u2019ll depend on if I find the person I want to do that with.\u201d\n\nThe Mean Girls actress also told People in 2009 that she looks forward to being a mother someday.\n\nSee more of Rachel in the video below, and please SHARE this story with your friends and family on Facebook to wish her all the best!\n\nPhotos: Getty / Sonia Recchia; YouTube / Movieclips\n\n[H/T: People]", "images": ["https://cdn6.littlethings.com/app/themes/littlethings/img/logo-sign.png", "https://cdn4.littlethings.com/app/themes/littlethings/img/no-video.png", "https://bcp.crwdcntrl.net/5/c=9173/b=52814680", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=30177769&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bnzfTM78T_ems.gif", "https://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2017/06/IMG_2916.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://cdn8.littlethings.com/app/themes/littlethings/img/logo-no-text.png", "https://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2018/02/Rachel-McAdams-expecting-first-child.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1215025/log/3/unip?en=view_content", "https://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/themes/littlethings/img/sad-face.png", "https://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/themes/littlethings/img/heart-icon-popup.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn5.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2018/02/Rachel-McAdams-expecting-first-child.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsey Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://www.littlethings.com/rachel-mcadams-pregnant/", "title": "Actress Rachel McAdams Is Reportedly Pregnant With Her First Child At The Age Of 39", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "fb": {"app_id": 663436973736133, "pages": 1645725112328569}, "description": "Congratulations are in order for Rachel McAdams \u2014 the 39-year-old actress is reportedly going to be a first-time mom!
