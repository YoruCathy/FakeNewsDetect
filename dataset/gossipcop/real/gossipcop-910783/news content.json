For a while that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s worth fighting for, but then you have to ask if you can ever get back to that.\u201d\n\nWhile Megan and Kyle are moving forward in their relationship \u2014 and contract \u2014 by planning a wedding, Evangelista says the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d of their relationship is over, and now they are faced with questions of trust and whether or not the fantasy can withstand time.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of whose vision this wedding truly is, given that it was just one of many milestones she promised to mark when she signed the relationship agreement in the first place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Megan\u2019s vision, it\u2019s not Kyle\u2019s vision, it\u2019s something else,\u201d Evangelista says. \u201cThere\u2019s always this other force around them, so it\u2019s this young girl having incredible moments, something she\u2019s fantasized about her whole life, and it\u2019s out of her control in a lot of ways. It\u2019s very stressful, and coming into this season the stakes are very high but the consequences are even higher.\u201d\n\nA throughline for the season, says Evangelista, is whether or not Megan and Kyle\u2019s relationship is strong enough to convince him of the truth behind the Institute, and Henderson points out that Kyle \u201creally wants the relationship to survive\u201d because he \u201ctruly does love Megan.\u201d\n\nBut further complicating things is the fact that Megan and Kyle are also embarking upon a professional project together \u2014 a movie she will star in that he will direct. Because it\u2019s the first project Kyle is directing \u201cit\u2019s a big deal for him, so he kind of obsesses about it,\u201d says Henderson.\n\nThe show\u2019s second season will also explore who Kyle was in the past to understand more about him, including his relationship with Lisbeth (Ashley Hinshaw) and Terrence (Michael Vartan).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a deep dive into Kyle West,\u201d Abrahams says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to learn a lot, not just about Kyle but also Terrence and their relationship \u2014 so much more of why his life has the strange elements in it that it does.\u201d\n\nHenderson adds that in getting to know Kyle, the audience will see \u201che\u2019s got a lot of guilt\u201d and \u201cdemons\u201d that he\u2019s trying to work through.\n\n\u201cHe wants to be happy and right some wrongs, and he\u2019s tired of hiding things. He and Megan have some pretty eye-opening, groundbreaking moments between them, and it\u2019s a big journey for him this year to decide if Terrence and the Institute really have his best interest at heart and if it\u2019s the best thing for him,\u201d Henderson says.\n\nKyle has had his own doubts about the organization, he says, but thus far he has needed it because of his \u201cintense\u201d relationship with Terrence.\n\nBut as the couple marches toward their marriage, they will be re-evaluating the other relationships they see around them. \u201cThere\u2019s a cool episode where we juxtapose the relationship [between Megan and Kyle, and Terrence and Deann] because they\u2019re both arrangements in a way, but they\u2019re in very different places,\u201d Abrahams says.\n\nMegan and Kyle may even have to re-evaluate their own relationship beyond the professional obligation they made to each other, says Henderson. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of separation. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on with her, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of stuff with me, and then we come back at the end of the day and we\u2019re living together and there\u2019s this interesting, kind of weird dynamic between us because there\u2019s so many things not being said,\u201d Henderson says.\n\n\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d Season 2 premieres March 11 on E!", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/nup_174905_0714.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fthe-arrangement-season-2-interview-josh-henderson-christine-evangelista-jonathan-abrahams-1202614911%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202614911", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/nup_174905_0714.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danielle Turchiano"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/the-arrangement-season-2-interview-josh-henderson-christine-evangelista-jonathan-abrahams-1202614911/", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Team on Season 2\u2019s Wedding Plans, Revenge, and a \u2018Deep Dive\u2019 into Kyle\u2019s Past", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"The Arrancement\" creator and stars preview Season 2: a Hollywood wedding, Megan's plan to burn down the Institute, and Kyle's backstory.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202614911, "author": "Danielle Turchiano", "pmc-category": "Features,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-11-15T11:00:49"}, "pmc-tag": "Christine Evangelista,Jonathan Abrahams,Josh Henderson,The Arrangement", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Team on Season 2\u2019s Wedding Plans, Revenge, and a \u2018Deep Dive\u2019 into Kyle\u2019s Past", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "Features", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Team on Season 2\u2019s Wedding Plans, Revenge, and a \u2018Deep Dive\u2019 into Kyle\u2019s Past", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/the-arrangement-season-2-interview-josh-henderson-christine-evangelista-jonathan-abrahams-1202614911/", "description": "The first season of E!\u2019s Hollywood relationship drama \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d ended with Megan (Christine Evangelista) emerging from the Institute of the Higher Mind presumably \u201cr\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/nup_174905_0714.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 667, "alt": "THE ARRANGEMENT -- Episode 101/102 -- Pictured: (l-r) Josh Henderson as Kyle West, Christine Evangelista as Megan Morrison -- (Photo by: Daniel Power/E!
