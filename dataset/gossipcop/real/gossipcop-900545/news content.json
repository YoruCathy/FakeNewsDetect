The gorgeous duo welcomed their second son in Brazil this week. Swanepoel posted a sneak peak of their new bundle of joy on her Instagram Stories today\u2014holding her baby's tiny hand with the text \"blessed\" on the photo.\n\nCourtesy @angelcandices\n\nSwanepoel posted an Instagram on Monday sharing the excitement they were feeling. \"Hoping to meet our newest addition soon!\" she captioned a pregnancy shot of herself with her first son, 1-year-old Anaca. The South African wore unbuttoned, ripped denim jeans, and a white crocheted bra top, showing off her bump. Swanepoel and family have spent the last few months in Brazil, her fiance's native country, while they've awaited the new addition to their family.\n\n\n\nThe supermodel first announced her pregnancy in December, just a few weeks after walking in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in Shanghai, undoubtedly the biggest production in the show's 31-year history. Yes, she was pregnant while strutting herself in skimpy lingerie.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFor the last six months she's shared photos of her growing bump with her fans and her earthy maternity style on Instagram.\n\nSwanpoel has also had another baby to celebrate in the last few months. In February, she launched her own sustainable swimsuit line called Tropic of C. After spending much of her career in lingerie and swimsuits it was no surprise to see the model start a business of her own. The 14-piece collection includes minimalist one-pieces and retro-inspired bikinis.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-candice-swanepoel-1529434461.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/15/46/1280x640/landscape-1447172075-hbz-dream-angels.jpg?resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-candice-swanepoel-1529434461.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chrissy Rutherford"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a21627648/candice-swanepoel-gives-birth-second-baby/", "title": "Candice Swanepoel Welcomes Her Second Child", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Candice Swanepoel Welcomes Her Second Child", "description": "It's boy #2 for the Victoria's Secret Angel.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a21627648/candice-swanepoel-gives-birth-second-baby/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-candice-swanepoel-1529434461.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-06-19 07:03:32", "published_time": "2018-06-19 06:17:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-candice-swanepoel-1529434461.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Candice Swanepoel Welcomes Her Second Child - Birth to Baby Boy - Victoria's Secret Models", "description": "Baby number two has arrived for Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel\u200b and her fianc\u00e9\u200b Hermann Nicoli.
