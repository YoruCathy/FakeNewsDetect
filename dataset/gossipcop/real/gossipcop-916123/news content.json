Please honor our business and not make tele-cast based decision to try and improve ratings. In other words, we have have 90 years of Oscar Magic. Don't fuck it up. \u2014 Ian Bohen (@IanBohen) August 8, 2018\n\nThe film business passed away today with the announcement of the \u201cpopular\u201d film Oscar.
