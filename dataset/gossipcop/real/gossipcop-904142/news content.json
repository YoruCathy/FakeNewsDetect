Hey, there\u2019s a reason she was accepted into every college she applied to this year! And to hear her tell it, the opportunity to work alongside industry legends including Tracee Ellis Ross, her costar in the hit ABC comedy, definitely has helped her become so grounded.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really taught me how to demonstrate that I have an opinion, especially when it comes to beauty,\u201d Shahidi, who\u2019s teaming up with Clean & Clear for the launch of its Acne Triple Clear Bubble Foam Cleanser, told PeopleStyle. \u201cGrowing up on the small screen, I had to confront how I felt about beauty at a younger age because I was putting on a full face of makeup to get into character. I had to learn not to feel makeup-dependent, as though I wasn\u2019t finished without it, so it could stay a fun experience of experimenting and self-expression.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: UPDATED!

Knowing when to take it off. \u201cAs I\u2019ve entered my teenage years, skincare is so important, so I feel confident in who I am,\u201d Shahidi said. \u201cI can\u2019t just wash my face and go to bed now. It\u2019s about making sure my pores are clean, getting all of the makeup out and making sure that my skin is hydrated.\u201d\n\nHer essentials: makeup wipes, a hydrating cleanser and face oil. Simple enough, right?\n\n\u201cI adore the Clean & Clear makeup wipes because amidst all the traveling I do, I don\u2019t always have time to [fully] wash my face. I\u2019ve also been playing around with the brand\u2019s bubble cleanser because it\u2019s gentle on my skin and gets everything out of my pores,\u201d the actress told us. \u201cAfter, I love putting on rosehip oil [as face moisturizer], which is so great for hydration.\u201d\n\nShahidi says that despite trying her best to take good care of her skin, every so often pimples still pop up (she is still a teenager after all!), but she\u2019s tries to make skincare maintenance fun \u2014 with an assist from her real-life mom too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a water challenge to see how much water we can drink in a day, because pimples signify more than surface level issues, but something internal,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was doing well because I was going for 50 ounces a day, but my mom was like, \u2018Oh, well, I am doing 60 ounces a day!\u2019 But it\u2019s been fun supporting each other and reminding each other through it.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s your skincare essential?
