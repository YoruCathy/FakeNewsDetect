Women were in full force tonight: Oprah gave an incredibly empowering speech and Natalie Portman called out the Globes for its all-male directing category\u2026and Portman wasn\u2019t the only person on stage who called the ceremony out. While presenting the last award of the evening for Best Picture, Drama (it went to Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri), Barbra Streisand gently \u2014 but powerfully \u2014 mentioned that she was the last woman to win Best Director at the Golden Globe Awards for the film Yentl.\n\nShe also mentioned that she won in 1984, which was 34 years ago. 34 years:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know that we have a long way to go in Hollywood (and everywhere) when it comes to gender equality.\n\nHere to present our final award of the night is someone who needs no introduction... @BarbraStreisand! She introduces the nominees for Best Motion Picture - Drama. #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/Q946KYUjvH \u2014 Golden Globe Awards (@goldenglobes) January 8, 2018\n\nTonight was a powerful night for women in show business as the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements ruled the evening, but it should be noted that Greta Gerwig was snubbed for Best Director. Lady Bird is critically acclaimed and even won Best Picture, Comedy or Musical tonight \u2014 but Gerwig wasn\u2019t recognized for it. What else does Gerwig have to do to be nominated?\n\nWhat about all of the other incredible films that women have directed in the past 34 years?\n\nStreisand is right. Time is up for the neglect and dismissal of women in film. Behind the scenes, in front of them, and all around them. Time is up for women not being appreciated.\n\nIt was incredible to have Streisand, such a living legend, call our attention to the amount of time that has passed since a woman won Best Director at the Golden Globes.\n\nBarbra Streisand is the only woman to win a #GoldenGlobe for Best Director (for Yentl in 1984). That stat will not be broken this year as there are no women nominated in that category. pic.twitter.com/bGwKBtTpGk \u2014 Women Film Directors (@women_direct) January 8, 2018\n\nWe hope women are nominated at the Oscars, and we hope that next year, there are many more women nominated at the Globes. We hope these Hollywood institutions start realizing why representation matters.\n\nThings the #GoldenGlobes should be not bragging about: \"And now ten time golden globe winner who made history as the only woman to receive a globe for directing. Barbra Streisand.\" pic.twitter.com/drN1y4ABwK \u2014 Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) January 8, 2018\n\nMaybe one day there will only be women in the Best Director category. Hey, time is up. Let\u2019s dream big.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/16020752/avatar-b1-150x150.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2F07135701%2Fbarbrastreisand.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2F07135701%2Fbarbrastreisand.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2F07135701%2Fbarbrastreisand.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Tholmer"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/awards-events/red-carpet/golden-globes/barbra-streisand-calls-out-golden-globes-women-best-director/", "title": "Barbra Streisand \u2014 the only woman to have ever won Best Director at the Golden Globes \u2014 called out the awards show for its lack of women nominees", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "#timesup,2018 Golden Globes,awards,barbra steisand,hellogiggles,TRENDING,women", "news_keywords": "#timesup,2018 Golden Globes,awards,barbra steisand,hellogiggles,TRENDING,women", "description": "Barbra Streisand called out the Golden Globes for not nominating a woman for director since 1984.
