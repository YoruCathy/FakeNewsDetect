He has insulted our dignity.\"\n\nLast year, Ms Jenner told the BBC that she had been \"really upset\" by some of the president's policies, including his decision to revoke Obama-era guidance which allowed transgender students to use school toilets matching their gender identity.\n\n\"It doesn't make me regret my vote yet, but it is very disappointing and I have been very verbal about that,\" she said at the time.\n\nThe same year, Mr Trump also reinstated a ban on transgender people serving in the military which had been lifted by former President Barack Obama. He later signed a more limited directive after federal judges ruled the initial ban was probably unconstitutional.", "images": ["https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=world::us_and_canada::news.world.us_and_canada.story.45987123.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:26a04821-9680-e543-8cff-d0f6773cf3fa]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F9D/production/_104037582_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6F9D/production/_104037582_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name="], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F9D/production/_104037582_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45987123", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Trump 'relentlessly attacking' trans people", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Republican activist says the president has \"relentlessly attacked\" the transgender community.", "x-country": "hk", "x-audience": "Asia", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Asia", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 129764677, "og": {"title": "Caitlyn Jenner ends support for Trump", "type": "article", "description": "The Republican activist says the president has \"relentlessly attacked\" the transgender community.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45987123", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6F9D/production/_104037582_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
