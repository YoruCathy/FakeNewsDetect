Heat Wave. After recurring on The Flash, both men transitioned to DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow. Even though Snart was killed off in the Legends\u2019 season 1 finale, Miller became a series regular across all of the Arrow-verse shows and recurred on Legends and guest-starred on The Flash.\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July, the Legends EPs revealed that Miller would return in season 3. \u201cMick Rory needs his pal, but unfortunately he\u2019s not going to get the version of his pal that he remembers,\u201d EP Phil Klemmer said during the show\u2019s panel. EP Marc Guggenheim added, \u201cWe\u2019re obviously really excited to bring Wentworth back on the show for a few episodes, but a different iteration of Mr. Snart. Chaos and merriment will ensue.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the poster for this year\u2019s four-way crossover \u201cCrisis on Earth-X\u201d confirmed that Miller would appear in that, too; Captain Cold\u2019s face can be seen right above Barry\u2019s right shoulder.\n\nImage zoom DC Comics\n\nCheck out Miller\u2019s Instagram post below:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BbFIeFwB6xn/\n\nDC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on The CW.", "images":
