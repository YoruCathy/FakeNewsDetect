I have to show you something. Quick!!\n\nIt is these photos of a movie starring Liam Hemsworth, Priyanka Chopra, and Rebel Wilson. But these are not just any photos. They are bonkers photos.\n\nThey come from the New York City set of Isn't It Romantic, a romantic comedy coming out on Valentine's Day 2019. According to Variety, it's about a \"a cynical young woman who doesn\u2019t believe in love and then wakes up one day to discover that her life has become a romantic comedy.\"\n\nPer The Hollywood Reporter, Adam Devine and Liam Hemsworth star as the lucky guys in Wilson's love triangle, \"with Devine playing a character who is stuck in the friend zone and Hemsworth the hunky object of Wilson\u2019s affections.\" As for Chopra, she will portray \"yoga ambassador Isabella,\" apparently\u2014which, okay!\n\nBut back to these photos. They are as tinged with movie magic as you'd expect for a meta romantic comedy. Each photo is worth more than a thousand words. More like a full movie of its own. I think this movie should have 127 sequels. I've done everyone the favor of coming up with the titles.
