I literally was in Texas, in my apartment, crying in my closet talking to him [Simon Fuller] trying to hide from my family because I felt weak.\"\n\nKelly Clarkson's 'Whole Lotta Woman' and 5 Others About Natural Beauty\n\nOnce she realized she couldn't get out of her role in the movie she begged Fuller to release her single before the movie dropped, and he did. \"I think that's what saved my career,\" she reasons.\n\nClarkson filmed the movie in 28 days and admits she dreaded the film's premiere. \"I got very drunk at that premiere,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI literally ended up in a fountain soaked. I was real hammered.\u201d\n\nShe also admits to briefly dating her co-star and Idol competition Justin Guarini, who placed second in the reality competition the year she won. \u201cWe were really good friends,\u201d she says. \"I think it was so heightened, so by the time everybody stopped talking about it we actually did date.\"\n\nThese days Clarkson is happily releasing music she wants to create and raising 1-year-old son Remington Alexander, and 3-year-old daughter River Rose with husband Brandon Blackstock.\n\nOh \u2014 she only watched her film that one time and will likely never see it again.", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Kelly-Clarkson-American-Idol.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Kelly-Clarkson-American-Idol.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Reuter"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/kelly-clarkson-justin-to-kelly-premiere-drunk/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Got \u2018Very Drunk\u2019 at the Premiere of Her Bad Movie", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "Kelly Clarkson was the first contestant crowned on American Idol \u2014 a major accomplishment that she says came with some less than exciting opportunities.", "keywords": "kelly clarkson, kelly clarkson american idol, kelly clarkson from justin to kelly, kelly clarkson movie, kelly clarkson film", "fb": {"app_id": 193351250697247, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 173910492638623}, "og": {"title": "Kelly Clarkson Got 'Very Drunk' at the Premiere of Her Bad Movie", "description": "Kelly Clarkson was the first contestant crowned on American Idol \u2014 a major accomplishment that she says came with some less than exciting opportunities.", "url": "https://tasteofcountry.com/kelly-clarkson-justin-to-kelly-premiere-drunk/", "site_name": "Taste of Country", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Kelly-Clarkson-American-Idol.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tasteofcountry"}, "sailthru.description": "Kelly Clarkson was the first contestant crowned on American Idol \u2014 a major accomplishment that she says came with some less than exciting opportunities.", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-16 10:00:24", "sailthru.title": "Kelly Clarkson Got \u2018Very Drunk\u2019 at the Premiere of Her Bad Movie", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, kelly-clarkson, country-music-news", "sailthru.author": "anniereuter", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Kelly-Clarkson-American-Idol.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Kelly-Clarkson-American-Idol.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "e19BTQtucrkVk-O5axdlPIIJWMrqGU-QRWcldJZvxnA", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510797624.0, "source": "http://tasteofcountry.com", "summary": ""}
