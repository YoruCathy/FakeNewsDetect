Loves it! So many fun, amazing & hilarious memories with Nicole,\" Hilton captioned the promotional picture of the two parodying the Grant Wood's famous painting, \"American Gothic.\"\n\n\"Love that this show is so timeless & iconic,\" she continued. \"And that it has brought so much happiness and laughter to people around the world. And the #Legend Tinkerbell who I love & miss very much. #TheOG\u2019s.\"\n\nNicole hasn't addressed the show's anniversary on social media today, but Paris' posts are making fans reminisce since she shared a montage of what we assume are some of Paris' favorite moments.\n\nThe first season of \"The Simple Life\" followed the two socialites (now both very successful boss ladies and entrepreneurs!) living with the Leding family on their farm in Arkansas for a month. During their tumultuous stay, they tried and failed at basically every blue-collar job that was thrown their way, and TV viewers ate it up. At its peak, millions of viewers were tuning in to watch the wealthy young women -- who had never worked a day in their lives before that -- mix and mingle with average Americans.\n\nWatch this incredible montage below to remember the priceless moment when Paris and Nicole stunned their southern hosts by having the audacity to ask, \"What is Walmart?\"", "images": ["https://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/elite-daily-logo-1.png", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/skeleton.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/03/simple-life-main-rex-1200x630.jpg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rsss-justjared-logo-cut-v2.gif", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/cdl-260x30-for-tmz3-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/19/newsletter-logo-v2-1.png", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png"], "top_img": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/03/simple-life-main-rex-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toofab Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://toofab.com/2018/12/03/paris-hilton-the-simple-life-15th-anniversary-nicole-richie-reality-show/", "title": "How Paris Hilton Honored 'The Simple Life' on 15th Anniversary of 'Timeless and Iconic' Reality Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"toofab": 116547240, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@toofab", "title": "How Paris Hilton Honored 'The Simple Life' on 15th Anniversary of 'Timeless and Iconic' Reality Show", "description": "Paris Hilton pays tribute to \"The Simple Life\" 15 years after it premiered with a must-see video for any fan craving early 2000s nostalgia.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/03/simple-life-main-rex-1200x630.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "description": "Paris Hilton pays tribute to \"The Simple Life\" 15 years after it premiered with a must-see video for any fan craving early 2000s nostalgia.", "robots": "index,follow", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://toofab.com/2018/12/03/paris-hilton-the-simple-life-15th-anniversary-nicole-richie-reality-show/", "site_name": "toofab", "type": "article", "title": "How Paris Hilton Honored 'The Simple Life' on 15th Anniversary of 'Timeless and Iconic' Reality Show", "description": "Paris Hilton pays tribute to \"The Simple Life\" 15 years after it premiered with a must-see video for any fan craving early 2000s nostalgia.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/03/simple-life-main-rex-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116046798441464, "pages": 324392354652}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TooFab"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543766400.0, "source": "http://toofab.com", "summary": ""}
