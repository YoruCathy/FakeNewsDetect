WAPA-TV next chose her to play Iris Chac\u00f3n and Daniel Guerrero's daughter in Yo s\u00e9 que ment\u00eda. She was a child actress playing an important supporting role in the story, thus became a household name.[2]\n\nA short, two chapter appearance on Vivir Para Ti followed in 1983, and after that, L\u00f3pez decided to dedicate herself to her studies. She holds a B.A. in Communications from the University of the Sacred Heart\n\nAdulthood and fame [ edit ]\n\nAfter reaching the age of maturity, she came back, participating in several plays at Puerto Rico's Teatro Tapia, San Juan's premier and oldest theater, and getting the attention of Mexican producers.\n\nShe traveled to Mexico next, after the invitation by the producers to try out there, and became a superstar in that country as well, working in many top soap operas, including Camila and the national super hit Amigas y Rivales. L\u00f3pez also participated in Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real, where she played a victim of rape that later turned lesbian.\n\nRecent years [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, L\u00f3pez participated in the soap opera Mujer de Madera. During the recording of that soap opera, her father, Luis, a respected and successful undertaker, suffered a heart attack and had to be hospitalized and operated on. L\u00f3pez was given immediate permission to travel to Puerto Rico and be with her father for as long as she needed. Her father recovered, but with only five percent of his heart working. L\u00f3pez had to return to Mexico after her father was released from the hospital, but she flew back to Puerto Rico every time that the filming schedule allowed her to. In 2011, she participated in the second season of Univision's dancing show Mira Quien Baila where she was one of the top dancers and won the competition.\n\nPersonal life and relationships [ edit ]\n\nL\u00f3pez was the wife of fellow Puerto Rican singing super star Luis Fonsi.

On November 8, 2009, Adamari L\u00f3pez and Luis Fonsi released a joint statement where they announced they were separating. They were divorced on November 8, 2010.

Her then-boyfriend, Luis Fonsi, announced at the same press conference that he was cancelling his 2005 international tour to be by her side. She was expected to recover, as her cancer was caught at \"stage 1,\" which is a very early stage, and it had not spread to other areas of her body.\n\nShe underwent cancer surgery. In 2006, it was reported that she is in remission. Since being diagnosed, she has campaigned for breast cancer awareness.[7]\n\nIn 2020, L\u00f3pez was a Weight Watchers ambassador.[8][9].
