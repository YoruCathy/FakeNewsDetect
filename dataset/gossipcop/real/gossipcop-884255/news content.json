(MGN)\n\nSinger Ariana Grande is pushing for gun control after the shooting in Las Vegas. The singer from Boca Raton took to Twitter to share her emotions.\n\n\"My heart is breaking for Las Vegas,\" Grande wrote. The 24-year-old also asked on Twitter for love, unity, and peace in the wake of the Vegas shooting that left more than 50 people dead and 500 people hospitalized.\n\n\n\nThe shooting happened Sunday night during an outdoor country music festival. The gunman, identified by police as Stephen Craig Paddock, fired from his room on the 32nd floor at the Mandalay Bay Casino before taking his own life, police said.\n\nPresident Trump called the Las Vegas shooting \"an act of pure evil.\"\n\nGrande, in calling for gun control, said people should call the worst mass shooting in U.S. history what it is: \"terrorism.\"\n\nIn May, a man set off a bomb at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The blast killed 22 people along with the attacker, according to police.\n\nGrande returned to Manchester a month later to hold a benefit concert for the victims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images":
