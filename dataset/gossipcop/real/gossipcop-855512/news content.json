I did really good!\u201d Hunt, 32, said on E!\u2019s Live from the Red Carpet in Las Vegas.\n\nImage zoom John Shearer/Getty\n\nThe country crooner married Fowler in an intimate Georgia ceremony in April, and he gushed about his newest accessory: his wedding band.\n\n\u201cIt feels great \u2014 there\u2019s a spiritual strength to it [the ring], and I feel a little bit taller now that I\u2019m wearing it,\u201d he told E!

She finally did. It was her first time to an awards show like that, and this is her second one, so I just wanted to throw her into the deep end. But she came out, and after that she was so much more comfortable even though she didn\u2019t enjoy those 30 seconds very much!\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fsam-hunt1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1329&h=696&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fsam-hunt1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1329&h=696&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fsam-hunt1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeff Nelson"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/country/billboard-music-awards-2017-sam-hunt-married-life-spiritual-wedding-ring/", "title": "Billboard Music Awards 2017: Sam Hunt Talks Marriage, Wife", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Billboard Music Awards,Couples,Music News,News,Sam Hunt", "news_keywords": "Billboard Music Awards,Couples,Music News,News,Sam Hunt", "description": "Plus, the country crooner opens up about embarrassing his wife with a surprise serenade at the ACMs in April!", "og": {"title": "Billboard Music Awards 2017: Sam Hunt Talks Marriage, Wife", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/country/billboard-music-awards-2017-sam-hunt-married-life-spiritual-wedding-ring/", "description": "Married life looks good on Sam Hunt.
