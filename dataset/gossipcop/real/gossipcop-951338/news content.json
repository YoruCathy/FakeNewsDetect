He took my phone and tweeted that last tweet. It was not me. I swear to God. Forgive him. @kumailn\u201d\n\nI\u2019m having dinner with @JoshMalina. He took my phone and tweeted that last tweet. It was not me. I swear to God. Forgive him. @kumailn \u2014 Bradley Whitford (@WhitfordBradley) July 12, 2018\n\nAlso Read: Martin Sheen Endorses Sterling K Brown For 'West Wing' Reboot President\n\nBut if they are talking about a revival, they are missing one key member of the new cast: Sterling K. Brown.\n\nLast fall, Sorkin told The Hollywood Reporter his idea for a possible reboot of the series \u2014 for which he says he has a \u201cstanding offer\u201d from NBC \u2014 saw the \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star in the Oval Office and \u201csome kind of jam\u201d brings Sheen\u2019s Josiah Bartlet in to advise Brown\u2019s POTUS \u201cin the way that Bill Clinton used to consult with Nixon.\u201d Brown tweeted soon after that he would be \u201chonored\u201d to lead that project.\n\nAnd while Sheen isn\u2019t familiar with the Emmy-winning actor\u2019s performance, he told TheWrap in March he has full faith in Sorkin\u2019s selection.\n\nAlso Read: Aaron Sorkin Suggests 'West Wing' Reboot With Sterling K Brown as President\n\n\u201cI have heard of him, but I have not seen the show, so I couldn\u2019t speak to his talent,\u201d Sheen told TheWrap. \u201cBut if Aaron were to choose him, I would have 100 percent confidence in him.\u201d\n\nNBC did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment about on the status of a possible reboot.\n\nSee Malina\u2019s picture of the \u201cWest Wing\u201d reunion below.", "images":
