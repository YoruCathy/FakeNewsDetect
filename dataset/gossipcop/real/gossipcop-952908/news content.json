And we put them all to a taste test to see if they reminded anyone of home on the range, the land of Dixie or just about anywhere else.\n\nThe Tastes of America flavored-chip lineup includes cajun spice; chile con queso; crab spice; deep dish pizza; fried pickles with ranch; lobster roll; pimento cheese; and Thai sweet chili.\n\nEach flavor was picked based on consumer feedback in different regions, said Tina Mahal, senior director of marketing at Frito-Lay.\n\n\u201cThis just a part of our DNA now, listening to consumers,\u201d said Mahal. \u201cWhat we did was tap into those places that had the inspiration that popped the most.\u201d\n\nMore Money:How billionaire entrepreneur Ted Leonsis amassed his most important asset \u2013 his network\n\nMore Money:12 Amazon Prime Day deals you didn\u2019t know you needed\n\nMahal added that Lay\u2019s took a new approach in offering these selected flavors only in the relevant regions as a part of their efforts to acknowledge consumers and their roots within those areas.\n\n\u201cPeople feel a deep connection to home,\u201d said Mahal. \u201cThey also feel that they want their brands to understand them.\u201d\n\nSo, we put them to the test. With eight unique flavors, we had our very own USA TODAY staff taste test the flavors to see if they could actually identify them and associate them with various regions.\n\nOur first participant, Marissa Surman, scored was able to associate each chip with its part of the country. The Wisconsin native found that fried pickle with ranch hit home for her.\n\n\u201cIf I know my state at all, that\u2019s definitely representing the mid-America area,\u201d said Surman.\n\nThe next volunteer, Kyle Montoya identified deep-dish pizza and Thai sweet chili right away, but couldn\u2019t distinguish lobster roll, Chile con queso and pimento cheese.\n\n\u201cI have to best honest, I don\u2019t know what I just put in my mouth,\u201d said Montoya. \u201cIt\u2019s good. I just don\u2019t know what it is\u201d\n\nChristopher Potter, became a huge fan of cajun spice and could pinpoint the flavor right away. \u201cI\u2019m tasting the cajun spice on this one for sure, you can almost see it on the chip.\u201d\n\nParticipant Maria Marzullo sounded a little hesitant at first.\n\n\u201cThey [the chips] caught me off guard but once you eat more of them they taste really good,\u201d she said.\n\nHere is Lay\u2019s Taste of America summer collection and its region:\n\n1. Cajun Spice, Central Gulf: Inspired by the Gulf Coast iconic jambalaya and blackened Cajun chicken, this bag harbors intense flavors of garlic, paprika, onion and oregano.
