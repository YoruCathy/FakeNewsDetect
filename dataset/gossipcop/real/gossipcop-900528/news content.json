Most antennas should pick up NBC since it is a broadcast network.\n\nFailing the three options above, the best course of action would be to live-stream the red carpet coverage, which will broadcast on Facebook from 6 to 8 p.m. EST. Or, you can forget about the awards entirely, and catch up on this year\u2019s Golden Globes nominees instead.", "images": ["https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/golden-globes-streaming.jpg?quality=85", "http://time.com/img/navigation/subscribe-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/golden-globes-streaming.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "canonical_link": "https://money.com/golden-globes-2018-live-free/", "title": "How to Watch the 2018 Golden Globes for Free", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "onetime,Television", "news_keywords": "golden globe awards, 75th golden globe awards, golden globes 2018, golden globes 2018 live, how to watch golden globes 2018, golden globes 2018 livestream, what time do the golden globes start, channel for golden globes, golden globes 2018 watch online, golden globes live", "description": "Want to watch the 2018 Golden Globe awards, hosted by Seth Meyers, but don't have cable?
