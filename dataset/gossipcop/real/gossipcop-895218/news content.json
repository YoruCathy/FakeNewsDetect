News at the KKW Beauty pop-up shop in the South Coast Plaza mall on Tuesday the reason her family is forgoing its epic, annual Christmas photoshoot this year. And fans who have been watching the current season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians won\u2019t be surprised by the answer.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cI have to say, thanks to last year\u2019s Christmas card, that really did just f\u2014 us over,\u201d the mom of three, 38, told the outlet. \u201cThat was so dramatic. Kris Jenner has given up. She\u2019s just like, \u2018I don\u2019t have the energy to wrangle all my kids anymore and their kids.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe reality star also revealed another big change in family traditions for 2018.\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian Pokes Fun at Her Accidental Nip Slip on The Cher Show Opening Night Red Carpet\n\n\u201cThis year is the first year ever that Kanye and I are having our Christmas Eve party at our house,\u201d Kim told E!, adding that after her younger sister Khlo\u00e9, 34, didn\u2019t make it home for Thanksgiving, she hopes she\u2019ll be able to stop by for the festive gathering \u2014 pending her boyfriend, NBA player Tristan Thompson\u2018s game schedule.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the schedule is like, but I know that she will spend Christmas Eve with us,\u201d Kim said during the interview. \u201cShe usually spends the party with us, and then she\u2019ll go out.\u201d\n\nThe heartwarming photos from the 2017 KarJenner Christmas card, which the family revealed day by day, were overshadowed by all the sibling fighting surrounding the shoot \u2014 as the premiere of the 15th season of the family\u2019s hit show revealed.\n\nImage zoom Kim Kardashian West at the KKW Beauty Pop-Up Stefanie Keenan/Getty\n\nIt all started with scheduling issues relating to Kourtney Kardashian, 39. The mother of three wanted to prioritize her kids over the rest of the family.\n\n\u201cNo one wants you in the f\u2014ing shoot. Get the f\u2014 out of here and go,\u201d snapped Kim. \u201cI need Kourtney to not be so f\u2014ing annoying with a stick up her a\u2014 like she f\u2014ing runs this s\u2014, because she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s the least exciting to look at.\u201c\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian Says Sister Kourtney Is the Most Likely to Sue Her: \u2018She Is Ruthless\u2019\n\nKourtney stormed off, but the argument continued over the phone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to be mistreated by my f\u2014ing bitch family,\u201d Kourtney said on speakerphone in the episode, sobbing. \u201cKim saying that I\u2019m the least interesting to look at \u2014 who even speaks like that? You don\u2019t say things like that. You guys just have really different values than me. I choose to be a mother to my three kids. I\u2019m not here looking for another job. I already work enough \u2014 more than I would like to. What\u2019s natural to me is being a mother. And I don\u2019t expect everyone to have the same interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would honestly think that we have more jobs, so [you should] work around our schedule,\u201d Kim fired back. \u201cYou do whatever the f\u2014 you want to do and you don\u2019t do s\u2014, so be accommodating to the people that actually do s\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll everyone f\u2014ing says is, \u2018What\u2019s your job?\u2019 \u201d Kourtney said. \u201cIf I had enough money, I wouldn\u2019t work. I wouldn\u2019t do the show. I would be a full time mom. That\u2019s what I want to do. The guilt I carry every day from not being at home when they get in from school, not doing homework \u2014 my kids suffer. Honestly, it\u2019s like, we have a disgusting family. I\u2019m ashamed to be a part of [it]. It\u2019s just gross.\u201d\n\nLater, Kim acknowledged that she\u2019d been rude, but refused to back down.\n\n\u201cThat was rude, but I wanted to be rude. Because she\u2019s so f\u2014ing rude all the time. Everything revolves around her,\u201d Kim fumed. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tolerate her f\u2014ing rudeness. I\u2019ll be 10 billion times ruder back to her, every single time. Until she just cries when she sees me. Everyone walks on f\u2014ing eggshells around her. She\u2019s f\u2014ing rude. She\u2019s so goddamn entitled. She\u2019s such a mess. Gremlin. I\u2019m not going to play around with her anymore.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The Kardashians\u2019 Very Merry Christmas Cards Through the Years\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Says Rewatching Drama on KUWTK Is \u2018Awkward\u2019 for Tristan Thompson\n\nWhen Kourtney returned to talk things over a few hours later, she was still upset.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to spend my time, whether it\u2019s my sister or not, with anybody that talks to me that way or thinks that way about me. Everybody has different priorities,\u201d she said during the episode. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you die and when I die, it doesn\u2019t matter how much money is in our bank account. What matters to me is my memories. I don\u2019t give a f\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be around people that bring me down on a daily basis,\u201d she continued, crying. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my best.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9, in an attempt to mediate, suggested that the sisters all \u201cstop judging each other\u201d and pointed to her own recent move to Cleveland.\n\n\u201cI will move to another state at some point, or another country,\u201d Kourtney interjected. \u201cI cannot wait for that day and hopefully just won\u2019t have to have these fake relationships.\u201d\n\nEventually, Kim rearranged her meetings to accommodate Kourtney\u2019s schedule and the photo shoot came to fruition \u2014 even though the tension between the sisters was clearly lingering.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1310&h=686&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkim-kardashian1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkim-kardashian1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1310&h=686&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkim-kardashian1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Hohman"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-no-karjenner-christmas-card-2018-drama/", "title": "Kim Kardashian West Says There Won't Be a KarJenner Christmas Card This Year \u2014 Here's Why", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Christmas,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,Kris Jenner,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Christmas,Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,Kris Jenner,News,TV", "description": "The Kardashian-Jenner family won't put out a Christmas card in 2018, Kim Kardashian West says", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian West Says There Won't Be a KarJenner Christmas Card This Year \u2014 Here's Why", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-no-karjenner-christmas-card-2018-drama/", "description": "The KarJenners are staying away from the drama this holiday season \u2014 or at least, they\u2019re trying to.
