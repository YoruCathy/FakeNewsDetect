{"url": "https://swoon.theodysseyonline.com/honeymoon-phase-end", "text": "This is something that I have always wondered. Through a quick Google search, it seems that this is something that tends to run its course until you get to the point in your relationship where you stop learning new things about your partner. I find this fact to be interesting because personally, I am constantly learning new things about myself and growing.\n\nMaybe it is just the place I am in my life: I am still in college and figuring out my future, but I hate to think that the meaning of this phrase is that simple.\n\nIn my experience, I have met people in their late twenties and early thirties who are still figuring themselves out and are evolving and changing each day just like I am.\n\nThus, I feel like if you are in a relationship, the honeymoon phase is something that could potentially continue for the entirety of the relationship. Further, the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d makes it seem like that there is the point in the relationship that everything is happy and sweet and after this period, the relationship isn\u2019t that great. This may be thinking too much into this, but this is one of those things that fascinates me.\n\nI would hate to think that after this imaginary period within my relationship that things are bound to go downhill just because of the fact that I know my partner better than when I first met him. In that case, it would be more logical for the relationship to not do well in the beginning because you do not know your partner and who they are that well, which could be the foundation of misunderstanding, etc.\n\nI guess I write this article to say that I think oftentimes we get caught up with such phrases and feel like somehow it dictates our relationship and the direction of it. Live your life the way you see best and whether or not the honeymoon phase is something that actually is a real phenomenon, don\u2019t allow it to dictate how you should act or feel about your relationship.", "images": ["https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=6GrUm1a4KM+2Io", "https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xNzMyMTUzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNjYxMTE1OH0._bTKgnjO0JP2PFq9sydDbDYNniO8SkRZF0f1v-lCF4c/img.jpg?width=980", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20869612&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xNzMyMTUzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNjYxMTE1OH0._bTKgnjO0JP2PFq9sydDbDYNniO8SkRZF0f1v-lCF4c/img.jpg?width=980", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nidhi Singh", "Taylor Mead", "Emily Malloy", "Olivia Kappler", "Jennifer Kustanovich", "Dr King", "Caitlin Johnston", "Lauren Barnette", "Ashley Myers"], "canonical_link": "https://swoon.theodysseyonline.com/honeymoon-phase-end", "title": "The Honeymoon Phase Never Has To End, Maybe You're Looking At This Wrong", "meta_data": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Swoon", "application-name": "Swoon", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ef38af", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.rbl.ms/static/img/whitelabel/odysseyswoon/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?1", "theme-color": "#ff0000", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@twitter", "id": 341251022}, "image": "https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xNzMyMTUzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNjYxMTE1OH0._bTKgnjO0JP2PFq9sydDbDYNniO8SkRZF0f1v-lCF4c/img.jpg?width=980"}, "fb": {"app_id": 402984699895135, "pages": 1232766503427695}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://swoon.theodysseyonline.com/honeymoon-phase-end", "site_name": "Swoon", "image": {"identifier": "https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xNzMyMTUzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYwNjYxMTE1OH0._bTKgnjO0JP2PFq9sydDbDYNniO8SkRZF0f1v-lCF4c/img.jpg?width=980", "width": 980, "height": 2000}, "description": "I would hate to think that after this imaginary period within my relationship that things are bound to go downhill.", "title": "The Honeymoon Phase Never Has To End, Maybe You're Looking At This Wrong"}, "article": {"publisher": 1232766503427695, "published_time": "2018-02-20T21:13:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-22T17:15:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/1232766503427695"}, "referrer": "always", "description": "Is this a real phenomemnon?", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "google-site-verification": "djogUE-B3y4KQ0xxTG-nyB3W5aGMBns_A0_bs_yunTE"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519161231.0, "source": "https://swoon.theodysseyonline.com", "summary": ""}
