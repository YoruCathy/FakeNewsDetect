Martin, who came out as gay in 2010, said that the series' portrayal of LGBT issues is precisely why he agreed to play the role of Antonio D'Amico, Versace's longtime boyfriend.\n\nMartin also told Noah that it wasn't easy going public with his own sexuality.\n\n\"It was extremely painful for me,\" he said. \"Until I said, 'I can't take it anymore.' It's all about me now, it's not about what's happening outside, it's about what i need in order to be happy.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nHe said close friends and colleagues warned him not to come out, suggesting that it could ruin his career. But he said he had to for the sake of his two sons, Matteo and Valentino.\n\n\"I said, 'I have to come out.' I mean, am I going to lie to these beautiful kids?\" Martin recalled.\n\nMartin also said that his efforts to help his native Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria has raised more than $5 million. He hopes to partner with Habitat for Humanity to begin building homes. Some 1.5 million people remain without electricity or water after Hurricane Maria devastated the island on Sept. 20.\n\nRelated: Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez Open Up About Relief Trip to Puerto Rico\n\nRelated: Inside Ricky Martin's $13.5 Million Beverly Hills Mansion", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/screenshot.png?h=9e68610a&itok=sSZthWbk", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2016-12/640_ricky_martin_matteo_valentinto_jwan_getty629042178.jpg?itok=5ReSlhUJ", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-01/screenshot.png?h=9e68610a&itok=EH4zCfuA", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/screenshot.png?h=9e68610a&itok=sSZthWbk", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Haas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/ricky-martin-opens-about-coming-out-gay-it-was-extremely-painful-94504", "title": "Ricky Martin Opens Up About Coming Out as Gay: It Was 'Extremely Painful'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Ricky Martin Opens Up About Coming Out as Gay: It Was 'Extremely Painful' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ricky-martin-opens-about-coming-out-gay-it-was-extremely-painful-94504", "title": "Ricky Martin Opens Up About Coming Out as Gay: It Was 'Extremely Painful'", "description": "Puerto Rican singer, actor, starring in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story as Versace's boyfriend", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/screenshot.png?h=9e68610a&itok=sSZthWbk", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Puerto Rican singer, actor, starring in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story as Versace's boyfriend", "title": "Ricky Martin Opens Up About Coming Out as Gay: It Was 'Extremely Painful'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Brian Haas\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ricky-martin-opens-about-coming-out-gay-it-was-extremely-painful-94504", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/screenshot.png?h=9e68610a&itok=sSZthWbk"}, "description": "Puerto Rican singer, actor, starring in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story as Versace's boyfriend", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "TV, Music, Ricky Martin, Trevor Noah", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
