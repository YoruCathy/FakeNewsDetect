And I get to wear the school sweatshirt and hold a trombone. https://t.co/xPNEE681J4 \u2014 David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) October 29, 2017\n\n\u201cThe idea of me in a small size sweatshirt of some high school, holding a trombone with this poor girl trying to take her high school photos seriously, I just thought that was so funny,\u201d Harbour later told ThisIsInsider.com about why he replied.\n\nThe post soon garnered thousands of likes, with Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers in the show) giving Fregoso\u2019s cause a helping hand:\n\nCome on guys, go retweet, I need to this picture pic.twitter.com/1tS2T6gxAw \u2014 Noah Schnapp (@noah_schnapp) October 29, 2017\n\nFregoso, who attends Orestimba High School in Newman, soon hit her hoped-for tally \u2015 and Harbour vowed to fulfill his promise:\n\nHoly hell, internet. How can you be in favor of this? Friends don\u2019t lie. @posttdamaris DM me... https://t.co/xPNEE681J4 \u2014 David Harbour (@DavidKHarbour) October 30, 2017\n\nThree months after Fregoso\u2019s initial tweet, Harbour made her dream come true when the pair posed for the snaps at Netflix\u2019s Los Angeles\u2019 HQ earlier this week.\n\nHarbour shared the photos, in which he\u2019s playing a trombone and wearing an Orestimba High School sweatshirt (as per his conditions), to Instagram on Friday:\n\nA post shared by David Harbour (@dkharbour) on Jan 12, 2018 at 1:18pm PST\n\n\u201cVoted most likely to hijack someone\u2019s high school senior photos 24 years later,\u201d Harbour wrote. Fregoso also shared some of the images on Twitter:\n\nsenior photos '18\n\n\n\n-bunny ears\n\n-trombone\n\n-pompoms\n\nand\n\n-smiles pic.twitter.com/8Nccv5adK1 \u2014 damaris \u25df\u033d\u25de\u033d (@postydamaris) January 13, 2018\n\n\u201cWell this is certainly something I didn\u2019t think would actually happen!\u201d Fregoso wrote in a subsequent Instagram post. \u201cDavid is such a sweet dude!\u201d\n\nA post shared by damaris fregoso (@postydamaris) on Jan 11, 2018 at 1:11am PST\n\nPhotographer Tommy Garcia said he enjoyed taking the pictures:\n\nI don\u2019t always take senoir portraits, but when I do, it\u2019s because @postydamaris gets 25k+ retweets and @DavidKHarbour agrees to take them with her as long as he is allowed to hold a trombone. \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/XTmYjrvm9r \u2014 Tommy Garcia (@iamtommyg) January 12, 2018\n\nDamaris\u2019 school, meanwhile, appeared proud of its student:\n\nDamaris, one of our seniors, just took her senior photos with @DavidKHarbour !!!\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9b pic.twitter.com/JKSrvW5Y8Y \u2014 Orestimba High (@_WARRIORPRIDE) January 11, 2018\n\nThe shoot also went down well on Twitter:\n\nTHIS IS FANTASTIC: David Harbour agreed to take high school yearbook photo with girl if she got 25k RTs. She did.

It's still hard to believe that I met him, but I thank you, for the continuous love and support on all my social medias! y'all are too sweet! much love xoxo \u2014 damaris \u25df\u033d\u25de\u033d (@postydamaris) January 13, 2018\n\n\u201cI feel strange to have my photos be the talk of the town,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cBut i\u2019m glad I could share them with everyone who helped make this happen!\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d243183250000b21ae9cc35.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a59f8731f00003c00db8917.jpeg?cache=2oezzmflai&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a59f8731f00003c00db8917.jpeg?cache=2oezzmflai&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/david-harbour-senior-high-school-photos-viral_n_5a59f0cce4b03c418965ece0", "title": "David Harbour Hijacks Student's Senior Photos After Twitter Joke Goes Viral", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"Well this is certainly something I didn't think would actually happen!\"", "keywords": "Twitter,Stranger Things,David Harbour", "og": {"title": "David Harbour Hijacks Student's Senior Photos After Twitter Joke Goes Viral", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a59f8731f00003c00db8917.jpeg?cache=2oezzmflai&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a59f8731f00003c00db8917.jpeg?cache=2oezzmflai&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/david-harbour-senior-high-school-photos-viral_n_5a59f0cce4b03c418965ece0", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"Well this is certainly something I didn't think would actually happen!\""}, "article": {"tag": "Twitter,Stranger Things,David Harbour", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/leemoranjournalist/", "published_time": "2018-01-13 08:51:32 -0500", "modified_time": "2018-01-18 09:34:30 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "David Harbour Hijacks Student's Senior Photos After Twitter Joke Goes Viral", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a59f8731f00003c00db8917.jpeg?cache=2oezzmflai&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"Well this is certainly something I didn't think would actually happen!\"", "creator": "Lee_Moran"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a59f0cce4b03c418965ece0", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515851492.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
