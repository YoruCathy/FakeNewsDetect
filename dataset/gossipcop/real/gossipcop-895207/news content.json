I was within his grasp just one year before he committed brutal murder in 1969,\u201d the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d star tweeted Monday. \u201cLuck was with me when a cousin and I went horseback riding at the Span Ranch, and saw the little man with crazy eyes whom the other hippies called Charlie.\u201d\n\nCult leader Manson, who was convicted along with his Manson Family followers of killing seven people over two horrific nights in 1969, died Sunday at the age of 83.\n\nCranston has previously talked about running into Manson before he and and his crew committed the killings, when Cranston was a 12-year-old growing up in the Canoga Park section of Los Angeles.\n\nThe future star was riding horses with his teenage cousin at Spahn Ranch \u2014 a ranch used for filming Western movies and TV shows whose owner, George Spahn, allowed Manson and his murderous acolytes to live there rent-free in exchange for performing odd jobs.\n\nCranston and his cousin were checking out their horses when a man in his 20s started yelling, \u201cCharlie\u2019s on the hill!\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody looked around, and there was this frantic nervous energy going on, and they all jumped on horses and away they went,\u201d Cranston told the Daily Beast last year. \u201cWe asked the old guy [Spahn] what was going on, and he said, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s happened before.\u2019 We thought, \u2018Well, Charlie must be someone important.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCranston\u2019s cousin, who was about a year-and-a-half older than he, would have been about the same age as Dianne Lake, Manson\u2019s youngest devotee, when she joined his \u201cfamily\u201d at the age of 14 in 1967.\n\nCranston and his cousin rode out to find \u201cCharlie\u201d and see what all the fuss was about \u2014 and there they found a drugged-out Manson, who still oozed charisma despite being whacked out of his gourd, Cranston recalled.\n\n\u201cThere were about eight or so people, and there was a man in the middle on a horse, but he wasn\u2019t holding his own reins \u2014 there was someone on the horse in front holding the reins \u2014 and Charlie, I guessed, was this comatose, bearded, long-haired guy with big eyes riding as if he\u2019s just stuck to the back of a horse. Totally zoned out. You couldn\u2019t take your eyes off him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy cousin turned back to me and said, \u2018Wow, that guy\u2019s weird.\u2019 When we passed him and their whole group, she turned around again and said, \u2018That must be Charlie,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yeah \u2026 and Charlie\u2019s freaky!\u2019 We didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d\n\nThe kids instantly recalled Charlie when news of the murders broke.\n\n\u201cI saw his face on the news, and my jaw dropped,\u201d Cranston said. \u201cMy cousin called me first and said, \u2018Can you believe this?\u2019 The picture of Charlie Manson was the guy on the back of this horse. And we thought for a second, oh my God, what if? It was very freaky, to say the least. Oh, man.\u201d", "images": ["https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bryan1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bryan1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/bryan1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["November"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/11/20/bryan-cranston-recalls-chilling-encounter-with-charles-manson/", "title": "Bryan Cranston recounts chilling encounter with Charles Manson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
