I don\u2019t really see myself as her older brother. We\u2019re equal partners when it comes down to it. B.G. is just so mature for his age. It\u2019s a pretty strong bond.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Life After Michael: How Jackson\u2019s Kids Have Struggled And Succeeded After His Death\n\nThe three collaborated over Halloween to design mazes and a haunted house for the second annual Costume for a Cause event. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s bred into us, to really give back to the community,\u201d Prince explained. \u201cMy dad always taught me to lead by example, so I hope I can set a good example that you can have fun by helping other people and you can make a change just by doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he would definitely be proud of the type of work that we\u2019re doing and giving back to the community,\u201d added Prince, who started his own charitable foundation dedicated to helping foster children who have aged out of the system called Heal Los Angeles.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1077&h=564&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fparis-jackson.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fparis-jackson4-1-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1077&h=564&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fparis-jackson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/paris-jackson-shares-rare-childhood-home-video-prince-birthday/", "title": "Paris Jackson Shares Rare Childhood Home Video to Celebrate Big Brother Prince's Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Michael Jackson,Music News,News,Paris Jackson,Prince Michael Jackson", "news_keywords": "Michael Jackson,Music News,News,Paris Jackson,Prince Michael Jackson", "description": "Paris Jackson is taking a trip down memory lane\u00a0\u2014 and giving fans a rare glimpse into her super private childhood", "og": {"title": "Paris Jackson Shares Rare Childhood Home Video to Celebrate Big Brother Prince's Birthday", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/paris-jackson-shares-rare-childhood-home-video-prince-birthday/", "description": "Paris Jackson is taking a trip down memory lane&nbsp;\u2014 and giving fans a rare glimpse into her super private childhood.
