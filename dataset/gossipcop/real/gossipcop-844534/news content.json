Think again.\n\nSerena Williams is pregnant!! \ufe0f\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/u2RfhSzlcB \u2014 Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) April 19, 2017\n\nCongratulations are in order for both Williams and fiance Alexis Ohanian, as the woman behind the Serena Slam sensation has revealed that she's pregnant with their first child. Her publicist, Kelly Bush Novak, confirmed to TODAY that Williams is \"expecting a baby this fall.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nRELATED: After Australian Open win, Serena Williams posts loving tribute to sister Venus\n\nOn Wednesday, Williams posted a brief blink-and-you'd-miss-it Snapchat story showing off a sporty yellow swimsuit and what seemed to be a baby bump.\n\n\"20 weeks,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nRELATED: Serena Williams names her top tennis player of all time, and the move she'd steal\n\nBuzzfeed's Jarett Wieselman captured the shot before it vanished and shared it on Twitter \u2014 along with several exclamation points and a couple of heart emoji.\n\nAnd for those doing the math in their heads, yes, 20 weeks along means that Williams was already 9 weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open women's singles championship in January!\n\nThis isn't be the first time Williams has surprised fans by sharing big personal news in the form of a picture.\n\nIn December, she and Reddit co-founder Ohanian took to his site to announce their engagement with a cartoon of the moment he (or rather his avatar) got down on one knee.\n\nShe said \"yes,\" and Ohanian replied to the post to say, \"And you made me the happiest man on the planet.\"", "images":
