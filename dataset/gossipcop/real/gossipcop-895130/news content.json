The film will also feature Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, and Alfre Woodard as Sarabi. Actors like John Oliver, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and Eric Andr\u00e9 round out the cast.\n\nDisney\u2019s trend of turning its animated classics into live-action remakes has been a steady part of the studio\u2019s output for years now, with everything from Alice in Wonderland to Beauty and the Beast getting the treatment. But Jon Favreau\u2019s 2016 adaption of The Jungle Book stood out by combining live-action elements along with near-photorealistic computer-generated animals and environments. The result was a technological marvel that felt like it could stand on its own, apart from the nostalgia-fueled interest many of the other remakes have tended to thrive on.\n\nIt\u2019s that same approach that the filmmaker is applying to The Lion King. The original film, released in 1994, tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is destined to become ruler of the animal kingdom \u2014 only to have his villainous uncle intervene. The film won two Academy Awards, and in the decades since has become a modern Disney classic, earning theatrical re-releases in both IMAX and 3D. Given that Favreau\u2019s new version will be iterating upon the achievements of The Jungle Book, it will no doubt be an incredible achievement in terms of visuals and effects \u2014 with a diverse cast of stars delivering performances to match. The Lion King will arrive in theaters on July 19th, 2019.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDTgFbEjoT8yLNpaVayO5bGoVwU=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3u10lRG-Se8ZBFnjCKEPIzAlnqA=/0x0:3000x2106/1200x800/filters:focal(1065x494:1545x974)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57431463/621183062.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDTgFbEjoT8yLNpaVayO5bGoVwU=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryan Bishop", "Nov"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16596124/disney-the-lion-king-beyonce-cast-announcement", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "published_time": "2017-11-01T20:21:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-01T20:21:21-04:00"}, "author": "Bryan Bishop", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/e8584abde1fc118cbb44d8e68e9902bc/tools.css", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Jon Favreau\u2019s cast just gets more and more impressive", "og": {"description": "Jon Favreau\u2019s cast just gets more and more impressive", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDTgFbEjoT8yLNpaVayO5bGoVwU=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "alt": "Hillary Clinton Campaigns In Key Swing States", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "The Verge", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16596124/disney-the-lion-king-beyonce-cast-announcement"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16596124/disney-the-lion-king-beyonce-cast-announcement", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "description": "Jon Favreau\u2019s cast just gets more and more impressive", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDTgFbEjoT8yLNpaVayO5bGoVwU=/0x0:3000x1571/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "alt": "Hillary Clinton Campaigns In Key Swing States"}, "site": "verge"}, "sailthru.title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "sailthru.tags": "general,the-verge,front-page,entertainment,film,culture", "sailthru.description": "Jon Favreau\u2019s cast just gets more and more impressive", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-01T20:21:21-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qO-3qXbhxJ2pQ9ND47i2Cc8iXms=/0x0:3000x1688/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57431461/621183062.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6G-x2hVdrnB6PepsRw9t3xV-dw8=/252x0:2358x2106/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57431461/621183062.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/7396113/221a67c8-a10f-11e6-8fae-983107008690.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#393092", "outbrainsection": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509465600.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
