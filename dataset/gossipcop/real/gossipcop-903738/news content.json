{"url": "https://ew.com/gallery/ranking-bachelorette-seasons/", "text": "The sixth Bachelorette almost never had her own season of the reality franchise: On Jake Pavelka\u2019s season 14 (aka The Bachelor: On the Wings of Love), Ali made history by putting her career ahead of a man \u2014 gasp! She quit The Bachelor instead of her job\u2026 but then she wound up quitting anyway and becoming the Bachelorette. Thankfully for us she did, because her season offered up Justin \u201cRated R\u201d Rego and Kasey Kahl. The images of Justin trying to flee the show while in a foot cast and Kasey being stranded on a glacier are some of the best of the series to date. And on top of all that, Ali and Robert made a pretty cute couple, even if it wasn\u2019t forever. \u2014Dalene Rovenstine", "images":
