K\u00e1ra McCullough, our new reigning Miss USA, sparked controversy during Sunday night\u2019s crowning due to her polarizing opinions on two separate issues: feminism and health care. Unlike so many of our elected politicians, McCullough\u2019s soundbites were definitive, articulate, and to the point. But it was the content of McCullough\u2019s politics, not her delivery, that left viewers sounding off on social media well into Monday morning. To recap, Miss District of Columbia became an unconventional alt-right darling by insisting that health care is a privilege, not a right. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to say it is a privilege,\u201d McCullough offered during the 30-second question and answer portion of the pageant. \u201cAs a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that to have health care, you need to have jobs.\u201d\n\nMuch to the chagrin of Twitter eggs everywhere, the 25-year-old McCullough has since clarified her position on health care, explaining on Good Morning America that, \u201cI am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right, and I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.\u201d But McCullough is less likely to backtrack on her other controversial opinion of the night\u2014the revelation that she self-identifies not as a feminist, but as an equalist. \u201cI try not to consider myself this die-hard, like, I don\u2019t really care about men,\u201d she infamously insisted on Sunday night\u2019s broadcast. During a victory tour interview at the top of New York\u2019s Empire State Building, a wind-blown McCullough (complete with sash and crown) doubles down on her decision to identify as an equalist. \u201cI\u2019m just about being equal,\u201d McCullough tells The Daily Beast, before insisting that, \u201cI\u2019m all about women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nAs a scientist at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a degree in radiochemistry, McCullough has experience succeeding in a traditionally male-dominated field. In fact, she\u2019s consistently spoken out about the importance of supporting women and girls in STEM, a platform that, for many, made her reluctance to call herself a feminist even more surprising. Still, McCullough insists, \u201cI do want to see women flourish in just every aspect of life, whether it is in the medical sciences, or whether it\u2019s in the government agencies and in STEM. I\u2019m just saying in total we have to look at ourselves as, \u2018we are equal.\u2019\u201d McCullough pauses and smiles before reaching for a pageant conclusion: \u201cWomen have made so many strides, and I\u2019m looking forward to this next generation of women coming up.\u201d\n\nEqualism aside, McCullough has been heralded as an outstanding role model on multiple fronts: not just as a black female scientist, but as a pageant beauty who insists on wearing her natural curls. McCullough concedes that in a time when images of natural black hair are still under-represented in pop culture, her decision was, of course, a deliberate one. \u201cWhen I came to the conclusion to wear my hair natural, I wanted to be authentic,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd I feel the most liberated and happy with my natural curly hair. Typically, you don\u2019t really see women on the pageant stage with their natural hair. You\u2019re always told to straighten your hair, that it looks more professional, it looks more put together.\u201d McCullough stops just short of explaining the racism intrinsic to this particular brand of pageant advice\u2014we are at an Empire State Building press junket, after all\u2014and chooses her next words carefully. \u201cI wasn\u2019t necessarily trying to challenge the status quo,\u201d she continues. \u201cI just wanted to be comfortable. And that\u2019s the message that I want to send to so many young women: do what makes you comfortable.\u201d\n\nTen years ago, Miss USA would most likely be answering questions about her exercise routine or her favorite home-cooked meal. But, perhaps given the pageant\u2019s history as a part of Donald Trump\u2019s extensive entertainment portfolio, politics appear to have become a part of the competition. McCullough seems up to the challenge of wearing the crown during one of the most turbulent political moments in recent memory. In fact, she\u2019s excited that Sunday\u2019s Miss USA amounted to more than just channel surfing fodder. \u201cWe\u2019re starting a conversation!\u201d She exclaims. \u201cWe\u2019re pressing on issues that are prominent in our nation right now\u2026Everyone has an opinion, and I\u2019m glad.\u201d\n\nMcCullough insists that while \u201cI don\u2019t have a political agenda, I\u2019m not trying to be a politician,\u201d she\u2019s open to using her platform to discuss more political issues in the future. \u201cIf matters are pressing on my heart, and I feel as if I\u2019m the one involved in that type of situation, then sure, I\u2019ll speak out about it,\u201d she offers, before concluding that, \u201cI\u2019m just trying to go with the flow.\u201d\n\nAs for her personal reaction to all of the backlash her pageant responses elicited, from doting conservatives to disappointed liberals, our reigning Miss USA has a perfectly patriotic answer: \u201cThat\u2019s what social media\u2019s about, and that\u2019s what America\u2019s about.\u201d Land of freedom of expression, and home of the tweets.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2559,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494979466/170516-zimmerman-miss-usa-tease_gvak4z", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2559,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494979466/170516-zimmerman-miss-usa-tease_gvak4z", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2559,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494979466/170516-zimmerman-miss-usa-tease_gvak4z", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/miss-usa-2017-clarifies-controversial-stance-on-feminism-im-all-about-womens-rights", "title": "Miss USA Kara McCullough Clarifies Controversial Stance on Feminism: \u2018I\u2019m All About Women\u2019s Rights\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Miss USA Kara McCullough Clarifies Controversial Stance on Feminism: \u2018I\u2019m All About Women\u2019s Rights\u2019", "keywords": "Miss USA", "og": {"title": "Miss USA Kara McCullough Clarifies Controversial Stance on Feminism: \u2018I\u2019m All About Women\u2019s Rights\u2019", "description": "Newly crowned Miss USA K\u00e1ra McCullough denounced the word \u201cfeminism\u201d during Sunday night\u2019s pageant, but tells The Daily Beast, \u201cI\u2019m just about being equal.\u201d", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/05/16/miss-usa-2017-clarifies-controversial-stance-on-feminism-im-all-about-womens-rights", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2559,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494979466/170516-zimmerman-miss-usa-tease_gvak4z"}, "description": "Newly crowned Miss USA K\u00e1ra McCullough denounced the word \u201cfeminism\u201d during Sunday night\u2019s pageant, but tells The Daily Beast, \u201cI\u2019m just about being equal.\u201d", "authors": "Amy Zimmerman", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2017-05-17T08:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/amy-zimmerman"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@ahzimm", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2559,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1494979466/170516-zimmerman-miss-usa-tease_gvak4z"}, "sailthru.date": "2017-05-17T08:00:00.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2017-05-31T08:00:00.000Z", "publicationDate": 201705170800, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Amy Zimmerman\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/miss-usa-2017-clarifies-controversial-stance-on-feminism-im-all-about-womens-rights\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\",\"rubric\":\"EQUALIST\"},\"post_id\":\"articles/2017/05/16/miss-usa-2017-clarifies-controversial-stance-on-feminism-im-all-about-womens-rights\",\"pub_date\":\"2017-05-17T08:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"tags\":[\"Miss USA\",\"typeArticle\"],\"title\":\"Miss USA Kara McCullough Clarifies Controversial Stance on Feminism: \u2018I\u2019m All About Women\u2019s Rights\u2019\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495008000.0, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
