Twitter took special interest in the pineapple theory.\n\n\u201cStill don\u2019t definitively know who killed #JonBenet but my question is, who tf eats a bowl of pineapple with milk?! #ThatsCrazy,\u201d said one twitterer.\n\n\u201cIf having pizza with Burke Ramsey make sure you get him the Hawaiian. Guy would kill for some pineapple. #thecaseofjonbenet #JonBenet,\u201d joked another.\n\nUproar over the pineapple stems from a bowl filled with pineapple and milk found on a table by investigators, who said autopsy results revealed partially-digested pineapple in JonBenet\u2019s stomach. Theory holds that Burke was eating the pineapple when his sister swiped some, and then he struck her with a flashlight in a fit of rage, accidentally killing her. The theory also maintains that parents John and Patsy Ramsey covered up the incident.\n\nAlso Read: JonBenet Ramsey Special Cut Back to 4 Hours at CBS\n\nThe investigators also revealed that Burke had hit JonBenet with a golf club a year earlier after \u201closing his temper.\u201d\n\nNaturally, there were those who wanted to believe.\n\n\u201c@CBS I really believe your team solved the murder. #Burke killed his sister. I hope one day there will be #Justice for #JonBenet,\u201d one of the show\u2019s more fervent viewers tweeted.\n\n\u201cPUT THIS CBS JONBENET SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM IN CHARGE OF ALL MYSTERIES PLEASE,\u201d posted another, fighting through a broken Caps Lock button.\n\nHowever, there were those who felt no closer to closure than they did before the series aired.\n\nAlso Read: Katy Perry Is JonBenet Ramsey?
