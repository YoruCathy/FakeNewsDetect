She also tucked her hair into a neat little bun.\n\nThe ensemble is a stark contrast to the more muted tones Meghan has been wearing since becoming a royal. However, Meghan\u2019s wardrobe choices are likely intentional. After all, the duchess has attended many events with Queen Elizabeth II, and Dishaw suspected Meghan aligned her fashion choices for these events to not overshadow the importance of those events or the other members of her new family that were with her. As for the Duke of Sussex, Harry looked snazzy in a blue suit.\n\nHowever, Meghan isn\u2019t the first royal to wear the bright color. Kate Middleton has worn yellow to many occasions. Princess Diana also wore yellow to several events\n\n\n\nHeld at the Marlborough House, the event invited young leaders from across the Commonwealth to discuss how they hope to shape the future of their states by the year 2040. The leaders focus on a number of topics, including human rights, health climate change, peace and democracy.\n\nHer Majesty appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador in April 2018, so the event was a significant one for the Duke of Sussex. He expressed his excitement during a speech at the event.\n\n[wdi_feed id=\u201d1\u2033]", "images": ["https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d4.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/World-stars-mag-updated1.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d2.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/99C65CE6-AD6D-44AD-A83F-1DB65A078F86-145x100.jpeg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/lg-web2.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_5405-375x195.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/swift2-145x100.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_5426-145x100.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/C3B2D2F9-61EA-4E78-A964-F23CDD863593-145x100.jpeg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-2.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_2399-.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3783.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d3.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/d1.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_3764.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/xx-1-375x195.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/World-stars-mag-updated1-1-1024x576.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_5303-145x100.jpg", "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/IMG_4136-145x100.jpg", "http://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://worldstarsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/d4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://worldstarsmag.com/2018/07/05/meghan-markle-epitomizes-summer-chic-yellow-brandon-maxwell-dress/", "title": "Meghan Markle Epitomizes Summer Chic In Yellow Brandon Maxwell Dress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Epitomizes Summer Chic In Yellow Brandon Maxwell Dress - Magazine", "description": "Olivia Anderson \u2013 World Stars Mag Meghan Markle looked sunny and chic on Thursday when she attended a reception for the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge in London with Prince Harry.
