The former couple and their significant others reunited to celebrate the holiday with their kids \u2014 Apple, 14, and Moses, 12 \u2014 a source tells People. \"They\u2019re a total modern family and had a great time celebrating together,\u201d the insider shared.\n\n\n\nIt seems like Johnson is becoming closer to Martin's family. The Fifty Shades of Grey star, 29, and Coldplay frontman, 41, were spotted together for the first time over a year ago. Just last month, rumors swirled that Johnson was pregnant when she celebrated her birthday at Martin's house with pink and blue balloons, which some people confused for gender reveal party props.\n\nBut Johnson was quick to shut down rumors that she and the musician were expecting a child together. She explained that the balloon colors were just a coincidence\u2014and maybe a poor color scheme choice. \"The only thing I'm pregnant with is a lot of really good ideas,\" she told Ellen Degeneres shortly after the rumors spread. \"But not any babies.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Paltrow just tied the knot with producer Brad Falchuk in an intimate celebration in The Hamptons.\n\nAlthough Martin and Johnson were not in attendance for the nuptials, the exes \u2014 and even Falchuk and Martin \u2014 remain on very good terms. In November last year, Paltrow shared a photo of Martin and Falchuk spending time together. \"Sunday brunch #modernfamily,\" she joked on Instagram.\n\nPaltrow often shares snaps of Martin with their children, too. \"Happy Father\u2019s Day cajm, you are a ray of sunshine \u2600\ufe0f,\" Paltrow wrote in June as a tribute to her ex.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-461902999-1-1543254810.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.689xh;0,0.0398xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-461902999-1-1543254810.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.689xh;0,0.0398xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isabel Greenberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25306084/gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson-thanksgiving/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Spent Thanksgiving with Ex-Husband Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Had Thanksgiving with Chris Martin & Dakota Johnson", "description": "Talk about a modern family.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25306084/gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson-thanksgiving/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-461902999-1-1543254810.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.689xh;0,0.0398xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-11-26 06:37:27", "published_time": "2018-11-26 06:14:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-461902999-1-1543254810.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.689xh;0,0.0398xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Spent Thanksgiving with Ex-Husband Chris Martin and Dakota Johnson", "description": "Talk about a modern family.\u00a0According to reports, Gwyneth Paltrow and new hubby Brad Falchuk spent Thanksgiving with her ex-husband Chris Martin and his girlfriend, actress Dakota Johnson.
