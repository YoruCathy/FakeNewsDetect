He was 34.\n\nDias\u2019 body was reportedly found in his Brooklyn apartment on Saturday after friends became concerned when they hadn\u2019t heard from him.\n\nDays before, Dias had allegedly taken what a friend believed to be LSD or mushrooms and \u201cfreaked out\u201d before retreating to his room, according to TMZ, which first broke the news of his death.
