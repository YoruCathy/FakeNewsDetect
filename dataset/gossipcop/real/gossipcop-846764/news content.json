It will begin Sept. 19 in the United States and end in Japan in early December.\n\nAll tickets go on sale on Friday, May 5 (excluding Japan) via local ticketing agents. Those sales begin just a week ahead of the debut of Styles\u2019 self-titled debut album, which will be released May 12.\n\nFan registration for all North American dates has commenced, though supplies are limited. To prevent other vendors from re-selling tickets at higher prices, concert-goers can sign up for Ticketmaster\u2019s Verified Fan program.\n\nStyles began promoting the tour with performances of his new tracks on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and BBC\u2019s \u201cThe Graham Norton Show\u201d earlier in April. He will kick off the NBC \u201cToday\u201d Show Summer Concert Series on May 9, followed by a week-long residency on CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Late Late Show\u201d with James Corden May 15-18.\n\nSee the complete list of dates below:\n\n9/19: San Francisco, CA, The Masonic\n\n9/20: Los Angeles, CA, The Greek Theatre\n\n9/25: Nashville, TN, Ryman Auditorium\n\n9/26: Chicago, IL, The Chicago Theatre\n\n9/28: New York, NY, Radio City Music Hall\n\n9/30: Boston, MA, Wang Theatre\n\n10/1: Washington, D.C., DAR Constitution Hall\n\n10/4: Toronto, ON, Massey Hall\n\n10/5: Upper Darby, PA, Tower Theater\n\n10/8: Atlanta, GA, Roxy\n\n10/10: Irving, TX, The Pavilion at Irving Music Factory\n\n10/11: Austin, TX, ACL Live at The Moody Theater\n\n10/14: Phoenix, AZ, Comerica Theatre\n\n10/25: Paris, France, L\u2019Olympia\n\n10/27: Cologne, Germany, Palladium\n\n10/29: London, U.K., Eventim Apollo\n\n10/30: London, U.K., Eventim Apollo\n\n11/1: Manchester, U.K., O2 Apollo Manchester\n\n11/2: Glasgow, U.K., SEC Armadillo\n\n11/5: Stockholm, Sweden, Fryshuset\n\n11/7: Berlin, Germany, Tempodrome\n\n11/8: Amsterdam, Netherlands, AFAS Live\n\n11/10: Milan, Italy, Alcatraz\n\n11/23: Singapore, The Star Theatre\n\n11/26: Sydney, Australia, Enmore Theatre\n\n11/30: Australia, Melbourne, Forum Theatre\n\n12/2: Auckland, New Zealand, Spark Arena\n\n12/7: Tokyo, Japan, EX Theater\n\n12/8: Tokyo, Japan, EX Theater\n\nIt is not currently known which opening acts, if any, will be joining the former One Direction lead singer on tour.\n\nStyles in managed by Jeffrey Azoff of Full Stop Management and booked by CAA.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/harry-styles.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Fharry-styles-live-on-tour-dates-1202403013%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202403013", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/harry-styles.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Ahern"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/harry-styles-live-on-tour-dates-1202403013/", "title": "Harry Styles Announces 2017 World Tour Dates", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Harry Styles has announced the dates for his first solo world tour since leaving One Direction, Harry Styles Live On Tour.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202403013, "author": "Sarah Ahern", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-04-28T12:46:32"}, "pmc-tag": "Harry Styles,One Direction,Twitter", "title": "Harry Styles Announces 2017 World Tour Dates", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "music", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harry Styles Announces 2017 World Tour Dates", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/harry-styles-live-on-tour-dates-1202403013/", "description": "Harry Styles took to Twitter Friday morning to announce the dates for his first solo world tour, Harry Styles Live On Tour.
