It\u2019s not a disaster, but it does represent Schumer\u2019s lowest opening for a film yet.\n\n\u201cIn terms of her career trajectory, it\u2019s been a declining scale,\u201d box office analyst Jeff Bock said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of her finding her feet. She\u2019s relatively new on the scene.\u201d\n\nThe comedian made her film debut alongside Bill Hader in 2015\u2019s hit \u201cTrainwreck.\u201d The incisive rom-com, written by Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, bowed with $30 million and went on to earn $110 million. That\u2019s an impressive tally, particularly for a genre that has struggled to live up to the glory years of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts. Audiences were familiar with Schumer\u2019s prolific stand-up career and her Comedy Central show, and no doubt were eager to see her tackle the big screen.\n\n\u201cTrainwreck\u201d proved to be a tough act to follow. Her next leading role, last year\u2019s \u201cSnatched,\u201d opened with $19 million. The comedy, written by Katie Dippold and directed by Jonathan Levine, earned a disappointing $45 million and some blistering reviews.\n\n\u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d has also struggled critically, earning a 33% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, along with a 31% average audience score. It has inspired a number of hot takes for its somewhat muddled message of body acceptance. Schumer has since addressed criticism, saying the film was unfairly judged based on the trailer and not the movie\u2019s theme of empowerment.\n\nAlthough she dropped out of Sony\u2019s live-action \u201cBarbie\u201d movie due to scheduling conflicts, it may have been for the best given the similar image-centric storyline as \u201cI Feel Pretty.\u201d Aside from a brief detour into drama with 2017\u2019s \u201cThank You For Your Service,\u201d Schumer\u2019s big-screen roles have largely been in the same vein. The question now remains: just how much is Schumer willing to stretch her material beyond the themes of her appearance?\n\n\u201cIf she wants to have a long career, that\u2019s essential,\u201d Bock said. \u201cAudiences do get tired of the same movie over and over.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something audiences might get to see soon, as the comedic drama \u201cShe Came to Me,\u201d is one of her more promising future projects. Schumer will appear alongside Steve Carell and Nicole Kidman in the film that\u2019s still in pre-production, written and directed by Rebecca Miller.\n\n\u201cI always like it when comedic actors try their hand in dramatic roles. Audiences don\u2019t always follow them across that bridge, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with attempting,\u201d Bock said. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt your career.\u201d\n\nRegardless of performance, there is one thing her last two disappointing films have in common: Schumer didn\u2019t write them. Given her background in stand-up, it\u2019s no surprise she penned her most successful project to date. It\u2019s fair to say her movies could benefit from Schumer having a stronger hand in the screenplay.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s less talented [since \u2018Trainwreck\u2019], I think it\u2019s a matter of finding the right project,\u201d Bock said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to have to go through some bumps to find out why people were so enamored with \u2018Trainwreck.'\u201d\n\nHer untitled comedy with Jennifer Lawrence, which has been in development for some time now, will be the next test of Schumer\u2019s impact as a screenwriter.\n\n\u201cShe has something people want to see,\u201d Bock said. \u201cShe\u2019s a different kind of person in terms of what Hollywood usually throws money at.\u201d\n\nPOPULAR ON VARIETY", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Fbox-office%2Famy-schumer-box-office-analysis-i-feel-pretty-1202779934%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202779934&comment_count=143", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/amy-schumer.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/amy-schumer.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/box-office/amy-schumer-box-office-analysis-i-feel-pretty-1202779934/", "title": "After \u2018I Feel Pretty\u2019 Disappoints, What Should Amy Schumer Do Next?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Just how much is Amy Schumer willing to stretch her material beyond the themes of her appearance?", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202779934, "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "pmc-category": "Box Office", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-04-23T07:21:42"}, "pmc-tag": "Amy Schumer,I Feel Pretty", "title": "After \u2018I Feel Pretty\u2019 Disappoints, What Should Amy Schumer Do Next?", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film", "pmc-primary-category": "Box Office", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "After \u2018I Feel Pretty\u2019 Disappoints, What Should Amy Schumer Do Next?", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/box-office/amy-schumer-box-office-analysis-i-feel-pretty-1202779934/", "description": "Amy Schumer is undeniably funny, so why have her two latest films underperformed?
