And so I was super empathetic with DeMario because it\u2019s just another issue. Not only is consent important, but it\u2019s also to get rid of the stigma that interracial couples can\u2019t be or blaming African American men for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nJasmine Goode then added that she was thinking about the long-term repercussions for DeMario even after he was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking the whole time: what if this happened to my brother?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy from the guy I met here \u2026 and I never felt he was aggressive with any of us. \u2026 I just hate that he\u2019s going to have this image stuck with him for a while.\u201d\n\nThe group also discussed consent and slut shaming, with Chris leading the conversation as he asked the cast to define consent before telling everything to \u201ckeep consent in mind,\u201d especially while in Paradise and \u201cfor forever.\u201d\n\nChris then asked the group if they wanted to be there and if they agreed with the show resuming filming following the incident.\n\n\u201cKnowing what we all know now, having lived through what we\u2019ve all lived through and experienced \u2014 the shutdown, the scandal, the accusations, everything we\u2019ve all endured \u2014 do each of you want to be here?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIf the majority of you feels like we should not continue, then we will not continue the show. Please be 100 percent honest because it\u2019s important that we get this right. And so I want to literally go person-by-person,\u201d Chris said before asking each contestant one-by-one if they wanted to continue the show.\n\nWith every cast member agreeing that filming should resume, Chris declared \u201cBachelor in Paradise back open.\u201d\n\nTo see a clip of the cast discussion, click the video above!\n\nBachelor in Paradise airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nWhat do you think about the cast\u2019s statements following the scandal?
