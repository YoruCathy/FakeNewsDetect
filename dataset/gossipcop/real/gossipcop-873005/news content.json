There are not enough adjectives to describe the light he was, to anyone that ever had the pleasure to meet him. I will miss him everyday, but I know the memory of him will live on. And to his family, I thank them for letting us know him and seeing the joy they brought him. Us crazy ones love you.\u201d\n\nShe also went on to say, \u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=536&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2015%2F07%2Frobin-williams-1024-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1024&h=536&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2015%2F07%2Frobin-williams-1024-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sarah-michelle-gellar-pays-tribute-to-robin-williams/", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar Pays Tribute to Robin Williams on Anniversary of His Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Death,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Robin Williams,Sarah Michelle Gellar", "news_keywords": "Death,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Robin Williams,Sarah Michelle Gellar", "description": "Gellar played the straight-laced daughter Sydney to Williams\u2019 eccentric ad man Simon in the CBS comedy\u00a0The Crazy Ones", "og": {"title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar Pays Tribute to Robin Williams on Anniversary of His Death", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sarah-michelle-gellar-pays-tribute-to-robin-williams/", "description": "It\u2019s been three years since Robin Williams\u2019&nbsp;tragic death, but his presence is still felt among those who knew him best.
