Fortunately for them, they\u2019ve had numerous such chances in recent years, as the Harry Potter stars have often been spotted together, whether in social situations or at Potter-related events such as last year\u2019s opening of the \u201cForbidden Forest\u201d exhibit at Warner Bros. Studio Tour in London.\n\nWhen The Wizarding World of Harry Potter opened at Universal Studios Orlando in 2014, many of the films\u2019 cast members were on hand to celebrate the event.\n\nThat event produced a number of photos from Felton alongside his Malfoy father, Jason Isaacs, as well as other notable co-stars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this year\u2019s Golden Globes, Watson found herself in an impromptu Potter reunion when she presented the award for best limited series or TV movie with Robert Pattinson (Cedric Diggory).\n\nHERMIONE GRANGER AND CEDRIC DIGGORY THIS IS REAL

of The Circle.\n\nThere's a #HarryPotter reunion on the red carpet for The Circle @tribecafilmfest \u2014 Bonnie Wright catching up with Emma Watson pic.twitter.com/tmTPZbzbWR \u2014 Keira Alexander (@keira_alexander) April 27, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, many of the film\u2019s cast members \u2014 Stan Ianevski (Viktor Krum), Natalia Tena (Nymphadora Tonks), and James and Oliver Phelps (Fred and George Weasley) \u2014 joined Wright at Universal Studios Orlando for a Q&A as part of the park\u2019s Harry Potter celebration.\n\n\"There's something more real about being here than being

2018\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd on her official Instagram page, Wright has also routinely posted photos with her fellow Potter alums, including her series classmate Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), brother Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), and husband Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), as well as director Christopher Columbus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow if only they can all find their way back to Platform 9
