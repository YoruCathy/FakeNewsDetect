The 2018 Oscars will take place Sunday, March 4, 2018. Hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, the Motion Picture Academy\u2019s 90th annual awards ceremony will be the pinnacle and culmination of the awards season.\n\nPart of what makes this year\u2019s Oscar race so intriguing is its open-endedness \u2014 there\u2019s no clear frontrunner for Best Picture among the nine nominees, which span an unusually wide field of films and performances.\n\nRelated The case for and against every Oscars Best Picture nominee\n\nThe Shape of Water leads the nominations with 13 total nods, including Best Picture, Directing, and Original Screenplay. It\u2019s followed by Dunkirk, which earned eight nominations, also including nods in Best Picture and Best Directing.\n\nMeanwhile, Get Out notably earned four big nominations in Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay.\n\nThe nominations also contain a number records and milestones.\n\nMudbound writer-director Dee Rees is the second black woman screenwriter to be nominated for screenwriting, and the film\u2019s cinematographer, Rachel Morrison, is the first woman to be nominated in the Best Cinematography category. Get Out\u2019s Jordan Peele is the first black filmmaker ever nominated for directing, writing, and producing in the same year. And Lady Bird\u2019s Greta Gerwig is nominated for Best Director, making her only the fifth woman in Oscars history to be nominated in the category.\n\nRelated 12 surprising records and milestones from the 2018 Oscar nominations\n\nThe awards are handed out in 24 categories, most of which contain five nominees. The two exceptions are the Best Picture category, which can have between five and 10 nominees and has nine nominees this year, and Makeup and Hairstyling, which has three nominees.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of this 2018 Oscar nominees:\n\nBest Picture\n\nDirecting\n\nChristopher Nolan, Dunkirk\n\nJordan Peele, Get Out\n\nGreta Gerwig, Lady Bird\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson, Phantom Thread\n\nGuillermo del Toro, Shape of Water\n\nActor in a Leading Role\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Call Me by Your Name\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis, Phantom Thread\n\nDaniel Kaluuya, Get Out\n\nGary Oldman, Darkest Hour\n\nDenzel Washington, Roman J.
