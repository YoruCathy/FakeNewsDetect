It's really cool to surround yourself with people who are inspiring and changing the way they dictate what they love, whether it's acting or music, and she's one of those people who will continue to do that.\"When asked if Swift personally played the album for her, Gomez replied, \"Yeah! For sure.\"She added, \"I obviously love her so much and I want her to do what she does. She's killing it, and it's everything you would want and more. So, [I'm] very proud, and obviously [a] major fan.\"Those of us who aren't in Swift's squad, meanwhile, will have to wait until November 10 to make our own judgments.
