We didn\u2019t have any great inspiration. It wasn\u2019t Alexander the Great and Ella Fitzgerald.\u201d\n\nImage zoom George and Amal Clooney Franco Origlia/Getty Images\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Now, he\u2019s on double diaper duty with he and his wife\u2019s newborns \u2014 something the new dad told the Associated Press in August is \u201cmy job,\u201d along with \u201cwalking them around a little bit\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a life he\u2019s taking for granted. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think at 56 that I would be the parent of twins,\u201d George said, advising, \u201cDon\u2019t make plans.
