She posted a video with Sophia telling all her fans and followers that she was freaking out because Sophia came to support everyone at the Lip Sync battle Live show.\n\nDuring that very same evening, while she was walking the red carpet, Chrissy was with the Lip Sync Battle\u2019s co-host LL Cool J, and she talked to E! News about how it was like to meet Sophia for the first time.\n\nThey had been involved in a Twitter feud, but Chrissy told everyone that she apologized for that to Sophia during their recent meeting.\n\nGUYS!!! @realsophiarobot A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Jan 18, 2018 at 2:22pm PST\n\n\n\nChrissy stated that Sophia was backstage a little earlier and she thought their meeting went great.\n\nShe also made sure to mention that Sophia has really fine and supple skin.\n\nChrissy brought up their Twitter feud, and she claimed that she apologized to Sophia to which the robot lady said that she looks great and Chrissy agreed.\n\nIt seems that the old feud has been forgotten because Sophia also posted on her Twitter account on Thursday her thoughts regarding her meeting Chrissy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It was great meeting you @chrissyteigen,\u2019 Sophia posted. It\u2019s inspiring that Chrissy managed to get along with Sophia the Robot after all.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Oprah-Winfrey-Phil-McGraw-Fauci-300x182.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Chrissy-Teigen-HGTV.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Check-Out-Chrissy-Teigen-Apologizing-To-Sophia-The-Robot-Following-The-Twitter-Feud.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/RonCollins-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nene-leakes-rhoa-season-12-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/John-Legend-Chrissy-Teigen-Take-Their-Self-Quarantine-To-A-Whole-New-Level-By-Getting-Extremely-Creative-With-Their-Kids-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Halle-Berry-Dating-Boys-In-The-Past-300x203.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sophie-Turner-Survive-700x466.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Melania-Trump-Marks-Her-First-Year-As-The-First-Lady-With-A-Photo-That-Does-Not-Feature-Donald-Trump-Her-Fans-Love-It-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bernice-Burgos--300x185.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Check-Out-Chrissy-Teigen-Apologizing-To-Sophia-The-Robot-Following-The-Twitter-Feud.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ron Collins", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/check-out-chrissy-teigen-apologizing-to-sophia-the-robot-following-the-twitter-feud-107311/", "title": "Check Out Chrissy Teigen Apologizing To Sophia The Robot Following The Twitter Feud", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ron Collins", "news_keywords": "chrissy teigen, Sophia the Robot,", "keywords": "celebrity news, chrissy teigen, Sophia the Robot,", "description": "Chrissy Teigen just met Sophia the Robot this Thursday, and she was beyond excited.
