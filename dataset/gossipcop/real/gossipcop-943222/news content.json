The twins, named Sir Carter and Rumi, are \u201cone month old\u201d according to the singer\u2019s post. Assuming they were born in California, that would put their birth date at June 13, 2017.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 posted a photo of herself with the twins shortly after 10 pm Pacific time.\n\nSir Carter and Rumi 1 month today. \u2764\ufe0f A post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jul 13, 2017 at 10:10pm PDT\n\nThe post deliberately echoed February\u2019s pregnancy announcement.\n\nWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters A post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST\n\nThe initial pregnancy announcement referenced Renaissance paintings of the Madonna when pregnant. Similarly, the introduction of Sir Carter and Rumi calls back to paintings of the Madonna with her son, the Christ child. (Here\u2019s a pretty good example of one that seems as if it may have provided a model for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s post.)\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and her husband, Shawn Carter (better known as rapper Jay-Z), welcomed their first child, daughter Blue Ivy Carter, in 2012. Beyonc\u00e9 most recent album, Lemonade, was released in 2016 and went on to become one of the year\u2019s top-selling albums. Jay-Z\u2019s latest release, 4:44, came out just weeks ago.\n\nThe names of Sir Carter and Rumi have been rumored for weeks now, after documents to trademark both names were filed with the government in late June.\n\nFor more on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s pregnancy, read Vox\u2019s Constance Grady on the changing demands of celebrity pregnancies, and the ways Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 use music to control the narrative around their marriage.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672267/GettyImages_1210300377.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-acUlfFI7FgaLl4S0T4leqx8IA=/0x0:597x336/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55707697/beyoncesocial.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66563937/GettyImages_1129912168.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671897/shel_silverstein.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672426/GettyImages_1187901752.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672372/GettyImages_1210313287.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672024/1218646346.jpg.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-acUlfFI7FgaLl4S0T4leqx8IA=/0x0:597x336/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55707697/beyoncesocial.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Dylan Matthews", "Riley Beggin", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Matthew Yglesias", "Constance Grady", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/14/15970102/beyonce-twins-names-sir-rumi", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s twins are here \u2014 and their names are Sir Carter and Rumi", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2017-07-14T02:47:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-14T02:47:24-04:00"}, "author": "Emily Todd VanDerWerff", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "The singer announced the names, rumored for weeks, in a post on Instagram.", "og": {"description": "The singer announced the names, rumored for weeks, in a post on Instagram.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-acUlfFI7FgaLl4S0T4leqx8IA=/0x0:597x336/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55707697/beyoncesocial.0.jpg", "height": 900, "width": 1600}, "site_name": "Vox", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s twins are here \u2014 and their names are Sir Carter and Rumi", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/14/15970102/beyonce-twins-names-sir-rumi"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/14/15970102/beyonce-twins-names-sir-rumi", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s twins are here \u2014 and their names are Sir Carter and Rumi", "description": "The singer announced the names, rumored for weeks, in a post on Instagram.", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-acUlfFI7FgaLl4S0T4leqx8IA=/0x0:597x336/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55707697/beyoncesocial.0.jpg", "site": "voxdotcom"}, "sailthru.title": "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s twins are here \u2014 and their names are Sir Carter and Rumi", "sailthru.tags": "general,vox,front-page,celebrities,culture,music", "sailthru.description": "The singer announced the names, rumored for weeks, in a post on Instagram.", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-14T02:47:24-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-acUlfFI7FgaLl4S0T4leqx8IA=/0x0:597x336/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55707697/beyoncesocial.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KBmtI-RGUeMnuFT21_YzKT-pTY=/148x0:488x340/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55707697/beyoncesocial.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/441/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000_yellow.755.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#4f7177", "outbrainsection": "celebrities"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499961600.0, "source": "https://www.vox.com", "summary": ""}
