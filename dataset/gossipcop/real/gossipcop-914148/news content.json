Named after the pioneer William Harrison Boring, the unincorporated town is the site of the newest Netflix coming-of-age show, \u201cEverything Sucks!\u201d\n\nDrawing inspiration from \u201890s hallmarks like \u201c10 Things I Hate About You,\u201d \u201cMy So Called Life\u201d and \u201cFreaks and Geeks,\u201d the show is a celebrations of all things \u201890s. The first episode\u2019s opening montage alone features slap bracelets, pogs, hacky sack and arguing over whether the Star Wars reboot is going to be super cool or sacrilege. The soundtrack throughout the season will bring you back to your Columbia House subscription: Oasis, Gin Blossoms, Blues Traveler and Tori Amos.\n\nWe talked with the creators Ben York Jones and Mike Mohan and have distilled the conversation into 10 things we love about the show.\n\n1. While a celebration of the \u201890s, the show isn\u2019t geared only toward the Zima generation.\n\nGrowing up in the \u201890s himself, creator Ben Jones says he loved watching the \u201cWonder Years,\u201d which was about a boy his age living in the \u201860s. \u201cI guess it seemed like a slightly different world, and that was fascinating to me as a kid, but ultimately it was a backdrop,\u201d he said, adding that that\u2019s their goal, too. \u201cSo for kids watching it today that weren\u2019t even born in the \u201890s, it\u2019ll feel like the olden days for sure, but hopefully that\u2019s just a footnote to the emotional arc of the story.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cEverything Sucks!\u201d features characters who would have never gotten their own show in the \u201890s, but should have.\n\nStep back to 1996, before Ellen came out, before \u201cWill and Grace.\u201d In that era, gay and lesbian characters and people of color were generally relegated to a supporting friend role in mainstream shows.\n\nNow, step into \u201cEverything Sucks!,\u201d where the main characters are Luke, a black boy, and Kate, a sophomore girl coming to terms with her attraction to other girls. Much of the show\u2019s drama revolves around Luke\u2019s crush on Kate, as it collides with Kate\u2019s coming out process.\n\n\u201cWith the character of Luke, we thought about ourselves, and the fact that we were obsessed with girls, wear your heart on your sleeve \u2014 all these things that have nothing to do with race,\u201d Mohan said. \u201cSo in terms of the question of \u2018Why did you make him black?\u2019 Really the question is \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a little bit of the point, too, is to go and say here\u2019s how we could\u2019ve or should\u2019ve done it,\u201d Jones added. \u201cAnd if that feels a little utopian, that\u2019s OK by us. We\u2019re presenting things as we would like to see them.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Scott Patrick Green/Netflix\n\n3. They get the \u201890s teenage coming-out experience right \u2014 in other words, we were totally at that Tori Amos concert.\n\nTori Amos, one of the most memorable artists to break out of the \u201890s, is used to incredible narrative effect. On the first day of class, Kate is wearing a Tori Amos t-shirt, and her description of what makes Amos great gives the first indication of things to come.\n\nLuke, trying to win Kate\u2019s affection, eventually takes her to an Amos concert, where Kate spends the entire time staring at a happy lesbian couple dancing nearby. Actor Peyton Kennedy captures the lonely but hopeful longing of that moment with heart-breaking authenticity, and we should know: We were the closeted kid at that Tori Amos concert in the mid-\u201890s staring at the happy queer couple nearby.\n\n\u201cYou can see everything that\u2019s going on in [Kate\u2019s] head on [Kennedy\u2019s] face, even though she doesn\u2019t have to say a word,\u201d Mohan said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s miraculous about Peyton and her performance as an actor.\u201d (Granted, Tori was way too big post-\u201cCornflake Girl\u201d to ever play the Aladdin, where this scene was filmed. But the Rose Garden just doesn\u2019t have the same charm.)\n\n4. While we\u2019re on the subject of music: the soundtrack.\n\nRemember when you used to sign up your entire family for Columbia House or BMG Music, and if you schemed it right, you could get 20 CDs for the price of one? Well, half the bands you ordered probably have a song in the show. Some are timeless gems (Oasis\u2019s \u201cWonderwall\u201d), some are used to express thematic effect (Weezer\u2019s \u201cPink Triangle\u201d and The Verve Pipe\u2019s \u201cThe Freshman\u201d), and some make you thankful the \u201890s are long over (Deep Blue Something\u2019s \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s\u201d).\n\n5. The fact that the actors capture all the awkwardness of the teen years with aplomb is all the more impressive given they weren\u2019t even alive in an era where you passed notes instead of texted and had to bike to Blockbuster instead of logging in to Netflix.\n\nJones and Mohan recommended certain movies and bands to the young actors with which to familiarize themselves for the era, but they attribute the cast\u2019s acting abilities to the performers\u2019 own empathy.\n\nThere were, however, a few things lost in translation. Jones tells a story about the first time they filmed a scene in Luke\u2019s room where actor Jahi Di\u2019Allo Winston had to put a VHS tape in the VCR. \u201cMike calls action, and Jahi puts the tape into the VHS player backwards and is trying to shove it in,\u201d Jones said. \u201c\u2019Cut! Cut! Cut! Jahi what\u2019s going on?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to do this. I\u2019ve never put a tape in a VHS player.\u2019 And instantly everyone on set felt ancient. That was just one example of how the \u201890s are pretty far in the past, especially for these kids, who\u2019re born in the early 2000s.\u201d\n\n6. The parents are real people.\n\nUnlike most teen shows from the \u201890s like \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d and \u201cMy So-Called Life,\u201d where the parents rarely made an appearance, Luke and Kate\u2019s single parents are central to the show. Sherri and Ken, having lost their spouses to abandonment and death, respectively, suffer from the grown-up versions of the loneliness and insecurity that affects their children. But in a nice twist, while the kids flounder at romance, it\u2019s the two parents who get to experience the anxiety of new love.\n\n\u201cIt was important for us that the parent characters have dimension and not simply be comedic foils to the kids like they are historically in a lot of high school shows,\u201d Jones said.\n\n7. The show ended up in Boring by accident.\n\nJones and Mohan knew they wanted to set the show in a rural area. \u201cWhen we were Googling images, we just looked up \u2018boring suburb\u2019 just because I needed a photo for when we were going to go into Netflix and pitch it to them,\u201d Mohan recalled. \u201cAnd we discovered the town of Boring, Oregon, and it just made us laugh.\u201d\n\nThey put it in the pitch, thinking they\u2019d film in Vancouver, British Columbia, and just call it Boring. But then they convinced Netflix to let them scout Oregon, and they discovered the strength of the local film community and the beauty of the area. \u201cIt\u2019s just a beautiful place to set a show,\u201d Mohan said. \u201cThe whole goal of the show is to make it as honest as possible, so you might as well just go with that authenticity.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Scott Patrick Green/Netflix\n\n8. For once, an Oregon TV show isn\u2019t all about Portland.\n\nPortland has had more than its due of attention. While \u201cPortlandia\u201d is in its final season, the new HBO series \u201cHere and Now\u201d has picked up the torch, with excruciating attention to Portland details. (What are they having for lunch? Bunk Sandwiches. What wine are they drinking? A to Z. Donuts? You can guess.)\n\n\u201cEverything Sucks!\u201d wants none of that.\n\nApart from the Tori Amos concert filmed at the Aladdin Theater, \u201cEverything Sucks!\u201d is filmed almost exclusively around Oregon City, since Boring doesn\u2019t have its own high school, with the effect of making it a stand-in for small towns everywhere.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say there aren\u2019t small local cameos that are all the more delightful for their subtlety, like the fact that one of the VHS tapes Luke\u2019s film-loving father left behind is Gus Van Sant\u2019s ode to Old Portland, \u201cDrugstore Cowboys,\u201d or that, when the show needed to film a scene at a Blockbuster in Los Angeles (which no longer exists), they could just go down the road to Sandy, Oregon, the site of one of the chain\u2019s last remaining outposts.\n\n9. The jocks aren\u2019t the bad guys.\n\nSince the dawn of VHS \u2014 if not before \u2014 seemingly every movie and show ever set in a high school has reserved the bad guy role for the jocks. For \u201cEverything Sucks!,\u201d it\u2019s the drama club. Because let\u2019s be honest, the jocks can\u2019t be bothered with the A/V club. The thespians, on the other hand, are just one step up in the social ladder, meaning that they have all the more to gain for playing the villains (which, every actor knows, is always the best role anyway). Of course, that \u201890s can\u2019t-we-all-just-get-along ethos wins out in the end, and the two join forces to make an over-the-top sci-fi film worthy of \u201cMystery Science Theater 3000.\u201d\n\n10. There are plenty of possibilities for season two.\n\nThe season ends with both a certain level of satisfying resolution and a cliff-hanger \u2014 the perfect compromise for an unknown future.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a season two yet, but if enough people watch it, we are hoping and praying that we can spend another summer in your beautiful state, hanging out with these kids and telling more stories with them,\u201d Mohan said. \u201cBecause this show ends with a pretty big whopper cliffhangeranger, we are definitely hoping to honor it and do so in the most unexpected of ways. And that\u2019s all we can say.\u201d", "images": ["https://images3.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/artsandlife_20170120_portlandia_augusta_quirk-ifc-2_azqg2t.jpg", "https://images1.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/20200414-food-bank_1586884424166.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/footer/apm_logo.gif", "https://images5.opb.org/c_fill%2Cg_north_west%2Ch_300%2Cq_90%2Cw_400/news_20180303_everything-sucks_netflix3_d7nl1f.jpg", "https://images4.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/20200316_oha-gov-brown-coronavirus_kd-12.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/logo-mobile.gif", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/logo-small.png", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/footer/prilogo.png", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/footer/bbclogo.gif", "https://images4.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/haystack5_1532981123880.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/footer/pbslogo.png", "https://images2.opb.org/c_fill%2Cg_center%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/781c548552c3daca645ed2136cd39426.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/images/television/programs/ofg/ofg-op-directions.png", "https://images2.opb.org/c_limit%2Cg_north_east%2Ch_1000%2Cq_90%2Cw_640/radio_20180303_everything-sucks_netflix_krjvqe.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/images/television/programs/ofg/ofg-op-map.png", "https://images2.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/garlic_1587086951247.jpg", "https://images5.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/artboard_1_copy_5__1_.png", "https://images5.opb.org/c_fill%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/television_packer-1_e5gyar.jpg", "https://images1.opb.org/c_limit%2Cg_north_east%2Ch_1000%2Cq_90%2Cw_640/news_20180303_everything-sucks_netflix2_nccchh.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/images/television/programs/ofg/ofg-op-arrow-right.png", "https://www.opb.org/s/images/television/programs/ofg/ofg-op-photo.png", "https://www.opb.org/s/chrome/footer/nprlogo.gif", "https://images4.opb.org/c_limit%2Cg_north_west%2Ch_1000%2Cq_90%2Cw_640/news_20180303_everything-sucks_netflix3_d7nl1f.jpg", "https://www.opb.org/s/images/television/programs/ofg/op-logo-grey.png", "https://images2.opb.org/c_fill%2Cg_west%2Ch_200%2Cq_90%2Cw_300/20200320_kate-brown-covid_bp-7.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images5.opb.org/c_fill%2Cg_north_west%2Ch_300%2Cq_90%2Cw_400/news_20180303_everything-sucks_netflix3_d7nl1f.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aaron Scott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.opb.org/news/article/everything-sucks-netflix-boring-oregon-interview/", "title": "10 Things We Love About Oregon\u2019s Newest TV Show, \u2018Everything Sucks!\u2019 On Netflix", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@OPB", "title": "10 Things We Love About \u2018Everything Sucks!,\u2019 Oregon's Newest TV Show", "description": "<p>Filmed in Boring, Oregon, Netflix&rsquo;s newest show is a homage to the '90s.
