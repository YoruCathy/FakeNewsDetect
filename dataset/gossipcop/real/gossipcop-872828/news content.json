Evelyn Lozada and Carl Crawford have called off their engagement, Us Weekly can confirm.\n\n\u201cThey did break up but it was over infidelity back in February,\u201d a rep for the Basketball Wives star, 41, tells Us in a statement on Thursday, August 10. \u201cRight now they are focused on being responsible and loving parents to their 3-year-old kid.\u201d The former flames \u201cdo remain friends,\u201d but Lozada, who currently resides in Arizona, is not living with the baseball star.\n\nThe duo got engaged in December 2013 after Crawford proposed to Lozada on Christmas Eve with a $1.5 million ring. The couple welcomed their first child together, Leo, in March the following year.\n\nLozada and Crawford, who were last seen together in March celebrating Leo\u2019s birthday party, recently sparked breakup rumors when fans began to notice that they\u2019d been posting several Instagram photos traveling without each other\u2019s company. The former Dodgers star flew to Vegas in June without Lozada and Leo, while the TV personality enjoyed a vacation in the Bahamas in early July.\n\n????\u2600\ufe0f A post shared by Evelyn Lozada (@evelynlozada) on Jul 3, 2017 at 8:52am PDT\n\nLozada took to Twitter on Thursday to thank a fan offering her support following the split. \u201cWhether or not the tea that\u2019s out there is true prayers with @Evelyn Lozada,\u201d a fan wrote to the reality star with a heart emoji. She retweeted the post alongside a series of red hearts and prayer hands.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-e17dc0d9-9ae5-4100-84b0-46947b1a8a67.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C674px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-e17dc0d9-9ae5-4100-84b0-46947b1a8a67.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-e17dc0d9-9ae5-4100-84b0-46947b1a8a67.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-call-off-engagement-w497158/", "title": "Evelyn Lozada and Carl Crawford Call Off Their Engagement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Basketball Wives\u2019 star Evelyn Lozada has split from former Dodgers player and fiancee Carl Crawford \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Evelyn Lozada and Carl Crawford Call Off Their Engagement", "description": "\u2018Basketball Wives\u2019 star Evelyn Lozada has split from former Dodgers player and fiancee Carl Crawford \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-call-off-engagement-w497158/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:43:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-e17dc0d9-9ae5-4100-84b0-46947b1a8a67.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-e17dc0d9-9ae5-4100-84b0-46947b1a8a67.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-10T20:23:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:43:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Basketball Wives\u2019 star Evelyn Lozada has split from former Dodgers player and fiancee Carl Crawford \u2014 details", "title": "Evelyn Lozada and Carl Crawford Call Off Their Engagement", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/evelyn-lozada-and-carl-crawford-split-e17dc0d9-9ae5-4100-84b0-46947b1a8a67.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502396580.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
