Demi Lovato and ex-boyfriend Wimer Valderrama are sparking reunion rumors after they were spotting dining together at L.A.\u2019s Sol Y Luna restaurant.\n\nThe former couple sported casual matching hoodies for the lunch date on Saturday, February 24, according to TMZ. The website reports that the \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d crooner, 25, and the That \u201970s Show alum, 38, were all smiles and laughed as they snacked on guacamole and chips.\n\nLovato and Valderrama, who called it quits in June 2016 after six years of dating, fueled reconciliation rumors in August 2017 when the NCIS star was seen cozying up to the former Disney star at her 25th birthday bash. Lovato also shared photos of the twosome with their arms wrapped around one another in June 2017 during a barbecue she hosted at her L.A. estate.\n\nThe Sonny With a Chance actress opened up about the duo\u2019s heart-wrenching split in her October 2017 documentary Simply Complicated. \u201cI\u2019ve never loved anybody like I\u2019ve loved Wilmer. And I still love Wilmer,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWhen I met him and I laid eyes on him for the first time, I was in hair and makeup and I was like, \u2018I love his man and I have to have him.\u2019 But I was only 17 so he was like, \u2018Get away from me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdded the \u201cConfident\u201d songstress: \u201cAfter I turned 18, we began dating and I think it was love at first sight. I don\u2019t really believe in that, but I believe it happened. We connected on a level that I\u2019ve never connected with anybody before. He was just my rock, my everything.\u201d\n\nThe Grammy nominee also noted in her movie that the breakup \u201chad nothing to do with falling out of love. We decided together that that we\u2019re probably better as friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/demi-lovato-ex-wilmer-valderrama-reunite-for-lunch-date/", "title": "Demi Lovato, Ex Wilmer Valderrama Reunite for Lunch Date", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Demi Lovato had a fun outing with ex-boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama on Saturday, February 24, in L.A. \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Demi Lovato and Ex Wilmer Valderrama Reunite for Lunch Date", "description": "Demi Lovato had a fun outing with ex-boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama on Saturday, February 24, in L.A. \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/demi-lovato-ex-wilmer-valderrama-reunite-for-lunch-date/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-26T17:46:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-25T21:05:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-26T17:46:26+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Demi Lovato had a fun outing with ex-boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama on Saturday, February 24, in L.A. \u2014 get the details", "title": "Demi Lovato and Ex Wilmer Valderrama Reunite for Lunch Date", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519592722.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
