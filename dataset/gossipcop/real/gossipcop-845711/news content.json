Although the items varied in thickness and size, there was a coherence to the style, a casual sensibility that suggested the laid-back lifestyle of Ms. Meyer\u2019s hometown, Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a specific look,\u201d said Karla Welch, a stylist who has placed Ms. Meyer\u2019s designs on clients like Elisabeth Moss and Olivia Wilde. \u201cYou know when it\u2019s a Jen Meyer piece. Her pieces have an identity.\u201d\n\nJewelry-making was not a lifelong goal for Ms. Meyer, although as a child she did spend afternoons making rings and medallions with her paternal grandmother, Edith Meyer, who designed enamel pieces in a tiny Santa Monica apartment, its kitchen crowded with a kiln. She studied child and family psychology at Syracuse University; when she returned to Los Angeles in 1999, she went straight into the work force, although not exactly by her own choice.\n\n\u201cI was done with college and my dad said to me, \u2018Here\u2019s the deal: You have two weeks to find a job,\u2019\u201d she said. She quickly gravitated toward style-related work, first as the West Coast beauty and fitness editor of Glamour and then in the publicity departments of Giorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren.\n\n\u201cShe was unflappable and she was also humble,\u201d recalled Wanda McDaniel, who hired Ms. Meyer at Armani, where she is executive vice president, entertainment industry communications worldwide. \u201cThere\u2019s no Hollywood artifice about her at all. She\u2019s just a very cool, ambitious, friendly person \u2014 and she did work very hard.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Felder"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-09-12T08:47:40.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-12T08:47:40.000Z", "section": "Fashion", "tag": "Los Angeles (Calif)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005368453, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/80619c053bfe44da8de2abde5e1960a9", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Rachel Felder", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Jewelry,Jennifer Meyer,Los Angeles", "pdate": 20170912, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "The designer Jennifer Meyer posing in some of her own jewelry creations at her Los Angeles home."}, "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "The designer Jennifer Meyer posing in some of her own jewelry creations at her Los Angeles home."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "fashion", "CN": "jewelry", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505145600.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
