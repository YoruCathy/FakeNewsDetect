In honor of Sex and the City\u2019s 20th anniversary, we asked 15 writers the moments from the show they \u2026 think about a lot.\n\n\u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d\n\nWhen Carrie first met Aleksandr Petrovsky, a.k.a \u201cThe Russian,\u201d a.k.a. her \u201clover,\u201d she and Charlotte had just taken in a performance art piece at a gallery in Chelsea: a woman was living there, on a platform, not eating or sleeping for 16 days. Petrovsky, a big-time artist played by Mikhail Baryshnikov, asked the women for their thoughts about the piece as they all prepared to leave, sending Carrie into an extended monologue about how she didn\u2019t buy it \u2014 \u201cI mean, if you put a phone on that platform it\u2019s just a typical Friday night waiting for some guy to call.\u201d This tickled Petrovsky, prompting him to ask the question that is burned into my mind for eternity. \u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d\n\nThe words \u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d run through my mind probably about five times per week. My dog does something funny: \u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d Somebody tries to make a funny joke on Twitter: \u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d I see either a comedian or a comic book: \u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d Somebody says \u201cyou are\u201d: \u201cYou are \u2026 comic?\u201d Neither a catchier nor more loaded turn of phrase was uttered at any point during Sex and the City\u2019s run, and it is a part of me now. I can\u2019t help it. We are tied together for life. I am you are comic.\n\n\u2014Kelly Conaboy\n\nThe \u201cSocks and the City\u201d brunch.\n\nI think a lot about the season five brunch where Carrie tells her friends that, due to a dating slump, she\u2019s run so low on ideas that she\u2019s tried to write about her sock drawer: \u201cMen as socks.\u201d \u201cSocks and the city!\u201d Samantha samanthas immediately. By \u201ca lot\u201d I mean I think about it every few weeks or so \u2014 impressive considering that the episode originally aired in 2002 \u2014 but I used to think about it even more, like almost every day. This was during the decade where I maintained a personal blog and also blogged on daily deadlines and did mostly first-person writing professionally. The sock drawer feeling started to crop up more and more, especially toward the end. It wasn\u2019t just that I was out of ideas, it was more like I was desperately strip-mining my thoughts, opinions, and experiences. Actually, I just looked up mining techniques in search of a better metaphor and what I was doing was closer to mountaintop removal, in terms of environmental devastation (in this metaphor the biodiverse mountaintops razed in the service of coal extraction represent my mind, body, and spirit). And yet I couldn\u2019t stop doing it, in part because it came so naturally to me; I was good at mountaintop removal, both efficient and skilled. The sock drawer feeling eventually killed this skill so that I could live, though some vestige of it remains, because here I am writing this now. Also in that same conversation it\u2019s revealed that Miranda is the only one of the foursome who consistently reads Carrie\u2019s column \u2014 which we already knew, but it was nice to have confirmation.\n\n\u2014Emily Gould\n\nJustin Theroux playing two different boyfriends.\n\nJustin Theroux as Jared.\n\nAnd again as Vaughn!\n\nThe early seasons of Sex and the City are a parade of baby-faced soon-to-be celebrities: Bobby Cannavale, Bradley Cooper, Timothy Olyphant. All of them and more played single-episode paramours for Charlotte, Carrie, Miranda, or Samantha, then invariably vanished from Manhattan forever, usually once an embarrassing, ultimately incompatible sexual preference was revealed. And then there\u2019s Justin Theroux. In season one, beautiful Justin Theroux plays Jared, one of New York Magazine\u2019s Coolest People Under 30 and someone for whom Carrie would have been a perfect match if she wasn\u2019t still hung up on Mr. Big. And then in season two \u2014 the very next season! \u2014 Theroux reappears, but this time as Vaugn Wystel, an insecure premature ejaculator with a super cool Upper West Side family. How was this allowed? Why was he even able to audition for a second role? They easily could have made \u201cVaugn\u201d just \u201cJared\u201d again, but instead they decided to taunt us as if nobody would notice that they cast the same guy twice. Well, joke\u2019s on them, because I\u2019ve watched SATC marathons on E! for so many hours without moving my dumb butt that I\u2019ve made it from Justin No. 1 to Justin No. 2 on more than one occasion. So how did Justin Theroux become two characters less than a year apart? Was it laziness? Incompetence? Sheer arrogance? I have no idea, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it.\n\n\u2014Dana Schwartz\n\nMiranda\u2019s boyfriend using the bathroom with the door open.\n\nEvery time I shut the bathroom door to use the toilet in my apartment, I think of Jim Gaffigan. He wasn\u2019t a famous comedian when this first started, but a bit player on season four of Sex and the City. Gaffigan plays Doug, a New Yorker cartoonist who seems like excellent boyfriend material for Miranda except for one fatal flaw: he pees with the door open. Miranda is horrified. I remember being horrified at Miranda\u2019s horror. I was a self-proclaimed Miranda who had just moved to Manhattan and I regularly shared toilet stalls (for peeing!) with my girlfriends \u2014 it was no big deal. Sex and the City shattered taboos in so many ways, but bathroom stuff was where they\u2019d draw the line?\n\nAs it turns out, I\u2019d misremembered the show. It was Miranda\u2019s disdain for Doug that haunted me whenever I contemplated leaving the door ajar when my husband was home. Upon a rewatch, I realized that the rest of the ladies weren\u2019t nearly as uptight as Miranda \u2014 in fact, they suggest she loosen up and join him. So Miranda boldy pees with the door open. But Doug takes it a step further.\n\nThere are many forms of intimacy celebrated on Sex and the City, but pooping in front of a partner is not one of them. \u201cMaybe it was narrow-minded, but for Miranda an open-door dump was definitely worth dumping someone over,\u201d Carrie writes, and I agree. Call me a prude, but every time I shut the door I\u2019m glad to still be a Miranda after all.\n\n\u2014Maris Kreizman\n\nCarrie losing Aidan\u2019s dog.\n\nOver the years, one scene from Sex and the City has haunted me. It is, in my opinion, Carrie\u2019s nadir. It\u2019s when she loses Aidan\u2019s freakin\u2019 dog.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t just lose Pete, a very sweet Brittany spaniel, she loses him when she\u2019s going downstairs to talk to Big, the guy she\u2019s been cheating on Aidan with! She gets distracted and Pete makes a run for it, because he\u2019s probably sick of listening to these two skeezeballs. Carrie runs after Pete, and Big runs after her, and even though she\u2019s in heels, he can\u2019t catch up with her. When she goes back inside, three hours later, soaked from the rain, it turns out Pete \u201cfound his way home,\u201d (did he buzz the door?) and Aidan is entirely too chill about the fact that this lady LOST HIS DOG.\n\nI think about this scene all the time mostly because I can\u2019t imagine how upset I would be if someone lost my dog, but also because I hope to God I\u2019m never a Carrie. Even as she\u2019s barreling over other people\u2019s emotions with her illicit dalliances and mishandling of dogs, she clearly feels so sorry for herself, like she\u2019s a victim of circumstances beyond her control, instead of an adult woman choosing to do things that hurt those around her. I hope I\u2019m never that oblivious. And, seriously, who loses their boyfriend\u2019s dog?\n\n\u2014Madeleine Aggeler\n\nSamantha saying \u201cLawrence of my Labia.\u201d\n\nThe Sex and the City moment that torments me in perpetuity occured not during the series itself, but during the franchise\u2019s 2010 film Sex and the City 2 (which really missed out on the opportunity to call itself 2 Sex 2 City, but I digress). The film mostly takes place in Abu Dhabi, where our horny foursome have ventured on a girl\u2019s trip; much of it would now be referred to using the umbrella term \u201cproblematic.\u201d But the most problematic moment of all, in the sense that it has personally caused me great mental anguish, comes when Samantha Jones utters one of the worst puns of all time. Now we know that the only thing Samantha loves more than incessantly advertising her coital proclivities is incessantly making terrible puns, but this one reaches new heights. While relaxing at their desert hotel, Samantha notices a Danish man also staying on the property and immediately decides she\u2019s DTF. She expresses this by uttering, in a sing-songy voice, \u201cLawrence of my Labiaaaaa!!!\u201d It is, I believe, haram on multiple levels. Now, after years of witnessing people overshare about their sex lives online, I\u2019ve become proudly sex negative \u2014 and, looking back, this is probably what kicked it off for me.\n\n\u2014Gabriella Paiella\n\nMiranda watching TV.\n\nAs a good Christian girl who watched smuggled DVDs of Sex and the City in middle school, everything on the show felt scandalous, from Samantha Jones\u2019s regular sexcapades to Miranda Hobbes and Dr. Robert Leeds interracial relationship. Yes, I do think of Blair Underwood\u2019s naked body often, but what sticks with me more is the iconic, yet fake BBC television show that ultimately pulled Miranda and Robert together \u2014 Jules & Mimi. I was but a child, but watching one of my favorite TV characters watch TV while I was watching TV was worth the one-way basket to hell I\u2019m sure my loved ones thought I\u2019d be on for watching such a sexual show at the age of 13. Just like me, Miranda loved to unwind with soaps, which, in a small way, made her New York City lifestyle a bit more accessible. If you follow my Kardashian work, this minor detail made me live every minor detail in every show I watched from then on out. Basically, without Miranda, SATC, or Jules & Mimi there may be no KUWTK Errors or TTD.\n\n\u2014Mariah Smith\n\nThe socialite falling out the window and dying.\n\nI rarely find myself in a Manhattan high-rise, but when I do, I always make sure to stand at least several feet from any open window. That\u2019s because in season six, episode eight, of Sex and the City \u2014 appropriately titled \u201cSplat!\u201d \u2014 a coked-up socialite trips on her heel and falls through an open window, not only dying, but also prompting Carrie Bradshaw to make the disastrous decision of moving to Paris with a Russian man who ends up slapping her.\n\nThe doomed party sequence starts with Carrie arriving at her Vogue editor\u2019s apartment. There, she comes across her old clubbing friend Lexi Featherston (Kristen Johnston) \u2014 a name that definitely sounds fake until you remember Tinsley Mortimer exists. Lexi does a bunch of cocaine in the bathroom, laments the boring \u201cEuro-intellectuals\u201d at the party, and then opens a floor-to-ceiling window to smoke. \u201cNew York is over. O-v-e-r. Over,\u201d Lexi rants. \u201cNo one\u2019s fun anymore. What ever happened to fun? Oh God, I\u2019m so bored I could die.\u201d Then, she trips over her heels, falls out the window, and \u2026 dies.\n\nNow, anytime I end up at a similarly tall building, I think about Lexi. I always look around the room and ensure I\u2019m not standing too close to one of those death traps. Yet, I can\u2019t help but wonder: What if I don\u2019t realize a window is open and then I die? What if I just lean back and an entire window shatters and I fall? What if I\u2019m standing across the room and I trip over my shoes so severely that I get flung across the room and fall out the window? But thankfully, few of my friends can afford such large windows, so I\u2019ve survived so far.\n\n\u2014Lisa Ryan\n\n\ufeffMiranda\u2019s breakup overalls.\n\nEvery time I walk out of the house \u201clooking how I feel,\u201d as Carrie describes it during her breakup with Mr. Big, I think about what would happen if I ran into an ex. This is a terrible cross to bear, I blame Sex and the City for it 100 percent. The women spend an entire episode toiling over the best approach to a single woman\u2019s sartorial revenge. How do you strike a balance between \u201cI\u2019m happy now\u201d nonchalance and trying a little bit harder than usual? Every single day until you die? For Carrie, the answer is a fur coat and a pinch hitter on her arm. For Miranda, the answer is, of course, the opposite of all this patriarchal bullshit. Miranda likes to walk around New York City wearing overalls, a puffer coat, and a dad hat. It\u2019s a way for her to clear her mind and not think about men for one sec \u2014 oh shit, there\u2019s her ex. Yeah. The image of Miranda scurrying away to hide behind a pole like a cockroach dodging Raid is really what\u2019s seared into my memory forever. It is so helpless, and could so easily be me. In 2018, though, I take solace in the fact that if Miranda did peek out from behind that pole to see her ex today, he\u2019d probably say, \u201cHey, you look great. Is that Balenciaga?\u201d\n\n\u2014Emilia Petrarca\n\n\u201cI\u2019m drunk at Vogue!\u201d\n\nIn episode 17 of season four, Carrie\u2019s editor at Vogue tears apart her first big story for the magazine. Julian, another editor who has become Carrie\u2019s mentor, tries to console her with a martini, and soon Carrie is plastered. \u201cI\u2019m drunk at Vogue!\u201d she declares \u2014 out of control at the control center of the fashion world.\n\nI think about this scene every time I find myself somewhat intoxicated at a work event, which happens fairly often because media is boozy and I\u2019m a lightweight. At least once a year, I consume two-thirds of a beer at a workplace happy hour, wobble into the office bathroom, look at myself in the mirror, and think, \u201cOh no, I\u2019m drunk at Vogue!\u201d It\u2019s an inside joke I\u2019ve had with myself my entire career, and it always makes me feel slightly better about being really, really bad at drinking professionally.\n\nIn a depressing coda to this story, I rewatched the scene recently and remembered that Julian is the same mentor who would later sexually harass Carrie in the accessories closet. I\u2019m glad my brain chose to ignore that information for so many years. For me, \u201cdrunk at Vogue\u201d isn\u2019t about lechery, or about men at all. It\u2019s shorthand for failing to live up to impossible professional standards because you are a mere flesh-and-blood human and who among us can\u2019t relate to that?\n\n\u2014Izzy Grinspan\n\nMiranda breaking a jar of marinara sauce.\n\nThe first time we watched Miranda say \u201cAnd I drop things!\u201d in an exasperated pitch near the top of her register after shattering a jar of marinara sauce by her apartment\u2019s front door, my best friend and I broke out in peals of laughter. It became a thing for us, a phrase we would say to each other to inevitably elicit a giggle. Many years, one college diploma, and three cities later, it still causes the same reaction.\n\nIt was early season three and Miranda and Steve were on their second-go-round and about to move in together. The rest of the episode \u2014 full of its gender essentialism and simplistic, outdated view of bisexuality \u2014 makes me sigh and roll my eyes, but I can\u2019t let go of this slice of it. I mostly laugh as a release and out of relief. Miranda is trying to be a certain type of woman, a woman who projects a traditional type of domesticity, to hide her flaws in that arena from Steve. With that broken jar and that high-pitched admission of imperfection, she decides to reject all of that. It\u2019s this rejection in favor of an acceptance of herself that has kept me returning to this moment. So I laugh and wonder if she went along with Steve\u2019s suggestion that they just order a pizza.\n\n\u2014Samantha Powell\n\nAidan eating too much fried chicken.\n\nSo Carrie puts on her Manolos and goes dancing at Bungalow 8 (lols) with a new friend she met at a gay club \u2014 Oliver, a hunky shoe importer. She\u2019s been frustrated with Aidan because he hates going out and she loves going out, and feels like Oliver is the key to having her fun and sexy times, without threatening her relationship. Turns out, Oliver is not gay and Carrie got scammed, so she goes home where Aidan is sleeping in a chair, having eaten a whole bucket of fried chicken. He tells Carrie, \u201cI ate too much fried chicken, rub my belly wouldja.\u201d And she does, in her club gear, with a blissful smile because she learned the lesson the episode title preaches: \u201cAll that Glitters is not Gold,\u201d and she\u2019s very lucky to have this gassy man to come home to.\n\nI realize the message is supposed to be something along the lines of why waste time with superficial partyboys, and bottles in the club, and chasing shiny nightlife, when you have a good, solid, down-to-earth man at home. Like Carrie, we should want the Aidan. But what is her prize, really? Rubbing out gas bubs. No thanks. The show isn\u2019t \u201cwrong\u201d: clubs do sort of suck, but the message is misguided: it\u2019s not better to have an Aidan. It is better to live like Aidan, who got a night in, a bucket o\u2019 fried chicken to himself, and a hot babe to soothe his belly when he is done. Aspirational.\n\n\u2014Allison P. Davis\n\nCarrie\u2019s apology bagels.\n\nI often think about the time Carrie was too busy to help Miranda, who was lying naked on the floor of her bathroom with a back injury, and sent Aidan instead \u2026 then later \u201capologized\u201d with bagels \u2026 only to have an in to talk about herself. I\u2019ve heard that people don\u2019t actually listen to each other in a conversation, but instead wait for the other person to stop so we can resume talking about our own issues. Watching Carrie arrive at Miranda\u2019s to \u201capologize\u201d with \u201cI\u2019m sorry bagels\u201d when she\u2019s actually there to talk about how Aidan has yet to forgive her (for cheating on him!) made me wonder how many times I\u2019ve pulled a similar self-obsessed move. How often do I feign interest in other people\u2019s issues all in the name of having a chance to talk about my own problems? Are we even listening to each other, and when we do hear our friends, do we care? Carrie certainly didn\u2019t \u2014 and she didn\u2019t even bring cream cheese! Bullshit bagels, indeed.\n\n\u2014Daise Bedolla\n\nWhen that dude painted Charlotte\u2019s vagina.\n\nCharlotte gets a lot of flak (mostly deserved, but at least she\u2019s not Carrie). She\u2019s always been the most relatable character for me personally: slightly creeped-out by what the other three are doing, consciously looking for marriage and family, and, most importantly, a brunette.\n\nAnd so it was particularly empowering for me when Charlotte decided to throw her native caution to the winds and let a famous artist paint her vagina (technically her vulva, but the wording wouldn\u2019t have been quite so satisfying). The image that has stayed with me, of course, is the artist\u2019s charmingly helpful wife, who wheedles Charlotte into participating with a very kindly, \u201cI bet you have a beautiful cunt, dear.\u201d There was something so pure about that moment, and I think some of it must be due to the fact that it\u2019s not a come-on or a line in any way. Charlotte came for Art and stayed for Art, and even as the most self-conscious of the SATC women, she proudly showed off her goods when they visited the gallery. The connection between your body and your sexuality gets such a workout on the show, but seeing this episode as a young teen developing a new and unfamiliar woman\u2019s body, it meant a lot that this most private part of your body could be beautiful, even if a man wasn\u2019t looking at it. You personally might think it was beautiful, even, and you would be right.\n\n\u2014Nicole Cliffe\n\nMiranda being attracted to the sandwich.\n\nWhile my love of the show is unwavering, I find nearly all of the characters on Sex and the City to be pretty insufferable. That is, except for Miranda, relatability queen. Like Miranda, I\u2019ve eaten many foods that I had mistakenly deemed as trash, straight out of the garbage can \u2014 cake included. I\u2019ve also found myself sexually attracted to food, real or otherwise, as did Miranda when she iconically wanted to bone a sandwich.\n\nTo clarify, the aforementioned sandwich scene isn\u2019t some American Pie\u2013esque, old-fashioned food-fucking. Instead, Miranda finds herself indignant, and then horny, after a fast-food worker dressed up as a sandwich catcalls her on the sidewalk. While there\u2019s something extremely unsettling about the monotonous tone in which the man sandwich says, \u201ceat me,\u201d I feel very close to Miranda in that scene. She\u2019s intrigued; I\u2019m intrigued. Is the sandwich man hot? She doesn\u2019t know, and neither do I. Though I\u2019m often suspicious of people in costume, would I feel differently if that person wasn\u2019t dressed up as the world\u2019s perfect food, the sandwich? I\u2019m not quite sure where this curiosity lands me on the Kinsey scale, but probably somewhere between a two and sitophilia.\n\n\u2014Amanda Arnold", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/06/01/satc-itatal/05.w710.h473.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/06/01/satc-itatal/satc-itatal-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3db/bc6/708adad44bc2b6784ed1243cef42d195e5-satc-itatal-feature-lede.2x.h600.w512.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/06/01/satc-itatal/07.nocrop.w710.h2147483647.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/06/01/satc-itatal/satc-itatal-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabriella Paiella"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/i-think-about-this-a-lot-sex-and-the-city-edition.html", "title": "I Think About This a Lot: Sex and the City Edition", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "I Think About This a Lot: Sex and the City Edition", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/i-think-about-this-a-lot-sex-and-the-city-edition.html", "description": "From Aidan eating too much chicken to the socialite falling out of the window, 15 writers share the moments that have stuck with them over the years.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/06/01/satc-itatal/satc-itatal-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "I Think About This a Lot: Sex and the City Edition", "description": "From Aidan eating too much chicken to the socialite falling out of the window, 15 writers share the moments that have stuck with them over the years.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/06/01/satc-itatal/satc-itatal-lede.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GMPaiella", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-06T07:00:01.983-04:00", "tag": "culture, tv, fixations, i think about this a lot, sex and the city, satc anniversary, satc", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "In honor of Sex and the City\u2019s 20th anniversary, a special installment of the \u201cI Think About This a Lot\u201d column in which 15 writers share the moments from the show that have stuck with them over the years.", "sailthru.tags": "culture, tv, fixations, i think about this a lot, sex and the city, satc anniversary, satc", "author": "Gabriella Paiella", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528282801.983, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
