I would have no problem with my son kissing me like that.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time people have taken issue with Mr. Brady\u2019s shows of affection, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted. He sparked controversy last year after he was photographed kissing his father on the lips after his Super Bowl win against the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Washington Times, LLC.
