Increasingly though, jeans are evolving into a comfortable travel option.\n\nThe Most Comfortable Jeans for Men and Women\n\nFrom designer jeans to fleece-lined skinnies, here are 10 pairs of the best travel jeans that are stylish but also comfortable enough you\u2019ll want to sleep in them.\n\nNo Nonsense Denim Leggings With Pockets\n\nThese denim leggings are fantastic for air travel. The denim is soft but holds its shape throughout the day, and you\u2019ll get the sophisticated look of jeans while wearing ultra-cozy leggings. Bonus: They have pockets for any little essentials you need close at hand.\n\nKUT from the Kloth Women\u2019s Catherine Boyfriend Jean\n\nThis pair of relaxed-fit jeans by KUT from the Kloth is perfect for traveling because of its loose style and spandex-cotton fabric. They\u2019re also machine washable, and the spandex in the material makes them extremely soft. We love the cuffed style as well. They come in a range of washes, allowing you to choose either a casual or polished look.\n\nDL1961 Women\u2019s Mara Instasculpt Straight Jeans\n\nAny pair of DL1961 denim will do the trick if you\u2019re looking for comfort, style, and quality, but I particularly like the Instasculpt styles, like these straight leg pairs, available in cropped or full-length. DL1961 denim is eco-friendly, antibacterial, and made of cotton and hybrid elastane, which allows for shape retention and 360-degree movement\u2014the perfect comfortable material for travel.\n\nDL1961 Vince Casual Straight Jeans\n\nJust like its women\u2019s styles, DL1961 makes a comfy jean from its signature denim for men. The Vince Casual Straight-Leg Jean comes in a variety of washes and colors that will suit all travel needs and styles. An Amazon reviewer said it best: \u201cLook of denim, freedom of sweatpants.\u201d\n\nWrangler\u2019s Flex Waist Jeans\n\nWrangler\u2019s flex waist collection is made from flexible denim for the perfect stretch material. The jeans have a mid-rise fit and come in many different shades of blue.\n\nLevi\u2019s Women\u2019s 710 Super Skinny Jeans\n\nLevi\u2019s 710 styles have advanced stretch and shape-holding technology to make them your most comfortable jeans yet. The Super Skinny style is made of extra stretch heavyweight denim, has 3.5 percent elastane, and fits any body shape flawlessly. It\u2019s available in several different washes and colors, so you might want to pick up more than one pair.\n\nLevi\u2019s Men\u2019s 541 Athletic Fit Stretch Jeans\n\nThese stretch heavyweight denim jeans have elastane and cotton for a relaxed fit, comfort, and mobility. The Athletic Fit Stretch Jeans come in several color and wash options, too.\n\nprAna Women\u2019s Kara Jean Pants\n\nThe best-selling Kara Jean by prAna is made from a 75 percent organic cotton. With five pockets, they can be worn long or cuffed, and have two percent spandex for some extra stretch. They come in a variety of colors, patterns, and washes, so it\u2019s worth investing in a few pairs if you like their fit for maximum versatility.\n\nFleece-Lined Jeans\n\nNothing says pajamas more than a pair of comfy fleece sweatpants or leggings. Well, luckily there are several fleece-lined jeans for both men and women out there that give you that extra comfort and warmth. For women, try a pair of Camii Mia Women\u2019s Slim Fit Fleece Skinny Jeans; for men, the Wrangler Authentics Men\u2019s Fleece Lined 5 Pocket Pants are a good option.\n\nMelissa McCarthy Seven7 Women\u2019s Plus-Size Tummyless Skinny Jean\n\nMelissa McCarthy Seven7 denim is the perfect denim line for plus-size travelers. The super soft stretch fabric holds its shape and has forward side seaming, a contoured waistband, and hip-slimming technology. The Tummyless Skinny in particular is made from a rayon spandex blend and is flattering for any body shape.\n\nMore from SmarterTravel:\n\nSome review products are sent to us free of charge and with no incentive to offer a favorable review.
