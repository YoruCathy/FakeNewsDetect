Liam Payne confirmed via Twitter that he and Cheryl Cole did in fact name their newborn son Bear.\n\nThe former One Direction singer, 23, subtly revealed the news during an exchange with TV personality Bear Grylls.\n\nThanks man hope he grows with an ounce of your courage! Your a boss \u2014 Liam (@LiamPayne) May 2, 2017\n\n\u201cGreat choice! Love & blessings to you guys as you start on the greatest adventure\u2026 @CherylOfficial @LiamPayne,\u201d Grylls, 42, tweeted to the new dad, along with a Daily Mail story reporting about the name.\n\nPayne replied: \u201cThanks man hope he grows with an ounce of your courage! Your a boss.\u201d\n\nPayne and Cole, 33, welcomed their first child together in March. \u201cMy close friends and family know there are very few times when I\u2019m left speechless\u2026 wow!\u201d Payne captioned an Instagram photo of himself holding his baby boy. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly happy to welcome our new baby boy into the world, it\u2019s a moment that I will never forget for the rest of my life and my favorite memory I have so far. I\u2019m completely in awe of his incredible mother and how she has been the whole way through this, she\u2019s really made my dreams come true. We haven\u2019t named him yet but he\u2019s already capturing hearts including mine. I feel very blessed.\u201d\n\nThe singer and Cole first met when he auditioned on the U.K.\u2019s The X Factor in 2008, when he was 14.
