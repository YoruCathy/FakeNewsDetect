Two guest bedrooms on the upper floor, one of which opens to the backyard through a bank of glass doors, share a hall bathroom with double-sink vanity and travertine lined combination bathtub/shower while the master bedroom provides what listing details describe as \u201cample closet space and a luxurious bath with separate tub and shower.\u201d\n\nA broad concrete terrace backed by a lushly planted and custom-lit hillside runs the full width of the rear fa\u00e7ade and comfortably incorporates a lounge area with fire pit and an al fresco covered dining area.
