I\u2019m engaged,\u2019\u201d the Game of Thrones star, 22, told Marie Claire for its May 2018 Fresh Faces issue. \u201cThere\u2019s this weird misconception that being married is the greatest thing that\u2019ll ever happen to you.\u201d\n\nThe actress, who has found worldwide fame while starring on the HBO series, knows the difference between finding happiness in a relationship and finding it within her work: \u201cI\u2019ve always found that my career is something I work for, and when I achieve something, there\u2019s a sense that this is the greatest thing I\u2019ll do in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely to be engaged. Not like I achieved anything, but I found my person, like I\u2019d find a house that I love and want to stay in forever. There\u2019s a sense of peace that comes with finding your person,\u201d the X-Men: Apocalypse star continued. \u201cBut there\u2019s a drive that comes with your career.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the happy couple, who began dating in 2016, announced their engagement in October 2017 with matching Instagram posts. They celebrated the exciting news in November surrounded by family and friends, including Tom Holland, Ashley Graham and the DNCE singer\u2019s brothers Kevin and Nick Jonas, at a star-studded party at Mamo restaurant in New York City. An onlooker told Us at the time, \u201cIt was such a fun night, and Joe and Sophie couldn\u2019t have looked happier.\u201d\n\nMaisie Williams, Turner\u2019s GoT costar and TV sister, will be a bridesmaid at the couple\u2019s upcoming wedding.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-newsstand-cover-marie-claire.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-joe-jonas1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-newsstand-cover-marie-claire.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-newsstand-cover-marie-claire.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sophie-turner-is-still-shocked-shes-engaged-to-joe-jonas/", "title": "Sophie Turner Is Still Shocked She\u2019s Engaged to Joe Jonas", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Sophie Turner\u00a0revealed she is still shocked she is engaged to Joe Jonas\u00a0\u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sophie Turner Is Still Shocked She\u2019s Engaged\u00a0to Joe Jonas", "description": "Sophie Turner\u00a0revealed she is still shocked she is engaged to Joe Jonas\u00a0\u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sophie-turner-is-still-shocked-shes-engaged-to-joe-jonas/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-newsstand-cover-marie-claire.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-newsstand-cover-marie-claire.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-11T22:21:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Sophie Turner\u00a0revealed she is still shocked she is engaged to Joe Jonas\u00a0\u2014 find out more", "title": "Sophie Turner Is Still Shocked She\u2019s Engaged\u00a0to Joe Jonas", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/sophie-turner-newsstand-cover-marie-claire.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523485275.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
