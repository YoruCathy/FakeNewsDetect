A post shared by heidipratt (@heidipratt) on Jul 17, 2017 at 12:10pm PDT\n\nThe 30-year-old reality star, who\u2019s expecting a son, went for a doctor\u2019s appointment on Monday, July 17, and shared the experience on her Snapchat. \u201cSo excited to see my little baby today,\u201d Montag said as she checked in for her ultrasound and glucose test.\n\nIt seems the former Hills star was surprised when she stepped on the scale. \u201cI\u2019ve already gained 25 pounds!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI mean, no big deal, right? Just three more months to go at 4 pounds a month.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ll only gain about 40 pounds or so, some women gain 25,\u201d Montag, who is due Oct. 19, continued. \u201cI think I over ate.\u201d\n\nHer husband, Spencer Pratt, was also on hand for the doctor\u2019s appointment, and could be seen in a Snapchat video as Montag had her ultrasound done. \u201cHeidi has wanted to be a mom since the day I met her,\u201d the 33-year-old told Us Weekly exclusively in an April interview. \u201cShe has planned for and thought about this.\u201d\n\nCelebrity Pregnancy Cravings\n\nThe parents-to-be have been married since they eloped in November 2008. They also had a traditional church ceremony in April 2009. This will be their first child together.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/heidi-montag-instagram-zoom-9ab5d2f2-3b0a-4ec7-b737-6f0d8c8bd72e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C870px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/632867344_heidi-montag-spencer-pratt-zoom-d8853fc4-063b-4064-b9ec-d9396933411b.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/heidi-montag-snapchat-zoom-9b5bb9cd-cae7-4d22-b1b8-b95ab1b2b4b0.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/heidi-montag-instagram-zoom-9ab5d2f2-3b0a-4ec7-b737-6f0d8c8bd72e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C870px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/heidi-montag-reveals-shes-gained-25-pounds-during-pregnancy-so-far-w492866/", "title": "Heidi Montag Reveals She's Gained 25 Pounds During Pregnancy So Far", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018The Hills\u2019 reality star Heidi Montag reveals she\u2019s gained 25 pounds during the first six months of her pregnancy \u2014 see her baby update", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Heidi Montag Reveals How Much Pregnancy Weight She\u2019s Gained So Far", "description": "\u2018The Hills\u2019 reality star Heidi Montag reveals she\u2019s gained 25 pounds during the first six months of her pregnancy \u2014 see her baby update", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/heidi-montag-reveals-shes-gained-25-pounds-during-pregnancy-so-far-w492866/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:53:29+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/heidi-montag-instagram-zoom-9ab5d2f2-3b0a-4ec7-b737-6f0d8c8bd72e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C870px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/heidi-montag-instagram-zoom-9ab5d2f2-3b0a-4ec7-b737-6f0d8c8bd72e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C870px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-07-18T15:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:53:29+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018The Hills\u2019 reality star Heidi Montag reveals she\u2019s gained 25 pounds during the first six months of her pregnancy \u2014 see her baby update", "title": "Heidi Montag Reveals How Much Pregnancy Weight She\u2019s Gained So Far", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/heidi-montag-instagram-zoom-9ab5d2f2-3b0a-4ec7-b737-6f0d8c8bd72e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C870px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500390900.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
