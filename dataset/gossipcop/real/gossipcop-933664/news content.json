There's nothing like a powerful woman walking into a room; her presence is like nothing else.\"\n\nThe seven-time-grand-slam winner went on to laud the powerful women she sees in sport today.\n\n\u201cThere are so many emerging forces,\u201d she said, \u201cthere's been so much growth for women in sports. It's very exciting.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to stand up for what you believe in and I think I've done a good job.
