I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public.'\"\n\nRobin Wright demanded equal 'House of Cards' pay\n\nSpacey was reportedly being paid $500,000 an episode in 2014. Forbes reported in 2015 that Wright made estimated $5.5 million from \"House of Cards,\" which comes out to approximately $420,000 an episode.\n\nBut in a recent interview with United Airlines in-flight magazine Rhapsody the actress said that increased payday never came.\n\n\"I don't think I'm getting paid the same amount,\" she said. \"They told me I was getting a raise. But ... I don't think so.\"\n\nWright said she never intended to become a spokesperson for gender pay disparity but \"That was one of 20 questions they asked me, and it went viral.\"\n\nAccording to the publication, Media Rights Capital -- the company that produces \"House of Cards\" -- noted it wasn't possible for the two actors to make the same since Spacey is one of the show's founding producers.\n\nInstead, Wright received an executive producer credit and the opportunities to serve as director.\n\nShe said in the Rhapsody interview, \"I really don't like being duped.\"\n\n\"It's such a male-dominant workforce still,\" Wright said. \"There's a conditioning. And changing the condition of men is what needs to happen.\"\n\nLast year Forbes named Spacey the 12th highest paid TV actor of 2016, estimating he earned $10.5 million for his role as the diabolical Underwood. Wright did not make their list last year of the 15 highest paid TV actresses.", "images": ["https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnn.svg", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160518123311-robin-wright-kevin-spacey-equal-pay-780x439.jpg", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160304062505-kevin-spacey-house-of-cards-elections-00001102-1024x576.jpg", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/newsletters/reliable_sources/rs-with-button_large1x1.jpg", "https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnnbusiness.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif"], "top_img": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160518123311-robin-wright-kevin-spacey-equal-pay-780x439.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa France"], "canonical_link": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/31/media/robin-wright-house-cards-salary/index.html", "title": "Robin Wright demanded equal pay.
