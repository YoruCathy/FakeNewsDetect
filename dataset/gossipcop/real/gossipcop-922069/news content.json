Oh Well You can let them all know that everyone on behalf on Stranger things would\u2019ve come! I think your [sic] awesome and next year I would like an invite... Please?\" Brown, 14, tweeted back at Alambat.\n\nMatarazzo, 15, jumped in in, too, offering to bring a snack for next year's big shindig.\n\n\"Count me in too! I\u2019ll bring the chocolate pudding,\" he added.\n\nAlambat basically lost her mind after seeing the tweets.\n\nNo word yet on whether this party will be held in the parallel world of the Upside Down.\n\nGaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard and Caleb McLaughlin attend the \"Stranger Things\" FYC event on June 6, 2017, in Beverly Hills, Calif.
