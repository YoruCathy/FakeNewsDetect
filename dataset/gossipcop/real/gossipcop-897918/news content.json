The Good Place star, 37, was the first-ever host of the Screen Actors Guild Awards, and she really upped her style game for the occasion.\n\nBell rocked not one, but four different gowns throughout the course of the evening \u2013 each more dazzling than the next.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFirst, she went full princess for her red carpet getup, in a fuchsia strapless J.Mendel gown with floral accents. To celebrate the lovely look, Bell was spotted posing on the carpet with Stranger Things actor David Harbour.\n\nGetty Images\n\nOnce she got inside The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, Bell kicked things up a notch in a sexy, low-cut black Reem Acra gown with silver embellishments. She rocked the look during her opening monologue, in which she called for people to come together and share their stories.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cAs we march forward with active momentum and open ears, let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re leading the charge with empathy and with diligence, because fear and anger never win the race,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd most importantly regardless of our differences, I think we can all come together and delight in one thing. Frozen 2 is coming out in 2019! I\u2019m very excited.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs the show continued, Bell changed into a sparkly long-sleeve Reem Acra black gown with a pink rhinestone collar.\n\nBut it was her final look of the night that really wowed. Bell greeted SAG winners backstage after their wins in a stunning Yanina Couture black gown with a full skirt, open back, and plunging neckline. She swept her blonde locks back in a sleek up-do.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhich look was your favorite?
