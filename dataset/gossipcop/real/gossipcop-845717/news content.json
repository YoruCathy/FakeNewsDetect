The blog looked at when each person first appeared on either list, and also gathered news reports and rankings to pinpoint their age at the time. When it wasn't possible to find an exact age, Betway Insider made an estimate based on the individual's first big success in business.\n\nTech appears to be the fastest wealth-building industry; the richest people in tech averaged five years as millionaires before becoming billionaires.\n\nBelow, how long it took the richest people in the world to go from millionaire to billionaire. The list excludes two people \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt-Meyers and Mukesh Ambani \u2014 who both inherited their billions, skipping the millionaire stage completely. All current net worth figures are from Forbes' real-time ranking as of April 4.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5ac5268a7a74af25008b46bb?width=1200&format=jpeg",
