But now, Bella revealed that she eventually struggled to produce as much milk as she used to.\n\n\u201cMy breast milk\u2019s taken a huge dip,\u201d she said at a breastfeeding support group, as seen in a sneak peek from Wednesday\u2019s episode of Total Divas.\n\n\u201cI used to have enough where I donate. And now I\u2019ve realized in the last month that I can\u2019t even keep up with her during the day so I\u2019ve had to introduce one bottle of formula a day,\" she continued. \"I\u2019m trying to pump and do all this stuff, but it\u2019s the stress\u2014I hate pumping, to the point it makes me feel bad when I\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m so miserable.\u201d\n\nBella also said in the clip that she struggled with \u201cmom guilt\u201d over her milk production, adding that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst feeling in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought pumping could balance Birdie and my job but it\u2019s not working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird how you just constantly feel like you\u2019re failing.\u201d\n\nYour breast milk usually works on a \"supply and demand\" schedule. So if there's less demand, the supply will go down as well.\n\nFor instance, \"if the baby starts sleeping through the night or if mom is back to work and not breastfeeding or pumping as much as she was, milk supply can drop,\" Diane L. Spatz, Ph.D., a professor of perinatal nursing at the University of Pennsylvania and nurse researcher at The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, tells SELF.\n\nOr, \u201cif the baby drinks less milk, or formula is introduced instead of breast milk, the supply can dwindle,\u201d Joan Younger Meek, M.D., R.D., chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding and associate dean for Graduate Medical Education at Florida State University College of Medicine, tells SELF.\n\nCertain medications, like hormonal birth control, can also affect your milk supply, as can fatigue or stress, Joanne Goldbort, Ph.D., R.N., a breastfeeding researcher and assistant professor in the College of Nursing at Michigan State University, tells SELF. And if you get your period when you're nursing, you may also see a drop in your milk supply during that time, Spatz says.\n\nBabies can also go through growth spurts when they want to nurse more, and it can seem like you\u2019re not producing as much when your baby feeds, but your body may simply be adjusting your milk supply to try to meet your baby\u2019s needs, Dr. Meek says.\n\nOn the flip side, if the demand can't keep up with the supply, you'll eventually produce less milk.\n\nFor instance, some people might get a little \u201cpump happy,\u201d overstimulate their breasts, and create a safety net of excess milk, Leigh Anne O'Connor, IBCLC, a La Leche League Leader, tells SELF. That sounds great, but it can actually mess with your milk production in the long run. They may use that stored milk to feed their baby and not realize that they also still need to continue pumping and stimulating the breasts to keep up milk production, she explains.\n\nAnd if you have an oversupply, the milk may also flow so easily that your baby doesn\u2019t really need to suck hard to get to your milk, O\u2019Connor says. \u201cOver time, the baby who has been riding the wave of oversupply does not stimulate the breasts, and this lack of stimulation will send a signal to the breasts to slow down milk production,\u201d she explains.\n\nIf you\u2019re having any difficulties with your milk supply, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your child\u2019s pediatrician as well as a breastfeeding expert.\n\nEven if you think you're not producing enough milk, it's important to have your child\u2019s pediatrician help you gauge how your baby is growing to see whether or not they\u2019re actually getting the milk they need, Dr. Meek says.", "images": ["https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b881cac9134316166c7782c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/headshot_korin.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Korin Miller", "Korin Mille"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/brie-bella-milk-production-breastfeeding", "title": "'Total Divas' Star Brie Bella's Milk Production Took 'a Huge Dip' While Breastfeeding Her Daughter", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Korin Miller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "WWE wrestler and \"Total Divas\" star Brie Bella explained in an upcoming episode that her milk supply dropped, which gave her \"mom guilt.\"", "id": "5bbce5473f15b979ec036a5c", "keywords": "pregnancy & motherhood,breastfeeding,news", "news_keywords": "pregnancy & motherhood,breastfeeding,news", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5bbce5473f15b979ec036a5c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"WWE wrestler and \\\"Total Divas\\\" star Brie Bella explained in an upcoming episode that her milk supply dropped, which gave her \\\"mom guilt.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The experience gave her \"mom guilt.\"", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "'Total Divas' Star Brie Bella's Milk Production Took 'a Huge Dip' While Breastfeeding Her Daughter", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/brie-bella-milk-production-breastfeeding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "The experience gave her \"mom guilt.\"", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.self.com/photos/5bbd0119564c7a0409065f20/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1032623628.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "'Total Divas' Star Brie Bella's Milk Production Took 'a Huge Dip' While Breastfeeding Her Daughter"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
