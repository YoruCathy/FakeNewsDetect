{"url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/star-wars-episode-ix-release-date-trailer-cast-news/", "text": "There\u2019s been plenty of speculation about the future of the Star Wars franchise since 2017\u2019s Star Wars: Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi hit theaters, and now the premiere of Star Wars: Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker is here The final, full-length trailer for The Rise of Skywalker offered some intriguing hints as to how the Skywalker saga will conclude, including a brief scene from an epic space battle featuring more than a few iconic ships, and now that we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve got our own opinions that don\u2019t necessarily follow the critics\u2019 consensus.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker brings back director J.J. Abrams to close out this arc of the iconic sci-fi saga after he helmed 2015\u2019s franchise-relaunching Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens. While Star Wars: Episode IX is now available for your viewing pleasure, if you\u2019ve yet to see the film, here\u2019s everything to know ahead of the action.\n\nJedi mind tricks\n\nIn a special event hosted in the game Fortnite, Disney released another clip from the upcoming film.\n\nThis time, we see Rey, Finn, and Poe land on an Imperial space station (which looks strangely familiar to previous films\u2019 Death Star scenes) and instantly take out a few Stormtroopers. They run into a corridor where they\u2019re stopped by two more Stormtroopers and look to be done for. However, Rey raises a hand and pulls a classic page from Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s book, telling the Stormtroopers, \u201cIt\u2019s okay that we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThey agree, after which Poe asks Finn, \u201cDoes she do that to us?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a little comic relief following a potentially significant reveal: That Rey has fully embraced and mastered the Jedi ability to control minds.\n\nA telling new clip\n\nA clip from Episode IX released a week before Rise of Skywalker hit theaters features the voice of James Earl Jones, who famously voiced Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy.\n\nEmperor Palpatine\u2019s voice joins that of Vader, as are the voices of Supreme Leader Snoke, taunting Kylo Ren.\n\n\u201cI have been every voice you have ever heard inside your head,\u201d the Sith voices hiss at Kylo, implying that Palpatine\u2019s powers may have conquered death long enough to pull the strings for the rise of the First Order. Of course, without additional context, it\u2019s impossible to say definitively what\u2019s going on here and that, naturally, is the point of the teaser.\n\nAt the very least, the clip shows that The Rise of Skywalker makes a concerted effort to tie together all three trilogies to bring the Star Wars saga to a close.\n\nThey can fly now\n\nDisney released a clip from The Rise of Skywalker on November 25 featuring Rey, Finn, Poe, and a few more familiar characters racing across a desert while being pursued by stormtroopers. They weren\u2019t your usual First Order troops, however, as the stormtroopers took to the sky using jetpacks in the 30-second clip, prompting some surprise from the hero characters. Yes, they can fly now.\n\nFinal trailer and ticket sales\n\nThe final trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (see above) premiered \u2014 much like past trailers for the episodic installments of the franchise \u2014 during a broadcast of the NFL\u2019s Monday Night Football on October 21. Tickets for The Rise of Skywalker officially went on sale just before the trailer\u2019s debut.\n\nHello, Babu\n\nAs part of Lucasfilm\u2019s annual \u201cForce Friday\u201d campaign, the studio revealed a new character who debuted in The Rise of Skywalker: Babu Frik.\n\nThe character\u2019s official description (via StarWars.com) reads as follows: \u201cThe tiny Anzellan droidsmith \u2026 works among the Spice Runners of Kijimi and can reprogram or modify virtually any droid \u2014 regardless of the security measures protecting its systems.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Star Wars universe, Babu.\n\nD23 preview: The last Jedi goes dark?\n\nDisney gave Star Wars fans an early look at some new footage from The Rise of Skywalker during the company\u2019s D23 Expo in August, and the preview generated quite a bit of discussion due to its closing scene: A shot of Rey (Daisy Ridley) in a dark cloak, wielding a double-bladed, red lightsaber similar to the one Darth Maul used in The Phantom Menace.\n\nAlong with that cryptic tease, the video also featured one of the repurposed scenes from the prior films that feature the late Carrie Fisher as Leia, as well as a few other notable moments.\n\nA foreboding poster\n\nRevealed at Disney\u2019s surprisingly packed D23 Expo event in Anaheim, California, the poster for the film is a daringly imaginative battle scene between our hero Rey (Daisy Ridley) and a fully masked Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The previously rumored return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is front and center as he looks on at the fight from the skies above with demonic eyes.\n\nA tight schedule\n\nThe film\u2019s late change in directors (by Star Wars standards, at least) was keenly felt by the production team, and prompted some creative maintenance of the filming schedule, according to Rise of Skywalker editor Maryann Brandon.\n\nIn an interview with Express U.K., the longtime collaborator with Abrams revealed that the tight production schedule for the film had her take the unusual step of cutting footage on set, while they were still filming.\n\n\u201cWhen we did The Force Awakens, we started in May and we finished shooting in October, and we were out [the following] Christmas,\u201d she explained. \u201cFor this film, we didn\u2019t start until August, so we weren\u2019t done until February shooting \u2014 so we have four months less time, and it\u2019s a very big film.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I convinced JJ to let me cut on the set,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was like, \u2018No, we never do that.\u2019 I [said], \u2018Just try it, so I can start turning over shots.'\u201d\n\nThe result was a situation in which Brandon was rarely more than 10 feet from Abrams at any given point during the filming of Rise of Skywalker, editing the movie as it was being filmed.\n\n\u201cSo if the camera would move 10 feet, I would move 10 feet,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI was everywhere.\u201d\n\nMore details (and photos) emerge\n\nIn May, Vanity Fair published an in-depth preview of Rise of Skywalker featuring some of the first looks at the characters \u2014 both new and returning \u2014 that appear in the trilogy-ending chapter of the saga.\n\nAmong the biggest revelations from the preview include the return of the Knights of Ren, and the confirmation of Keri Russell\u2019s character in the film, a \u201cmasked scoundrel\u201d known as Zorri Bliss.\n\nV.F. can exclusively confirm that the mysterious Knights of Ren\u2014first seen in #StarWars: The Force Awakens\u2014are back in #TheRiseofSkywalker https://t.co/ER4XSJmZ8k pic.twitter.com/cBrdAOrqSv \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) May 22, 2019\n\nA photo also revealed the first look at Naomi Ackie as Jannah, who joins Finn (John Boyega) in one of the photos, riding into battle on creatures known Orbaks.\n\nHere\u2019s what we can tell you about #TheRiseofSkywalker: when the film picks up\u2014about a year after the end of The Last Jedi\u2014Rey, Finn, and Poe are all finally in the same place for the first time since The Force Awakens https://t.co/cbjHB1IDSd pic.twitter.com/XWqLCCbsrK \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) May 22, 2019\n\nFranchise newcomer Richard E. Grant is also seen in the photos as the First Order\u2019s Allegiant General Pryde.\n\nNew villain alert! Richard E. Grant joins #StarWars as Allegiant General Pryde https://t.co/MZcbyGMav7 \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) May 22, 2019\n\nThe full gallery of photos is available at Vanity Fair\u2019s website.\n\nThe first look\n\nThe first trailer for The Rise of Skywalker dropped in front of a packed crowd at Star Wars Celebration in Chicago, and it revealed much more than just the film\u2019s title. The trailer would be viewed more than 111 million times within the first 24 hours it was available, according to Deadline, receiving 20 million more views than the trailer for Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi did during the same period of time.\n\nAs far as what the trailer revealed, Mark Hamill provided the preview\u2019s evocative voice-over, while footage of Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa \u2014 which was originally filmed for The Force Awakens \u2014 tugged at fans\u2019 heartstrings. Billy Dee Williams as the elder Lando Calrissian looked as dapper as ever sitting in the Millennium Falcon\u2019s cockpit.\n\nMore Star Wars News\n\nThe trailer\u2019s biggest surprise came at the very end, however, when a maniacal laugh took over the soundtrack. That cackle belongs to none other than former Emperor Palpatine, who (supposedly) died at the end of Star Wars: Episode VI \u2014 Return of the Jedi. Just in case there was any confusion, Palpatine actor Ian McDiarmid took the Star Wars Celebration stage after the trailer finished playing and, in character, growled, \u201cRoll it again.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, the Star Wars Celebration Episode IX panel was light on details, although Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy let the assembled cast members share a few small tidbits. Naomi Ackie\u2019s new character is named Jannah. The Rise of Skywalker brings the sequel trilogy characters together for a single adventure, and BB-8 has a new droid pal named DIO, who is just as cute as you would imagine.\n\nA leaked peek?\n\nJust a couple of weeks before Star Wars Celebration Chicago alleged promotional materials for the film leaked on Making Star Wars. The images, which include a collage and character sheets, confirm a number of long-standing rumors and offer fans a glimpse of some of Star Wars: Episode IX\u2018s new characters.\n\nRey takes center stage on the \u201cleaked\u201d image, dressed in an outfit that recalls both Luke Skywalker\u2019s all-white get-up in Star Wars: Episode IV \u2014 A New Hope and Padme\u2019s costume during Attack of the Clones\u2019 final battle scene. Poe Dameron is wearing full-on Resistance fighter garb, Finn holds a blaster, and C-3PO wields a Wookiee bowcaster, just like previous reports said he would. Kelly Marie Tran\u2019s Rose Tico, who first appeared in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, is conspicuously absent.\n\nOn the villains\u2019 side, Kylo Ren seems to have reforged his mask and is flanked by a group of similarly clad soldiers who are most likely the mysterious Knights of Ren. Kylo\u2019s long-rumored legion of red Stormtroopers also appears as does a masked woman who the character sheets call \u201cZorri,\u201d and who matches previous descriptions of the new character played by The Americans\u2019 Keri Russell.\n\nThe character sheets correctly identify Naomi Ackie\u2019s bow-wielding character as Jannah and offer a very blurry glimpse at Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, whose fashion sense doesn\u2019t seem to have changed much over the past 40 years.\n\nThe end of an era\n\nOn January 15, 2019, Abrams shared some momentous news on Twitter: Principal photography on Star Wars: Episode IX has wrapped after a six-month shoot, marking the end of filming on both Disney\u2019s sequel trilogy and the Skywalker family saga as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt feels impossible, but today wrapped photography on Episode IX,\u201d Abrams wrote alongside a photo of stars Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Issac embracing on set. \u201cThere is no adequate way to thank this truly magical crew and cast. I\u2019m forever indebted to you all.\u201d\n\nIt feels impossible, but today wrapped photography on Episode IX. There is no adequate way to thank this truly magical crew and cast. I\u2019m forever indebted to you all. pic.twitter.com/138AprtFuZ \u2014 JJ Abrams (@jjabrams) February 15, 2019\n\nAbrams wasn\u2019t the only one who felt that way. Boyega posted the same photo on his social media feed, along with a heartfelt message. \u201cThat\u2019s a wrap on Star Wars episode 9 and the end to a chapter of my life that I couldn\u2019t be more thankful for,\u201d Boyega said. \u201cIt really has been a joy to be in these movies surrounded by amazing people. JJ thank you for making my dreams come true.\u201d\n\nCosmic cameos\n\nThe Star Wars saga has a long history of bringing in famous actors, musicians, and other familiar faces for small parts \u2014 often under heavy makeup or costumes \u2014 as a nod to some of the franchise\u2019s most high-profile fans.\n\nStar Wars: Celebrity Chef Jamie Oliver Lands Episode IX Cameo https://t.co/3LXRF7QEGZ pic.twitter.com/5vNAsNsSK8 \u2014 Comic Book Resources (@CBR) December 26, 2018\n\nAccording to The Sun, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver suited up as a First Order stormtrooper for Episode IX. Oliver, who hosted the popular BBC series The Naked Chef for its three-season run, was offered the part after gaining attention for his Star Wars fandom over the years.\n\nOliver joins award-winning musician Ed Sheeran, who will also have a cameo in Episode IX, with both men playing First Order stormtroopers in the film.\n\nOne year later\n\nGiven how little time elapsed between the events of Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens and Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi, it comes as a bit of a surprise that Episode IX jumps ahead in the timeline a bit for its story.\n\nSpeaking to Empire Magazine about the film, actor John Boyega \u2014 who portrayed former First Order stormtrooper Finn in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi \u2014 indicated that Episode IX will pick up \u201croughly one year\u201d after the events of its 2017 predecessor. At Star Wars Celebration 2019, panelists confirmed that there would be a sizable time jump between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nJohn Boyega has confirmed that Star Wars: Episode #IX takes place ONE YEAR after the events of 'The Last Jedi'. [Empire Issue] pic.twitter.com/wC8iOV9Bv6 \u2014 Star Wars Stuff (@starwarstuff) December 22, 2018\n\nRumor patrol: Knights of Ren\n\nAs with any Star Wars movie, there\u2019s no shortage of rumors circling Episode IX, and a few have sparked quite a bit of discussion in mainstream circles.\n\nThe mysterious Knights of Ren were also the subject of a popular rumor making the rounds, with ComicBook.com reporting that a person present at a Disney marketing event confirmed that the shadowy group seen in Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens and led by Kylo Ren will indeed be in Episode IX.\n\n\u201cThey will definitely be in the next movie,\u201d writes the unidentified source. \u201cThey did show numerous pictures/artwork of them.\u201d\n\nThe Doctor is in\n\nOne of cinema\u2019s most popular sci-fi franchises will draw from the ranks of one of television\u2019s longest-running sci-fi sagas.\n\nIn late August 2018, former Doctor Who star Matt Smith (pictured above) was reported to be the latest casting addition to Episode IX.\n\nSmith, who played the 11th Doctor in the wildly popular British sci-fi series and recently earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his performance in the Netflix series The Crown, will play an unidentified \u201ckey role\u201d in the Star Wars sequel, according to Variety.\n\nA bittersweet beginning\n\nAbrams commemorated the August 1 start of production on Episode IX with his first post on Twitter, which acknowledged the absence of franchise veteran Carrie Fisher on the set and thanked Episode VIII director Rian Johnson and Star Wars creator George Lucas for getting the saga to this point.\n\nBittersweet starting this next chapter without Carrie, but thanks to an extraordinary cast and crew, we are ready to go. Grateful for @rianjohnson and special thanks to George Lucas for creating this incredible world and beginning a story of which we are lucky to be a part. #IX pic.twitter.com/FOfnGwVut5 \u2014 JJ Abrams (@jjabrams) August 1, 2018\n\nOfficial cast\n\nOn July 27, Lucasfilm\u2019s official Star Wars page listed the major cast list, including the big names returning and those joining anew the latest film in the franchise. And yes, that means Billy Dee Williams officially returns as the iconic Lando Calrissian, as does Mark Hamill which, for reasons we won\u2019t specify here, may come as a surprise to some. Follow below for the official cast list:\n\nOfficially returning for Episode IX are Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, and Billie Lourd.\n\nJoining the cast for their first Star Wars experience are Naomi Ackie (Dr. Who), Richard E. Grant, and Keri Russell. In addition, veteran Star Wars actors returning include Williams (as promised), Hamill (Luke Skywalker), and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO).\n\nBut those aren\u2019t the only familiar faces coming back. The announcement states that the late Carrie Fisher\u2019s character, Leia Organa, also returns for the film \u201cusing previously unreleased footage shot for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\u201d This may come as a surprise to some following news that no CG version of Fisher\u2019s character would be used for Episode IX (seemingly implying Leia would not return). However, Episode IX director J.J. Abrams made a statement to alleviate concerns.\n\n\u201cWe desperately loved Carrie Fisher,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cFinding a truly satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga without her eluded us. We were never going to recast, or use a CG character. With the support and blessing from her daughter, Billie, we have found a way to honor Carrie\u2019s legacy and role as Leia in Episode IX by using unseen footage we shot together in Episode VII.\u201d\n\nA tricky new title\n\nStar Wars films are notorious for using working titles to throw off the public and keep production costs low in terms of locations and services. Episode VI \u2014 Return of the Jedi was shot under the guise of a horror movie called Blue Harvest. Meanwhile, Episode II \u2014 Attack of the Clones poked fun at the negative response to prequel trilogy\u2019s Gungan leader with the title Jar-Jar\u2019s Big Adventure.\n\nSometimes the production title can offer clues, though they may not make sense until after the film is released. Fantha Tracks has reported that the working title for Episode IX was trIXie. The site claimed that \u201cthe same research methods and public sources were used by the same team to uncover the production names of every Disney-era Star Wars film to date.\u201d\n\nThe Force Awakens was shot under the title AVCO, which Bleeding Cool reported was the name of the theater in Los Alamos where a young J.J. Abrams saw the first Star Wars film. So what does trIXie refer to, if anything? It appears to simply be a way to get the roman numeral for the number 9 in the title.\n\nReunion time\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of the Star Wars trilogies that came before it, the current three-part story arc had its main characters separating in Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi, the middle chapter of the saga (much like the characters did in Episode II \u2014 Attack of the Clones and Episode V \u2014 The Empire Strikes Back). As with those previous trilogies, though, the cast reunited for one big team-up for the concluding installment.\n\nAsked about Episode IX during a convention in Washington, D.C. in 2018, Boyega said he expects the film to bring together his character, Finn, with Daisy Ridley\u2019s character, Rey. The pair have been separated since the events of Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens, but that period apart is nearing its end.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read the script for Episode IX,\u201d he said (via SlashFilm). \u201cBut Daisy did shoot me a text saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, I just heard from J.J. [Abrams], and we\u2019re back together.\u2019 That\u2019s what I\u2019m really excited about, is Finn and Rey back together again.\u201d\n\nDifferent endings, same result?\n\nWhile discussing the differences in working with Star Wars directors J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson, Hamill revealed how the creator of the sci-fi saga, Lucas, planned to handle the later years of his iconic character, Luke Skywalker.\n\n\u201cI happen to know that George didn\u2019t kill Luke until the end of [Episode] IX, after he trained Leia,\u201d Hamill told IGN. \u201cWhich is another thread that was never played upon [in The Last Jedi].\u201d\n\nAlthough most of Lucas\u2019 plans for a sequel trilogy were reportedly scrapped when Disney took over the franchise, The Last Jedi did get to a point with some of its main characters that has a lot in common with those early outlines. Luke\u2019s death occurred one episode earlier, and Leia (Carrie Fisher) did show some aptitude with The Force in Johnson\u2019s 2017 film.\n\n\u201cGeorge had an overall arc \u2014 if he didn\u2019t have all the details, he had sort of an overall feel for where the [sequel trilogy was] going \u2014 but this [sequel trilogy] is more like a relay race,\u201d Hamill said of the current saga, which appears to be letting its creative teams take the over-arching events in some unexpected directions, too. \u201cYou run and hand the torch off to the next guy, he picks it up and goes.\u201d\n\nThe rich get richer\n\nWhatever your thoughts about Episode VIII, most can agree that it was a visually spectacular film. Scenes like the throne room saber battle and Vice Admiral Holdo\u2019s lightspeed strike were breathtaking, thanks to some excellent art direction and production design. Now, the team for Episode IX has a new, distinguished member: Paul Inglis, who served as art director for the excellent (and gorgeous) Blade Runner 2049.\n\nThanks to a report from Omega Underground, we know Inglis was tapped as the supervising art director for Episode IX, to work alongside Abrams and the production team to define the film\u2019s aesthetic. Inglis\u2019 previous credits also include Skyfall, Game of Thrones, Prometheus, and Children of Men.\n\nA different kind of ship\n\nSome Star Wars fans saw Rey (Ridley) and Poe (Isaac) meet in The Last Jedi and started hoping it was their meet-cute. The single scene was enough to fuel shipping rumors \u2014 so much so that Ridley had to answer a question about it during a promotional event in China. Redditor Niamor89 posted a video (via Sleemo) showing the actress discussing the two Resistance fighters\u2019 possible romantic future. Put simply, she doesn\u2019t really want them to have one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have relationships that are not romantic,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think in films you always need a romantic relationship. I think friend relationships can be romantic in their gestures and their intimacy and all of that. So I think, hopefully \u2014 you know, if Rey and Poe get to have some scenes together and stuff \u2014 that there will be intimacy, but I think, for me, it doesn\u2019t have to be romantic love.\u201d\n\nLocation on loch\n\nThe next installment of the Star Wars franchise headed to the highlands \u2014 the county of Argyll in the Scottish Highlands, to be precise.\n\nA report in Scotland\u2019s Daily Record indicated that a new Star Wars movie began filming in the western Scottish county of Argyll in June, with shooting taking place in the historic mountain pass known as the Rest and Be Thankful. Although the initial report suggested that it was Johnson\u2019s spinoff trilogy that filmed in Argyll, that series hasn\u2019t entered production \u2014 so if a Star Wars movie did indeed shoot in Argyll, it\u2019s most likely Abrams\u2019 Episode IX.\n\nParent problems, redux\n\nAlthough The Last Jedi seemed to offer some resolution regarding the mystery of Rey\u2019s lineage, Johnson indicated in an interview with Huffington Post that fans might not have heard the end of that particular identity crisis.\n\n\u201cAnything\u2019s still open, and I\u2019m not writing the next film. [Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio] are doing it,\u201d said Johnson while discussing the revelation about Rey\u2019s parents that has become one of the most polarizing aspects of the film.\n\nTheir story will go on\n\nDon\u2019t let the description of Episode IX as a \u201cconcluding chapter\u201d mislead you: The stars of the sequel trilogy aren\u2019t going away.\n\nIn a November 2017 interview featured on The Star Wars Show, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy indicated that many of the main characters introduced in Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens will continue their stories in Episode IX and beyond the sequel trilogy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sitting down now, we\u2019re talking about the next 10 years of Star Wars stories, and we\u2019re looking at, narratively, where that might go,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cFuture stories beyond Episode IX with these new characters \u2014 Rey, Poe, Finn, BB-8 \u2014 but we\u2019re also looking at working with people who are interested in coming into the Star Wars world and taking us places we haven\u2019t been yet. That\u2019s exciting too because it\u2019s a vast galaxy far, far away.\u201d\n\nGoing back to the beginning\n\nAfter original Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow exited the project in September 2017 due to creative differences with the studio, it didn\u2019t take long for Disney and Lucasfilm to find a new filmmaker to helm the movie \u2014 and he was a familiar face to fans of the franchise.\n\nAbrams was named the new director of the film just a week after the post was vacated, with the film\u2019s co-writer, Academy Award winner Chris Terrio (Argo, Justice League), also announced at that time.\n\n\u201cWith The Force Awakens, J.J. delivered everything we could have possibly hoped for, and I am so excited that he is coming back to close out this trilogy,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement on StarWars.com.\n\nGiven the success of Abrams\u2019 franchise-relaunching sequel The Force Awakens, the decision to bring him back for Episode IX seems like a safe bet for the studio.\n\nRelease date, updated\n\nNot too long after Abrams was announced as the director of Episode IX, the film also received a new release date.\n\nStar Wars: Episode IX officially hit theaters on December 20, 2019, several months later than its original release date of May 24, 2019.\n\nThe new release date has the film arriving in theaters on the same weekend as a live-action feature based on the popular Broadway musical Cats. It also allows the film to carry on the tradition set by the two serialized installments of the Star Wars franchise that immediately precede it, Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens and Star Wars: Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi, which were both assigned December premieres.\n\nEditors' Recommendations", "images": ["https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/the-rise-of-skywalker-final-trailer-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/the-rise-of-skywalker-final-trailer-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rick Marshall", "December"], "canonical_link": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/star-wars-episode-ix-release-date-trailer-cast-news/", "title": "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Everything We Know So Far", "meta_data": {"description": "Star Wars: Episode IX -- The Rise of Skywalker will finally hit theaters on December 20, and here's everything we know about the sci-fi sequel so far, including official details on the story and the film's trailers, which confirm the unexpected return of a key character.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Everything We Know So Far", "description": "Star Wars: Episode IX -- The Rise of Skywalker will finally hit theaters on December 20, and here's everything we know about the sci-fi sequel so far, including official details on the story and the film's trailers, which confirm the unexpected return of a key character.", "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/star-wars-episode-ix-release-date-trailer-cast-news/", "site_name": "Digital Trends", "image": {"identifier": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/the-rise-of-skywalker-final-trailer-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "secure_url": "https://icdn3.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/the-rise-of-skywalker-final-trailer-2-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/digitaltrends", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rickmarshall25", "tag": "Tier 4", "section": "Movies & TV", "published_time": "2019-12-21T01:17:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-21T01:18:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Star Wars: Episode IX -- The Rise of Skywalker will finally hit theaters on December 20, and here's everything we know about the sci-fi sequel so far, including official details on the story and the film's trailers, which confirm the unexpected return of a key character.", "title": "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: Everything We Know So Far", "site": "@digitaltrends", "image": "https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/the-rise-of-skywalker-final-trailer-2-510x0.jpg", "creator": "@rickmarshall"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=500266645, affiliate-data=11lnN7", "fb": {"app_id": 61377565444}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "theme-color": "#0095da", "viewport": "minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1, width=device-width, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1576891069.0, "source": "https://www.digitaltrends.com", "summary": ""}
