When he was 17, the red-headed prince was taken to a rehab centre after he admitted he had smoked marijuana and illegally drank alcoholic beverages. When he was 27, TMZ released naked pictures of the royal, who was reportedly playing strip billiards in a Las Vegas hotel suite. For over two decades, Harry has been rewriting the royal rule book \u2014 and in the process, became known to the world as the fun and charming prince. (No offence, Will.)\n\nAnd now, Harry has found the perfect partner-in-crime. With American-actress Meghan Markle on his arm, the British Monarchy is receiving the modern treatment it so desperately needs. From pantyhose to PDA, we have an ongoing list tracking every time that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stray from royal protocol:\n\nMeghan paints her nails burgundy\n\nOn our roundup of weird royal facts, it\u2019s listed that Queen Elizabeth has been wearing the same $8 nail polish for nearly 30 years. It\u2019s a nearly-sheer, light pink polish \u2014 Essie\u2019s \u201cBallet Slippers\u201d to be exact \u2014 and according to the brand\u2019s website, in 1989 Queen Elizabeth\u2019s hairdresser sent the company a letter requesting a bottle of \u201cthe only colour Her Majesty would wear.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the only colour she\u2019ll wear\u2014it\u2019s the only colour she\u2019ll tolerate in Buckingham Palace. According to OK! magazine, there is a rule in place stating that coloured nail polish does not meet royal standards and is considered \u201cvulgar.\u201d\n\nPhotography via Twitter/@kensingtonroyal\n\nWhen Meghan Markle made a surprise appearance at the British Fashion Awards to present her wedding dress designer, Clare Waight Keller, the British Womenswear Designer of the Year award, all eyes were on her pregnancy glow. As she cupped the growing royal baby in her black Givenchy gown, royal rule followers were quick to question: is that\u2026 dark nail polish on the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s fingers? Maybe the burgundy hue is an act of royal rebellion, maybe it\u2019s some mystical lighting mishap, or maybe, she just thought it was a seasonally appropriate winter nail colour. Either way, we plan on copping the look this Christmas.\n\nMeghan closes her own door\n\nWhen Meghan Markle arrived at London\u2019s Royal Academy for her first solo engagement as Duchess of Sussex, she made a small gesture of independence that shook the Internet. Without her prince on her arm, Markle rolled up in a fancy black car in a fancy black Givenchy dress. And then, she did a thing that (apparently) few royals have done before: she shut the car door.\n\nVideo: #duchessofsussex arrives at the RA. A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door. Well done Meghan! pic.twitter.com/kJZXctr8AH \u2014 Emily Andrews (@byEmilyAndrews) September 25, 2018\n\nDoesn\u2019t really seem worthy of a headline, does it. But according to Twitter\u2014where this earth-shattering news was the top trending story\u2014it\u2019s almost totally unheard of for an on-duty royal to nudge a car door closed. Is this further evidence that she is a down-the-earth princess? Because if is, Kate Middleton deserves some props too.\n\nMeghan has an opinion about abortion\n\nGreat to chat with Meghan Markle, Duchess Of Sussex, about Repeal and the importance of her feminist activism. So important to have people in her position championing women\u2019s rights. Total sounder! pic.twitter.com/Vjdquo45CP \u2014 Una Mullally (@UnaMullally) July 10, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s totally okay for royals to have political opinions\u2014as long as they don\u2019t publicly share them. As part of their offical royal tour of England, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry attended a fancy garden party in Dublin. At the event, Markle struck up conversation with a few pro-choice activists and politicians who supported Ireland\u2019s recent abortion referendum.\n\nOne feminist journalist tweeted about her positive interaction with the feminist Duchess, while senator Catherine Noone tweeted: \u201cThe Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result \u2014 she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.\u201d The Irish politician realized the epic mistake she\u2019d made, and quickly deleted the tweet, sending out instead: \u201cI should say she seemed pleased \u2014 she was interested and very measured, not political at all.\u201d She later deleted the second tweet too.\n\nMarkle is a vocal feminist, so we probably could\u2019ve predicted her stance on women\u2019s reproductive rights. (And secretly, we hope this is a rule she keeps on breaking.)\n\nMeghan wears a sleeveless dress to her first Trooping the Colour\n\nPhotography via Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nMeghan Markle made her Buckingham balcony debut on June 9 in celebration of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s birthday. The of-the-shoulder silhouette of her pale pink, princess-worthy outfit from designer Carolina Herrera was, in fact, not so princess worthy after all. Tabloids were quick to call out the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s dress as a break from unspoken royal protocol, with Page Six claiming: \u201cfashion tradition usually dictates that Royal women do not wear off-shoulder or other more revealing styles.\u201d\n\nFor the past seven years, Kate Middleton has worn dresses with sleeves that reach past the elbow, People notes, as did Princess Diana when she attended the festivities. But let\u2019s not get our pantyhose\u2014which Meghan Markle is wearing now!\u2014 in a twist, fashion rules were made to be broken.\n\nMeghan\u2019s coat of arms does not include her family name\n\nWith the tiara and the title also comes other cool royal perks, like your very own emblem. Now that she\u2019s officially a member of the British monarchy, the Duchess of Sussex has received a personalized coat of arms. Traditionally, the symbolic gift goes to the father of the bride ahead of the royal wedding\u2014Kate Middleton\u2019s coat of arms not only reflects the Middleton family, but also her mother Carole\u2019s maiden name (Goldsmith). With the newest addition to the family, however, the palace has decided to bestow the honour on only Markle herself.\n\nA Coat of Arms has been created for The Duchess of Sussex: https://t.co/mJb3mqZfaZ pic.twitter.com/0EgbiS29Rb \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 25, 2018\n\nThe coat of arms, however, does pay homage to Markle\u2019s roots. The custom design includes a blue background (the Pacific Ocean) and two golden rays (sunshine), which Kensington Palace says is representative of the Duchess\u2019 home state of California.\n\nA two ring royal wedding ceremony\n\nUsually, royal men don\u2019t sport wedding bands after they marry. Harry\u2019s grandfather, father and brother have all opted to follow this tradition by not wearing a ring after they wed their respective wives. However, Markle and Harry have chosen to break this tradition, exchanging rings in the ceremony that they will continue to wear. This signifies equality in the marriage and is a modern step for the monarchy.\n\nMeghan wore a crossbody bag\n\nThe princess-to-be arrived at Edinburgh Castle on February 13, 2018 wearing an appropriately chic and seemingly inoffensive outfit: Burberry coat, Veronica Beard pants, Birks rings and a Strathberry bag. But it\u2019s not what Markle was wearing that broke protocol, per se, it was how she was wearing it.\n\nPhotography via Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images\n\nGASP! A crossbody! What a shockingly common and un-royal \u2014 AKA comfortable and practical \u2014 way to carry one\u2019s lipgloss and cellphone.\n\nAccording to royal expert William Hanson, royals always carry a clutch as a means to avoid shaking hands. \u201cIt is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the royal family (blood royal or those who have married into the family) unless their hand extends first,\u201d Hanson told the Daily Mail. \u201cThe Duchess of Cambridge may well prefer not to shake hands with certain people\u2014but there are other ways to achieve this, as used by the Queen and other members of the royal family, [rather] than opting for a clutch over a bag with a strap.\u201d\n\nChristmas with the Queen\n\nAfter weeks of rumours, Kensington Palace officially confirmed last December what we all were wishing for: an un-wed Meghan Markle would be spending Christmas with her prince. Markle\u2019s invitation was, of course, a break from royal tradition, with Markle being not yet being married into the monarchy. But it seems with Prince Harry, rules don\u2019t apply, because a palace spokesperson told AP that \u201cyou can expect to see the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and Ms. Markle at Sandringham on Christmas Day.\u201d\n\nMeghan ignored the pantyhose policy\n\nThe royal family has an unspoken policy about wearing pantyhose in public. It\u2019s not a style-code that\u2019s set in stone, per say, but it\u2019s a tradition that\u2019s long been upheld by Queen Elizabeth, Kate Middleton and the ruling ladies that came before them.\n\nPhotography by Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nUntil now! When Meghan Markle stepped out with Prince Harry for their official engagement photocall, the world ogled every inch of the American actress\u2019 outfit. The Internet went wild for Markle\u2019s snow white overcoat by LINE the Label and her opal earrings from Birks, but royal watchers were quick to note the one thing she wasn\u2019t wearing: pantyhose.\n\nThey\u2019re tied the knot in May\n\nThere\u2019s nothing better than a spring wedding, right? WRONG. It turns out, a marriage in May would not have been approved by the Prince\u2019s great-great-great granny, Queen Victoria. The late, great monarch believed it was unlucky to marry in the fifth month of the calendar year, buying into the superstitious rhyme: \u201cMarry in May, and rue the day.\u201d\n\nMeghan\u2019s been married before\n\nBefore hooking up with Harry, Meghan was in a long-term relationship with producer Trevor Engelson. They Hollywood powercouple married in 2011, after seven years of dating, and divorced in August of 2013. Now, Engelson is making a show about a man who has to share custody of his child after his ex-wife marries into the British monarchy. According to Deadline, this is the plot: \u201cDivorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London\u2019s tabloid media, is next level.\u201d GROSS.\n\nPhotography by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\n\nPreviously, members of the Royal Family have not been allowed to marry divorcees. As you may recall \u2014 from history books, or from season one of The Crown \u2014 Princess Margaret had to break off her relationship with Peter Townsend because he was divorced, and Edward VIII abdicated from the throne in order to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson. But it\u2019s not that big of a deal anymore: Prince Harry and Prince William\u2019s father, Prince Charles, married fellow divorcee Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, in a civil ceremony in 2005.\n\nThis means that Prince Harry will be the first royal family member to have a church wedding with a divorcee. In 2002, the Church of England agreed that divorced people could remarry in church \u2014 with the discretion of the priest, of course. After all, it\u2019s only 2017.\n\nMeghan isn\u2019t Anglican\n\nFor centuries, it was forbidden for royals to marry a Roman Catholic. However in 2015, an amendment to the Act of Settlement of 1701 made that allowed British royals to have an interfaith marriage. Markle has never *actually* discussed her religious affiliations openly, though it has been widely reported that her father is Jewish and she attended an all-girls Catholic high school in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore her Windsor Castle wedding to Prince Harry, Meghan will be baptized and confirmed in the Church of England. By completing these religious sacraments, Markle honours Queen Elizabeth, who, as the sovereign, holds the title of \u201cDefender of the Faith and Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re all about the PDA\n\nOkay, so calling a hand-holding PDA is a little extreme. But hey, *technically* it is a public display of affection!\n\nPhotography by Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThere are no specific anti-PDA rules, but public displays of affection have previously been avoided by the royal family at official events, due to their position as working representatives of the British monarchy. For example: Prince William and Kate Middleton have been photographed holding hands less than a dozen times in the past 10 years (!!!).\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle have ignored this unspoken rule at pretty much every opportunity. When they made their first public appearance, the couple shared a smooch. During their joint appearance at Toronto\u2019s Invictus Games, they were photographed holding hands. Even when they stepped out together as an engaged couple, Markle and Harry couldn\u2019t keep their hands off of each other. Not that we\u2019re complaining or anything\u2026more PDA-filled moments please!\n\nMeghan\u2019s Vanity Fair cover\n\nIt\u2019s not unprecedented for a royal to grace a magazine cover (after all, Kate Middleton was in British Vogue), but to open up about her private life with Harry pre-engagement was a big shock for royal watchers. Here\u2019s the major takeaway: Prince Harry and Markle are madly in love and they\u2019re not afraid to share it with the world.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u2019s perception. Nothing about me changed. I\u2019m still the same person that I am, and I\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1-480x320-c-top.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-970628184-480x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/img/dst/logos/logo_st-joseph-cropped.png", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/unnamed.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1-800x534.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIPhQWwAEvSWr-480x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001_B_coverLowRes_Thai_FASUM18-260x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-880237670-480x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/img/dst/misc/snapchat-qr-code.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/harry-480x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CVR_AUG_FA0818_hi-260x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-853710046-480x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/meghan-480x0-c-default.jpg", "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/img/dst/fashion-logo.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1124567250995889&ev=PageView\r\n&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1-800x534.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Date December"], "canonical_link": "https://fashionmagazine.com/culture/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-rules/", "title": "A Comprehensive List of Royal Rules Broken by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"description": "Just a couple of royal rebels.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1-900x600-c-default.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A Comprehensive List of Royal Rules Broken by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry", "description": "Just a couple of royal rebels.", "url": "https://fashionmagazine.com/culture/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-rules/", "site_name": "FASHION Magazine", "updated_time": "2020-02-12T18:53:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1-800x534.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1-800x534.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 534}}, "article": {"tag": "royal rules", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2018-12-11T15:52:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-12T18:53:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Just a couple of royal rebels.", "title": "A Comprehensive List of Royal Rules Broken by Meghan Markle and Prince Harry", "image": "https://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DuJIQArX4AAsa0b-1.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544543564.0, "source": "https://fashionmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
