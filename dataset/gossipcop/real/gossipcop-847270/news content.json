And I said, 'Yes, Amy, it's live !'\"\n\n\"I said, 'Don't worry. I've grown. I've evolved,\" Schumer responded. \"I'm wearing flowers. 'Who is this woman?'\"\n\nHawn joked, \"I didn't even recognize her!\"\n\n\"Stay classy,\" Guthrie warned Schumer. \"It's morning TV.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Guthrie references the actress' recent appearance on The Graham Norton Show, in which Hawn said Schumer \"could have been my daughter,\" but she \"would have been a troubled daughter.\"\n\nHawn also noted that if Schumer were her daughter, she'd have no advice to offer her.\n\n\"You don't give advice,\" Hawn said. \"What advice do you give somebody?\" Schumer replied, \"'Keep your feet in a bucket.' That's what my mom said. Because you can't open your legs...if they're in a bucket.' What? I know it's the morning, but...\" Guthrie quickly realized what Schumer had said, and admitted she didn't see the joke coming until it was too late.
