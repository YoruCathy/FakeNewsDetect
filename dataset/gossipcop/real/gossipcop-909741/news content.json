Mars took Record Of The Year with \"24K Magic\" and Song Of The Year with \"That's What I Like.\" King won Record Of The Year with \"It's Too Late\" and Song Of The Year with \"You've Got A Friend.\"\n\n3. \"That's What I Like\": 8 Songwriters Recognized\n\n\"That's What I Like,\" with eight credited songwriters, set a new record as the Song Of The Year winner with the most co-writers. The old record, shared by seven songs, was four co-writers.\n\n4. Alessia Cara: Canada's Best New Artist\n\nBrampton, Ontario, native Alessia Cara won Best New Artist. She's the first artist who was born in Canada to win in this category.\n\nWatch: Alessia Cara Wins Best New Artist\n\n5.
