But we need a pillar of hope, and that pillar of hope is Jodie Whittaker.\u201d\n\nThe actress won over the producers from the instant she walked into the audition room. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things [where] you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for until you see it,\u201d Chibnall described, hailing Whittaker\u2019s performance as \u201cfresh, funny and very emotional.\u201d\n\nAs for how Whittaker\u2019s Broadchurch co-star and former Doctor David Tennant reacted to her casting, the actress said the message conveyed to her was, \u201cThis is the most amazing thing that can happen to you, and there are only a few people who know how it feels.\u201d\n\nWhile Season 11 won\u2019t debut until this fall, fans were already introduced to the 13th Doctor in last year\u2019s Christmas special. Shooting the brief scene was \u201cincredibly nerve-wrecking, because the reveal had [already] happened [in the media],\u201d Whittaker described. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re taking on\u2026 I was nervous to touch anything. I felt as if I was in someone else\u2019s shoes, which is a wonderful way to start this journey. It was amazing.\u201d\n\nThe cast and creative team were tight-lipped on specifics about the new Time Lord, but executive producer Matt Strevens did share that \u201cthis Doctor is in love with life\u201d and \u201ctreats everything with respect and wonder.\u201d\n\nWhittaker will be joined by three new companions, who are all very different, said Mandip Gill (Hollyoaks), who plays one of the pals. Her character, Yasmin, is a 19-year-old who is \u201cwhisked away on this amazing adventure with these people, who become her family, and she\u2019s in awe of the Doctor\u2026 The dynamic between the three friends is beautiful.\u201d\n\nWhen it came time to cast the companions, \u201cwe were looking for people who have incredible range, because the tone of the show demands everything,\u201d Chibnall described. \u201cAnd just truth \u2014 bringing emotional truth. It\u2019s really important for us this season, especially. There are big emotional journeys for everyone to go on. All of them aced it, and the chemistry was really apparent.\u201d\n\nIn addition to its new ensemble, Season 11 will also feature a fresh take on the sonic screwdriver. Chibnall would only hint that \u201cthere is a story [about] how the Doctor comes by\u201d this incarnation of the device.", "images":
