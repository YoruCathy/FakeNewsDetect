Bayona told us \u201chints at a short section of the movie,\u201d is a precursor to a final act which merges gothic horror with scares evoking Steven Spielberg's original which turns 25 later this month.\n\nDownload the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\nIt seems that while some critics have lapped up the film's thrills, others remain unconvinced by the latest big-budget attempt from Universal Pictures despite hailing it as a better film than Jurassic World. You can read a selection below for yourself.\n\nThe Independent - Geoffrey Macnab - 4 stars\n\n\"This is a summer popcorn movie with all the trimmings - action, cheesy in-jokes, startling visual effects and a storyline with a moralising, eco-friendly subtext.\"\n\nThe Guardian - Peter Bradshaw - 2 stars\n\n\"There are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to.\"\n\nThe Telegraph - Robbie Collin - 2 stars\n\n\"Hollywood finds a way to make dinosaurs boring.\"\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Film premises that shouldn\u2019t have worked but did Show all 14 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Film premises that shouldn\u2019t have worked but did 1/14 1. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Kicking us off is Phil Lord and Christopher Mille\u2019s bizarre animated film about a scientist who creates a machine that transforms water into food. So far, not too crazy, but then the machine gets stuck in the sky and it starts raining food. Everything goes wrong and Flint Lockwood must save the day by flying up to the machine and kicking fried chicken butt. Yeah, a pretty crazy premise, but a fantastic film. 2/14 2. Frank Michael Fassbender may be one of the most bankable stars of the moment - having starred in the likes of Steve Jobs, X-Men and Macbeth - but in 2014, instead of flaunting his face, producers decided to make him wear a weird papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 mask for the film\u2019s near entirety. The plot see\u2019s Fassbender\u2019s titular character front a rock band, play SXSW and make \u2018likeable\u2019 music. It\u2019s all just a bit strange. 3/14 3. Groundhog Day Almost anything with Bill Murray in it is a win in my book, but when you say the premise of Ground Hog day out loud - a weatherman who must relive the same day over and over again - it sounds quite boring. What transpired was one of Murray\u2019s funniest films. 4/14 4. Star Wars With Star Wars being so prevalent in pop-culture, it\u2019s hard to imagine a time when no-one except George Lucas knew what a Lightsaber was. Producers must have been shocked when this young director came into the office trying to sell a script about Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Darth Vader, Chewbacca and Stormtroopers. Thankfully, they believed in his vision and now we have one of the best sci-fi sagas of all time. 5/14 5. Incepetion A dream, within a dream, within a dream. Even those who watched Inception were left confused, let alone those who only heard what the film was about. Christopher Nolan\u2019s final flick, however, was a masterclass in storytelling and one of the best films of the last ten years. 6/14 6. Speed The high-concept Speed is quite ridiculous really. Keanu Reeves can\u2019t let a bus go below 50 miles per hour or it will blow up. It\u2019s quite amazing how Jan de Bont managed to make his debut 116 minutes long in the first place, let alone making it a decent film in the process. 7/14 7. Edward Scissorhands Tim Burton is a director who could fill this entire list up. While he may have chosen to reboot numerous films in the past few years (Alice in Wonderland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the upcoming Dumbo 2) it was his original concepts that set him apart from everyone else. In Burton\u2019s head, the love story of a man with scissors for hands and a young woman made complete sense, while for everyone else - from just the premise - it seemed entirely weird. Luckily, he was given the opportunity to make the film and a cult classic was born, all while Johnny Depp\u2019s ability to play the outsider was solidified. 8/14 8. Mrs Doubtfire Post-Hook and Aladdin, Robin Williams was on a role. One of his standout performances was as Mrs. Doubtfire, the father-turned-drag-housekeeper. As a premise, dressing your lead male as a woman wasn\u2019t exactly new (see Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie), so the filmmakers ran the risk of it all seeming like an overdone joke. Luckily, Chris Columbus managed to pull off the ridiculous plot (how wouldn\u2019t the kids know it\u2019s their father, really?) leading to one of the funniest films of the 90s. 9/14 9. The Lobster Like Burton, most of Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s films could probably feature on this page, but we\u2019ve gone with The Lobster. The film tells of a hotel where residents must find a suitable partner within 45 days otherwise they will be turned into an animal. Try to run away and the other residents will hunt you down with tranquillisers. The result was one of the best love stories of 2015. 10/14 10. Ant-Man Some comic book superheroes should not be adapted to the big screen (*cough* Howard the Duck *cough*). Ant-Man is not one of them. Against all the odds, Paul Rudd and Peyton Reed managed to make a compelling film about a man who could shrink down in size and control ants. What\u2019s incredible is that - somehow - the film quickly became one of Marvel\u2019s most beloved films. Of course, everyone knew Marvel could pull off weird, having knocked it out of the park with Guardians of the Galaxy the year before. 11/14 11. Beetlejuice Two ghosts living in their old home want to scare away the alive people who now live there. Unfortunately, the new home-owners can\u2019t see them and so the ghosts have to call upon a deranged Michael Keaton to help them out. Add one of the strangest afterlife scenes in film history and you\u2019ve got a brilliant film. 12/14 12. Forrest Gump While not an obvious contender like Star Wars or Beetlejuice, when you think about it, Forrest Gump is a weird idea. A below-average intelligent man, sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus, telling strangers about all the famous moments in history where he observed/effected. Thanks to Tom Hanks, Gump was a magical film of love and hope, winning over the hearts of thousands and becoming an instant classic. 13/14 13. The Lego Movie Another film from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, The Lego Movie shouldn\u2019t have worked. Making a beloved toy into a film; it was all just a bit silly. Thankfully, Chris Pratt\u2019s turn as Emmett (and a catchy song in \u201cEverything is Awesome\u201d) the film was a huge hit with critics and fans alike, and now we have a cinematic universe of Lego movies to come. Awesome? 14/14 14. I\u2019m Not There \u201cLet\u2019s get Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, and Ben Whishaw to all play Bob Dylan in a single film\u201d, Todd Haynes said. While you would think that would be overkill, the result was stunning, with Dylan himself eventually praising the film in 2012. 1/14 1. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Kicking us off is Phil Lord and Christopher Mille\u2019s bizarre animated film about a scientist who creates a machine that transforms water into food.

While you would think that would be overkill, the result was stunning, with Dylan himself eventually praising the film in 2012.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter - John Defore\n\n\"While the movie courses seamlessly through different modes, it remains old-fashioned in its treatment of Howard's character, who mostly screams and runs while Owen gets things done. Claire has grown up a lot since her debut as Jurassic World's soulless corporate climber, but she remains a damsel in distress who (this time, as last) gets to perform a single far-fetched heroic feat when things are at their most dire.\"\n\nEmpire - Ben Travis - 4 stars\n\n\"The island is where Bayona\u2019s disaster movie credentials come into play. He invokes the relentless intensity of The Impossible's harrowing tsunami in a thunderous stampede sequence as the volcanic eruption escalates, boldly providing the film\u2019s biggest set-piece at the midway point. Such mass destruction is a new flavour for the Jurassic series, and Bayona wisely punctuates the bombast with human-scale peril.\"\n\nIGN - Gav Murphy\n\n\"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom opens with one of the most exciting set pieces of the year and from there it barely stops for breath as we\u2019re bounced from a huge, high-stakes disaster film to a claustrophobic gothic horror.\"\n\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is in cinemas now", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-2-review-chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-a8385536.html", "title": "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom review round-up: The verdict is in for JA Bayona's dinosaur sequel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-2-review-chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-a8385536.html", "title": "The first Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom reviews are in", "description": "It's a mixed bag of reactions for the follow-up to the 2015 blockbuster", "updated_time": "2018-06-20T15:50:48+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5772638091001_5772619021001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5772619021001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8385536"}, "description": "The first reviews for the brand new Jurassic World sequel have been released.", "keywords": "jurassic world, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, News, Film, Culture", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "jurassic world", "published_time": "2018-06-06T09:10:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-20T15:50:48+01:00", "section": "News", "subsection": "Video", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 424, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 4, "external_link_count": 5}, "twitter": {"title": "The first Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom reviews are in", "description": "The first reviews for the brand new Jurassic World sequel have been released.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528272600.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
