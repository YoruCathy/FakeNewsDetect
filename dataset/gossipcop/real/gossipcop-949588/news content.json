If Litchfield Penitentiary had its fair share of interpersonal complications \u2014 and that\u2019s putting it lightly \u2014 then one can only imagine what drama Litchfield Max will bring.\n\nAccording to the official press release, the sixth season of Jenji Kohan\u2019s \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d will pick up one week after emergency response teams finally overpowered Litchfield\u2019s inmate riot. The fifth season\u2019s finale left us wondering where, exactly, each character would end up.\n\nAt the start of the new season, we get our answer \u2014 for some characters, that is. While Suzanne, Piper (Taylor Schilling), Taystee (Danielle Brooks), and Red (Kate Mulgrew) adjust to maximum security, the fate of others remains unclear. \u201cWhere\u2019s Alex?\u201d Piper asks. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird we\u2019re the only people in here?\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning, \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d has effectively balanced its focus between the ensemble and the individual, highlighting each prisoner\u2019s past and how it weaves into a larger, dysfunctional prison family.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that this trailer makes clear, it\u2019s that this family will be tested harder than it ever has before, both by other inmates and the judicial system. As they\u2019re left to consider the trade between allegiance and plea bargains, the girls will be left asking both each other and themselves \u201cwhose team [they\u2019re] really on.\u201d\n\nSeason 6 of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d hits Netflix July 27.", "images": ["https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-16-at-2.01.10-PM-1024x515.png", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-1.13.43-PM-1024x459.png", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ANNA-Portrait-1018-2.jpeg", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-half-of-it.png", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/editortowatch.png", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/women-and-hollywood-ad.jpg", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MV5BMjAxMDc4NDY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzODc4NTM@._V1_SX1500_CR001500999_AL_-e1531155963286.jpg", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/50502020-logo-1.png", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tammy-use.jpg", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bangla-surf-girls.jpg", "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MV5BMjAxMDc4NDY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzODc4NTM@._V1_SX1500_CR001500999_AL_-e1531155963286-1024x636.jpg"], "top_img": "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MV5BMjAxMDc4NDY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzODc4NTM@._V1_SX1500_CR001500999_AL_-e1531155963286.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelsey Moore"], "canonical_link": "https://womenandhollywood.com/trailer-watch-friendships-are-at-stake-in-season-6-of-orange-is-the-new-black/", "title": "Trailer Watch: Friendships Are At Stake in Season 6 of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "generator": "WordPress 5.3", "og": {"url": "https://womenandhollywood.com/trailer-watch-friendships-are-at-stake-in-season-6-of-orange-is-the-new-black/", "type": "website", "title": "Trailer Watch: Friendships Are At Stake in Season 6 of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d", "image": "https://womenandhollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MV5BMjAxMDc4NDY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzODc4NTM@._V1_SX1500_CR001500999_AL_-e1531155963286.jpg", "description": "\u201cNavigating adult female friendships is so complicated!\u201d Suzanne (Uzo Aduba) laments as she tries to understand the inner workings of her new surroundings.
