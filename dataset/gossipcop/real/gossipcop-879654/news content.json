I could see then how pure of heart he was and how generous and caring his soul was.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything about the evening felt so \u2018right\u2019. There was an ease and an authentic familiarity,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe talked about everything under the stars \u2026 even marriage. There was a strong sense of destiny that night, and I think I knew then, deep in my heart, that he and I were going to be together forever.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Robb Derringer and Carrie Ann Inaba Carrie Ann Inaba\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Carrie Ann Inaba Gushes About Fianc\u00e9 Jesse Sloan\n\nDerringer isn\u2019t Inaba\u2019s first ex-fianc\u00e9.\n\nIn September 2012, a rep for Inaba told PEOPLE that she and Jesse Sloan \u201cdecided early in the summer to break off their engagement and have remained friends.\u201d\n\nSloan, a 45-year-old accountant, had proposed to Inaba on Live!
