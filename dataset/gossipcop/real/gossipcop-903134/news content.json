She has been filling in for Lauer since he was fired over sexual misconduct allegations in November. During Lauer\u2019s tenure in the same role, he reportedly earned around $20 million a year, according to the New York Daily News, with his net worth estimated at $60 million.\n\nAn official from NBC did not respond to a request for comment about the salaries of Today show anchors. On Wednesday, some news outlets, including the Hollywood Reporter, reported Kotb\u2019s salary could be up to $7 million a year \u2014 which is reportedly the same as Guthrie\u2019s salary.\n\nWith Lauer\u2019s ouster, Megan Kelly became NBC\u2019s highest-paid anchor. She earns between $15 million and $20 million for her program, according to several media outlets. The former Fox News anchor now hosts Megyn Kelly Today in the mornings.\n\nKotb\u2019s net worth is currently around $12 million, according to an Oct. 2016 report from GoBankingRates.com. Her Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie has a net worth of $2 million, according to that same report, but signed a new contract with NBC after that number was estimated. It\u2019s possible her new contract includes a higher salary.\n\nKotb first joined NBC News in 1998 as a correspondent for \u201cDateline,\u201d and began co-hosting the Today show\u2019s fourth hour a decade later. During her tenure at NBC, Kotb regularly filled in on the Today show, and she served as co-anchor during the interim period after Lauer\u2019s termination.\n\nOutside of her roles at NBC, Kotb is a New York Times bestselling author, with three books published on a range of topics including inspirational life stories as well as a detailed account of her battle with breast cancer back in 2007. She also penned a children\u2019s book called I\u2019ve Loved You Since Forever, which is coming out in March. Kotb said it\u2019s inspired by her 11-month-old daughter Haley Joy, who she adopted in early 2017.\n\nKotb, who is dating financier Joel Schiffman, recently shared a sweet Instagram picture of them getting into the \u201cChristmas spirit\u201d with Haley Joy.\n\nKotb began her career in broadcasting as a news assistant with CBS in Egypt, and, several years later, served as an anchor and reporter for WWL-TV in New Orleans. Now a household name, Kotb has appeared as herself in a number of television shows, including 30 Rock, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Girlfriends\u2019 Guide to Divorce.\n\nAs for Kotb\u2019s new role at NBC, it appears her fellow Today show colleagues are excited for her to join them.\n\n\u201cWe are kicking off the year right, because Hoda is officially the co-anchor of Today,\u201d Guthrie said during Tuesday morning\u2019s broadcast. \u201cThis has to be the most popular decision NBC News has ever made, and I am so thrilled.\u201d\n\nAl Roker also shared a \u201chearty\u201d congratulations with Kotb Tuesday with a photo of the two of them and Guthrie in the anchor seat at 30 Rock.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pinching myself,\u201d Kotb said.", "images": ["https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/hoda-kotb-today-show.jpg?quality=85", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "http://time.com/img/navigation/subscribe-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/hoda-kotb-today-show.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas"], "canonical_link": "https://money.com/hoda-kotb-salary-net-worth/", "title": "Hoda Kotb Is Due for a Big Raise Now That She's Replacing Matt Lauer on the Today Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Media,onetime", "news_keywords": "hoda kotb, hoda kotb net worth, hoda kotb salary, hoda kotb daughter, how much does hoda kotb make a year, hoda kotb age, hoda hotb today show, matt lauer net worth, matt lauer salary, savannah guthrie hoda kotb", "description": "Longtime NBC anchor Hoda Kotb was promoted to co-anchor the Today show after Matt Lauer's ouster.
