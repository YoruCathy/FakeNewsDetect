People mean so well, but they have no idea the harm or frustration it can cause.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Dey Street Books\n\n\u201cOnce a month I look like I\u2019m in my second trimester because I\u2019m bloated,\u201d she says. \u201cIt leads to the questions and it leads to the rumors and anytime I go into a doctor\u2019s office I feel like I\u2019m a member of SEAL Team Six undercover because I don\u2019t want people to speculate.\u201d\n\nBy sharing her story in We\u2019re Going to Need More Wine, which is out Oct. 17, Union hopes that the way people approach her about the topic changes.\n\nFor more on Gabrielle Union\u2019s infertility struggles, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands now.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fgabrielle-union-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fgabrielle-union-1-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fgabrielle-union-1-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fgabrielle-union-4-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F11%2Fgabrielle-union-3-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fgabrielle-union-1-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne Tracy"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/gabrielle-union-infertility-struggles-exclusive-memoir/", "title": "Gabrielle Union's Struggle with Infertility", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Babies,Books,Exclusive,Gabrielle Union,Maternity,News,Rollout,TV", "news_keywords": "Babies,Books,Exclusive,Gabrielle Union,Maternity,News,Rollout,TV", "description": "Gabrielle Union's book We're Going to Need More Wine (out Oct. 17) is excerpted exclusively in the current issue of PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "Gabrielle Union's Struggle with Infertility", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/gabrielle-union-infertility-struggles-exclusive-memoir/", "description": "Gabrielle Union&nbsp;has revealed she\u2019s suffered multiple miscarriages in an attempt to have a much-longed-for baby with NBA star husband Dwyane Wade.
