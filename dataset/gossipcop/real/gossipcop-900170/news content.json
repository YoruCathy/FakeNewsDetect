Mutual friends and birthdays were to thank the night NFL player Larry English met model Nicole Williams back in 2011. Though production cameras weren\u2019t around back then, the couple\u2019s relationship subsequently unfolded in the public eye on E!\u2019s WAGS, including their May 2016 engagement in Thailand. A year later, they married before 220 loved ones in Laguna Beach, California.\n\n\u201cI was so happy and relieved,\u201d Williams, a model, tells The Knot. \u201cI was so nervous walking down that aisle I couldn\u2019t feel my legs\u2026 After months of planning and work, I could finally just enjoy the rest of the night.\u201d\n\nThe bride and groom, a retired NFL linebacker, thankfully tasked wedding planner Alissa Hussey with the finer details. \u201cI actually couldn\u2019t have done it without her. Planning a wedding is so much harder then I would have ever thought,\u201d Williams notes. \u201cSo much work goes into it. So many vendors and so many decisions have to be made. Having someone who knows how everything is supposed to flow really helped ease my stress.\u201d\n\nThe pre-wedding anxiety actually bubbled over to when she slept. \u201cI kept dreaming that I would arrive to the wedding and the whole venue was all pink and purple flowers. I\u2019d wake up sweating,\u201d she jokes. \u201cFlowers are the most important part of your wedding, so I literally would go to bed thinking about flowers and have nightmares that nothing would be beautiful\u2026 I had nothing to worry about and I was in great hands.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that the day went by without any snafus. \u201cOne of my bridesmaids broke the zipper on her dress,\u201d Williams laughs. \u201cShe had to be stitched in.\u201d\n\nIn retrospect, the bride would tell herself to actually embrace each and every minute of the day. \u201cI would tell her to enjoy every moment because it goes by so fast,\u201d she says. \u201cI was told the same thing, even so, I still got a bit overwhelmed with saying hi to everyone, changing dresses, and being pulled in every direction for different things. Oh and take a moment for yourself to take everything in.\u201d\n\nThe Venue\n\nThe couple exchanged vows at the Montage in Laguna Beach. \u201cOur ceremony was set at the most perfect of locations, overlooking the Pacific Ocean,\u201d Williams says. \u201cLarry and I were framed together by a beautiful white and green floral arch that had roses and cascading orchids. Our aisle was aligned with black planter boxes filled with white flowers and even more tall floral arrangements at the entrance of the aisle.\u201d\n\nThe Dress\n\nThe bride wore a custom design by Michael Costello. The piece, comprised of lace and hand-beaded detail, included a high neck design and open back. \u201cIt was my dream dress,\u201d says the bride.\n\nThe Ceremony\n\nThe couple\u2019s two nieces\u2014one on each side\u2014and goddaughter all served as flower girls in the wedding. The bride was escorted down the aisle by both her mom and dad to the tune of Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cThe Power of Love.\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s always been a special song to me,\u201d she says.)\n\n\u201cWe actually just kept our ceremony very short and simple. I didn\u2019t want to stand up there too long because I get so nervous in front of crowds!\u201d Williams says. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how weak my knees get.\u201d\n\nThe Planner\n\nLos Angeles-based event planner Alissa Hussey of Alissa Hussey Productions was a huge help to the couple. \u201cHaving a big wedding like we did was definitely hard to pull off alone, so Alissa really made it happen for us,\u201d Williams says.\n\nThe Decor\n\nThe pair opted for a white-and-black color reception. \u201cWe draped the ballroom in all white to create a crisp palette,\u201d she says. \u201cWe chose black, sparkly table linens and a huge white dance floor with our initials in black.\u201d To offset the neutral colors, Hussey added elements of sparkle with giant chandeliers over the dance floor. Adding to the luxe factor, the couple served meals on marble-canted chargers accented with rose-gold silverware.\n\n\u201cThe flowers were to die for,\u201d Williams continues. \u201cAvant Garden did huge tall round centerpieces of white orchards and roses held in massive black glass vases. White flowers were everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe Cake\n\nBelladonna Sweets customized a seven-tier cake in white and rose-gold marble for the pair. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat at all because I was so busy having fun,\u201d says Williams. However, guests gave her the approval that it was truly delicious.\n\nThe First Dance\n\n\u201cLarry and I are huge fans of New Edition,\u201d she says. \u201cWe chose to dance to \u2018Can You Stand the Rain.\u2019 It\u2019s one of our favorite songs.\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s truly my best friend,\u201d Williams says of her husband. \u201cHe loves everything about me\u2014things that I even question. He\u2019s the best dad to our two dogs and he\u2019s just the most caring, loyal, selfless and considerate person I know.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/authors/elee-9.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-14.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-07.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89960078_664744544273850_2656838980867194880_o-120x67.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-23.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-05.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-26.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-19.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-the-knot-news-logo@2x.png", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-25.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-28.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-02.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1554396644-120x67.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-24.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-16.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-27.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-15.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-06.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2127-120x67.jpg", "https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cec381d2-93e9-4201-9271-30f51f4fec94~rs_200.h", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-11.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-03.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-17.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brittany-Tyler-Couch-Story-Lead-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Questions-About-How-Coronavirus-Could-Affect-Your-Wedding_-Read-This-LEAD-shutterstock-120x67.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-08.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-21.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-12.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nicole-williams-larry-english-17.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Is The Senior News Editor At The Knot.
