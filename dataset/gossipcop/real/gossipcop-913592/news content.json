{"url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a17876630/kate-upton-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-shoot-knocked-over-wave-video/", "text": "Kate Upton's 2018 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit shoot got off to a really rocky start to say the least.\n\nThe model, who stands at 5-feet-10-inches, was in the middle of a shoot on a beautiful beach in Aruba when a giant wave knocked her down to the sandy ground. Immediately, everyone on set gasped with sheer panic, but the good news is that she was not hurt ... and that the whole thing was caught on video.\n\nSports Illustrated shared a clip of the scary (but kinda funny because she's fine?) incident on Instagram with the caption, \"Whoops! Things got a little rocky on @kateupton's #SISwim 2018 shoot in Aruba! \ud83d\udc40.\"\n\nIn the video, a topless Upton holds on to her breasts as she poses in a long, tulle skirt, while standing on top of giant rocks. A man then joins her on the rocks for touchups, but fails to break the model's fall when the water sweeps her off her feet.\n\nUpton \u2014 being the pro that she is \u2014 breaks out in laughter, while others on set lost their shit. \"Oh my God! Get her out of here,\" Sports Illustrated director MJ Day can be heard saying in the video.\n\nDespite the accident, it's likely that Upton will do another sexy SI spread in the future. She was named their Rookie of the Year following her first appearance in 2011, and was the annual issue's cover model for 2012, 2013 and 2017. However, she may pick a different setting for next year. Maybe.
