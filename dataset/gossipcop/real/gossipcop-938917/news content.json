Hewitt and the network and producers were in a standoff over storylines for the third season.\n\nTVLine reported that Hewitt, who is pregnant with her fiance/co-star Brian Hallisay's baby, wanted to have Hallisay be the father. The producers and Hewitt didn't agree on how to handle the pregnancy.\n\n\"The Client List\" was originally a Lifetime original movie that eventually became an ongoing series. Hewitt starred in both. In the TV series, Hewitt played Riley, a massage therapist who begins work at a day spa after he husband leaves her family. But it's no ordinary spa, the massage therapists give much more than massages.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb578672400005100566263.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad348f2500003200376e07.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-client-list-canceled_n_4194154", "title": "'The Client List' Canceled After 2 Seasons", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Well, it's not exactly a happy ending for \"The Client List\": Lifetime has canceled the Jennifer Love Hewitt drama after two seasons, The Huffington Post ...", "keywords": "tv,tv canada", "og": {"title": "'The Client List' Canceled", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-client-list-canceled_n_4194154", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Well, it's not exactly a happy ending for \"The Client List\": Lifetime has canceled the Jennifer Love Hewitt drama after two seasons, The Huffington Post ..."}, "article": {"tag": "tv,tv canada", "section": "TV & Film", "published_time": "2013-11-01 15:36:09 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-11-01 15:42:30 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@", "title": "'The Client List' Canceled", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "Well, it's not exactly a happy ending for \"The Client List\": Lifetime has canceled the Jennifer Love Hewitt drama after two seasons, The Huffington Post ..."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_4194154", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "tv"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1383235200.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
