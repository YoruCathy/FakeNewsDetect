He also shared what he\u2019s learned since they tied the knot. Turns out, he\u2019s learned a lot.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\n\u201c20 Years Ago Today we held hands and walked naively down that aisle. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned since,\u201d he began. \u201cLove is Like Gardening... I have learned to focus on HELPING you to BLOSSOM into what YOU want to be (into what you were born to be)... Rather than Demanding that you become what my Fragile Ego needs you to be.\u201d\n\nImpressed? Hold on. He\u2019s just getting started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned to take pleasure in Nourishing YOUR dreams... Rather than wrestling with you to Fulfill my Selfish Needs & Satiate My Insecurities,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have learned that Love is Listening. Love is Giving. Love is Freedom.\u201d\n\nLove is ... this relationship. Alberto Rodriguez/NBC / Getty Images Contributor\n\nAnd what have we learned? That Will Smith has a way with words. And that he really loves his wife (and their son Jaden and daughter Willow).\n\n\u201cHappy Anniversary, My Queen! I am forever Devoted to Nurturing your Deepest Truth,\u201d the actor wrote.\n\nAs far as anniversary messages go, this one\u2019s pretty special. Our only question is, how are you going to top yourself next year, Will?\n\nCongrats to you and Jada on your milestone day!", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/1229909/jada-smith-today-tease-170720_7d68f5d7c0c9448c3961034a226214b7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/1229909/jada-smith-today-tease-170720_7d68f5d7c0c9448c3961034a226214b7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/will-smith-posts-anniversary-tribute-wife-jada-pinkett-smith-t120669", "title": "Will Smith's anniversary tribute to wife Jada is beautiful \u2014 and really deep", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/will-smith-posts-anniversary-tribute-wife-jada-pinkett-smith-t120669", "title": "Will Smith's anniversary tribute to wife Jada is beautiful \u2014 and really deep", "description": "The \"Bright\" star really does have a way with words.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/1229909/jada-smith-today-tease-170720_7d68f5d7c0c9448c3961034a226214b7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/1229909/jada-smith-today-tease-170720_7d68f5d7c0c9448c3961034a226214b7.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/1229909/jada-smith-today-tease-170720_7d68f5d7c0c9448c3961034a226214b7.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Will Smith's anniversary tribute to wife Jada is beautiful \u2014 and really deep", "description": "The \"Bright\" star really does have a way with words.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Will Smith took to Instagram to celebrate his wife of 20 years, Jada Pinkett Smith.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_29/1229909/jada-smith-today-tease-170720_7d68f5d7c0c9448c3961034a226214b7.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514770845.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
