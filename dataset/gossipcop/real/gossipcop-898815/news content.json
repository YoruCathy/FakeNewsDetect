The titles, presented in alphabetical order, are works AFI's juries have determined advance the art of the moving image, enhance the cultural heritage of America's art form, inspire audiences and artists and make a mark on American society.\n\nIn addition to the 20 honorees, AFI is giving a special award to PBS' Ken Burns documentary series The Vietnam War.\n\n\"At a time when the world seems defined by division, storytellers bring us together as one,\" AFI president and CEO Bob Gazzale said Thursday in a statement. \"AFI Awards is honored to celebrate this community of artists who challenge and inspire us, entertain and enlighten us \u2014 ultimately reminding us of our common heartbeat.\"\n\nThis year's juries were chaired by AFI board of trustees vice chairs Tom Pollock (for film) and Richard Frank (for TV). Other jury members included Judd Apatow, Halle Berry, Jamie Lee Curtis, Leonard Maltin, authors and scholars representing prestigious universities with recognized motion picture arts and TV programs and film and TV critics from media outlets like NPR, Rolling Stone, TV Guide and The Washington Post. Apatow, who is a producer of The Big Sick, recused himself from voting on that film.\n\nTwo years ago, the AFI delayed voting on its year-end list to give critics a chance to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which it subsequently included on its list of the 10 best films of 2015. However, this year, the latest Star Wars film, The Last Jedi, which hits theaters on Dec. 15, was nowhere to be found on AFI's list.\n\nThe honorees will be recognized at a Jan. 5 luncheon in Los Angeles.\n\nThe full list of this year's honorees follows.\n\nAFI Movies of the Year\n\nThe Big Sick\n\nCall Me by Your Name\n\nDunkirk\n\nThe Florida Project\n\nGet Out\n\nLady Bird\n\nThe Post\n\nThe Shape of Water\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nWonder Woman\n\nAFI TV Programs of the Year\n\nBig Little Lies\n\nThe Crown\n\nFeud: Bette and Joan\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nThe Good Place\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale\n\nInsecure\n\nMaster of None\n\nStranger Things 2\n\nThis is Us\n\nAFI Special Award\n\nThe Vietnam War", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Lewis", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afi-names-top-movies-tv-shows-2017-1065499", "title": "'Wonder Woman' Among AFI's Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afi-names-top-movies-tv-shows-2017-1065499", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Wonder Woman' Among AFI's Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Wonder Woman' Among AFI's Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/afi-names-top-movies-tv-shows-2017-1065499", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Wonder Woman' Among AFI's Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "sailthru.description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "sailthru.author": "Hilary Lewis", "sailthru.vertical": "Awards", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-07 13:30:00", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Television,Awards,Wonder Woman,THR Year in Review 2017"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512624600.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
