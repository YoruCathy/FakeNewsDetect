News to quote Shaggy's lyrics, \u2018It Wasn't Me\u2019.\n\nInstagram\n\nLast November, The Weeknd was seen exiting Bella\u2019s NYC apartment weeks after his split from girlfriend Selena Gomez after 10 months of dating leading many fans of the pair to believe they were on good terms following the break-down of their year-long relationship in 2015.\n\nThis kiss is giving us the tingles. Hurrah for a Bella and The Weeknd romance 2.0.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/crying-1525958751.gif?crop=1xw:0.8769968051118211xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/16/50/1600x800/landscape-1481563778-emma-watson-hair-transformation.jpg?resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a20655261/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-kissing-cannes-film-festival/", "title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Were Just Spotted Kissing At Cannes Film Festival", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Were Just Spotted Kissing At Cannes Film Festival", "description": "This is not a drill, people", "url": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a20655261/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-kissing-cannes-film-festival/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-05-11 09:59:24", "published_time": "2018-05-11 07:53:00", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Were Just Spotted Kissing At Cannes Film Festival", "description": "This is not a drill, people", "keywords": "Bella Hadid, The Weeknd, Kiss, Cannes Film Festival, relationship, Selena Gomez", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.234xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-11T07:53:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl1695647-001-1526025015.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.234xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Bella Hadid And The Weeknd Were Just Spotted Kissing At Cannes Film Festival", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525996380.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
