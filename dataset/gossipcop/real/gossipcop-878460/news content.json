Rushing over to see what was wrong, he found Venezia\u2019s limp body still underwater being hammered by the building surf.\n\nFormer Bajan pro-turned-surf instructor Alan Burke told Surfline Florence shouted for help, trying to get a bleeding and unresponsive Venezia to shore. \u201cThey tried to get him to the beach quickly, which was difficult,\u201d Burke said. \u201cBox by Box is a tough place to get in and out of, even if you have the ability. There\u2019s lots of big rocks around, and some stick out of the water.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Zander Venezia/Instagram\n\n\u201cWhen they finally did get him in, they performed CPR on the beach,\u201d Alan continued. \u201cThe ambulance came really swiftly from Speightstown, and the whole drive Nathan Florence, Dylan Graves and the paramedics continued to try and revive him. But once they got him to the hospital, Zander was breathing, but not responsive. From the time Nathan got to him in the water to when they arrived at the hospital, it was about 75 minutes of nonstop CPR.\u201d\n\nVenezia died later at the hospital, where his family \u2014 parents Lisa and Louis Venezia and sister Bella \u2014 had joined him. Autopsy results reported Wednesday said he suffered no fractures, Surfline reported.\n\nAfter his death, Venezia\u2019s friends took to social media to share their memories of the young athlete.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much Zander!\u201d said Nolan, who watched Venezia\u2019s last surf, on Instagram. \u201cYou had such an amazing session today. Surfed for 4 hours. You were charging and had the happiest smile on your face every time I saw you. You were a humble, respectful, full of positive energy that every kid should look up too and live the way you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cGone too soon,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy heart is heavy. The Venezias always treated me like family and it hurts that they have to go through losing someone so special.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis saddens me in a way that my stomach actually hurts,\u201d said friend Patrick Ruddy. \u201cI\u2019m floored by the news this morning that our good friend @zandervenezia passed away doing what we all love, surfing at home and enjoying the ocean. It\u2019s times like this I reflect on how fragile life really is, and how quickly it can be taken away. Zander you\u2019re gonna be really f\u2014\u2014 missed!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Hurricane Irma Strikes Puerto Rico Before Moving Toward Florida. Here\u2019s What to Know\n\n\u201cI feel empty,\u201d Burke told Surfline in tears. \u201cWe are in shambles over here. \u2026 Zander was such a good, funny kid. He was always joking, and he just loved surfing. He was so jovial, such a joy to be around. I just can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. I\u2019m a mess, man. We\u2019re all a mess over here.\u201d\n\nBurke also revealed what was believed to be Zander\u2019s last words, spoken to friend Dylan Graves before his final surf.\n\n\u201cHe told Dylan, \u2018I just got the best wave of my life\u2019 \u201d Burke said.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=655&h=343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fzander-venezia.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fzander-venezia.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=655&h=343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fzander-venezia.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/human-interest/zander-venezia-surfer-dead-hurricane-irma/", "title": "Zander Venezia Dies Surfing in Barbados During Hurricane Irma", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Human Interest News,Hurricanes,News", "news_keywords": "Human Interest News,Hurricanes,News", "description": "Teenage surfer Zander Venezia died Tuesday while riding the mega-swell waves in Barbados during Hurricane Irma", "og": {"title": "Zander Venezia Dies Surfing in Barbados During Hurricane Irma", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/human-interest/zander-venezia-surfer-dead-hurricane-irma/", "description": "A teenage budding pro surfer died Tuesday while riding the mega-swell waves in Barbados during Hurricane Irma, multiple outlets report.
