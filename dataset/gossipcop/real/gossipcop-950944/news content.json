My sassy, independent, boss lady, adorable gigantic piece of my heart, first born love. Gracie is exactly like this. Diabolical. XO. My girls are born leaders. Why do they grow up? Her sweet little eyes and massive eyelashes.\n\nA post shared by Mandy Teefey AKA Nelson (@kicked2thecurbproductions) on Jul 10, 2018 at 1:03pm PDT\n\nI wouldn't mess with Selena Gomez, even at 5 years old. The singer's mom, Mandy Teefey, shared the cutest home video to Instagram on July 10, featuring a fiery young Selena back in 1997. You can hear Selena giving her mom an earful over the phone, complete with floor pacing and passionate hand gestures. Mandy explains in her caption that Selena was talking to her about school while she was at work, and boy, did she have some things to say. At one point she looks directly into the camera and says, \"You better girl.\" I choked.\n\nMandy also praised her daughter further in the caption, calling Selena a \"sassy, independent, boss lady,\" and revealed that her younger daughter Gracie is already the same. \"My girls are born leaders,\" she wrote. While these comments could be seen as subtle support for Selena after her ex Justin Bieber announced his engagement, Mandy has yet to officially comment. It's no secret she wasn't a Jelena fan towards the end of their relationship, but since Selena reportedly doesn't care about the news Mandy could simply be focusing on her fierce and funny firstborn.\n\nSource link", "images": ["https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564985285_5d47c7c5a5b0f.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564772345_5d4487f9a5e44.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564976103_5d47a3e7d7cfe.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564847348_5d45acf4d480b.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564893364_5d4660b465d74.gif", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505749_5d6e3d553be679.67411669.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564792146_5d44d5529c50f.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564944069_5d4726c5abbe3.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505568_5d6e3ca0249e16.24907573.png", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564810563_5d451d43c5775.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564797664_5d44eae094c66.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564787353_5d44c2990607e.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564861744_5d45e5300ee48.png", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564900267_5d467bab18e12.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564779122_5d44a27221eef.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564777086_5d449a7eb7564.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/1531291443_5b45a7334f1ae.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505563_5d6e3c9b275956.96586484.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564964652_5d47772c9c160.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505730_5d6e3d42eaa125.57987608.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564871885_5d460ccd02262.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564930206_5d46f09e1f529.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564819865_5d454199567b2.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505880_5d6e3dd8ac9967.00824352.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564830607_5d456b8f977e6.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564946105_5d472eb976898.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/1530270652_5b3613bc60402.png", "https://news.littlecdn.com/770x410/1531291443_5b45a7334f1ae.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564966991_5d47804f19263.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564882150_5d4634e61377e.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564952345_5d474719e53de.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564877347_5d46222340110.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564840936_5d4593e87f8a9.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564802344_5d44fd2816aea.jpeg", "https://mc.yandex.ru/watch/55779112", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564771933_5d44865d8d160.png", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505482_5d6e3c4a36a061.74735680.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564799706_5d44f2daee2d8.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564901763_5d4681832a710.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564789384_5d44ca88ecf05.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564777446_5d449be6d5d9e.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567504987_5d6e3a5b325147.62899672.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505573_5d6e3ca59b4f06.13829205.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564783085_5d44b1ed848db.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564923424_5d46d6201331a.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564997522_5d47f7921836d.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564920603_5d46cb1b25eda.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564861567_5d45e47f27705.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564933744_5d46fe702b4af.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505441_5d6e3c216942c7.79775474.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564974004_5d479bb4bd98a.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564934704_5d47023027921.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505732_5d6e3d449e8d88.93046581.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564893424_5d4660f08c68a.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505488_5d6e3c50f15ac0.09082510.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564974964_5d479f747371b.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505766_5d6e3d66a08b25.27590172.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564851964_5d45befc6befd.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505442_5d6e3c22aeeb45.12977126.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564786866_5d44c0b229a90.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564856643_5d45d14365f69.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1567505876_5d6e3dd4b9c334.06504197.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564770617_5d44813968a5b.jpeg", "https://news.littlecdn.com/360x240/1564851244_5d45bc2cbc386.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://news.littlecdn.com/1531291443_5b45a7334f1ae.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://breakingfeedz.com/posts/so-cute-selena-gomezs-mom-shared-a-sassy-home-video-of-her-independent-daughter", "title": "So Cute!
