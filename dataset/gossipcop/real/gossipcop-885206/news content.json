It also gave us a Shonda Rhimes\u2019 cliffhanger that probably made more than one Gladiator knock over their glass of red wine in shock.\n\nAnd we\u2019re sure if you saw the finale you already know we\u2019re talking about that \u201cYAS QUEEN!\u201d-enducing painting of Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) two young girls see hanging in the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. You know, something that suggests she eventually becomes PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\nAlso Read: 'Scandal' Star Scott Foley on Why Series Finale Will Have Fans Asking 'Did That Happen?'\n\nFollowing the episode, Rhimes, Washington and the rest of the cast sat down on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d to discuss the ending, and of course that moment came up.\n\nWhen the late-night host asked Washington what she thinks the portrait is doing there, she nervously answered: \u201cGosh, I really want Shonda to answer this question. Because even in the script it\u2019s written that we don\u2019t know exactly why.\u201d\n\nRhimes jumped in to say: \u201cIt says the audience is left not knowing.\u201d But, of course, the showrunner revealed she actually knows what\u2019s up, adding, \u201cI get one last thing to say as a spoiler that I\u2019m going to hold onto for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Ratings: 'Scandal' Series Finale Surges 44 Percent From Last Week\n\nWell, that sounds par for the course for, Rhimes.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s OK, because Scott Foley, who plays Liv\u2019s sometimes lover (other times brother) Jake Ballard, told TheWrap in an interview last week that the seventh and final season of \u201cScandal\u201d would come to a close with an ending he wants you to make your own. And we\u2019re 99.9 percent sure that portrait of Olivia is what he was referencing.\n\n\u201cNow there is one thing that is sort of ambiguous at the very end of the show and it\u2019s going to leave people questioning, \u2018Did this happen? Did that happen? I don\u2019t quite get it.\u2019 And I think it\u2019s important to make it your own,\u201d Foley said of the episode \u2014 titled, \u201cOver a Cliff.\u201d \u201cAnd there\u2019s going to be questions and disagreements and \u2018It couldn\u2019t be. Here\u2019s why\u2019 or \u2018It has to be. Here\u2019s why.'\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Scandal' Cast Pranks Josh Malina With an Old Lady and Her Fake Heart Attack (Video)\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s important for the viewer, when that happens, and they see the moment that I\u2019m talking about, to make it personal to them. And I know this is sounding very ethereal, and forgive me for that. But there is an opportunity there for it to have whatever you want it to have,\u201d he added.\n\nWatch Rhimes and Washington discuss the ending above and see the portrait below.", "images":
