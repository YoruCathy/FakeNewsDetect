She seems like the mean, popular girl from school.\n\nA: That\u2019s exactly what I wanted to do. I remember telling my mom, because my mom used to help me out with my character a lot. I was telling her I want to be that mean girl that everyone knew in high school. Everyone knew that girl. There was always that one girl that was rude that was mean, but everyone still wants to know what\u2019s going on with her. I get a lot of inspiration from a lot of different villains and different movies.\n\nQ; Do you think that is why everyone connects with Alexa Bliss, because everyone has met someone like that in their life?\n\nA: Absolutely, I take inspiration from people who were not nice to me in high school (laughs), try to focus that. I feel like that is something everyone can relate too, even if you were that girl. People knew who that was and how to relate to it.\n\nQ: You said you take inspiration from different villains. You are a fan of cosplay. What made you go with the Harley Quinn look? That was the one that took off.\n\nA: I did a lot of cosplay when I was with (Wesley) Blake and (Buddy) Murphy when I was in NXT. We had a Harley Quinn and Joker trio outfit that we never got to do. I remember saying to (my fianc\u00e9e) Murphy, \u2018I really want to still do this Harley Quinn one\u2019 and he was like \u2018you should\u2019. So we worked on the outfit and got it all together.\n\nHe actually came up with the pose with the belt (behind my neck and right shoulder), which is funny. That has transitioned into how I hold the title. That was where it came from. It was an idea we had in NXT. Everyone knows I can do the cosplay thing on the main roster. I went for it and it worked out pretty well.\n\nQ: You didn\u2019t take the traditional path to wrestling. You were a Division I cheerleader, body builder. You applied online for a WWE tryout. What made you take that chance at 22?\n\nA: I had watched wrestling grow up. I found it amazing. I loved watching wrestling. I was so focused into sports and everything growing up, after college one of my trainers was telling me that WWE was having a tryout. When I found that out I said, \u2018My gosh I have to tryout.\u2019 I knew it was an opportunity that I didn\u2019t want to pass up.\n\nI remember sending in a video, thinking probably nothing will come of it, but I still had high hopes. I got a call, got a tryout and I\u2019ve been wrestling for the last four years.\n\nQ: When you walk into that tryout and you\u2019re 5-foot-1, never wrestled before and you\u2019re in a room with these big athletes and model types, what\u2019s going through your mind as things are getting started there?\n\nA: When I went it was in L.A. and it was all these models. They were real tall, real thin, beautiful women. I remember texting my mom like, \u2018Well I tried.\u2019 I was like, clearly they are looking for something, looking for a specific look and I am walking in 5-foot. I had never done like modeling, modeling. I was just like, \u2018Oh man. Fantastic.\u2019\n\nQ: Was there a point where you relax and think, OK this is not as bad as I thought it would be?\n\nA: I think once I started talking because we got to go in and start talking to everyone. They were just trying to get a feel for our personalities. A lot of the girls that were there I feel like didn\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about wrestling because they told me they didn\u2019t.\n\nI remember just going and just talking and Triple H was there and I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh this is so cool.\u2019 I just started talking and I am a talker. I just started talking about my family watching wrestling. I started to talk about the knowledge I had of wrestling, storylines and everything like that.\n\nThey told us they would call us back if we got a 30-day tryout. When I was on the flight home from that tryout, they were like it\u2019s a 30-day tryout, and in-ring tryout and they would take girls from there. Then I get a call about two weeks later, saying, \u2018Well you are not going to the 30-day tryout.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh no.\u2019 \u2018We are going to sign you and you are going to move down [to Florida] in four months and we are going to give you your medical next week. I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh gosh.\u2019 \u2018Just hope you are as athletic as you look.\u2019 Oh my gosh, no pressure.\n\nQ: What do you think made them change their mind and sign you right away?\n\nA: I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d be really interested to know, but I am not sure. Maybe it was because I didn\u2019t stop talking. I don\u2019t know.\n\nQ: When you are holding some of those titles, do you ever think back to where this started, from never wrestling to the first person to hold the Raw and SmackDown women\u2019s titles?\n\nA: It\u2019s been an amazing journey that I\u2019ve had with WWE. I always think about the first day I came to FCW at the time. I remember walking in and I had sparkly-sequence UGG boots on, sparkly-sequence jacket on and matching sequence backpack. The head instructor, Bill Dumont, goes. \u2018What are you?\u2019 I was just like, \u2018I\u2019m Lexi.\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what else to say.\n\nYou could probably see me from space. I was very just like not knowing anything and watching the girls on the first day. I was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, they are so good.\u2019 That day I didn\u2019t think I would ever be able to get to their level and to have the opportunity to be champion has been absolutely incredible.\n\nQ: Even before that, you had to deal with anorexia as a teenager. In what ways did it take over your life?\n\nA: Oh gosh, I was a completely different person. It controls you and it consumes you in so many different ways.\n\nI remember my mom sitting me down and telling me I was in the hospital and she was like, \u2018You are probably going to die from this\u2019 because the doctors were telling her 1 in 4 people die from it and I was going to be that one because my body wasn\u2019t responding. My heart wasn\u2019t responding. Everything was just going downhill and I didn\u2019t see it. Your brain doesn\u2019t see it. I remember being in the hospital and not knowing why.\n\nI looked in the mirror and said, \u2018I\u2019m fine. I look fine\u2019 and my mom is telling me you are going to die from this and I just literally looked at her blankly and said, \u2018I don\u2019t care.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s one of those things you don\u2019t know who you are. You become something completely different and it consumes you entire life. It consumes everything about you.\n\nThat is why I try to be so open about it because people going through it, it consumes them and you tell them it doesn\u2019t have to. You can move past your eating disorder and not let it have control over your life anymore.\n\nQ: How did you overcome it?\n\nA: I went through treatment so many times. At one point I was in rounds of five different doctors a day. That was my deal to be able to get out of the hospital, which was I had to see five different doctors every day. I literally spent every day at the doctors. I remember, you have to get better when you want to get better. I\u2019d have phycologists and physiatrists telling me ways to try to get better. It is something you have to try to do on your own.\n\nI remember my friend Erin telling me she had been in the hospital with me every day. She was there when I got admitted and after I was released. She said, \u2018If you think you are fat Lexi, what do you think I look like?\u2019 And then I noticed she was starting to pick her food apart like me. She was starting to count calories like me and it just broke my heart because I never wanted to influence anyone to go through what I am going through and that\u2019s exactly what I had done. That was the moment where I knew I needed to get better.\n\nIt was for me and it was for people around me because it doesn\u2019t just affect you, it affects people around you. That fact that I was literally taking my best friend and morphing her into that bad path, it wasn\u2019t OK with me.\n\nMy parents put me back in touch with my trainers Mike [Davies] and Natalie [Calland]. They told me I was going to compete [in body building]. I was like 80 pounds and they were like, \u2018You are going to be on stage in six weeks. You can either be skinny and embarrass yourself or look healthy and do well, but regardless you are getting on stage in six weeks.\u2019 That was kind of the kick in the butt. Their diets got me comfortable eating food again. It was a very, very long process because this was like a four or five year battle.\n\nQ: How tough was it to earn the respect of room in NXT or FCW when you had not wrestled before and had not gone through the indies?\n\nA: Oh god, I don\u2019t know if I still have it now. It\u2019s one thing coming in, not being a part of the indies stuff like that and doing well. It\u2019s another to now be part of the indies and be champ. It\u2019s an ongoing thing, but the girls that I work with now are amazing.\n\nWhen I came up to SmackDown I was super nervous. I never really worked with these girls before. I have to say, the group of women I was drafted with to \u201cSmackDown Live\u201d were the most welcoming and most amazing women I\u2019ve ever worked with.\n\nWe would go on tours, we would go have dinners together and hang out and everyone was so sweet. It was the most refreshing locker room I had ever been in and it is still the best locker room I\u2019ve even been in. Just having Nikki [Bella] there we had so much fun.\n\nQ: Did anyone help you transition to the world of reality TV with Total Divas?\n\nA: I texted Nikki Bella asking her like, \u2018Oh gosh what do I do.\u2019 She was just like, \u2018Have fun with it. You\u2019re with (your best friend) Nia (Jax) so just kind of be you because we are crazy anyway. Just have fun with it.\u2019 The real stuff is awesome, but don\u2019t be afraid to open up and just be fun.\n\nQ: What will people see from Total Divas\u2019 Alexa Bliss that is different from the person they see on Raw?\n\nA: Oh gosh. You probably won\u2019t see me be mean as much. That is probably the biggest difference. I\u2019m not nearly as mean. You get to see how the schedule affects me and Murphy and you will get to see that I get a (pet mini) pig Larry-Steve. You will see pretty much everything about Nia and I\u2019s friendship.\n\nQ: It feels like Larry-Steve is starting to take off. He\u2019s getting is own social media accounts. How fun has it been to have him?\n\nA: It\u2019s so much fun. He is such a little ham for the camera, no pun intended. If you pull out a camera, he knows exactly what it is. He comes up and sniffs it and like pose. It\u2019s the funniest thing ever. He\u2019s super smart. He has just been so fun to have and see how he interacts with (our) dogs.\n\nQ: When you did the Bayley: This is Your Life segment on Raw, why didn\u2019t that work and did it bother you and Bayley?\n\nA: We kind of knew going into it that it wasn\u2019t going to be The Rock and Mick Foley. We pretty much took what we had. We knew the direction. We knew it was going to go really well or really bad. I knew if it was gonna go bad and it wasn\u2019t going to be responsive to the audience, I was just going to have fun with it. So I was like you know what, there was nothing we could do about it, we are going to have fun and just make the best of it as we can.\n\nSometimes there is those segments that no matter what you do they are going to turn out how they are gonna turn out. I don\u2019t think it was the writing or anything like that. I feel like it was, I\u2019m not The Rock. She\u2019s not Mick Foley. It\u2019s never going to be the same as something that was done before.\n\nI started like messing with actors, just slap her and call her like Slaps McGaps or something like that. I just started playing around with it and just having fun with it. Because I was like, if they\u2019re not going to like it than I am going to have fun with it.\n\nIt\u2019s wasn\u2019t really something we beat ourselves up over. It was just like, \u2018Well, it is what it is. Looking forward to next week.\u2019 I think it is funny that WWE joked about it ever since.\n\nQ: It was the next week\n\nA: Yea, the next week and weeks after that they have me keep mentioning like, \u2018Oh hey this is your life. Just kidding.\u2019 Stuff like that. It\u2019s been the butt of every joke. It is fun, but you are never (always) gonna have amazing segments and it was deemed like the worst segment in Raw history, so I feel like I had some really good segments in Raw and the worst segment in Raw history so I am pretty much well rounded then.\n\nQ: You and Mickie James seem to have good chemistry. What is it like having veterans like her and Natalya in the locker room to bounce things off of?\n\nA: I love having Mickie in the locker room. When I was on SmackDown, I always worked with Nattie and she\u2019s awesome and I love Nattie to death. We always have our makeup and Sephora brushes. She actually texted me the other day about her Sephora trip, we compare Sephora trips.\n\nMickie has been a lot of fun to work with. I am looking forward to our match at TLC. When Mickie first came back she was on my side as La Luchadora and helped me retain my SmackDown title in a cage match against Becky (Lynch). To kind of switch roles and have us against each other has been a lot of fun. She is always fun to work with and she has all this information and it\u2019s just fun to pick her brain.\n\nQ: Asuka is making her main roster debut at TLC. What was it like working with her in NXT and how does her style from Japan make things a little different?\n\nA: At first her style was very, very different, but I\u2019ve worked with her so many times now that I am kind of used to her style, used to the aggression, used to how to make it work. I know because if you have two conflicting styles you can have an amazing match or it could be a hot mess. I love working with Asuka. I am really excited she\u2019s coming to the roster. She is what this next step of the women\u2019s revolution needs.\n\nQ: How did you and Nia become friends? Why did you hit it off so quickly?\n\nA: They have the NXT talent help out with the tryouts in NXT and I helped out with her and it was in the middle of their lunch break, she comes up and starts talking to me when I was doing cardio. And we just hit it off and we have been best friends ever since.\n\nQ: If WWE didn\u2019t\u2019 work out, what would Alexa Bliss be doing?\n\nA: I went to college (at Akron) for diet and nutrition, so I would probably be a nutritionist.", "images": ["https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bliss2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bliss2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/sidebarwidget_sportsodds_promo_image_280x180.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/mani-kit-feature.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bliss2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/10/20/alexa-bliss-on-her-sudden-wwe-rise-anorexia-battle-and-total-divas/", "title": "Alexa Bliss on her sudden WWE rise, anorexia battle and \u2018Total Divas\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
