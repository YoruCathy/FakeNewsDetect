Madison Hildebrand shared that he will not be returning for Season 11 of MDLLA.\n\nMadison confirmed the news in a statement to The Daily Dish. \"After a decade of adventure and one of the most unique experiences of my life, I have decided not to continue 'Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles.' I am so grateful to have had this opportunity but the time has come for me to re-energize, rejuvenate, and refocus my attention and light onto new endeavours. As an original cast member, I feel so lucky to be a part of the show that sparked the 'Million Dollar Listing' franchise,\" he said. \"For the past 10 years, the show has documented my life and real estate career from the very beginning. I couldn\u2019t have done it without the love and support from the fans who inspired me to share my life on camera. Thank you to Bravo, World of Wonder and the crew who became family for all your hard work and dedication to making this show the success that it is today. From the bottom of my heart, I sincerely thank you all and hope you will continue to follow my journey as I begin a new chapter of my life.\"\n\nMadison has been with MDLLA since the very first season, joining the series as one of the original agents, alongside Josh Flagg and Chad Rogers. After appearing on MDLLA more briefly in Seasons 7 and 8, Madison returned full time in Seasons 9 and 10.\n\nAs the president and founder of The Malibu Life, Inc., Madison continues to dominate the Malibu real estate market. Since last season of MDLLA, he has shared a lot of personal news with fans, including his breakup with boyfriend Cody Keltz, the passing of his grandmother, and his younger brother's open heart surgery.", "images": ["https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/2020-03/mdlla-season-12-16x9-sans-logo.jpg?itok=g4OObIuo", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/dish-million-dollar-listing-la_1.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/02/dish-021518-madison-cody.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/393/179/200413_4149848_Kandi_Burruss_and_Todd_Tucker_Clash_Over_New.jpg?itok=f4JKV304", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-todd-kaela-tucker.jpg?itok=EzzwdqqY", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/rhonj-season-10-aftershow.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/emily-simson-family-children-rhoc.jpg?itok=qD9_yrVe", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-blaze-tucker-rhoa.jpg?itok=JeNobttG", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/last-chance-kitchen-playlist-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/kandi-burruss-throwback-picture-rhoa.jpg?itok=p5t7QGq7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/dish-121517-madison-hildebrand.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-03/vanderpump-rules-aftershow-season-8.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2020-02/rhoa-aftershow-playlist-promo_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/sonja-morgan-bridget-everett-friendship.jpg?itok=cIbhVQv-", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/teresa-giudice-nono-father-tribute.jpg?itok=dUZhrRvi", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/lizzie-rovsek-son-children-quarantine.jpg?itok=li3lTJzU", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/529/839/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th.jpg?itok=WTimcsbI", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/04/dish-million-dollar-listing-la.jpg?itok=C8WxO8SD", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2019-12/project-runway-season-18-aftershow.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/616/903/200410_4149060_Your_First_Look_at_the_Season_Finale.jpg?itok=sWG7OjgC", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/paul-adrienne-maloof-children-rhobh.jpg?itok=Tvhm2ri5"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/07/dish-million-dollar-listing-la_1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/million-dollar-listing-los-angeles-season-11-madison-hildebrand-not-returning", "title": "A Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles Veteran Won't Be Returning for Season 11", "meta_data": {"title": "Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles Season 11: Madison Hildebrand Not Returning | The Daily Dish", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "description": "An OG Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles agent is moving on.
