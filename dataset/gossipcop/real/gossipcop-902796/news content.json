The full clip was released on Tidal on Friday, December 29, after he shared a short teaser featuring his wife, Beyonce, and daughter Blue Ivy on Thursday.\n\nThe rapper enlisted some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names, including Mindy Kaling, Jessica Chastain, Michael B. Jordan, Thandie Newton, Brie Larson, Janet Mock, Constance Wu, Rashida Jones, Rosario Dawson and Niecy Nash. The video travels through time and explores different types of government throughout 400 years. Starting in the year 2444, the scenes travel back in time as they preview how a government could look with women as leaders, the consequences of power struggles and other political turmoil.\n\nIn the opening scene, Newton and Jordan play a brother and sister who are fighting over their kingdom, which is under her command. Her lover, played by Trevante Rhodes, steps in and kills Jordan\u2019s character. Newton\u2019s character then stabs him in the back and says: \u201cIt\u2019s not his, and it\u2019s not yours. It\u2019s my throne.\u201d\n\nThis Is Us actress Susan Kelechi Watson plays a grown-up Blue Ivy who is now a political leader working with other powerful women on revising the constitution. Watson says, \u201cIt\u2019s like I remember my father saying when I was a little girl: \u2018Nobody wins when the family feuds.\u2019\u201d The clip then returns to present day, when the \u201cLegacy\u201d rapper walks into a church holding his daughter\u2019s hand and then enters a confessional to speak of his sins with his wife Bey as the priestess.\n\nOmari Hardwick, David Oyelowo and America Ferrera also make appearances in the video. The cast has been sharing photos of the shoot, including The Mindy Project star who was pregnant at the time. She tweeted an image on Friday of herself posing with some of the women in the cast. She captioned it: \u201cNobody wins when the family feuds. The Family Feud music video is now on Tidal directed by @ava @s_c_ \ud83c\udf1f\u201d\n\nNobody wins when the family feuds.
