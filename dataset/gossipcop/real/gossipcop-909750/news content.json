More here!\n\nLife just one year ago was a lot different for country music star Thomas Rhett and his wife Lauren Akins. The couple had no children\u2014 but that was all about to change when they would welcome their first daughter, Willa Gray, home from Uganda in May.\n\nHaving children is something the couple has dreamed about and asked God for and now that their dreams are coming true they take every minute to gush about their two bundles of joy. On the 2018 Grammy Awards Red Carpet the two couldn\u2019t stop talking about their girls with E! News!\n\nThomas Rhett said that it has been \u201camazing\u201d to watch Willa be a big sister to newborn Ada James.\n\n\u201cShe was jealous at first I think, but it\u2019s so fun to watch her,\u201d Thomas Rhett said. \u201cShe loves our little Ada so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we just hoped for for so long,\u201d Lauren spoke of her eldest daughter. \u201cShe was very fresh off just coming to America, so it was something that we really wanted her to feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nWilla has become more comfortable with her little sister for sure! The video of the two of them meeting for the first time is heartbreakingly adorable!\n\n\u201cI think I was more nervous that she just wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable but the second I was like, \u2018Do you wanna give her a kiss?\u2019 and she leaned over and kissed [Ada], I was like, \u2018Thank you God,\u2019\u201d Lauren added on the 2018 Grammy Awards Red Carpet. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be sweeter.\u201d\n\nHaving Willa become an official member of the family wasn\u2019t easy though. TR and Lauren also opened up about the emotional aspect it took to officially call her their daughter.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely the hardest thing we\u2019ve ever been through,\u201d Lauren shared with E! News. \u201cBut I think it needs to be hard because you have to fight for that baby just like you do. I\u2019ve done both now \u2014 I\u2019ve had one biological and I\u2019ve had one through adoption. It\u2019s a battle to bring your child home. And it just strengthens you as parents and as a team. It is hard but it\u2019s so worth it.\u201d\n\nSince Willa Gray has been home the whole Akins clan has just been enjoying life together and accomplishing many milestones. From Willa Gray\u2019s first birthday with her family to Christmas as a family of four, they\u2019ve done it all and with big smiles on their faces!\n\nFor more Akins family updates keep up with Country Fancast!", "images": ["https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=SX5zm1akGFL170", "https://cdn.mobsocmedia.com/uploads/sites/49/20180205172247/thomas-rhett-adoption-.jpg", "https://cdn.mobsocmedia.com/wp-content/themes/mobsoc-media-grid/assets/img/ajax-loader.gif?9f0db8", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1034239779997311&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22014649&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mobsocmedia.com/uploads/sites/49/20180205172247/thomas-rhett-adoption-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://countryfancast.com/thomas-rhett-adoption-process/", "title": "Thomas Rhett & Wife Open Up About Turbulent Adoption Process", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Country artist Thomas Rhett and wife Lauren Akins had a year full of blessings, including officially getting to call Willa Gray their daughter.
