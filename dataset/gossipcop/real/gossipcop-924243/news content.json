News, Kraines warns that being the butt of a joke has haunted him for years.\n\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m Todd Kraines and you literally would know me from one thing and one thing only,\u201d he says. \u201cIn honor of April Fools\u2019 Day, I\u2019m here to bring awareness to the consequences seemingly harmless pranks can have on people\u2019s lives \u2014 not just for a day, but forever. So f\u2014\u2013 up man.\u201d\n\nHe adds in the E! clip, \u201cThe Todd Kraines prank placed me in an extremely, extremely uncomfortable situation. Kris would call me asking if I was behind these pranks and I had no idea what the hell was going on. Do I need to call the FBI? Was someone using my name? Identity theft is a serious crime.\u201d\n\nKraines has a stern warning for anyone ready to pull a fast one of their pals.\n\n\u201cThis April Fools\u2019 day, believe nothing and trust no one more than any other day,\u201d he says. \u201cThink before you prank and the aftermath could be eternally viral.\u201d\n\nFor just a bit of revenge, Kraines calls up Kourtney in the E! clip to get the scoop on the long-running game.\n\n\u201cWhen that whole thing was going on, like did you guys ever think about how it would affect my life?\u201d he asks, to which the reality stars admits, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to share that it started during a Mexican getaway and wasn\u2019t Disick\u2019s idea. In fact, her ex-boyfriend had never even met Kraines when he started making the phone calls.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Ftodd-kraines-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Ftodd-kraines-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/todd-kraines-jokes-scott-disick-prank-hilarious-psa/", "title": "Todd Kraines Jokes About 'Extremely Uncomfortable' Scott Disick Prank in Hilarious PSA", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kardashians,News,Scott Disick,TV", "news_keywords": "Kardashians,News,Scott Disick,TV", "description": "Before pulling off an April Fools' day gag, Todd Kraines is asking potential pranksters to think first of the effect on their victims", "og": {"title": "Todd Kraines Jokes About 'Extremely Uncomfortable' Scott Disick Prank in Hilarious PSA", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/todd-kraines-jokes-scott-disick-prank-hilarious-psa/", "description": "Before pulling off an April Fools\u2019 day gag, Todd Kraines is asking potential pranksters to think first of the effect on their victims.
