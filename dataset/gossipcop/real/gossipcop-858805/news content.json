She helped PETA lobby the New York City Council to pass bills increasing licensing fees for unneutered animals and prohibiting dogs from being chained outside, she hosted PETA\u2019s Passover hotline to promote vegan ham \u2014 or \u201cpork even a Jew can eat\u201d \u2014 and she helped PETA unveil Melissa\u2019s anti-fur billboard in Times Square.\n\nEvery year, more than 6 million dogs and cats end up in U.S. animal shelters, and half of them must be euthanized because there aren\u2019t enough good homes for them. Countless more end up on the street, where they may starve, freeze, get hit by cars, or endure abuse. PETA encourages caring people to adopt from local animal shelters and never buy from breeders or pet stores, which only exacerbate the homeless-animal overpopulation crisis.", "images": ["https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/1251-save-the-children/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6x2w6bZhj5w/default.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-f3vrMXzLyb-fU.gif", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jif18pZPlDc/default.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1tNK-P29SvU/default.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/11396-joan-rivers-peta-ad/story_wide.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/6908-elton-john-aids-foundation/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/1295-red-cross/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/11396-joan-rivers-peta-ad/story_wide-1496779761.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ntGdo99ymAM/default.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/622-edie-falco/teaser-1503164810.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/images/banners/subscriptions-300x250-1587180514.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/6341-elton-john/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/547-ed-begley-jr/teaser-1503125239.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/11572-lady-gaga/small_square-1503620652.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/3051-make-a-wish-foundation/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/images/footer-logo-1587180514.svg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/1242-peta/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/2984-annie-lennox/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/7146-unicef/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/24-bill-clinton/small_square-1503121377.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/7581-paul-mccartney/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/134-sting/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/9-bono/small_square-1503121378.jpg", "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/373-ellen-degeneres/small_square-1503121378.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/11396-joan-rivers-peta-ad/story_wide.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.looktothestars.org/news/16739-joan-rivers-stars-in-posthumous-peta-campaign", "title": "Joan Rivers Stars In Posthumous PETA Campaign", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Melissa Rivers, Joan Rivers, PETA, celebrity, charity, news", "description": "Joan Rivers, who would have turned 84 on June 8, lives on \u2014 in new books, on QVC, and now in a PETA campaign urging animal adoption, using one of her trademark jokes.", "robots": "index", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed-1587180514.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fee133", "msapplication-tooltip": "Look to the Stars", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#fee133", "msapplication-starturl": "/", "application-name": "Look to the Stars", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Look to the Stars", "twitter": {"site": "@looktothestars", "title": "Joan Rivers Stars In Posthumous PETA Campaign", "description": "Joan Rivers, who would have turned 84 on June 8, lives on \u2014 in new books, on QVC, and now in a PETA campaign urging animal adoption, using one of her trademark jokes.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"url": "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/11396-joan-rivers-peta-ad/story_wide.jpg"}}, "stripe-key": "pk_live_idk4U6tpUXcAV1RMXtw3Rwsh", "og": {"site_name": "Look to the Stars", "url": "https://www.looktothestars.org/news/16739-joan-rivers-stars-in-posthumous-peta-campaign", "title": "Joan Rivers Stars In Posthumous PETA Campaign", "description": "Joan Rivers, who would have turned 84 on June 8, lives on \u2014 in new books, on QVC, and now in a PETA campaign urging animal adoption, using one of her trademark jokes.", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.looktothestars.org/photo/11396-joan-rivers-peta-ad/story_wide.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-07T14:30:00Z", "tag": "PETA"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496845800.0, "source": "https://www.looktothestars.org", "summary": ""}
