Heigl says she was inspired by a beach vacation, Suits starting in April \"and my deep desire to feel fit, strong and sexy.\"\n\nThe last two-month push finally allowed her \"to lose the last of my baby weight and do a deep dive search for the ab muscles I knew were buried under that belly somewhere!\" Heigl wrote.\n\n\"I am so grateful I\u2019ve had a full year to find those ab muscles and get my butt back up where it belongs and wasn\u2019t forced by work to snap back into shape,\" Heigl wrote. \"But it is time to make the strength, fitness and overall health of my body a priority.\"\n\nHeigl gave props to the Bikini Body Guide and the accompanying app Sweat.\n\nThe workouts are tough. \"But the progress I\u2019ve made in only 5 short weeks has kept me motivated and inspired to keep going!\" Heigl wrote.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5736857715001_5736848752001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/19/katherine-heigl-shows-off-her-14-month-post-baby-weight-loss-journey/353755002/", "title": "Katherine Heigl shows off her 14-month post-baby weight loss journey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Katherine Heigl shows off her 14-month post-baby weight loss journey", "description": "Heigl shows photo proof of her progress, getting back to shape after giving birth to her son Joshua in Dec. 2016.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/19/katherine-heigl-shows-off-her-14-month-post-baby-weight-loss-journey/353755002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3000, "height": 1695}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bryan Alexander", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Heigl shows photo proof of her progress, getting back to shape after giving birth to her son Joshua in Dec. 2016.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Katherine Heigl shows off her 14-month post-baby weight loss journey", "description": "Heigl shows photo proof of her progress, getting back to shape after giving birth to her son Joshua in Dec. 2016."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518969600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
