But today\u2019s cosmetics market has many formulas designed to protect acne-prone, very dry, and very oily skin. Just take a look at the best foundations for sensitive skin here in this review.\n\nChoose from light, medium, or full coverage, as well as liquid, powder, and airbrush makeup foundations. We selected the top formulas and brands that enhance your beauty without irritating your face.\n\nBefore we begin, here\u2019s a little information about the best ingredients and ones to avoid, plus how to choose the best color for your skin tone.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCommon ingredients in makeup foundation for sensitive skin\n\nLiquid foundations for sensitive skin are water-based, so water should be one of the first ingredients in the list\n\nDimethicone, a silicon derivative, seals in moisture and hides redness, but could cause a reaction in very sensitive people\n\nTitanium dioxide, zinc oxide, and silica hide redness and absorb oil\n\nZinc oxide is a mineral that works as a natural sunscreen\n\nSome matte finishes contain talc, which could irritate very sensitive skin\n\nTocopheryl acetate (Vitamin E) is often includes because it helps heal\n\nNiacinamide, or Vitamin B3, reduces redness and strengthens the skin\u2019s natural barrier\n\nAvoid products with these ingredients:\n\nPetroleum derivatives\n\nSLS, sodium lauryl sulfate, may irritate skin and eyes, cause acne\n\nParabens that disrupt hormones and are linked to cancer\n\nFragrances, because these mystery chemicals are among the top 5 allergens\n\nOils, of course, only make the problem worse\u2014with the exception being Jojoba oil\n\nAlcohols\u2014not fatty alcohols, but SD denatured and isopropyl, kinds that dry out your skin\n\nWe\u2019ll try to point out problem ingredients as we review each product. Some foundations may contain one or two undesirables, but otherwise are good. The farther down the ingredient list the problem appears, the less of it makes up the formula. Now let\u2019s look at tips for picking the best color.\n\nSelecting the best color foundation for your skin\n\nChoosing the best color to blend with your skin tone isn\u2019t too hard if you can test the foundation yourself. It\u2019s best if you can place a small sample along your jawline and look at it in the daylight. See if the foundation disappears against your skin.\n\nCheck the undertones to see if they match your coloring. Look at the veins in your wrist. Do they look greenish? Then you have warm-toned skin. Do they appear bluish or purplish? Then you have cool-toned skin. Some people have neutral toned skin because they have a mix of both.\n\nAlso take into account that what looks great on you in the winter might not cut it in the summertime. Some beauty experts handle the transition times between seasons by having both lighter and darker foundations on hand, then blending them for a perfect match.\n\nNow let\u2019s begin the reviews of the best foundations for sensitive skin.\n\nThe top makeup foundations\n\nWe\u2019ll start with one of the most common types of foundation\u2014liquids. Liquids look good on all ages, unlike powders which may not suit older users. Liquids can provide everything from barely-there coverage to a flawless finish for a photoshoot.\n\nLORAC Natural Performance Foundation\n\nLORAC, a cosmetics company started by makeup artist to the stars, Carol Shaw, is known for high quality products made without parabens, sulfates, and other undesirables. In fact, their Natural Performance Foundation doesn\u2019t have synthetic fragrances or dyes or phthalates, either.\n\nWhat is does have is a formula containing Vitamin A and xyleine\u2014a mix of extracts from olive leaf, papaya fruit, and lemons. LORAC says it has natural cell regenerating qualities. Users say the foundation goes on smooth, feels light, and has good coverage. It\u2019s available in 8 colors.\n\nLa Roche-Posay Toleriane Teint Mattifying Mousse Matte Foundation for Oily Skin and Sensitive Skin\n\nLa Roche-Posay is a brand recommended by dermatologists for their non-comedogenic foundations. The Toleriance Teint Mattifying Mousse is free of oils, parabens, and fragrances that can irritate skin. It comes in 5 shades for light to medium skin.\n\nIts formula hides blemishes and pores, and soaks up oil to provide a matte finish. The oil reducer is a proprietary ingredient called Airlicium that keeps shine under control all day long. The full list includes: Dimethicone, Undecane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Tridecane, Tocopheryl Acetate, Silica Silylate, Perlite, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Retinyl Linoleate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Titanium Dioxide, and Iron Oxides.\n\nPay attention to the ingredient called Retinyl Linoleate\u2014if you plan to spend a lot of time outdoors, consider using a different foundation. While Vitamin A derivatives like retinol, etc., can help clear up acne, they can increase your risk of damage from sunlight.\n\nbareEscentuals bareMinerals bareSkin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation SPF 20\n\nWhen you see the brand name bareMinerals, you probably think of powders. In this case, they also sell a Pure Brightening Serum Foundation that\u2019s a liquid. It even has SPF 20 to protect your face from UV rays, and it comes in 20 colors.\n\nUsers say it doesn\u2019t even feel like they\u2019re wearing makeup, but they can see the difference on their skin. The foundation serum has a slight shimmer to it and it definitely brightens up skin tone.\n\nThe ingredients include titanium dioxide as a sunscreen, Vitamin C for fading dark spots, glycerin for hydration, Vitamin E, Lilac Leaf Cell Culture Extract and Plant Stem Cells, Mica, and other derivatives of natural substances like coconut and jojoba.\n\nDermablend Cover Foundation Creme SPF 30\n\nDermablend\u2019s Cover Foundation Cr\u00e8me with SPF 30 is perfect if you need serious coverage that lasts all day and withstands perspiration and even a dip in the pool.\n\nUsers who say they have sensitive skin have worn this foundation successfully without irritating their skin. Some say it works very well as a concealer instead of an all-over base.\n\nThe ingredient list contains mineral oil and talc, two things that can cause trouble for very sensitive skin. But if you need intense coverage, this could be something to try on a small patch of skin and see how you react. It comes in 18 colors.\n\nVichy Dermafinish Corrective Fluid Liquid Foundation\n\nVichy\u2019s Dermafinish comes in 4 colors for light to medium tone skin. It\u2019s a high coverage formula designed to hide flaws like scars, and it does a great job. This foundation lasts up to 16 hours and provides SPF 30 sunscreen against both UVA and UVB rays.\n\nIt\u2019s fragrance-free and non-comedogenic, tested against allergies and on sensitive eyes and contact lens wearers.\n\nNARS All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation\n\nwww.amazon.com/NARS-Luminous-Weightless-Foundation-Barcelona/dp/B00TOO63YA/\n\nNARS All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation comes in 20 shades, from light with neutral undertones to dark with espresso undertones. It\u2019s going to be hard to not find the exact color you need when you see this collection.\n\nThe formula provides good coverage while feeling weightless on skin. It lasts up to 16 hours. Just one note: it contains Retinyl Palmitate, which may actually make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Some makeup wearers avoid Vitamin A derivatives in products they wear outdoors.\n\nGiorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation\n\nWhile this may be the most expensive foundation in our lineup today, it\u2019s also one of the best products, at least according to one internationally-known makeup artist. We\u2019re a little doubtful because the formula contains parabens and a mysterious \u201cfragrance.\u201d But we\u2019re reviewing products for sensitive skin, so we\u2019re being picky.\n\nThis silky medium coverage foundation hides redness and pores but feels very lightweight and breathable. In fact, one user described the appearance as having a \u201cdewy glow.\u201d While you can apply it with your fingers, Giorgio Armani recommends using a brush for a flawless result.\n\nFor your benefit (since they\u2019re a little hard to find), here are the alleged ingredients: Water, Cyclopentasiloxane, Glycerin, Isododecane, Alcohol, Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate, Aluminum Starch Octenylsuccinate, Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone, Hexyl Laurate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Phenoxyethanol, Acetylated Glycol Stearate, Magnesium Sulfate, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Tristearin, Cellulose Gum, Nylon-12, Limonene, Benzyl Salicylate, Linalool, Diphenyl Dimethicone, Acrylates Copolymer, Fragrance, Disodium Stearoyl Glutamate, Methylparaben, Butylparaben, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Aluminum Hydroxide, Hexyl Cinnamal, and May Contain: Titanium Dioxide, Iron Oxides, Ultramarines, and Mica.\n\nLancome Teint Miracle Bare Skin Foundation SPF 15 Natural Light Creator\n\nLanc\u00f4me\u2019s Teint Miracle Bare Skin Foundation with SPF 15 is a product recommended by some well-known beauty sites and makeup artists as well as dermatologists. It comes in 20 shades so you\u2019re likely to find the perfect color.\n\nThe lightweight formula is gentle on sensitive skin, but designed to last up to 12 hours. The foundation actually hydrates skin, too, so your face may feel softer even after you take it off.\n\nOrganic ingredients for discerning customers\n\nAll this talk of chemical ingredients gets depressing, don\u2019t you think? What about foundations made with organic components? Do they work? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nBella Mari Moisturizing Foundation\n\nBella Mari\u2019s Moisturizing Foundation protects your skin up to SPF 30 with the power of all-natural zinc oxide. It doesn\u2019t have parabens, petroleum products, synthetic preservatives or fragrances, gluten, soy, or even talc. It\u2019s non-comedogenic and vegan, packaged in glass for easy recycling.\n\nThe main ingredients are purified water, candelilla wax, and a host of organics like olive oil, sweet orange oil, bilberry leaf, burdock root, geranium rose oil, and bergamot oil. All that sounds great. What we want to know is whether it\u2019s decent makeup.\n\nUsers say it provides good coverage without feeling greasy or being cakey. It needs to be stirred before use and it feels quite thick so you don\u2019t need much. It has a slight citrus scent. If you want a shine-free appearance, top off with a lightweight powder to set the foundation for all day wear.\n\nThe Organic Face 100% All Natural Organic Luminous Liquid Foundation\n\nIf you have darker-toned skin and are challenged to find foundations in a matching shade, take a look at The Organic Face Luminous Liquid Foundation. Once again, this is an all-natural organic product with no synthetic dyes, fragrances, or preservatives. It\u2019s vegan and gluten-free. The SPF 15 protection comes from zinc, not chemicals.\n\nThe Organic Face says their foundation is buildable, and it brightens tone and makes fine lines disappear without caking or flaking. It contains ingredients like beeswax, jojoba oil, green tea, Vitamin E, thyme, grape seed, golden seal, lavender, and rosemary. If you wish to set the foundation for all day wear or get a matte finish, simply dust powder over the top.\n\nUsers say it provides good coverage, but isn\u2019t ideal for use by persons with very dry skin or in very dry climates.\n\nPowder foundations\n\nPowder foundations may not work for everyone, but these top two picks are quite popular.\n\nBare Escentuals bareMinerals Mineral Foundation MATTE SPF15\n\nWith 18 colors to choose from, the bareMinerals collection of Mineral Foundation doesn\u2019t disappoint. If you want a matte finish that feels light but hides pores and imperfections, test this foundation on your face. It\u2019s so good it\u2019s won awards from Glamour Magazine.\n\nUsers like the fact that it hides freckles but makes their skin look natural. The powder formula keeps oil under control without talc, and provides SPF 15 protection.\n\nVINCENT LONGO Water Canvas Creme-To-Powder Foundation\n\nTake your powder foundation up a level with Vincent Longo\u2019s Water Canvas Cr\u00e8me-to-Powder Foundation. It\u2019s oil-free and very lightweight and breathable, but oddly enough, it actually hydrates skin. It contains an ingredient called microwater as well as seaweed extract. It comes in 16 colors.\n\nUsers say it won\u2019t hide scars, but it does smooth over small imperfections and discolorations and it gives a dewy glow to any age skin.\n\nFor a flawless finish, airbrush it\n\nSeriously, this is how people on TV look so good in UltraHD resolution. Their makeup is spray-painted on their faces and necks.\n\nSEPHORA COLLECTION Perfection Mist Airbrush Foundation\n\nOur last foundation is an airbrush formula from Sephora that doesn\u2019t require an airgun to apply it. It comes in a spray can. Because it\u2019s an airbrush formula that needs to come out very light and thin, it does have some no-no ingredients like butane that aren\u2019t best for sensitive skin. But we couldn\u2019t resist sharing it because you can try it without buying into the whole airbrush setup.\n\nUsers say the coverage looks matte and feels very light when applied. It lasts for hours without melting or fading. On the bright side, if you\u2019ve reacted badly to brushes or sponges in the past, you won\u2019t need those tools to apply this foundation.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe hope that our review of the best foundations for sensitive skin helped you find the perfect makeup for your complexion.
