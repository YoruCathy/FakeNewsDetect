He could\u2019ve said, you know, \u2018This was a beautiful relationship. I learned a lot, but we\u2019re going our separate ways.\u2019 Or he could say what he did say,\u201d says Brie. \u201cYou could see in his face that it was hard that that was brought up.\u201d\n\nDespite John\u2019s public plea, Nikki still isn\u2019t ready to get back together.\n\n\u201cBut I love him so much,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard. I just wanna be a mom.\u201d\n\nNikki, 34, and Cena, 41, called off their wedding in April after six years together but were spotted out together in May. PEOPLE confirmed earlier this month that they are officially back together.\n\nThe pro wrestlers had been open about their desire to reconcile, with the Total Bellas star previously telling PEOPLE that she\u2019d been in \u201ccommunication\u201d with her ex.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Nikki Bella Believes John Cena Has \u2018100%\u2019 Changed His Stance On Not Having Kids\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically back together,\u201d a source close to the situation told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cThey never stopped talking. Other than the actual wedding weekend, when they took some space, they have been talking.\u201d\n\nSources had previously said that Nikki\u2019s decision to call it quits was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids: She wanted a family, but Cena was hesitant.\n\n\u201cThis was never really about ending their relationship \u2014 it was about calling off a wedding because something didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d an insider said. \u201cIt was a wedding that was entered into under false pretenses. She was pretending she was okay with not having a kid, he was pretending he absolutely couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t budge on that point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey both got a wake-up call once they canceled the wedding,\u201d added the insider. \u201cAnd they both realized they could fix what was broken.\u201d\n\nTotal Bellas airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1539&h=806&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fjohn-cena4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fjohn-cena1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1539&h=806&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Fjohn-cena4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-confused-john-cena-today-show/", "title": "Nikki Bella Is Left Feeling 'Confused' After Watching John Cena's Emotional Today Show Interview", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,John Cena,News,Nikki Bella,TV", "news_keywords": "Couples,John Cena,News,Nikki Bella,TV", "description": "Nikki Bella is left with mixed feelings after John Cena gives an emotional interview on the Today show", "og": {"title": "Nikki Bella Is Left Feeling 'Confused' After Watching John Cena's Emotional Today Show Interview", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-confused-john-cena-today-show/", "description": "John Cena is pleading for Nikki Bella\u2018s love on national television.
