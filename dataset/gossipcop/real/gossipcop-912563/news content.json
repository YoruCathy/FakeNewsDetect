One contestant from Japan is already getting attention from international fans, producers, and other contestants. Yuki from The Bachelor Winter Games is a spunky woman that Bachelor Nation really should be keeping their eye on as the season progresses.\n\nAt 21 years old, Yuki Kimura from Tokyo, Japan, is one of the youngest contestants on the new spinoff series, per US Weekly. Despite being so young, this isn\u2019t her first rodeo. She first appeared in Season 1 of The Bachelor Japan. In that series, she was one of 25 women competing for the heart of Hirotake Kubo, a 35-year-old entrepreneur. However, it was not meant to be with him, and now, she\u2019s appearing on The Bachelor Winter Games, still looking for love.\n\nWinter Games is set to be slightly different than other Bachelor series shows \u2014 not only because it\u2019s the first to incorporate contestants who have appeared in other countries\u2019 versions of The Bachelor, but also because of the way the competition will work. Along with trying to make love connections, contestants like Yuki will also be going \u201chead-to-head in winter-themed challenges,\u201d according to the show\u2019s official website.\n\nBachelor Nation on ABC on YouTube\n\nIn her Winter Games introduction video on YouTube, Yuki reveals that despite coming onto this American show, she doesn\u2019t know much English. In fact, she lists the amount of phrases she knows on one hand: \u201cThank you. Okay. Hello. I love you. Will you marry me?\u201d Living in a house with Bachelor alums from all over the world ought to add a lot more phrases to her oeuvre.\n\nThe show\u2019s executive producer Bennett Graebner says that language won't not be an issue at all, and not just because she will have a translator. \u201cYuki is incredible. She speaks very little English, but she just lights up and it almost didn't matter that there was this language barrier with her,\u201d he said to E! News. \u201cEveryone responded to her, those of [us] working on the show and the men and women who were there on the show. Everyone just loved her. She is just a sweetheart of a young woman and a very open and emotional one.\u201d\n\nGraebner isn\u2019t the only one truly excited about Yuki\u2019s inclusion. The Bachelor host Chris Harrison thinks that there is something special about Yuki appearing this season. \u201cThere is one star that will take over America and become maybe, the biggest star in the world and her name is Yuki,\u201d he said in a phone call with Hollywood Life. He added that she\u2019s, \u201cso compelling, she\u2019s so sweet, she\u2019s so funny.\u201d\n\nBachelor Nation on ABC on YouTube\n\nHowever, Yuki may end up single after appearing on Winter Games. There is already talk about including her in future Bachelor projects. In speaking to The New York Times, the creator and an executive producer of the Bachelor shows said he\u2019d love for Yuki to be involved in more shows. \u201cThe international cast members are more unfiltered than the Americans tend to be now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to bring Yuki back for Paradise.\u201d Apparently, she would be open to it too, confirming as much in an email to The Times. \u201cI want to marry a man I meet on The Bachelor,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil that day comes, I will keep being on The Bachelor [shows].\u201d\n\nYuki is certainly capturing the hearts of many through her romantic journey. There is no doubt she will continue gain interest from fans in Japan, producers on the show, and undoubtedly, viewers from the U.S. when the show premieres on Feb. 13.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/14/3320ea12-f35a-4f09-a1e8-3f26a77ed39a-getty-1206496569.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/2/12/3fc2c940-9d85-4014-b17b-a0293631935c-148310_0362_r1.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/14/09b0f102-16c3-4c00-b942-0728fc2f091f-getty-1158663894.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/2/12/3fc2c940-9d85-4014-b17b-a0293631935c-148310_0362_r1.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/3/20/c328eadf-9ae0-4257-99eb-e601f708c458-getty-916296824.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/9/dbe575a0-757f-431a-b1ff-26cca1927f4d-getty-1187976985.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/2/12/3fc2c940-9d85-4014-b17b-a0293631935c-148310_0362_r1.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/whos-yuki-from-bachelor-winter-games-the-japanese-hopeful-is-one-to-watch-8194770", "title": "Who\u2019s Yuki From \u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019?
