Candice Bergen will reprise her role as Murphy Brown, and the series will be produced by the original creator, Diane English, and original producers.\n\nMurphy Brown originally ran from 1988 to 1998 and starred Bergen as the \"sarcastic, ambitious, often self-involved and bossy but dedicated and ethical\" famous investigative journalist and news anchor. The show was critically acclaimed and occasionally controversial in its portrayal of a single working mother.", "images": ["https://dailynews.news/public/img/logodailynes.png", "https://dailynews.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_600x600-180124134512-600-murphy-brown-3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://dailynews.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_600x600-180124134512-600-murphy-brown-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://dailynews.news/murphy-brown-revival-is-happening-at-cbs-for-30th-anniversary", "title": "Murphy Brown Revival Is Happening at CBS For 30th Anniversary \u25b7DailyNews", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"url": "https://dailynews.news/murphy-brown-revival-is-happening-at-cbs-for-30th-anniversary", "type": "website", "title": "Murphy Brown Revival Is Happening at CBS For 30th Anniversary \u25b7DailyNews", "description": "Murphy Brown Revival Is Happening at CBS For 30th Anniversary \u25b7DailyNews", "image": "https://dailynews.news/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rs_600x600-180124134512-600-murphy-brown-3.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://dailynews.news", "summary": ""}
