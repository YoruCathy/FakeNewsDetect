That fear and the drop in your stomach? My diaphragm seizes up. Then I have a hard time breathing, and my whole body goes into a spasm. And I begin to cry. That\u2019s what it feels like for trauma victims every day, and it\u2019s\u2026 miserable. I always say that trauma has a brain. And it works its way into everything that you do.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year old singer said it took years for her to open up about the sexual assault.\n\n\u201cNo one else knew. It was almost like I tried to erase it from my brain. And when it finally came out, it was like a big, ugly monster. And you have to face the monster to heal,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was lying to the world because I was feeling so much pain but nobody knew. So that\u2019s why I came out and said that I have PTSD, because I don\u2019t want to hide \u2014 any more than I already have to.\u201d\n\nIn addition to fibromyalgia and PTSD, Lady Gaga also lives with synovitis, a chronic inflammation in her hip caused by overuse and injury. Like many pain sufferers, the singer has tried a variety of different treatments to ease her discomfort \u2013 from massage to hot saunas to Epsom salt baths. In 2016, she posted on Instagram an image of herself sitting in a sauna wrapped in an emergency blanket.\n\nLady Gaga\u2019s battle with chronic pain is only a small part of her interview with Vogue. She\u2019s helping to promote A Star is Born \u2013 her new film with Brad Cooper that premiers next month.", "images": ["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/1564851422418-IFIGLFC6WKYWK1HXTBPI/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEkKH1a86e3CJsY6tV-xGZtZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEgy3ycKkr2Kq99c8oDNxHtBQroFE4WgKcQrq_Pdh_-A6QvevUbj177dmcMs1F0H-0/paypal+donate.png", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/1536681203743-08M1O6AV80M4V5Z2WY72/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kIj5Fn_rqWuadNFXavCKpnNZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpzOBBMuA5z3mnJgPLI429YfS8bceBmNwyvoe4_ODV-kqvzuoknk6giQvq6_hXZYhbY/09-lady-gaga-vogue-cover-october-2018.jpg", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/1586272690560-WVVDMX5DK0SXO98IOXKQ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDI3bUhc9rm0nS4oF-asonRZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWEtT5uBSRWt4vQZAgTJucoTqqXjS3CfNDSuuf31e0tVEL672QucMQZKQYsphDJG7aNn4gV0V5zrj5cWh5UkQlQjqWIIaSPh2v08GbKqpiV54/survey3.png", "https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/1564851437139-AH3PUTIBGX59I4PJICZU/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kA-qNyztq3PmZ7HfT4bUk-blfiSMXz2YNBs8ylwAJx2qLijIv1YpVq4N1RMuCCrb3iJz4vYg48fcPCuGX417dnbkMCanwyRNaYGqPuiGnEPOV6KD-bK1U_oFD6JrawBnxzFvbuqF0GUInBxxtVhBOn4/.jpg", "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/54de4dcae4b05ae6225b992c/5b97e48f8a922d713262f2a6/1536685894050/09-lady-gaga-vogue-cover-october-2018.jpg?format=1500w", "https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/t/5d45c097b176780001ff29c4/1587181553302/?format=1500w"], "top_img": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/54d50ceee4b05797b34869cf/54de4dcae4b05ae6225b992c/5b97e48f8a922d713262f2a6/1536685894050/09-lady-gaga-vogue-cover-october-2018.jpg?format=1500w", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pat Anson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2018/9/11/lady-gaga-chronic-pain-is-no-joke", "title": "Lady Gaga: \u2018Chronic Pain Is No Joke\u2019 \u2014 Pain News Network", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Pain News Network", "title": "Lady Gaga: \u2018Chronic Pain Is No Joke\u2019 \u2014 Pain News Network", "latitude": "36.778261", "longitude": "-119.41793239999998", "url": "https://www.painnewsnetwork.org/stories/2018/9/11/lady-gaga-chronic-pain-is-no-joke", "type": "article", "description": "By Pat Anson, PNN Editor  One of the few celebrities brave enough to speak openly about their battle with chronic pain is talking about it again \u2013 in a fashion magazine.  \"Chronic pain is no joke.
