Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It\u2019s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.\u201d\n\nThe late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer \u201cpinches me on the ass a lot.\u201d A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer\u2019s firing.\n\nCouric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC\u2019s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.\n\nImage zoom NBC/Getty\n\nLauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a \u201cdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d with reason to believe \u201cthis may not have been an isolated incident.\u201d Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.\n\nFollowing his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d he said, in part. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\u201d\n\nAlthough her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer\u2019s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.\n\nIn a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I\u2019m ready to. Thanks for your interest.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time\u2019s Up Movement\n\nThe claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men \u2014 including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp \u2014 have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.\n\nThe movement inspired the new Time\u2019s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time\u2019s Up was a major focus at this year\u2019s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.\n\n\u201cI think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,\u201d Couric tells PEOPLE about Time\u2019s Up. \u201cClearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.\u201d\n\nShe also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.\n\n\u201cOne of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,\u201d she says. \u201cI just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today\u2019s New Anchor Team\n\nAs for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast \u2014 and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we\u2019re \u2018dropping\u2019 episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019m still happily married (after three years!) and I\u2019m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,\u201d she continues. \u201cHis are pretty lame so far. I\u2019m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie\u2019s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I\u2019ll be able to announce soon. I\u2019m addicted to work!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1904&h=997&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatie-couric-matt-lauer-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2Fkatie-couric-matt-lauer-thanksgiving-day-parade-vintage.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1904&h=997&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatie-couric-matt-lauer-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone", "Kate Coyne"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/katie-couric-matt-lauer-firing-opens-up-interview/", "title": "Katie Couric Opens Up About Matt Lauer's Firing from the Today Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Exclusive,Katie Couric,Matt Lauer,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,Katie Couric,Matt Lauer,News,TV", "description": "Katie Couric is opening up about Matt Lauer's shocking firing from the Today show", "og": {"title": "Katie Couric Opens Up About Matt Lauer's Firing from the Today Show", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/katie-couric-matt-lauer-firing-opens-up-interview/", "description": "More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1904&h=997&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatie-couric-matt-lauer-2000.jpg", "width": 1904, "height": 997}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/katie-couric-matt-lauer-firing-opens-up-interview/", "description": "Katie Couric is opening up about Matt Lauer's shocking firing from the Today show", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatie-couric-matt-lauer-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/katie-couric-matt-lauer-firing-opens-up-interview/", "title": "Katie Couric Opens Up About Matt Lauer's Firing from the Today Show", "description": "Katie Couric is opening up about Matt Lauer's shocking firing from the Today show", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1904&h=997&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fkatie-couric-matt-lauer-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
