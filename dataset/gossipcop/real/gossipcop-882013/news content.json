The Teen Mom 2 rumor mill has been busier than usual this week ever since Kail posted (and deleted) a Snapchat photo in which she\u2019s kissing her gay best friend, Rebecca Hayter, on the lips. PHOTOS: Kailyn And Her Rumored Gal Pal Certainly Aren\u2019t Denying Those Rumors\n\n\n\nNow the internet is convinced they\u2019re a couple... even blaming Becky for causing a rift in her marriage to Javi Marroquin!\n\n\n\nBut the mom of two is not about these rumors, debunking them on social media with one straight-to-the-point tweet:\n\nI didn't leave javi for anyone though Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) June 9, 2016\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t leave Javi for anyone though,\u201d Kail wrote to her 1.1 million followers. Sorry, Becky Hayter haters...she didn\u2019t break these two up!

PHOTOS: Both Kailyn and Javi Share Pictures With Other Women! \"If you\u2019re not going to change your mind I'll always resent you and I won\u2019t be happy with my life because I wanted more kids,\u201d Javi tells his wife via Facetime in the super emotional ep. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that to you, I don\u2019t want to do that to the kids. I don\u2019t think I can change my mind.\u201d\n\nCredit: MTV\n\nAnd since their separation \u2014 which reportedly happened in December \u2014 both of Lincoln\u2019s parents seem to be getting on with their separate lives. Javi is still deployed overseas with the Air Force, and Kailyn is at home with her two boys and finishing up her final semesters at Delaware State University.", "images": ["http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/26152787_1896505867329996_8668809372878503936_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kailyn-lowry-rebecca-hayter-photos-640x480-1465484256.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery-pregnant-320x223-1511803275.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21149338_757212517791923_6938295666963644416_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-519451536-320x223-1495779173.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/wetpaint.svg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kailyn-lowry-rebecca-hayter-photos-750x522-1465484278.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/loading.gif", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/kailyn-javi-teen-mom-2-season-7-finale.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nick-carter-sexual-assault-320x223-1509372738.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21041889_254812198371809_8175695720834138112_n-320x223.jpg"], "top_img": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "http://wetpaint.com/kailyn-lowry-cheated-javi-marroquin-rumors-1499084/", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Sets The Record Straight: \u201cI Didn\u2019t Leave Javi For Anyone\u201d", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Did Kailyn Lowry leave her husband Javi Marroquin for a woman?!
