Just after midnight, I was at home watching Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve With Ryan Seacrest, still smarting from Ohio State\u2019s brutal loss to Clemson in the College Football Playoff, when onto my screen bounded Mariah Carey, apropos of nothing. Carey wasn\u2019t promoting new music \u2014 her most recent album, the fabulously named Me. I Am Mariah\u2026 The Elusive Chanteuse, was more than two years old at the time \u2014 but she\u2019d agreed to perform after the ball dropped to usher in 2017 on a literal high note.\n\nAnd then it happened: one of the most talented singers to ever cut a record suffered the most talked-about televised lip-syncing snafu since Ashlee Simpson.\n\nBeing a professional blogger, my first instinct was to document this debacle at stereogum dot com, and that\u2019s exactly what I did. Twitter users performed their customary roasting. We all had a good laugh at Carey\u2019s expense. And to her credit, rather than retreating into a bomb shelter, Carey laughed right along with us. By 2AM, she had tweeted a non-apology replete with emojis and the GIF equivalent of \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af: \u201cShit happens \ud83d\ude29 Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!\ud83c\udf89 Here's to making more headlines in 2017 \ud83d\ude02.\u201d\n\nShit happens \ud83d\ude29 Have a happy and healthy new year everybody!\ud83c\udf89 Here's to making more headlines in 2017 \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/0Td8se57jr \u2014 Mariah Carey (@MariahCarey) January 1, 2017\n\nCarey didn\u2019t take many Ls early on, but by now she\u2019s used to shrugging off her failures. Most famously, when her powerhouse \u201990s run ended post-Y2K, she found a way to bounce back triumphantly. Although \u201cLoverboy\u201d from her musical rom-com Glitter went all the way to #2 and went on to become 2001\u2019s bestselling single, Carey suffered an emotional breakdown during the project\u2019s promotion, delaying its release. Both the film and its soundtrack flopped. (Bizarrely, Carey\u2019s fans conspired to send the album to #1 on iTunes this week in a display of #JusticeForGlitter.) Glitter\u2019s 2002 follow-up Charmbracelet failed to generate a real hit, and although it eventually went Platinum, this was a boom time for the industry when Napster hadn\u2019t yet destroyed sales and the likes of Britney Spears, Eminem, and N \u2018Sync were going Diamond on the regular.\n\nCarey seemed to have been fully supplanted by a wave of younger, TRL-minted celebrities. Yet she proved reports of her career\u2019s death to be premature by returning to glory with the 6x Platinum The Emancipation Of Mimi, the biggest album of 2005, and its 14-week #1 hit \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d one of the most dominant singles in music history. The album also generated a second #1 hit in \u201cDon\u2019t Forget About Us\u201d plus \u201cShake It Off,\u201d which made it to #2 behind \u201cWe Belong Together\u201d (and, later, Kanye West\u2019s \u201cGold Digger\u201d). Pop\u2019s reigning diva was officially back.\n\nIn the 13 years since, Carey has never approached the splendor of her Mimi era. She did make it back to #1 for the 18th(!) time with \u201cTouch My Body,\u201d the lead single from 2008\u2019s E=MC\u00b2. But it\u2019s been a full decade since the former queen of the charts has sniffed that kind of success. She now goes four or five years between albums, sometimes because her release dates get pushed back when the singles she releases to drum up attention don\u2019t take off. In recent years she\u2019s been more famous as an American Idol judge and a subject of tabloid gossip than a recording artist. There\u2019s no denying her status as a legacy act; on New Year\u2019s Eve, she was there to sing her classics. Yet when the albums do come out, they remain quietly stunning collections of pop-R&B. And tomorrow she\u2019s about to release another one.\n\nCaution, Carey\u2019s first album since that New Year\u2019s mishap, has yet to generate a hit unless you count \u201cWith You\u201d reaching #11 on the Adult Contemporary chart and failing to crack the Hot 100 \u2014 which, in the context of this woman\u2019s statistically extraordinary career, absolutely should not count. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from checking it out if you\u2019ve ever enjoyed a Mariah Carey song in your life. Like Elusive Chanteuse, this latest collection contains ample delights \u2014 and this time they aren\u2019t even stranded on a bloated 15-song tracklist (18 if you\u2019re streaming Chanteuse deluxe). Instead, Caution clocks in at an eminently reasonable 10 tracks in 38 minutes, prioritizing quality over quantity.\n\nThe album eases you in with some immaculate slow jams, a vibe that prevails throughout. First comes the dreamy, computerized \u201cGTFO.\u201d Produced by Drake favorite Nineteen85, it turns Aubrey\u2019s favored post-midnight desolation into a powerful diorama of love falling apart. When Carey declares, in a measured cadence that descends into an emotive flurry, \u201cHow bout you get the fuck out?\u201d you feel the sting. That\u2019s followed by \u201cWith You,\u201d a different sort of ballad: warm, organic, built from little more than gospel piano and booming 808s. When she leans into the hook, \u201cDamn, I fucks with you,\u201d you feel that too.\n\n\u201cCaution\u201d is less noteworthy, a slow-creeping Destiny\u2019s Child throwback that feels more like a deep cut than a title track given spotlight placement on the tracklist. Fortunately the serviceable \u201cA No No\u201d comes along next to pick up the pace with skittering hi-hats and staccato keyboard stabs. Produced by Skrillex, Poo Bear, and Lido, the steamy romance anthem \u201cThe Distance\u201d is even better: sampled cheerleader chants, funky digital bass, the ubiquitous Ty Dolla $ign? Sign me up. And the minor-key bump-and-grind \u201cGiving Me Life,\u201d which features backing vocals from Blood Orange(!) and a guest verse from Slick Rick(!!), lives up to its name every time.\n\nMost of the rest is unremarkable: The sex swoon \u201cOne Mo\u2019 Gen\u201d and attempted piano tearjerker \u201cPortrait\u201d belonged on the trash heap, while the casually booming Gunna collab \u201cStay Long Love You\u201d is a mildly enjoyable trip to Carey\u2019s wheelhouse. But at least stick around to marvel at the Timbaland-produced \u201c8th Grade,\u201d which successfully weaves trap drum programming and Migos triplets into the sound of a luxuriant R&B ballad from Carey\u2019s \u201990s heyday. It\u2019s one more low-key pleasure on an album full of them.\n\nLook: Carey isn\u2019t what she used to be. Time has reined in that gargantuan vocal range. Her songs are no longer seasoned with those preposterously high whistle vocals that used to be her trademark. No Carey song since the George W. Bush administration has generated as much pop-cultural noise as her divorce from Nick Cannon and subsequent dating life, her cataclysmic feud with fellow Idol judge Nicki Minaj, or the reemergence of her iconic J-Lo putdown \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d as one of the most merciless GIFs on the internet. The outrageous persona once glimpsed in her legendary episode of MTV Cribs now completely outshines her musical output.\n\nCarey doesn\u2019t even appear to be aiming for her old blockbuster status anymore, given that Caution is more of a grown-and-sexy R&B album that fully concedes her former role as queen of the hip-hop-adjacent divas to her longtime enemy/Mini Me Ariana Grande. On the other hand, the album doesn\u2019t venture all that far from Carey\u2019s old comfort zone. Give or take an F-bomb or hypermodern collaborator, quite a few of its songs are easy to imagine as smash hits from 1996, which suggests the music industry has changed far more than Mariah Carey has.\n\nIn the age of infinite stimulation, controlled simmers like \u201cGTFO\u201d and \u201cGiving Me Life\u201d are never going to grab people\u2019s attention like a good, old-fashioned public embarrassment. Carey surely knows this, and she\u2019s more than capable of thriving in a celebrity economy that runs on endless drama. What Caution suggests is that she remains just as adept at making records whether the world is listening or not. In its own way, the album is as much of an act of stubborn defiance as her \u201cshit happens\u201d tweet.\n\nMaybe no one will remember this album a few months from now. Chances are most people have also forgotten what went down the night we rang in 2017. The fact is, almost everything disappears into the past \u2014 triumphs, embarrassments, and all. For most singers, that merciless march forward would have subsumed their entire careers by now. How many artists who were popping in 1990 are still going? All things must pass, but the world hasn\u2019t yet forgotten Mariah Carey, and Mariah Carey surely hasn\u2019t forgotten how to sing a song. Cackle all you want; anyone releasing an album this good three decades into her career is having the last laugh.\n\nCREDIT: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia\n\nCHART WATCH\n\nAriana Grande has her first #1 hit. Grande\u2019s remarkable \u201cthank u, next\u201d enters the Hot 100 at #1 this week, ending a seven-week run by Maroon 5 and Cardi B\u2019s \u201cGirls Like You.\u201d It\u2019s Grande\u2019s 11th top 10 hit, the first song by a woman to debut at #1 since Adele\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d three years ago, and the only song by a female artist to hit #1 this year without a male artist also on the track \u2014 previously we\u2019ve seen Ed Sheeran and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cPerfect Duet,\u201d Camila Cabello and Young Thug\u2019s \u201cHavana,\u201d Cardi B, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin\u2019s \u201cI Like It,\u201d and the aforementioned \u201cGirls Like You\u201d by Maroon 5 and Cardi.\n\nMore trivia: Grande becomes the first artist to debut the lead single from her first five albums in the top 10. The others: \u201cNo Tears Left To Cry\u201d from Sweetener earlier this year, Dangerous Woman\u2019s title track in 2016, My Everything\u2019s \u201cProblem\u201d featuring Iggy Azalea in 2014, and \u201cThe Way\u201d featuring Mac Miller from her debut Yours Truly in 2013.\n\n\u201cGirls Like You\u201d is now #2, with Travis Scott and Drake\u2019s \u201cSicko Mode,\u201d Marshmello and Bastille\u2019s \u201cHappier,\u201d and Juice WRLD\u2019s \u201cLucid Dreams\u201d bumped to #3, #4, and #5 respectively. Halsey\u2019s \u201cWithout Me\u201d rises to a new #6 peak, followed by Post Malone\u2019s \u201cBetter Now\u201d at #7 and Kodak Black/Offset/Travis Scott\u2019s \u201cZeze\u201d at #8. Sheck Wes reaches a new #9 high, and Lil Baby and Gunna\u2019s \u201cDrip Too Hard\u201d rounds out the top 10.\n\nOver on the Billboard 200, Metro Boomin scores his first #1 album with 99,000 equivalent album units for his star-studded Not All Heroes Wear Capes, 92,000 of them via streaming. It\u2019s the third top 10 release to have the producer\u2019s name attached as an artist following his Big Sean collab Double Or Nothing and Without Warning alongside Offset and 21 Savage, though he of course contributed heavily to major releases like Future\u2019s DS2.\n\nAfter the extremely resilient A Star Is Born soundtrack at #2 comes another soundtrack, Bohemian Rhapsody, up from #25 to #3 with 59,000 units / 24,000 sales now that the Queen biopic has made its theatrical debut. It\u2019s the highest charting Queen album in 38 years, since The Game spent five weeks at #1 in 1980, Billboard reports. Also in the top 10 at #9 with 39,000 units is Queen\u2019s Greatest Hits I II & III: The Platinum Collection.\n\nTakeoff of Migos enters at #4 with 49,000 units for his debut solo album The Last Rocket, which means all three Migos now have landed solo albums in the top five (if you\u2019re counting Offset\u2019s Without Warning alongside 21 Savage and Metro Boomin, which Billboard is, even though that\u2019s not really a solo album\u2026 anyhow, Offset\u2019s got an actual solo LP coming in December, so this will probably be a moot point shortly). The rest of the top 10 comprises the usual suspects: Drake, Lil Wayne, Lil Baby and Gunna, Travis Scott, and Post Malone.\n\nPOP FIVE\n\nZayn & Nicki Minaj \u2013 \u201cNo Candle, No Light\u201d\n\nAnd to think I used to really enjoy both of these artists!\n\nDido \u2013 \u201cHurricanes\u201d\n\nThe first new Dido song in five years is a brooding trip-hop epic that\u2019s making me wonder why I\u2019ve never spent any time with her discography beyond \u201cThank You.\u201d It\u2019s called \u201cHurricanes,\u201d but this shit sounds like winter setting in and I am here for it.\n\nAlessia Cara \u2013 \u201cNot Today\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Today\u201d is such a pleasant-sounding soul-pop ditty that you might not realize what kind of real talk Alessia Cara is spitting: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what sadness means/ \u2018Til you\u2019re too sad to fall asleep/ One day I\u2019ll be snoozing peacefully/ But surely not today.\u201d It\u2019s exciting to see stars like Cara and Shawn Mendes being so real about their struggles with depression.\n\nNormani & 6LACK \u2013 \u201cWaves\u201d\n\nNormani is going places!
