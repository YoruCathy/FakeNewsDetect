Hulu just announced they're bringing back the show \"Animaniacs\" for two new seasons. The first episodes will air in 2020. It originally ran from 1993 to 1998 on Fox Kids and The WB Network. So it's been off the air for 20 years. Steven Spielberg was involved with the original version, and he'll be executive producing this time as well.\n\nPinky and the Brain were on the show before they got their own spinoff, and they'll be on the new version too.\n\nHulu also got the rights to all the OLD \"Animaniacs\" episodes, plus \"Pinky and the Brain\" and \"Tiny Toon Adventures\". You can stream all those episodes right now.", "images": ["http://www.iheartradio.ca/image/policy:1.3536138:1548368846/animaniacs.jpg?f=default&$p$f=5751475", "http://www.iheartradio.ca/img/common/ph-16x9.gif", "http://www.iheartradio.ca/logger/p.gif?a=1.3536132&d=/2.4828/2.5396/2.6896&template=base.StandardArticle", "http://www.iheartradio.ca/img/common/ph-1x1.gif", "http://www.iheartradio.ca/image/policy:1.3536138:1548368846/animaniacs.jpg?a=16%3A9&w=1000&$p$a$w=1fa66ce"], "top_img": "http://www.iheartradio.ca/image/policy:1.3536138:1548368846/animaniacs.jpg?a=16%3A9&w=1000&$p$a$w=1fa66ce", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bell M\u00e9dia", "Mark Mckenzie"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheartradio.ca/89x/blogs/animaniacs-is-returning-with-new-episodes-1.3536132", "title": "Animaniacs Is Returning With NEW Episodes!", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Animaniacs Is Returning With NEW Episodes!", "description": "Yakko, Wakko, and Dot are coming back w/ their friends", "image": "http://www.iheartradio.ca/image/policy:1.3536138:1548368846/animaniacs.jpg?a=16%3A9&w=1000&$p$a$w=1fa66ce", "sitename": "iHeartRadio", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.iheartradio.ca/89x/blogs/animaniacs-is-returning-with-new-episodes-1.3536132"}, "description": "Yakko, Wakko, and Dot are coming back w/ their friends", "fb": {"pages": 428221510004, "app_id": 651205258366355}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "author": "Bell M\u00e9dia", "locale": "en", "brand-id": "radio-89xradio", "station-id": "89xradio", "site-name": "Radio.d", "ajax-timeout": 6000, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=290638154"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ddm1nLyWQqo"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.iheartradio.ca", "summary": ""}
