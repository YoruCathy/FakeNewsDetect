I just moved the plane up and I think she\u2019s in labor,\u201d says Jenner, 62. \u201cI knew we should have gone last night. I knew it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d asks Kim Kardashian West, 38, who had originally wanted to stay in L.A. for a few days so she could attend her 20-year high school reunion.\n\n\u201cNo, you come in a couple of days,\u201d Jenner says. \u201cI\u2019m going, I\u2019m bringing the doctor. The only thing that frightens me is that she\u2019s going to have this baby before I get there. And then she\u2019s giving birth alone.\u201d\n\nJenner rushes out of the room and Kim calls Khlo\u00e9, 34, who asks whether her contractions should \u201cfeel like period cramps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey keep going from different times so I don\u2019t understand if I\u2019m feeling them,\u201d she says. \u201cOne was at 9:43, one was at 8:21, one was at 10-something.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to run and get my bag and I\u2019m going to come with Mom,\u201d Kim insists.\n\n\u201cYou know, when there\u2019s something crazy that goes on in our family, we just always drop everything that we\u2019re doing and go be supportive to them,\u201d she explains. \u201cI obviously wanted to go to my reunion and I wanted to make both work, but since my reunion is in two days, it\u2019s like, game over \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to go to Cleveland and be there for her.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khlo\u00e9 Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal\n\nKhlo\u00e9 welcomed her first child, daughter True, with boyfriend Tristan Thompson on April 12, just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.\n\nWhile calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest this summer, Kim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.\n\n\u201cSometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was more maybe when Khlo\u00e9 wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do.
