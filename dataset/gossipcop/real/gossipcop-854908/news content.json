One is a former emergency room nurse, the other a longtime elementary school teacher.\n\nThey make notes on coffee filters instead of index cards and wear clam diggers and sensible sneakers.\n\nBut thanks in part to the amateur sleuth work of Gemma Hoskins and Abbie Schaub, the 47-year-old unsolved murder of a young Catholic nun is gaining national attention. Earlier this year the Baltimore County Police Department conducted DNA tests on the exhumed body of a priest in relation to the case. And now, with the debut last Friday of Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Keepers,\u201d the seven-part docu-series in which the two are central figures, Hoskins and Schaub are being treated like Cagney and Lacey.\n\nThe two were classmates at Archbishop Keough High School in the 1960s, where Sister Cathy Cesnik served as their teacher. But the nun disappeared suddenly on Nov. 7, 1969, after driving to a local shopping center to buy some Muhly\u2019s dinner rolls, cash a paycheck and purchase an engagement gift for her sister. She never returned home, and her car was found directly across the street from where she lived, parked haphazardly, the rear jutting out into the road. The tires were caked with mud, and a twig hung from the steering wheel. The Muhly\u2019s bag was still inside the vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe driveway across from Sister Cathy Cesnik\u2019s apartment where her car was found abandoned. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times)\n\nCesnik\u2019s body wasn\u2019t discovered until Jan. 3, 1970, abandoned in a snowy, wooded area just a few miles from where she lived.\n\nHer death remained a sad, murky mystery until Hoskins got a call from a former Baltimore Sun reporter searching for anyone who had been a student of Cesnik\u2019s.\n\nHoskins, wanting to help reporter Tom Nugent figure out who had hurt Cesnik, posted a message to a Facebook page for Keough High alumni, but was berated for muddying up a space usually filled with birth and anniversary announcements with such an unpleasant topic. One person, however, came to Hoskins\u2019 defense: Schaub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the two started a new Facebook group, this one seeking justice for Cesnik.\n\nAmateur sleuths\n\nHoskins has always liked true-crime stories; she\u2019s watched \u201cDateline\u201d and \u201c20/20\u201d every Friday night for years. But it wasn\u2019t until this mystery turned up in her own backyard that she realized just how adept she was at detective work.\n\nThe grave site of Father Joseph Maskell shortly after his body was exhumed on Feb. 28, 2017. (John Benam)\n\nFollowing tips often submitted through the Facebook page, Hoskins and Schaub began seriously investigating Cesnik\u2019s death, which led to the theory explored in \u201cThe Keepers\u201d that the teacher was killed after students confided in her about sexual abuse taking place at Keough. Numerous subjects interviewed by Hoskins and Schaub say they were molested by Father Joseph Maskell, who served as the school\u2019s chaplain, counselor and religion teacher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe two made a good team: Schaub, the retired nurse, had a knack for research. Through Google, she learned how to access public records, digging up old court documents, sifting through microfilm and even filing Freedom of Information Act requests. She kept all of her findings in organized spreadsheets and file folders, some days working for up to 10 hours on the investigation.\n\nHoskins, meanwhile, preferred to do the face-to-face work. If a new Maskell survivor popped up, she\u2019d be the one to go and conduct the interview. She wasn\u2019t afraid of knocking on doors or flirting to get information.\n\nGemma Hoskins sits on her patio with her dog, Teddy. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cGemma and I are opposite souls,\u201d explains Schaub, 65, who was on a vacation in West Virginia the week before the release of \u201cThe Keepers.\u201d \u201cShe is outgoing, confident and knows everybody in the community. I am far more of an introvert. I am keen to find substantive, hard facts. I want to see a paper trail. I don\u2019t really like cold-calling people. So her strengths are my weaknesses.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirector Ryan White, who began work on the series after the release of his and Ben Cotner\u2019s 2014 documentary, \u201cThe Case Against 8,\u201d immediately saw cinematic potential in the pair. But it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing. Often he and Hoskins would butt heads. She jokes that she told White she was quitting the project about a dozen times.\n\n\u201cWe always knew Gemma would come back, so I never took her seriously,\u201d he says with a laugh as he rides inside a car making its way through Baltimore\u2019s suburbs.

I was raised with values by my mom in that church. It\u2019s been very disappointing.\u201d\n\nSchaub feels the same way. For one, she\u2019s been disheartened to learn how difficult it is to get information from public sources. She recently put her daughter\u2019s name on an outstanding FOIA request in case she dies before the government gets back to her. And talking to scores of sexual abuse victims has taken a toll.\n\nIt\u2019s been worrisome. I\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep. It\u2019s a very strange twist of life, but something in me says I have a duty and obligation to see this through. Abbie Schaub\n\n\u201cI have always struggled whether or not it was a good thing to open this Pandora\u2019s box of pain and misery and memories, because I have been concerned that reopening this might be more emotional pain and someone might hurt themselves and the outcome would be a bad one,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt\u2019s been stressful. It\u2019s been worrisome. I\u2019ve lost a lot of sleep. It\u2019s a very strange twist of life, but something in me says I have a duty and obligation to see this through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnearthing the past\n\nHoskins\u2019 journey began with the motivation to find justice for Cesnik, but grew into a quest to expose long-buried secrets of sexual abuse by Father Maskell against some of her fellow Keough classmates.\n\nShe had no idea about the molestation allegations until two anonymous women \u2014 Jane Doe and Jane Roe \u2014 filed a $40-million civil lawsuit against Maskell in 1994. The case was thrown out because the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nAt school, Hoskins had never had much interaction with Maskell. She thought he was just a nerdy priest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe reminds me of \u2014 what is that new show that Kiefer Sutherland is in? \u2018Designated Survivor\u2019! You know how nerdy he looks in that? That\u2019s Maskell, exactly,\u201d she says, sitting in a rocker inside the Ocean City apartment she shares with her dog, Teddy, an Australian labradoodle.\n\nIt was when she learned that the Maskell allegations might be tied to Cesnik that Hoskins took a greater interest in the case. As a teenager, she\u2019d been terrified of the nuns who taught at her all-girls private school. They were old and serious, the white headdresses framing their faces so tightly it looked painful. There was a rumor that one of them didn\u2019t have any toes.\n\nThe apartment building where Sister Catherine Cesnik last lived. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut Cesnik was different. She was in her 20s, pretty and charismatic. She used the Socratic method and bused her students to downtown Baltimore to see a production of Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d Hoskins felt so close to her that when school let out for the summer, she and some classmates took a pizza over to the nun\u2019s apartment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was the last time Hoskins would see the woman who inspired her to become an elementary school teacher. When she found out about the murder, she felt sick.\n\n\u201cThe idea of her laying there for two months just makes me want to scream,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause she was so special. I can\u2019t imagine her beautiful body and face \u2014 her presence \u2014 laying in the snow. It wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nToday, a small metal placard has been drilled onto an ivy-covered tree near where Cesnik\u2019s body was found:\n\nIn Memory Of\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCathy Cesnik\n\n1942 \u2014 1969\n\nwith Love & Appreciation!\n\nIt would be hard to find the memorial if you weren\u2019t with someone who had been there before. The tree is located on private land, hidden about 50 yards off the street in some woods thick with underbrush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBack when Cathy was found, this was just a place where people dumped their garbage. All these trees weren\u2019t here,\u201d says White, pointing through the greenery.\n\nHe estimates he\u2019s been to this spot, about 20 minutes south of downtown Baltimore, 50 times since he started working on \u201cThe Keepers.\u201d His mother was raised just a few miles from here, and his aunt was a student at Keough. In 2014, when Jane Doe revealed her identity \u2014 Jean Hargadon Wehner \u2014 members of White\u2019s family realized they\u2019d been childhood friends with her and passed along the news.\n\nA placard to commemorate Sister Cathy Cesnik has been placed on a tree in the area where her body was found. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cMom is constantly sending me bad articles as ideas for documentaries,\u201d says White, 35, who lives in Los Angeles\u2019 Atwater Village. \u201cShe definitely hit it out of the park with this one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough he\u2019d left the church by the time he went to college at Duke University, White was raised a staunch Catholic. He was a eucharistic minister, assisting the priest in giving out communion. His youth group traveled to Honduras every couple of years on mission trips.\n\nSo making a story set in Baltimore, a city with deep ties to the religion, piqued his interest. He set up a meeting with Wehner, who became central to the series, and soon began traveling to the city for a week every month, staying in his uncle\u2019s attic for free.\n\nA safe place\n\nSince filming on the documentary was finished, Hoskins, after 64 years of living in Baltimore county \u2014 and seeing Schaub several times a week \u2014 decided to move permanently to Ocean City. It\u2019s a resort town where hundreds of thousands of tourists crowd the sand during the summer, picking up steamed crabs and salt water taffy on the wooden boardwalk.\n\nHoskins feels safe here. Her diabetes is causing her eyesight to deteriorate, and she no longer has peripheral vision. Soon, she won\u2019t be able to drive. But she\u2019ll be able to use the local mobility van for free. And she can see the ocean from the patio of her two-bedroom place, which she\u2019s filled with shabby chic decor. There\u2019s a lot of distressed wood and aquamarine. The couch has a tropical palm leaf print. In the corner, there\u2019s a chair she upholstered with the T-shirt she bought at a Billy Joel and Elton John concert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA chair Gemma Hoskins made from a concert t-shirt of Elton John and Billy Joel. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times)\n\nIt also makes for a good place to study. She recently decided to pursue a criminal justice degree through a local community college. She can take courses online from her rocker and just finished criminology this spring. When she graduates, she\u2019d like to start working for a private investigator.\n\nLooking back on the last few years, Hoskins feels confident that she and Schaub have made a dent in the cold case. Recently, she says, Baltimore County Police Officer Robin Teal asked to meet with them to hear about what kind of information they\u2019d gathered. (Teal did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\u201cShe told us, \u2018You have done my homework for me,\u2019\u201d says Hoskins. \u201cAs we were leaving, she said we\u2019d given her some really good smoking guns. She calls me probably once a week. But we just hope it isn\u2019t a PR thing because of the documentary.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemma Hoskins\u2019 living room in Ocean City, Maryland. (Amy Kaufman / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cThe Keepers\u201d has garnered strong reviews from critics and is already inciting the Archdiocese of Baltimore. On its Facebook page, the organization says it does not \u201cdispute the abuse committed by Fr. Maskell, but \u2018The Keepers\u2019 premise and conclusion are wrong.\u201d It also published a lengthy question-and-answer segment discussing the archdiocese\u2019s \u201cEfforts to Protect Children and Promote Healing for Victims of Abuse.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s for this very reason that Hoskins thinks \u201cThe Keepers\u201d could end up having a bigger impact than recent crime stories like \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cSerial.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something in a really sad, distraught world that everybody can agree on: Who wants to see children hurt?\u201d she says. \u201cThis is something that has nothing to do with politics or where you live. It\u2019s doing the right thing for kids. \u2026 How can that not be a good thing? I think that with Cathy dying so young, she could have had such an impact on our lives \u2014 but she\u2019s having a bigger one now. And maybe that was the way it was supposed to be. My life is so rich because of hers.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestigating Cesnik\u2019s death, Hoskins says, has given her purpose. Her husband died when she was 35, and she\u2019s fought loneliness ever since. She was only with him for five years \u2014 a relationship that took her completely by surprise. At 30, she was single and overweight, facing a future of health struggles because of her diabetes. But then she met Ernie, a bearded Kenny Loggins-lookalike with an affinity for flannel. He was so taken with her that one day, when she left a box of tampons in the bathroom, he drove to the elementary school where she taught just to drop them off.\n\nHis devotion perplexed her. \u201cHe must think I have money,\u201d she thought.\n\nBut Ernie had his own issues. Before they\u2019d met, he\u2019d fallen off a telephone pole on the job for a local cable company and accidentally kicked himself in the groin. Now, one of his testicles was the size of an orange.\n\nIt was cancer, and by the time Hoskins insisted he visit the doctor, it had already metastasized.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, they wed. She stayed by his side until his death in 1989.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s got his hand on my shoulder all the time. And Cathy \u2014 I think she\u2019s driving the bus,\u201d she says, her eyes watering. \u201cMy teeth are in this thing. I love that woman and [Maskell] was a monster and I\u2019m going to see what I can do about it.
