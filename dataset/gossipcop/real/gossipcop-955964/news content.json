So Wednesday morning, when the news came out that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is proposing to introduce a new category at the Oscars, one that would be called best popular film (or words to that effect), the first reaction I had \u2014 apart from my jaw dropping on the floor in shock and dismay \u2014 was: best popular film? What does that even mean?\n\nI get the motivation. The Academy, along with ABC, the TV network that programs the Oscars, is looking for new ways to lure viewers to a show that, in recent years, has seemed less and less interested in any film that could be called a blockbuster. That\u2019s become a problem for the Oscars, as both a TV-ratings spectacle and a cultural event. There\u2019s growing conviction, and with good evidence, that \u201cthe mass audience\u201d \u2014 the people who turn out to see comic-book movies, \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, etc. \u2014 is less and less interested in the Oscars. Ratings for the show have been in a slow but steady decline, and out of that reality grows the conviction \u2014 and fear \u2014 that the Oscars have become marginalized.\n\nThe problem is real. But let\u2019s be clear: This category is not the way to fix it. The notion of putting \u201cpopular\u201d films in a section all their own isn\u2019t just unworkable \u2014 and, the more you look it, nonsensical. It\u2019s nothing short of reprehensible. It violates the very spirit of what movies have been ever since there have been movies.\n\nI ask again: What, exactly, is a \u201cpopular\u201d film? \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d? Undoubtedly. \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d? Most certainly. And what about \u201cLa La Land,\u201d the musical that became a mainstream phenomenon by grossing $150 million? I\u2019d say that counts too. So should \u201cLa La Land\u201d have been nominated in the best popular film category? It\u2019s not a comic-book movie, but it is a highly entertaining work of popular appeal made in a time-honored Hollywood genre.\n\nOkay, it\u2019s obvious that \u201cLa La Land\u201d was trying to be a movie of genuine artistry. So should that, in fact, disqualify it from inclusion in the best popular film category? And if so, what do you do with \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d? It wasn\u2019t an acclaimed film like \u201cLa La Land\u201d (though I gave it one of its rare rave reviews), but it, too, was a highly popular musical, grossing $175 million. Should that film have been nominated in the best popular film category? If so, should the category actually be called best popular film that critics don\u2019t like?\n\nBut if that\u2019s the case, what do you do with popcorn movies \u2014 big-ticket movies, blockbuster movies, popular movies \u2014 that critics adore? (Believe it or not, we actually give good reviews to more than a few of them.) As my colleague Kristopher Tapley has noted, there\u2019s been much talk this year about the possibility of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d receiving a best picture nomination, and maybe even winning. If that happened, it would be an event with meaning, a sign that the industry knows how to salute its organic diversity \u2014 and, just as much, that it could recognize that a comic-book film can achieve a heightened artistry. If the scenario of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d dominating the Oscars came to pass, it would seem, to me, the essence of what the Oscars should be all about.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume that we have a best popular film category. You\u2019d think that \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d since it\u2019s the top-grossing movie of the year, would be relegated \u2014 almost by definition \u2014 to that category. Later on Wednesday, though, the Academy issued a clarifying statement that said a movie could be nominated in both the best popular film and best picture categories. That solves one problem by creating another. Imagine that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d was nominated in both categories. Wouldn\u2019t there be at least some Academy voters who felt tempted to vote for it in one category (i.e., best popular film) instead of the other? Wouldn\u2019t the movie, in effect, be competing against itself?\n\nLet\u2019s be honest: The whole notion of a best popular film category feels chintzy and cheesy and superficial \u2014 very People\u2019s Choice Awards, or MTV Movie & TV Awards. And in the end, how much difference would it make anyway? Are the legions of blockbuster fans who, more and more, don\u2019t even bother to tune into the Oscars really going to watch, all of a sudden, because there is now one category devoted to \u201ctheir\u201d movies? Are they really going to sit through the entire telecast to find out whether \u201cInfinity War\u201d can beat \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d? Anyone who believes that is dreaming.\n\nYet for all the ways that it\u2019s unworkable, impractical, and not at all likely to succeed, the single worst aspect of the proposed best popular film category is that it feels not just tacky but corrupt. It\u2019s a piece of cultural demagoguery. It commits a sin that I would call philosophical.\n\nThe whole notion of dividing movies into \u201cart\u201d and \u201centertainment,\u201d with the suggestion that the \u201cart\u201d films appeal to a \u201csmall, elite\u201d audience and that the \u201centertainment\u201d films appeal to, you know, the people, has always been simplistic and, ultimately, untrue. And these days it comes with an unmistakable Trumpian spin. The mainstream vs. the elites!\n\nSure, you can point to examples throughout movie history where thinking in terms of that dichotomy was justified. Robert Bresson\u2019s \u201cDiary of a Country Priest\u201d is an art film that was never going to be a mass-audience crowd pleaser; \u201cTransformers\u201d movies are mass-audience machines that no one would confuse with art.\n\nYet the real history of movies is about all these categories \u2014 these ways of thinking \u2014 being broken down. Most of the great films of the studio-system era were popular hits. In the \u201970s, extraordinary works of art, like \u201cEasy Rider\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cChinatown\u201d and \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d became timeless popular films. And though there\u2019s no denying that this happens less in our era, it\u2019s not as if it doesn\u2019t happen at all. Just look at films like \u201cDunkirk\u201d or \u201cLincoln\u201d or \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d all of them enormous hits, and all spectacular works of art. Which category should they be in?\n\nAnd since we\u2019re talking about the Academy, let\u2019s take a closer look at all the fantasy/popcorn/genre movies the Academy habitually underrates and overlooks. The argument, back in 2009, that \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d should receive a best picture nomination wasn\u2019t just based on the idea that \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d for a comic-book movie to finally get that recognition. It was based on the infinitely more pure idea that, yes, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d was that good. It was a genuine work of popular art.\n\nThe point is that, more and more, as our blockbusters tussle with year-end \u201cawards films\u201d for the attention of moviegoers, we need to begin looking at movies without putting them in slots, which is really a way of marginalizing them, reducing them from magical experiences to cut-and-dried niche products. The last thing that the Academy should now be doing is creating a reactionary new category that is, in effect, the Popular Ghetto. Instead, it should be working to take off its blinders and make more room in the big tent for every movie that comes out. That\u2019s how to win viewers back to the Oscars without trashing the essence of what movies are.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/blackpanther.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/blackpanther.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Fcolumns%2Foscars-best-popular-film-category-commentary-1202899728%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202899728&comment_count=54", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/blackpanther.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Owen Gleiberman"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/oscars-best-popular-film-category-commentary-1202899728/", "title": "Popular Film Category Violates Everything the Oscars Are Supposed to Be About", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The proposal for a best popular film category at the Oscars violates everything it's supposed to be about.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202899728, "author": "Owen Gleiberman", "pmc-category": "Columns", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-08-08T13:00:48"}, "pmc-tag": "Black Panther,La La Land,Oscars", "title": "Popular Film Category Violates Everything the Oscars Are Supposed to Be About", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film", "pmc-primary-category": "Columns", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Popular Film Category Violates Everything the Oscars Are Supposed to Be About", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/columns/oscars-best-popular-film-category-commentary-1202899728/", "description": "For a hundred years, movies have been a popular art form.
