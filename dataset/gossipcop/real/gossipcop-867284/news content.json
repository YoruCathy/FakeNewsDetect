Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman, pregnant with a baby. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home.\u201d\n\nAs the address continues, the Frey men begin to choke; they\u2019ve been poisoned. The Lord continued: \u201dBut you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. That was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem. Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe.\u201d\n\nAs they hit the floor, Arya reveals herself, turning to Walder's latest wife, telling her to deliver a message to the crown: \u201cTell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s brutal revenge, Maisie Williams saying of the scene: \u201cIt\u2019s so f**ked up! Even Arya is surprised she has so much power. In that last moment she\u2019s staring out at all those men dying, she\u2019s turned into a bit more of a monster than she\u2019s ever realised. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s sad about that but she\u2019s got it on her mind.\u201d\n\nThe disturbing scene also brings together some story threads from George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, the books on which Game of Thrones is based.\n\nAs The Hollywood Reporter explains, Arya\u2019s revenge against the Frey\u2019s encapsulates Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor\u2019s very own revenge story from the books.\n\nMartin\u2019s series sees Lord Manderly openly working with the Freys, Boltons, and Lannisters, while also plotting revenge for his son \u2014 lost in the Red Wedding \u2014 behind their backs.\n\nThe character kills numerous members of the Frey family and cooks them into pies, serving them up to relatives. \"The best pie you have ever tasted, my lords,\" Manderly says during A Dance with Dragons. \"Wash it down with Arbor Gold and savour every bite. I know I shall.\u201d\n\nDuring the season six finale, Arya gives Walder a pie before slitting his throat. She then brings the Manderly storyline to a conclusion by serving the Frey sons poisoned Arbor Gold.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

For those unaware, Stoneheart is the reanimated corpse of Catelyn Stark \u2014 brought to life by the Brotherhood Without Banners \u2014 who exacts revenge on the Red Wedding perpetrators.\n\nWith only twelve episodes remaining, there\u2019s almost zero chance we\u2019ll see Stoneheart; instead, Arya has encapsulated the undead character\u2019s quest to murder those traitors across Westeros.\n\nThe question remains of where will Arya go next? During the episode, she tells Ed Sheeran and his Lannister gang she\u2019s heading South to \u201ckill the Queen\u201d. But, could we see her travelling North to Winterfell? The teaser for episode two has already revealed a likely reunion will take place, but doesn\u2019t confirm where she\u2019s heading.\n\nGame of Thrones airs weekly on Sky Atlantic in the UK and is available on NOW TV.", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jack Shepherd"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-1-premiere-arya-stark-walder-frey-lady-stoneheart-books-a7846461.html", "title": "Game of Thrones season 7 premiere's opening Arya scene combines two iconic storylines from the books", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-1-premiere-arya-stark-walder-frey-lady-stoneheart-books-a7846461.html", "title": "How the Game of Thrones season 7 opening scene brings together two iconic threads from the books", "description": "'Wash it down with Arbor Gold and savour every bite'", "updated_time": "2017-07-18T14:18:48+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/7846461"}, "description": "Season seven of Game of Thrones has arrived, bringing death to numerous characters within the very first episode. **Spoilers for the season premiere \u2018Dragonstone ahead** No scene was quite as horrific as the cold opening which saw Arya Stark murder the entire Frey family, retribution for the infamous Red Wedding.", "keywords": "Game of Thrones season 7, Game of Thrones, Arya Stark, News, TV & Radio, Culture", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "Game of Thrones season 7", "published_time": "2017-07-18T09:41:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-18T14:18:48+01:00", "section": "News", "author_name": "Jack Shepherd", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 645, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 13, "external_link_count": 1}, "twitter": {"title": "How the Game of Thrones season 7 opening scene brings together two i\u2026", "description": "Season seven of Game of Thrones has arrived, bringing death to numerous characters within the very first episode. **Spoilers for the season premiere \u2018Dragonstone ahead** No scene was quite as", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500367260.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
