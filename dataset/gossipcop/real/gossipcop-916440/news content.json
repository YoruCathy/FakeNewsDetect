Marissa Jaret Winokur took home the $250,000 grand prize on Sunday, February 25 \u2014 with her BFF Ross Mathews by her side. The houseguests immediately clicked on the CBS series, and agreed to have each other\u2019s backs until the very end. So much so, that Winokur chose him to be in the final two with her even though the TV personality had a very big chance at winning.\n\n\u201cI had to choose Ross. Listen, my whole game was about trying to stay as true and honest to everybody as I possibly could so the idea of not choosing him was not an option. He saved me against Brandi [Glanville], a friend of his from the outside world. And he saved me against James [Maslow] who absolutely could have played a game with him longer. So once he saved me those two times I knew that was my only play,\u201d the Broadway vet, 45, exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even playing [the Head of Household] to win. I was playing because I wanted Ross to win. Because I felt like we had such a great game together and I would have rather have lost to Ross than win next to someone that I might have just beat just because.\u201d\n\nWinokur won the final HOH competition, which gave her the advantage to decide who would be sitting next to her during the finale. She saved Mathews and sent Mark McGrath and Ariadna Guti\u00e9rrez packing.\n\n\u201cI wanted him to win. I wanted him to play his best game. I really supported him. But here\u2019s the thing, I was just hoping Ross won so up until like halfway during the deliberations I was like, \u2018Wait a second. You took Ross. You can still win!\u2019 I was still campaigning for Ross and I forgot like, \u2018Wait, you put him here. He didn\u2019t put you here.\u2019 I was so confused that I just won that [HOH] and I was sitting there,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the only one not walking around the house planning a speech. Mark and Ross and Ari \u2014 they were all walking in the house all day with speeches and I was like if I get second I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not going to campaign against any of these people if anyone thinks to bring me. I want them to win. I wasn\u2019t even answering questions! My husband was like, \u2018You rambled. You didn\u2019t know what you were saying. Until you finally clicked into saying I played my honest game and I did the best I could.\u2019 He said, \u2018Thank God you pulled it together because you basically were like vote for Ross!\u2019\u201d\n\nFor more, read the rest of her Q&A:\n\nUs: Ross said multiple times he would bring Mark to the final two. Have you spoken to Ross about that?\n\nMJW: I can see in Ross\u2019 eyes during the last day or so he wasn\u2019t taking me. I could tell. I mean look, we had spent 30 days together playing this game. I could tell he wasn\u2019t giving me answers and he wasn\u2019t telling me he wasn\u2019t taking me. I think in my heart I hoped he would take me but I could tell. Honestly I wanted him to win because we were playing so good together. If it wasn\u2019t going to be me I wanted him to win. I probably am still having a little post traumatic stress disorder right now but I\u2019m not mad that he wasn\u2019t going to take me. I respect that choice because I didn\u2019t see what everyone else saw. I didn\u2019t see that I was a threat. I figured no one is going to vote for me in the end because I haven\u2019t really done anything here.\n\nUS: Were you surprised by how some of the votes went?\n\nMJW: Yeah, I was most surprised by Shannon [Elizabeth] to be honest. I knew Keshia [Knight Pulliam] and I had a really special relationship because people were trying to make her stay when she needed to go home to be with her baby. I didn\u2019t care what anyone said. During that eviction people were still trying to get her to stay. It was a big deal in the house. I pulled her aside and I said, \u2018It\u2019s just you and me. You tell me what you want.\u2019 So Keshia knew I always had her back. And then Omarosa [Manigault] I knew she really wanted a woman to win. It was Shannon\u2019s vote that really touched my heart. We did Dancing With the Stars 10 years ago but we\u2019ve never talked since. I barely talked to her then so we weren\u2019t friends but I know her game and I know that I hurt her. It broke my heart that I hurt her and it did the whole time I was in the house. I felt bad. So I\u2019m absolutely sending money to her charity.\n\nUS: You and your son Zev are just so cute. What were you telling him when you hugged him on stage?\n\nMJW: Oh my God! I was smothering him with so much love that no child should ever have. I was like, \u2018I love you so much. I\u2019ll never leave you again.\u2019 He was like, \u2018I love you! I love you! You won!\u2019 I was so overbearing it was too much. My son and I are so close. My husband works five months in New York a year. So it\u2019s really just me and my son half the time. We\u2019re like a little dynamic duo the two of us.\n\nUS: You mentioned he will get a present he wanted because you won. What is it?\n\nMJW: It\u2019s so horrible! Right before I left for Celebrity Big Brother he was like, \u2018If you win Celebrity Big Brother you have to get me a Warped Wall.\u2019 Which is that thing from American Ninja Warrior where they run up and grab onto the wood on a 14-foot wall. I was like, \u2018Sure kid. If I win \u2014 not the second prize, not money if they do a prize during the show \u2014 I have to win the whole thing. If I win the whole thing then you can have a Warped Wall.\u2019 He looked at me in the audience and he was like, \u2018I get a Warped Wall!\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh my God. I\u2019m going to have a 14-foot Warped Wall in my backyard that my son\u2019s going to break his arm on for sure.\u2019\n\nUS: And side note: I loved your headbands! How many did you bring into the house and did you make any of them yourself?\n\nMJW: Oh my God, I didn\u2019t make any of them myself. Some of them were a little mismatched so I would kind of combine some. In my mind I think I brought 10. I wear them all the time outside the house. I wear headbands because I just love them and have like 1,000 at my house. So I brought enough because my mindset was I\u2019m going to bring stuff to share. I brought those gold eye patches that we all wore, I brought tons of sweatshirts that we all wore, James ended up taking my sweatshirt. I brought headbands because I was like, \u2018How else to make friends?\u2019\n\nUS: You always joked that you talk too much. Did you ever think that could hurt your game along the way?\n\nMJW: Yes! Oh, so much. \u2026 My biggest worry was that I was going to be in a house with a bunch of people who got annoyed by me talking. I was so stressed out. I\u2019m 45 years old now and the night before going into the house I felt like it was high school. I was like, \u2018I hope they like me. I hope I don\u2019t annoy anybody. I hope they just are patient with me because I\u2019m loud.\u2019 If it weren\u2019t for every single person in that house \u2014 the exact group that we had \u2014 I would have absolutely not been able to do the show. I can\u2019t explain it. Even one person out would have changed the whole chemistry. Thankfully everyone in there got me and got my personality.\n\nUS: Would you do an All-Stars?\n\nMJW: I would never \u2014 this was a once in a lifetime experience. It\u2019s so intense. \u2026 There\u2019s a reason why people in their \u201820s do this show. I don\u2019t know how they do it for three times the amount. We were there for 26 days. They go from 90 to 100 days. And let me tell you, it\u2019s so intense so I don\u2019t know how they do it. It\u2019s mad respect to them.\n\nUS: How would you describe your experience in three words?\n\nMJW: Three words! Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve never said three words in my life. Extraordinary, emotional and joyous.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?w=215", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?w=238", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?crop=0px%2C36px%2C802px%2C421px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ross-and-marissa.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-ross-big-brother.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?crop=0px%2C36px%2C802px%2C421px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/celebrity-big-brother-winner-marissa-jaret-winokur-read-her-qa/", "title": "'Celebrity Big Brother' Winner Marissa Jaret Winokur: Read Her Q&A", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "'Celebrity Big Brother' winner Marissa Jaret Winokur opens up about Ross Mathews, her fallout with Shannon Elizabeth and more \u2014 read the Q&A", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Celebrity Big Brother's Marissa: How I Really Feel About Ross' Final Two Deal With Mark", "description": "'Celebrity Big Brother' winner Marissa Jaret Winokur opens up about Ross Mathews, her fallout with Shannon Elizabeth and more \u2014 read the Q&A", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/celebrity-big-brother-winner-marissa-jaret-winokur-read-her-qa/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?crop=0px%2C36px%2C802px%2C421px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?crop=0px%2C36px%2C802px%2C421px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-27T13:39:02+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Celebrity Big Brother' winner Marissa Jaret Winokur opens up about Ross Mathews, her fallout with Shannon Elizabeth and more \u2014 read the Q&A", "title": "Celebrity Big Brother's Marissa: How I Really Feel About Ross' Final Two Deal With Mark", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/marissa-jaret-winokur.jpg?crop=0px%2C36px%2C802px%2C421px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519738742.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
