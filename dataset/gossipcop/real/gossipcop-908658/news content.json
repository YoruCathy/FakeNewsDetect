Men are trash. Don\u2019t ever forget it,\u201d Woodward wrote on one of the surveillance shots, which Woodward later accused Pall of reporting to Instagram after it was deleted by the social network site.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you.

And in different words, that because he\u2019s famous now, he had a different rulebook for decency,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN\u2019T EVEN APOLOGIZED.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he\u2019s done,\u201d she claimed. \u201d \u2018You\u2019re better than this.\u2019 That\u2019s right I am, but you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Tori Woodward/Instagram\n\nWoodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message\u2019s end, writing, \u201cif there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their disgusting behavior, it\u2019s now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be that guy. Don\u2019t let your friend or brother or business partner be that guy. Basic respect for women in your life should not be such a hard standard to hold each other to,\u201d she said.\n\nShe concluded her message by thanking her 40K followers for supporting her in her battle.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate all the kind messages I\u2019ve been getting,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m moving on with my life now with the satisfaction that I\u2019m liberated from a
