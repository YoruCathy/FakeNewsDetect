I just remember thinking he was so cute \u2014 and I was surprised by how tiny he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was convinced I was having a giant baby, to the point where I didn\u2019t even buy newborn clothes \u2014 in my head he was 9 lbs.,\u201d she says of baby Liam, who was born weighing 6 lbs., 14 oz.\n\nImage zoom Elizabeth Messina\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

And I was sharing my body with someone \u2014 so I wanted to know as much as possible about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always hoped I would have a boy,\u201d she adds. \u201cBoys are so fun. I was a tomboy, and I always play best with boys. When we found out, I was so excited.\u201d\n\nAs for who Liam takes after in the looks department, Conrad says he\u2019s \u201csort of a combo of both of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe definitely looks like William,\u201d she says. \u201cBut he\u2019s still so tiny it\u2019s hard to tell!\u201d\n\nFor more on Lauren Conrad\u2019s life as a new mom with husband William and son Liam, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\nImage zoom\n\nSo did she always know she was going to be a mom? Not exactly, she says.\n\n\u201cIn my early 20s I was open to having them or not having them. But after meeting William, I changed my mind,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew I wanted to have a family with him. But I didn\u2019t want to do it right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crazy about Liam, but I never really got baby fever,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe wanted to enjoy being married and to really be in the right space. We took our time, so it was something to look forward to.\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Baby Boy Is on His Way! All of Lauren Conrad\u2019s Cutest Bump Pics\n\nAnd so far, so good! The designer, author and lifestyle expert is savoring every moment as a first-time mom \u2014 and she\u2019s not feeling \u201cany pressure\u201d to lose the baby weight. (\u201cSpanx exist for a reason,\u201d she notes.)\n\n\u201cI feel so spoiled,\u201d she says. \u201cLiam is such a good baby. I\u2019m sleeping three to four hours at a time. This morning I was up at 4 a.m. and I wasn\u2019t even tired, so I cleaned the kitchen and did some cooking. William was like, \u2018You\u2019re crazy!\u2019 \u201c\n\nFROM PEN: Emily Maynard Johnson Admits She Was Ashamed to Stop Breastfeeding Her Third Son Early\n\nAnd the new mom has already established a special routine with her son.\n\n\u201cHis last nighttime feeding is right around when the sun comes up, so I sit and feed him and watch the sun rise,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s funny to watch \u2014 he makes really funny little expressions. I\u2019m already stressing out because I want him to stay this tiny and I know he won\u2019t. So I\u2019m just trying to enjoy how itty-bitty he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was looking at him the other day, and I was like, \u2018I understand now why people keep having babies!\u2019 \u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably have two. I think it\u2019s best not to be outnumbered.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, Conrad knows exactly what kind of mom she wants to be.\n\n\u201cI want to be strong and teach him to respect women. The mother-son relationship is so important,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just excited to play again! I can\u2019t wait to break out the finger paints. And I\u2019m such a Disney nerd, so I get to watch those movies with someone who is seeing them for the first time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI worked hard to get here,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt took a lot. And it makes me appreciate my life now and value the peacefulness. I\u2019m really lucky.
