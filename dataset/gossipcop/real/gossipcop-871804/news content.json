That special feature has now arrived in its entirety online.\n\nJames Gunn created a Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 music video inspired by the original disco song \u201cGuardians Inferno\u201d by a group called The Sneepers, featuring none other than Star-Lord\u2019s fictional father David Hasselhoff. This is a full fledged retro music video created in the same style as real hit disco songs from the 1970s, and it\u2019s so weird and glorious. Watch it below!\n\nWatch the Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Music Video\n\nWhat\u2019s really fantastic about this music video, besides everything, is that it actually features cast members Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn and director James Gunn himself, all decked out in their finest disco gear, lip syncing, dancing and having a great time. There\u2019s even a cameo from Jimmy Kimmel Live security guard Guillermo, whose appearance that was shot for the movie didn\u2019t make the final cut, and one more guest appearance that we won\u2019t ruin here. It\u2019s no wonder James Gunn previously said on Twitter, \u201cThis may be the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d\n\nSadly, cast members Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Kurt Russell must have been too busy to appear in this music video. However, if you wait until the end, you just might catch one of them wearing a surprising disguise, even if it appears to be a moment added in post-production.\n\nNot only is this music video great, but that song is quite catchy. Where else can you find a song that rhymes procyon lotor (the scientific name for a raccoon) with the word motor? Nowhere. Could that be enough to land this song an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song? We certainly hope so.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 arrives on Digital HD on August 8th and 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on August 22nd.\n\n", "images": ["https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/guardians2-musicvideo-poster-frontpage.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/siteimages/pm-comments.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/guardians2-musicvideo-poster-frontpage-700x368.jpg", "https://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?1648144&101", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/authors/35.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/guardians2-musicvideo-poster-frontpage.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ethan Anderton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Music Video Is the Wackiest Thing You'll See Today", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 254451208349115}, "description": "Easily the wackiest and most wonderful thing from Marvel Studios, watch this Guardians of the Galaxy 2 music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno.\"", "news_keywords": "chris pratt, dave bautista, david-hasselhoff, guardians of the galaxy, guardians of the galaxy 2, guardians of the galaxy vol. 2, james gunn, karen gillan, michael rooker, pom klementieff, sean gunn, stan-lee, zoe-saldana, movies, film, tv", "original-source": "https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Music Video Is the Wackiest Thing You'll See Today", "description": "Easily the wackiest and most wonderful thing from Marvel Studios, watch this Guardians of the Galaxy 2 music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno.\"", "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/", "site_name": "/Film", "updated_time": "2017-08-06T20:06:50-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/guardians2-musicvideo-poster-frontpage.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/guardians2-musicvideo-poster-frontpage.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 368, "alt": "Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Music Video"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/slashfilm", "tag": "Zoe-Saldana", "section": "Comic Book/Superhero", "published_time": "2017-08-07T06:00:45-07:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-06T20:06:50-07:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Easily the wackiest and most wonderful thing from Marvel Studios, watch this Guardians of the Galaxy 2 music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno.\"", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Music Video Is the Wackiest Thing You'll See Today", "site": "@slashfilm", "image": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/guardians2-musicvideo-poster-frontpage.jpg", "creator": "@slashfilm"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MMMe1drnZY?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1502110845.0, "source": "https://www.slashfilm.com", "summary": ""}
