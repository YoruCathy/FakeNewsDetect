Smartest people of them all are the \u2018DEPLORABLES,'\u201d he wrote on on Tuesday night, two days after Sunday\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards telecast.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017\n\nThe Emmys, broadcast by CBS, were about on par with last year\u2019s ceremony in terms of total viewers. Sunday\u2019s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016\u2019s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year\u2019s low point of a 2.8.\n\nHost Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump\u2019s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.\n\nAccording to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2013\n\nKellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, criticized the \u201cpoliticized\u201d show for the \u201csameness\u201d of the attacks on Trump.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Americans are tuning out,\u201d she said on \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nThen she addressed stars who appeared on the stage. \u201cThey want you to stick to your knitting. They want you to stick to the stuff that other people write for you.\u201d\n\nShe did, however, praise Sean Spicer for his Emmy cameo, in which he made fun of his own post-inauguration press conference in which he chided the media never its reporting on Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd size. Spicer\u2019s appearance has drawn a backlash from Trump detractors who criticized Colbert and Emmy producers for milking laughs out of a political operative who had been a champion of Trump\u2019s polarizing agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is something that folks in Hollywood often lack \u2014 which is introspection and good humor,\u201d Conway said of Spicer.\n\nTrump spoke at the UN earlier on Tuesday in a speech in which he said that the U.S. would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d North Korea if the U.S. is \u201cforced to defend itself or its allies.\u201d", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/trump-2.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Fpolitics%2Fnews%2Fdonald-trump-emmy-award-ratings-1202564180%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202564180&comment_count=46", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/trump-2.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ted Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/politics/news/donald-trump-emmy-award-ratings-1202564180/", "title": "Trump Says He Was \u2018Saddened\u2019 by \u2018Worst Ever\u2019 Emmy Ratings", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense. \"I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202564180, "author": "Ted Johnson", "pmc-category": "News,Politics", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-09-19T20:07:02"}, "pmc-tag": "Emmys,President Donald Trump,Twitter", "title": "Trump Says He Was \u2018Saddened\u2019 by \u2018Worst Ever\u2019 Emmy Ratings", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "politics,tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "politics", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Trump Says He Was \u2018Saddened\u2019 by \u2018Worst Ever\u2019 Emmy Ratings", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/politics/news/donald-trump-emmy-award-ratings-1202564180/", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense. \u201cI was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last n\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/trump-2.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Donald Trump"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-20T03:07:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-22T21:41:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@tedstew", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "Trump Says He Was \u2018Saddened\u2019 by \u2018Worst Ever\u2019 Emmy Ratings"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/trump-2.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "Donald Trump"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trump Says He Was \u2018Saddened\u2019 by \u2018Worst Ever\u2019 Emmy Ratings", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense. \u201cI was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last n\u2026"}, "author": "Ted Johnson", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202564180, "title": "Trump Says He Was 'Saddened' by 'Worst Ever' Emmy Ratings", "published_at": "2017-09-19 20:07:02", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/trump-2.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 46, "tags": "Twitter", "topics": "Politics", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has weighed in on the Emmys, which were heavy on humor and swipes at his expense.\r\n\r\n\"I was saddened to see how bad the ratings were on the Emmys last night - the worst ever.
