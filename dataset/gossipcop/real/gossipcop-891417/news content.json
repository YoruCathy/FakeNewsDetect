The event included a discussion with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon announcer and Saturday Night Live writer-producer Steve Higgins.\n\nBaldwin made a point to discuss the current sexual misconduct allegations circulating in Hollywood. The actor admitted that he has been guilty of treating women poorly in the past. \u201cI certainly have treated women in a very sexist way. I\u2019ve bullied women. I\u2019ve overlooked women. I\u2019ve underestimated women. Not as a rule,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom time to time, I\u2019ve done what a lot of men do, which is \u2026 when you don\u2019t treat women the same way you treat men. You don\u2019t. I\u2019m from a generation where you really don\u2019t and I\u2019d like that to change. I really would like that to change.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning actor said that the way individuals function in the workplace needs to change, not just in Hollywood but everywhere. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to try to make the workplace and beyond not only comfortable and right and fair and appropriate but as productive, as well. I think a lot of what we\u2019re dealing with within this issue is hurting our business. It\u2019s making it less productive,\" Baldwin asserted.\n\n\u201cI knew of certain things, that there were rumors of things happening to people, but I didn\u2019t necessarily know the scope, when you hear the hundreds and hundreds of women who are complaining about this,\u201d the actor admitted while accepting the honor. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very eye-opening experience for me personally. We\u2019ve got to be vigilant in a new way to make sure that everybody is comfortable and that we get the job done together that we\u2019re there to do.\u201d\n\nDuring the conversation, Baldwin and Higgins discussed some of the actor\u2019s career highlights, including his famous impression of Donald Trump on NBC's Saturday Night Live. When Higgins asked if Baldwin jumped at the opportunity to play the public figure turned president, he joked, \u201cI was so there. I was like, \u2018Oh, God, I hope that Lorne [Michaels] calls me.'\u201d Baldwin admitted that he initially had no clue how in-demand the character would become. \u201cI lived in a world where it was presumed he wasn\u2019t gonna win,\u201d he said. Because of this, Baldwin thought he was only committed to play the character for three episodes on the late-night sketch show.\n\nBaldwin mentioned that he had only known Trump in passing prior to his portrayal. \u201cHe was always kind of a drive-by presence in Manhattan,\u201d he said. While the two had attended the same events, Baldwin explained that Trump would often show up for the red-carpet photo opportunities and then leave before the socializing began. \u201cIt would have been nice to sit through dinner, just out of curiosity, with Trump and say, \u2018Tell me what it was like growing up there in Jackson Heights, or wherever you\u2019re from,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cYou never got to talk to him. You never met him. He was a cypher.\u201d\n\nBaldwin said his lack of personal interactions with Trump didn\u2019t leave him with much material to draw from when creating the character. \u201cSo when you come in to do the show, you just have him in the media. Although he\u2019s pretty vivid in the media. He seems like himself,\u201d the actor said on his inspiration for the impersonation. \u201cI just wanted to make him as miserable as possible. He wins the election and he\u2019s like, \u2018God damn you people,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said in his best Trump impression.\n\nAnother character Baldwin reflected on was that of Jack Donaghy of NBC\u2019s critically acclaimed sitcom 30 Rock. \u201cI got very lucky,\u201d he said. The show never garnered impressive ratings, but managed to be a critical success. Baldwin won seven SAG Awards and two Emmy Awards for the role. \u201cWe were very lucky that the show was a critical darling,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe started in 2006. The [financial] crash came in 2008. It was very disruptive of the broadcast TV business and their ad rates and so forth,\u201d recalled Baldwin. His theory regarding 30 Rock\u2019s success was that is remained on the air as long as it did because most of its audience was in the entertainment industry. \u201cPeople in the business watch the show. It\u2019s not like other shows, which are huge hits but they might not be darlings in the industry.\u201d\n\nBaldwin also added that while he has acted in both dramas and comedies, he tends to choose his projects based on the material instead of the genre. \u201cI love doing dramas if the material is worthwhile, but then I did the TV show with [30 Rock creator and star] Tina [Fey],\u201d he said. \u201cThe writing is essential, and the writing was so good.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/11/hilaria_baldwin_alec_baldwin.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/hilaria_baldwin_alec_baldwin.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/hilaria_baldwin_alec_baldwin.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-admits-hes-bullied-women-calls-a-change-hollywood-1054420", "title": "Alec Baldwin Admits He's \"Bullied Women,\" Calls for a Change in Hollywood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The Paley Center for Media paid tribute to the actor Thursday at the Paley Honors.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-admits-hes-bullied-women-calls-a-change-hollywood-1054420", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Alec Baldwin Admits He's \"Bullied Women,\" Calls for a Change in Hollywood", "description": "The Paley Center for Media paid tribute to the actor Thursday at the Paley Honors.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/11/hilaria_baldwin_alec_baldwin.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Alec Baldwin Admits He's \"Bullied Women,\" Calls for a Change in Hollywood", "description": "The Paley Center for Media paid tribute to the actor Thursday at the Paley Honors.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-admits-hes-bullied-women-calls-a-change-hollywood-1054420", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/hilaria_baldwin_alec_baldwin.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Alec Baldwin Admits He's \"Bullied Women,\" Calls for a Change in Hollywood", "sailthru.description": "The Paley Center for Media paid tribute to the actor Thursday at the Paley Honors.", "sailthru.author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-02 14:12:45", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Culture,Alec Baldwin,About Town,autoplay,Events"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509603165.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
