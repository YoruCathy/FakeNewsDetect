Now, after more than two years after the star went public with her Lyme disease diagnosis, a source talks about her health, music career and her personal life.\n\n\u2018Avril is in a really good place right now,\u2019 the insider shares. \u2018Her recovery has been going well, and she\u2019s been getting stronger and stronger. She has more energy and has even been exercising.\u2019\n\nGreat being able to find @slimsecrets when I'm traveling/busy working \u2013 it's key to have healthy, tasty snacks on hand #slimsecrets #ad A post shared by Avril Lavigne (@avrillavigne) on Jun 9, 2017 at 2:00pm PDT\n\nThis chronic condition left her bedridden for five months and sidelined her professional activity until last December when she announced her sixth studio album.\n\nThe good news is that the new music from the singer is now closer than ever.\n\nIt looks like she will release new music by the end of this year, because the process was a bit slow due to all of her problems, according to the source.\n\nThe singer drew inspiration from her personal experiences related to Lyme disease in 2015 and her divorce from Nickleback frontman Chad Kroeger.\n\n\u2018She writes her own material, and she\u2019s been through a lot with her marriage and her illness,\u2019 the insider explains. \u2018She has a lot to say.\u2019\n\nShe also has a new man in her life, and we learned that he is the music producer J.R. Rotem.\n\nThey were photographed holding hands while out in Los Angeles Monday evening, and according to a source, things are moving toward a romantic relationship.\n\nWishing everyone a safe and happy Memorial Day! #MemorialDay #AbbeyDawn A post shared by Avril Lavigne (@avrillavigne) on May 29, 2017 at 4:48pm PDT\n\n\u2018J.R. is a producer she\u2019s been working with,\u2019 the source says, describing the Israeli-American music man as successful and sober.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s respected in the industry. Lately, they\u2019ve started hanging out socially, and there\u2019s chemistry there. They\u2019re both so passionate about music.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey have been seen out a few times by now, and it looks like they are headed towards a romantic direction. We\u2019re also very excited about her future and we can\u2019t wait to hear her new music.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Phaedra-Parks-Sons-Piano-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Justin-Bieber-avril-ryan-gossling-700x466.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Avril-Lavigne-Is-Doing-Great-Moving-Toward-A-Romance-With-Music-Producer-J.R.-Rotem.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Avril-Lavigne-BlogSpot.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toya-Johnson-282x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiny-Harris-reveals-the-new-addition-to-the-family-with-300x216.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/avril-lavigne-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kendall-Jenner-Sneaks-Out-Of-L.A.-Nightclub-With-Blake-Griffin-Where\u2019s-AAP-Rocky-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rs_600x600-181115140701-600-p-diddy-somber-me-11518-300x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Avril-Lavigne-Is-Doing-Great-Moving-Toward-A-Romance-With-Music-Producer-J.R.-Rotem.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/avril-lavigne-is-doing-great-moving-toward-a-romance-with-music-producer-j-r-rotem-58088/", "title": "Avril Lavigne Is Doing Great, Moving Toward A Romance With Music Producer J.R.
