(Spoiler alert: He did.)\n\n\u201cHe was photographed last night with Bella [Thorne],\u201d she told her sisters. \u201cBut he\u2019s been writing me all morning. He\u2019s like, \u2018I sold my house and I think that I should move in [with you]. Then we can just raise the kids together and have an open relationship.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cScott and I are not in a good place \u2014 he\u2019s been partying and I\u2019ve been trying to distance myself,\u201d she said. \u201cIs he serious that he thinks there\u2019s any sort of chance of moving back into the house? Because that is just wild.\u201d\n\nSure enough, as soon as he found out his ex would be there, Disick planned his own trip, claiming he had booked a club appearance.\n\n\u201cIt is crazy that Scott won\u2019t leave Kourt alone,\u201d fumed Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, 33. \u201cWe just went through all that s\u2014 in Santa Barbara, and all of a sudden Scott is going to Cannes? It\u2019s super suspicious.\u201d\n\nKourtney informed her that she and Disick had gotten into a \u201cfull war\u201d over the trip.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care how he embarrasses you, going out on the town with Bella and all of those other people,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said.\n\nBut it was more serious than that \u2014 according to Kourtney, Disick had started \u201cthreatening\u201d her and Bendjima.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Your little friend is going to get beat up every single day that we\u2019re there,'\u201d Kourtney said. \u201cThen he\u2019s like, \u2018You\u2019re the love of my life. Why would I have anyone attack you?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I will actually never speak to you again with your threats. If you threaten me and my friends, it\u2019s over \u2014 that\u2019s not how I will be treated, you treated me horribly for years,\u2019 \u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe he would stoop this low and speak to her like this,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said. \u201cAt the end of the day, she\u2019s the mother of his children. \u2026 It\u2019s just so childish.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Bella Thorne Reveals Details from Her Time in Cannes with Scott Disick \u2014 His Partying Was \u2018Way Too Much for Me\u2019\n\nAfter several attempts to reach Disick, the sisters acknowledged that he was purposely ignoring them.\n\n\u201cWhen Scott does something and he knows it, he avoids you,\u201d Kim Kardashian West said. \u201cHe avoids all of us. It\u2019s so obvious.\u201d\n\nAs for Disick? During a confessional, he claimed Kourtney was being \u201ca drop condescending\u201d about the trip.\n\n\u201cI got defensive,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be in Cannes with another guy, like, have fun. But just know that it\u2019s probably not going to be that fun if you run into me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s allowed to live her life, she\u2019s a single girl. We all know that I do what I want, so she should be able to also,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of anger. It\u2019s really real, us not being together.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 eventually got a hold of him, and he apologized for his behavior toward Kourtney, calling himself \u201ca f\u2014ing idiot.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still going to be the mother of your kids no matter what,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say certain things, because it\u2019s really hard to take it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really was just acting like a hothead. I got way too out of hand,\u201d he said. \u201cLong story short, I was acting a bit immature, and I said a few things that weren\u2019t appropriate. I\u2019m not going to regret that, because that\u2019s how I felt at the time.\u201d\n\nKim confronts her assistant\n\nMeanwhile, Kim, 37, was going through her own set of issues \u2014 this time over her longtime assistant Stephanie Shepherd, who had recently grown extremely close with Kourtney.\n\n\u201cShe was single, you were single, and you just love to have a partner in crime to go out with,\u201d Kim told Kourtney. \u201cI kind of looked up and they were BFF, or \u2018wifeys.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut the closeness between Shepherd and Kourtney made things awkward for Kim, who learned from her sister that Shepherd had admitted to feeling \u201cunfulfilled job-wise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s inappropriate for her to talk to you and not to me,\u201d Kim said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little unprofessional? \u2026 That\u2019s like, a convo she should have with me.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 advised her sister to have a conversation with Shepherd, and the two women finally sat down.\n\n\u201cI hate serious conversations. I\u2019m uncomfortable, she\u2019s uncomfortable, I just don\u2019t know what to say \u2026 but I don\u2019t have the time to dance around not being confrontational anymore,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI want to be upfront. I don\u2019t want to be that pushover person.\u201d\n\nBut a little honesty goes a long way \u2014 after their talk, Kim agreed to let Shepherd take on bigger roles in her companies.\n\n\u201cI do want you to feel like you\u2019re fulfilled and doing stuff that you love,\u201d she said, as Shepherd promised to always have Kim\u2019s back \u2014 no matter what her relationships with any Kim\u2019s family members may be.\n\nA visit to Planned Parenthood\n\nBefore Kourtney\u2019s trip to Cannes, the three sisters decided to visit a Planned Parenthood location in Los Angeles to become more informed about a hot-button political issue: \u201cpro-life\u201d lawmakers\u2019 efforts to close Planned Parenthood clinics across the country.\n\nAfter meeting with several employees and patients, the sisters all agreed that the organization is one they wanted to support.\n\n\u201cThe perception of Planned Parenthood is that it\u2019s this like, abortion clinic. That\u2019s nothing like what it\u2019s like,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHearing that firsthand really made it real for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHearing the stories for sure was eye-opening,\u201d Kourtney added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Planned Parenthood now,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said. \u201cMeeting all the girls and hearing their stories and seeing how many women have been helped by some of the services they have to offer \u2014 I think people need to be more educated before they form opinions, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m grateful that I had the opportunity to do today.\u201d\n\nKourtney and Kendall take France\n\nOnce in Cannes, Kendall couldn\u2019t help but notice how \u201cintense\u201d things were between Kourtney and Bendjima, whom she\u2019s been dating since earlier this year and whom family friend Simon Huck called a 24-year-old \u201cstallion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird because I haven\u2019t seen Kourt with another guy in like, 10 years, or however long it\u2019s been,\u201d said Kendall, 21. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s fun. She\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nBut just a couple of days into their trip, paparazzi photos surfaced of Disick flying out of Los Angeles on his way to Cannes with his then-fling, 20-year-old Bella Thorne.\n\n\u201cThey looked so desperate at the airport,\u201d said Kim to Kendall on the phone. \u201cWho goes to LAX together? It\u2019s not a good look for Scott, at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe talked to me it about it,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cHe thinks it is. I said, \u2018Are you nuts? Like, are you actually not well?\u2019 He was like, \u2018I\u2019m doing it to make Kourtney mad.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019re not going to make her mad for the right reasons.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s clear to everyone that Scott is doing this just to try to one-up Kourtney and that seems super malicious,\u201d Kim said. \u201cKourtney is genuinely trying to go away and have a good time. It\u2019s just so ridiculous. I can just see this is not going to end well.\u201d\n\nAs new photos of Kourtney with Bendjima continued to surface, so did photos of Disick cuddling up to a slew of young women, including Thorne, stylist Chloe Bartoli, current flame Sofia Richie and more.\n\nImage zoom KCS Presse/MEGA\n\nImage zoom J. Almasi/GC Images\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online\n\nBack in Los Angeles, Khlo\u00e9 could hardly believe her eyes: \u201cI feel like Kourt is just living her life on the boat with her guy, chilling, and Scott is trying to one-up Kourt with every picture, new girl, new thing, lovey-dovey,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all a jealousy thing,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt\u2019s just nuts.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Splash News\n\nImage zoom Splash News Online\n\nImage zoom BACKGRID\n\nAfter FaceTiming her sister (and meeting Bendjima for the first time!), Khlo\u00e9 encouraged Kourtney to keep living her life \u2014 even if that meant contributing to the ongoing \u201cpicture wars\u201d with her ex.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m watching a ping pong match,\u201d she joked to her sister. \u201cAnyways, you are a class act.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s finally doing something for herself,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 added later. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just proud of her for having fun.\u201d\n\nAs for Kourtney? She called the trip \u201cso fun\u201d and, most importantly, incredibly \u201cfreeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do think this was one of the first times I was really able to separate Scott and what he\u2019s doing and be able to have an amazing time and not worry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to throw anything in anyone\u2019s face, but I\u2019m also not going to hide.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-kardashian-7.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fscott-chloe.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fdisick-thorne-4-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fscott-disick-b-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fkourtney-k-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fkardashian-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-slams-desperate-scott-disick-over-kourtney-kardashian-drama/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Calls Scott Disick 'Desperate' and 'Malicious' During Cannes Fling with Bella Thorne", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kendall Jenner,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,News,Recap,Scott Disick,TV,Younes Bendjima", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kendall Jenner,Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,Kim Kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian,News,Recap,Scott Disick,TV,Younes Bendjima", "description": "On Sunday night's\u00a0Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney Kardashian went public with Younes Bendjima as Scott Disick was photographed with Bella Thorne", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Calls Scott Disick 'Desperate' and 'Malicious' During Cannes Fling with Bella Thorne", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-slams-desperate-scott-disick-over-kourtney-kardashian-drama/", "description": "Scott Disickisn\u2019t thrilled about his ex Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s new man.
