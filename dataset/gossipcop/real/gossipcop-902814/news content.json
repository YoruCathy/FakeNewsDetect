Peace and love. Ringo.\u201d\n\nFun fact: Starr, McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison were all recognized as Members of the Order of the British Empire in 1965.\n\nImage zoom Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr in January 2014 Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nBarry Gibb, the last surviving member of the Bee Gees, dedicated his knighthood to his late bandmates, twin brothers Robin Gibb, who died in 2012, and Maurice Gibb, who died in 2003.\n\n\u201cI want to acknowledge how responsible my brothers are for this honor,\u201d Gibb, 71, said. \u201cIt is as much theirs as it is mine.
