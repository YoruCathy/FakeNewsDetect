However late last night she got vulnerable and real about how acne affects her daily life.\n\n\n\n@thecwriverdaleupdatesembedded via\n\nWhile her character Betty Cooper is always confident and commanding, Lili revealed that she was feeling far from that during an 11 hour photo shoot she had to do yesterday and it all stemmed from her breakouts.\n\nVia lilireinhart\n\nVia lilireinhart\n\nVia lilireinhart\n\nVia liliheinhart\n\nVia liliheinhart\n\nVia liliheinhart\n\nVia liliheinhart\n\nVia liliheinhart\n\nVia lilireinhart\n\nVia lilireinhart\n\nVia liliheinhart\n\nThe full text reads:\n\nAdult acne story time.\n\nI have a cystic breakout on my forehead currently. And I had to do a photoshoot all day long. I've had cystic acne since I was 12. And it has caused major self-esteem issues ever since.\n\nI had to put my biggest insecurity on display. There was nowhere to hide.\n\n20+ people were studying my face on the camera monitor at any given time during the 11 hour shoot. And all I could think about when I was in the front of the camera were the pimples on my forehead.\n\nI always text my mom when I have a bad breakout. I tell her how ugly I feel and how these breakouts shatter my confidence every time they appear.\n\nBut I'm hoping that someday I can feel beautiful even if I'm having a breakout. And that I won't feel obsessive or paranoid.\n\nI feel the need to talk about my struggles with acne. Because maybe if I normalize my broken-out skin, more people... including myself... will be able to feel okay about their skin.\n\nMy breakouts don't define me.\n\nTo anyone out there who feels embarrassed or ashamed by breakouts... I feel you. We have each other. So let's get through this acne experience together.\n\nI'd love to hear your skin stories Write or post about your acne experience under this hashtag I just made up off the top of my head #breakoutbuddy.\n\nVia lilireinhart\n\nShe then ended her story with a photo of her skin fresh-faced and with acne cream on her forehead, captioning the photo with \"thank you for listening\".\n\nAnd while she isn't the first person in the media to come forward about her skin issues, Kendall Jenner did the same when she was shamed for her breakouts while walking the red carpet at the Golden Globes. Both girls have gotten vulnerable about how acne leads to larger issues of low self esteem and insecurities.\n\nHowever Lili's move to creating a support group where acne and breakouts are totally normal are steps in the right direction to removing the stigma around acne.\n\nYou go girl!", "images": ["https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/f75b218864f9842b23b1fbe1d534bf4fa30a7358.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18729422&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/311dcecf92c1324ae2cc0710f35d1249/5B8EB1C0/t51.2885-19/s150x150/25037899_520621978324796_3907835397958270976_n.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BhU9i8igmoX/media?size=l", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/abf98f1ddd4d3b965b26814659c3ea770b36d61e.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/83967d5061dc3aefe0f2cd2c7ff3b120a55b1fe5.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/bff1e4879b3639cdc90ff9eb486aadbd849e9105.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/82c6b713ac3bbdb52a030f00eb1526c3/5B9E93CE/t51.2885-19/s150x150/22709350_104161640351057_2976858806568353792_n.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/14898b651fdc108d874009d82e9510fec7e5d456.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/80e5c8216b7f19a91bbc48520ab895a27d31fd78.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/2aa77e958a636e9fa836dccb2185f0fe311ab840.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/1468efbe940504bb0d7de55dd97f94da7940866f.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BdlCYIGAk33/media?size=l", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/ca6f5a09c2ed50d85de97b67a4f2b2810b2e1b5b.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/3744ffe58e3693cea9bc4f11cdf71a46349b9889.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/e5bbea249723a7280813e668196d42c8931f5516.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=RT5wq1rcy520uW", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/d33e311677406f203f0b1cce2752e0fdf067c573.jpg_640xrel.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/56d19b524f06e291ff953b2bcd7021d3dbdbc5bd.jpg_1200x630.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/56d19b524f06e291ff953b2bcd7021d3dbdbc5bd.jpg_1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/riverdales-lili-reinhart-gets-real-and-vulnerable-about-her-cystic-acne-on-social-media-and-shows-off-her-breakouts", "title": "Riverdale's Lili Reinhart Gets Real About Her Cystic Acne On Social Media While Showing Off Her Breakouts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "template": "Polemos", "fb": {"app_id": 1468563456738953, "pages": 784042488306600}, "description": "Another reason we love her.", "title": "Riverdale's Lili Reinhart Gets Real About Her Cystic Acne On Social Media While Showing Off Her Breakouts", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Another reason we love her.", "title": "Riverdale's Lili Reinhart Gets Real About Her Cystic Acne On Social Media While Showing Off Her Breakouts", "site": "@NarcityCanada", "image": "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/56d19b524f06e291ff953b2bcd7021d3dbdbc5bd.jpg_1200x630.jpg"}, "article": {"section": "Gossip", "publisher": "Narcity", "author": "https://www.narcity.com/author/brittany-rogers", "published_time": "2018-05-22T02:09:00.000Z"}, "og": {"title": "Riverdale's Lili Reinhart Gets Real About Her Cystic Acne On Social Media While Showing Off Her Breakouts", "description": "Another reason we love her.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.narcity.com/u/2018/05/22/56d19b524f06e291ff953b2bcd7021d3dbdbc5bd.jpg_1200x630.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/riverdales-lili-reinhart-gets-real-and-vulnerable-about-her-cystic-acne-on-social-media-and-shows-off-her-breakouts"}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/riverdales-lili-reinhart-gets-real-and-vulnerable-about-her-cystic-acne-on-social-media-and-shows-off-her-breakouts", "app_store_id": 1291431733, "app_name": "Narcity"}, "android": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/riverdales-lili-reinhart-gets-real-and-vulnerable-about-her-cystic-acne-on-social-media-and-shows-off-her-breakouts", "package": "com.narcitymedia.narcity", "app_name": "Narcity"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/gossip/riverdales-lili-reinhart-gets-real-and-vulnerable-about-her-cystic-acne-on-social-media-and-shows-off-her-breakouts"}}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bd738d22d4fc40cea547f834666b428f"}, "ir-site-verification-token": "-1910751629"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526954940.0, "source": "https://www.narcity.com", "summary": ""}
