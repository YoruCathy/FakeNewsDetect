Cunanan opened fire at point-blank range, shooting Versace twice in the back of the head, according to FBI records.\n\nAt the time of his death, Versace was one of the most high-profile fashion designers in the world, dressing the likes of Princess Diana, Madonna and Elton John. His murder, which shocked the nation, is the focus of FX\u2019s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. It premieres Wednesday.\n\nWhat is known about Cunanan and Versace is that the fashion mogul was not Cunanan\u2019s first victim. Cunanan was a serial killer, suspected in four other deaths. He was on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, the subject of a national manhunt, and was hiding out in Miami Beach\u2019s gay scene at the time he killed Versace.\n\nAuthorities believe Cunanan\u2019s killing spree before Versace targeted ex-lovers, including some he may have believed may have given him HIV.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about suspected serial killer Andrew Cunanan:\n\nFour mug shots of Andrew Cunanan, who shot and killed fashion designer Gianni Versace.

The 27-year-old was on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, suspected in the killings of four other people in Minnesota, Illinois and New Jersey. The FBI painted Cunanan as a highly intelligent and dangerous man who desired a life of luxury. The California native, who could speak two languages, dropped out of college and funded his lifestyle thanks to relationships with older, wealthier gay men, federal investigations found. The FBI believes that in addition to working odd jobs, Cunanan was a prostitute.\n\nIn The Assassination of Gianni Versace, Cunanan is played by Glee star Darren Criss.\n\nDiners at the Edgewater Hotel on Miami Beach sit under a large wanted poster of Andrew Cunanan in July 1997 ROBERT SULLIVAN - AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhy did Andrew Cunanan kill Gianni Versace?\n\nTwenty years after the murder, Cunanan\u2019s motive is still unclear. Cunanan and Versace did not know each other, according to People, although they may have briefly met prior to the killing. Federal investigators believed Cunanan may have been targeting gay men. Versace had a longtime boyfriend, Antonio D\u2019Amico. The FBI believed Cunanan may have been seeking revenge on former lovers or clients who may have given him HIV, records show.\n\nDesigner Gianni Versace appearing at a fashion show.

Days later, Cunanan shot and killed his former lover David Madson, 33, and dumped his body near a lake in Minnesota. Then in May, Cunanan repeatedly stabbed Lee Miglin, a 72-year-old Chicago real estate developer and wealthy businessman, according to authorities. He killed William Reese, a 45-year-old cemetery worker in New Jersey, less than a week later. Authorities believe Cunanan targeted Reese so that he could steal his truck.\n\nHow did the hunt for Andrew Cunanan end?\n\nThe investigation into Versace\u2019s murder ended July 23, 1997 \u2014 eight days after the designer\u2019s death \u2014 when Cunanan apparently shot himself to death on a boat house, about two miles away from Versace\u2019s house in Miami Beach. The suicide ended the high-profile manhunt that followed the global news coverage of Versace\u2019s murder.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
