The Oscar-nominated documentarian\u2019s social-media feeds went quiet and his projects were halted\u2014most conspicuously, an unfortunately timed TNT docuseries titled Who Rules the World?, which was to examine the unique issues facing modern women.\n\nThanks to Spurlock\u2019s admission of sexual harassment, it seemed best for him to back away, leaving this project to the network. But Spurlock apparently didn\u2019t make a clean enough break from the series. According to Deadline, Turner Entertainment Networks is now suing Spurlock for botched communication with the network, as well as failing to give back funds that were earmarked for the show.\n\nIn the suit, which was filed on Tuesday in a federal court in Los Angeles, Turner\u2019s lawyers argue that Spurlock\u2019s contract was breached and that he failed to return funds, The Guardian notes. The sum has not been disclosed. Per Deadline, Turner requested financial data from the show once the company took over production, but did not get a response from Spurlock or his production company, Warrior Poets. In addition, it requested Spurlock and his team return production funds, but again did not receive a response.\n\n\u201cUnder information and belief, due to Spurlock\u2019s Twitter confession and the resulting fall-out from the admissions, Warrior Poets is having serious internal problems and may not have the funds to compensate TEN for the breach of contract,\u201d lawyer Neal Levin wrote in the suit, according to The Guardian, asking for an injunction to be placed on Warrior Poets\u2019 account so the production funds would not be \u201cdepleted.\u201d\n\nIssues began arising for Spurlock in December after he posted a confessional essay addressing sexual misconduct claims that had been made about him. He wrote about a girl who accused him of rape in college, though there were ultimately no charges or investigations afterward. \u201cShe believed she was raped. That\u2019s why I\u2019m part of the problem,\u201d Spurlock wrote.\n\nHe also confessed to sexually harassing a former assistant, as well as cheating on all of his past partners. He later wrote on Twitter that he was \u201cseeking help\u201d for his behavior. Shortly afterward, it was announced that Spurlock was stepping down from his position at Warrior Poets. His film Super Size Me 2 was dropped from the Sundance Film Festival lineup, and he lost his executive-producer credit on Showtime\u2019s The Trade. Who Rules the World? was set to be a collaboration with Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s Pretty Matches and Refinery29, but production was halted in December. Representatives for Spurlock and Warrior Poets have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a32e425315a62125eca6882/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/The-Rotten-Apples-Creators%2525202.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d043c5c509c53ae7926b2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2018-oscars-seliger-portrait-studio-Allison-Janney-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d96d53c0f45451fecd64b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2018-oscars-seliger-portrait-studio-Jordan-Peele-ss12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a3298ea315a62125eca6860/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/6352502078239875005046032_22_CNN_140110051.JPG", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9cd10c5c509c53ae792680/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2018-oscars-seliger-portrait-studio-Amy-Adams-ss03-A.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aafedd8affa80574bdbb1ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Cyrus-Vance-Times-Up.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta", "Yohana Dest"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/morgan-spurlock-turner-tnt-docuseries-lawsuit", "title": "Admitted Harasser Morgan Spurlock Sued After Abandoning TV Series About Women\u2019s Issues", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Turner Entertainment Networks claims that requests for Spurlock to return funds for the show have been met with radio silence.", "id": "5abb7f4e1cf4d943d4e35495", "keywords": "television,morgan spurlock,tnt,turner entertainment network", "news_keywords": "television,morgan spurlock,tnt,turner entertainment network", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5abb7f4e1cf4d943d4e35495", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Turner Entertainment Networks claims that requests for Spurlock to return funds for the show have been met with radio silence.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Turner Entertainment Networks claims that requests for Spurlock to return funds for the show have been met with radio silence.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Admitted Harasser Morgan Spurlock Sued After Abandoning TV Series About Women\u2019s Issues", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/morgan-spurlock-turner-tnt-docuseries-lawsuit"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Turner Entertainment Networks claims that requests for Spurlock to return funds for the show have been met with radio silence.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5abb9d80a5d5615ee64a52a9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Morgan-Spurlock.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Admitted Harasser Morgan Spurlock Sued After Abandoning TV Series About Women\u2019s Issues"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
