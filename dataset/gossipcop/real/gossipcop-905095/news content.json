On Monday, the family released a statement calling the show \u201ca work of fiction,\u201d created without their approval. Now, they have gone even further, calling the show\u2019s source material inaccurate.\n\nThe show was based on the book , a best-seller by Maureen Orth. FX released a statement saying they \u201cstand by the meticulous reporting of Ms. Orth,\u201d and Murphy said the book \u201chas been vetted for almost two decades.\u201d\n\nA new statement released Wednesday shows that things are still contentious between the family and the show\u2019s creators. The statement calls the book \u201cfull of gossip and speculation\u201d and \u201cfull of contradictions.\u201d The statement also refers to the show\u2019s portrayal of a \u201cmedical condition,\u201d and Entertainment Weekly reports that they are referring to Orth\u2019s reporting that Versace was HIV-positive at the time of his death; that claim is reportedly depicted in the show, but the Versace family says her reporting \u201cignores contrary information\u201d they provided.\n\nRead the statement in full below:\n\n\u201cAs we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr. Gianni Versace, which should only be considered as a work of fiction. The company producing the series claims it is relying on a book by Maureen Orth, but the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation. Orth never received any information from the Versace family and she has no basis to make claims about the intimate personal life of Gianni Versace or other family members. Instead, in her effort to create a sensational story, she presents second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\n\n\n\n\"As just one example, Orth makes assertions about Gianni Versace\u2019s medical condition based on a person who claims he reviewed a post-mortem test result, but she admits it would have been illegal for the person to have reviewed the report in the first place (if it existed at all). In making her lurid claims, she ignores contrary information provided by members of Mr. Versace\u2019s family, who lived and worked closely with him and were in the best position to know the facts of his life.\n\n\n\n\"Gianni Versace was a brave and honest man, who engaged in humanitarian work for the benefit of others. Of all the possible portrayals of his life and legacy, it is sad and reprehensible that the producers have chosen to present the distorted and bogus version created by Maureen Orth.\n\n\n\nThe Versace family will issue no further comment on the matter.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Friedman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a15051809/versace-family-american-crime-story-statement/", "title": "The Versace Family Rips American Crime Story in Second Statement", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "The Versace Family Rips 'American Crime Story' in Second Statement", "description": "They call the show, and its source material, \u201csad and reprehensible.\"", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a15051809/versace-family-american-crime-story-statement/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2019-10-21 03:55:48", "published_time": "2018-01-10 10:04:00", "section": "Film, TV & Theatre", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Versace Family Issues New Statement About \"The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\"", "description": "\u200bThe Versace family has been in a war of words with FX and Ryan Murphy over the upcoming show, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.", "keywords": "versace family, donatella versace, ryan murphy, fx, american crime story, the assassination of gianni versace, gianni versace, gianni versace death", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.369xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,film-tv", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-10T22:04:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/versace-1515621874.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.369xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "The Versace Family Rips 'American Crime Story' in Second Statement", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515549840.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
