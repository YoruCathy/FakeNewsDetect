Instead, they call themselves life partners. Personally, I wondered about that. What was that about? What\u2019s the reason.\n\nBut in an interview with People, Jada explained.\n\n\u201c I needed a different form to dissolve all the expectations that I had of a marriage. I needed to do that to see Will outside of husband and see him as a human being. We have all these expectations. \u2018Oh, this is what a husband is. This is what a wife is.\u2019 I started dissolving all the ideas and expectations and labels.\u201d\n\nWill will join Jada, her mother Adrienne Banefield-Jones and daughter Willow Smith on the season premiere of \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d on Facebook on October 22.\n\nThe two will discuss their evolving relationship there.\n\n\u201cWill comes on the show for two episodes, and we talk about redefining our relationship, going from calling ourselves married to becoming life partners. I felt like there was a way to speak about that that was open and transparent. But there are still aspects that are private!\u201d\n\nI know there are some who will read this description and write it off as additional evidence to prove Will and Jada have an open relationship or that they swing. But outside of the sexual component, I think we can all admit that there are expectations for married people\u2014moreso for women than men. And if you walk into a relationship believing that you and that person should behave in rigid, pre-defined ways, it can present a problem when you want to do or behave differently.\n\nIt reminds me of the reason Oprah and Stedman have never married.\n\nLast year, Oprah explained that there was a time when she wanted to marry Stedman and a time when he proposed to her. But a book proposal delayed their plans of getting married and eventually the two abandoned the discussion of marriage.\n\nOprah said, \u201cWe would not have stayed together because marriage requires a different way of being in this world. His interpretation of what it means to be a husband and what it would mean for me to be a wife would have been pretty traditional, and I would not have been able to fit into that.\u201d\n\nShonda Rhimes shared a similar sentiment during her sit down with Winfrey for Super Soul Sunday, saying, \u201cWhat I realized is, I don\u2019t want to be married\u2026because I could not have the life that I created for myself.\u201d\n\nMarriage requires compromise. And for women like Oprah and Shonda that might have meant compromising themselves. And that would have been a price to heavy to pay\u2026not only for themselves but for the world.\n\nStill, I think honest conversations about what each party expects in a marriage\u2014before that marriage takes place, could lead to a partnership where both parties still feel free to do and achieve all that they were meant to in the world.\n\nWhat do you think about the idea of not calling yourselves married?\n\nVeronica Wells is the culture editor at MadameNoire.com.
