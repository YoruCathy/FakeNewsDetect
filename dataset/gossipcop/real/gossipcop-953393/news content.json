The Vogue supermodel and her NBA star boyfriend were seen leaving the club, and they looked \u201ctense,\u201d possibly because Tinashe also was at the party.\n\nThis is awkward. Tinashe was, once again, at the same party as Kendall Jenner and Ben Simmons, after it was reported that Ben thought his ex was stalking him!https://t.co/s5ER5CJoeX \u2014 Luca Forzin (@Luca_Forzin) July 19, 2018\n\nTinashe\u2019s tendency to be up at the same Los Angeles-area events \u2014 at least three times in the past month \u2014 has become problematic enough that the Philadelphia 76er has hired extra security, TMZ and other outlets have reported. TMZ said Simmons believes the \u201cAll Hands on Deck\u201d singer has become \u201cobsessed\u201d with him after he dumped her for Jenner.\n\nAn insider told TMZ in early July: \u201cBen is convinced Tinashe cannot accept the fact he ended their relationship and has moved on with Kendall. He believes she\u2019s showing up to keep tabs on him so she can see if there\u2019s a chink in the armor between him and Kendall.\u201d\n\nLast Friday, Tinashe denied being \u201ca stalker,\u201d writing on Instagram stories: \u201cThis narrative has to end\u2026 I\u2019m not a character in some dumb storyline this is MY REAL LIFE.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, I was in love and I got hurt,\u201d she continued, according to E! News. \u201cI know I\u2019m not the first nor will I be the last person to be in this situation. The details of what has happened since are complicated to say the least, but I\u2019ve never lied. And of course I\u2019m not a stalker lol.\u201d\n\n.@Tinashe defends herself against claims that ex-boyfriend Ben Simmons hired security because she was stalking him. Last week, Tinashe was at the same club as Simmons & new GF Kendall Jenner. She told TMZ he was texting her while there with Jenner. Simmons claimed she was lying. pic.twitter.com/qilAKw0S5b \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) July 13, 2018\n\nThe \u201cFlame\u201d singer\u2019s reference to being hurt probably comes from reports that Simmons, 21, cheated on her with 22-year-old model Jenner, who also is a member of the Kardashian reality TV family.\n\nSimmons and Tinashe began dating in March and ended things in May \u2014 around the same time he and Jenner became romantically linked. Simmons and Jenner have never commented on their relationship status or the apparent cheating scandal, but a source told E! News that the two met through mutual friends and quickly developed a \u201cclose friendship\u201d while he was still going out with Tinashe.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time that Jenner has been accused of coming between another woman and an NBA basketball player. Jenner previously was romantically linked to former L.A. Clippers player Blake Griffin, who was sued by his ex-fianc\u00e9e Brynn Cameron for palimony, TMZ reported.\n\nCameron accused Griffin, who has since been traded to the Detroit Pistons, of leaving her and their two children for Jenner, saying he embarrassed \u201chis family with his public fawning over Kendall Jenner,\u201d TMZ said.\n\nThe Tinashe stalking allegations began earlier this month when she showed up at hotspot Delilah on July 5, when Simmons and Jenner also were there. She also turned up at Poppy nightclub last week when they were there.\n\nNow comes Wednesday night, when the lovebirds were back at Delilah at Drake\u2019s party, and Tinashe showed up again, nearly a week after issuing her denial that she was a stalker.
