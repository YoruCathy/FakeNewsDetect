And since Corden and his wife Julia Carey weren\u2019t expecting the baby to arrive for another few weeks, they still don\u2019t have a name picked out. So when the delivering doctor asked for her moniker to fill out the form, Corden panicked and did what we all do in a crisis situation: He looked to Beyonc\u00e9 for help.\n\n\u201cThe doctor asked about a name and I don\u2019t know why I said it and I looked at the doctor and I said, \u2018We\u2019re going to call her Beyonc\u00e9.\u2019 My wife did not think that was funny,\u201d Corden joked on The Late Late Show Thursday night.\n\n\u201cThen a nurse went to the other side of the room and started filling out a form with the name Beyonc\u00e9 and I had to go over to her and go, \u2018Uh, excuse me, there is only one Beyonc\u00e9.\u2019\u201d\n\nImage zoom Getty Images\n\nThe late night host also praised Harry Styles for standing in for him at the last minute when he wasn\u2019t able to tape Tuesday\u2019s show. Corden jokingly told Styles that he would happy to return the favor.\n\nRELATED: Watch Harry Styles Plant a Kiss on James Corden on Holiday-Themed Carpool Karaoke\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know, look, this works both ways man. If you ever need me, I can fill in for you at one of your concerts. You just say the word,\u201d Corden joked. \u201cHe said, \u2018James that won\u2019t be necessary.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat we'd give to see that.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F684xflex%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121517-corden-wife-baby-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3D0yy6VE-7", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121517-corden-wife-baby-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DrT8pAFpe"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121517-corden-wife-baby-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DrT8pAFpe", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Bahou"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/james-corden-initially-named-daughter-beyonce", "title": "James Corden Accidentally Named His Daughter Beyonc\u00e9 Because the Nurse Took Him Seriously", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celebrity,TV Shows,Reviews & Coverage,News,Baby News,James Corden,Beyonce Knowles", "news_keywords": "james corden baby, james corden daughter beyonce, james corden kids", "description": "The late night host accidentally named his newborn daughter after Queen Bey because the nurse took him seriously.", "og": {"title": "James Corden Accidentally Named His Daughter Beyonc\u00e9 Because the Nurse Took Him Seriously", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/james-corden-initially-named-daughter-beyonce", "description": "We\u2019re laughing now, but his wife did NOT think it was funny.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121517-corden-wife-baby-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DrT8pAFpe"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/james-corden-initially-named-daughter-beyonce", "description": "The late night host accidentally named his newborn daughter after Queen Bey because the nurse took him seriously.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121517-corden-wife-baby-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DrT8pAFpe"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/james-corden-initially-named-daughter-beyonce", "title": "James Corden Accidentally Named His Daughter Beyonc\u00e9 Because the Nurse Took Him Seriously", "description": "We\u2019re laughing now, but his wife did NOT think it was funny.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F121517-corden-wife-baby-lead.jpg%3Fitok%3DrT8pAFpe"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/87cb1JXoLho?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
