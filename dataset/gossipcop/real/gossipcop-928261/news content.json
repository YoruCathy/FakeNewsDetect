And more recently, fans of Keeping Up With the Kardashians were shocked by the scandals that hit Khloe and her NBA boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. While Khloe went on record as saying Tristan was one of the best men she ever dated, her world was rocked when videos and photos surfaced of him hanging out with other women during their relationship. Not only that, but Khloe was nine months pregnant with his child when the photos came to light.\n\nWhile Khloe and Tristan seem to be trying to work things out for the good of their daughter, True, it seems fans will never forgive him. Here\u2019s why.\n\nThe cheating scandal showed Tristan with several women, not just one\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson | Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson | Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian via Instagram\n\nWe all have lapses in judgment \u2014 and fans may be more forgiving of Tristan if he had a slip-up with just one woman on one occasion. The footage shared by Daily Mail Online and TMZ showed several occasions of Tristan all over other women during his relationship with Khloe, Cosmopolitan reports. Not only did he fall out of favor with fans when the footage was released, but it has many questioning whether he really has the capacity to change after so much shady behavior.\n\nThe first video released by Daily Mail Online showed Tristan kissing another woman in an NYC bar, says Cosmo. And another video showed Tristan cheating on Khloe with two separate women while in a hookah lounge in Washington, D.C. The D.C. footage also allegedly occurred two weeks after Khloe\u2019s pregnancy hit the media, too, making this act extra unforgivable.\n\nKim doesn\u2019t trust Tristan despite his apologies\n\nKhloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson, and their mothers | Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson, and their mothers | Tristan Thompson via Instagram\n\nIf all the Kardashians and Jenners forgave Tristan, perhaps fans would be more willing to give him a second chance. But People notes Kim was questioning Tristan\u2019s sincerity after he showed remorse. On Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kris expressed that she believed Tristan\u2019s apology wholeheartedly, but Kim didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cI told him, \u2018I think you\u2019re more remorseful because it\u2019s affecting your job,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s more embarrassed that he looks stupid, \u2019cause [of] the public \u2026 booing him. And I think it\u2019s more of that than anything, and I told him that.\u201d\n\nKim did hear him out off camera, however, and she didn\u2019t want to cause any unnecessary tension for Khloe. Even so, Kim\u2019s heart broke when she revealed Khloe really believed in creating a family with Tristan \u2014 and this made fans even angrier.\n\nHe also made a nasty gesture to basketball fans\n\nTristan still can\u2019t seem to catch a break with the media even months after the cheating scandal had been dealt with. People notes at the end of a Cavaliers game he was playing in, video footage from TMZ seemed to show Tristan giving the middle finger to a crowd full of Brooklyn Nets fans after the Nets missed their final three-point shot. He was then serviced with a $15,000 fine for the gesture.\n\nThe publication reminds us this isn\u2019t the first time fans saw Tristan get heated on the court, either. He also reportedly had an altercation with Ben Simmons from the Philadelphia \u201976ers (who was rumored to be dating Kendall Jenner at the time). The two NBA players had to be separated \u2014 and it certainly didn\u2019t help Tristan\u2019s standing with the Kardashian family or Khloe fans.\n\nAre Khloe and Tristan still together? Fans think they\u2019ve secretly broken up\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson | Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson | Khloe Kardashian via Instagram\n\nSince the birth of True, Khloe has been totally tight-lipped about her relationship with Tristan. And while it\u2019s assumed they\u2019re still together and making things work for the good of their child, Cosmopolitan notes some fans think they could be secretly broken up.\n\nAs for why fans think Khloe\u2019s single, her Instagram posts are a big clue. She hasn\u2019t posted any recent photos of her and Tristan together, and she\u2019s been posting emotional messages of love and encouragement to her fans that are also a big concern. Not only that, but she seems to only refer to Tristan as \u201cTrue\u2019s dad\u201d instead of her boyfriend.\n\nIf Khloe and Tristan are broken up, many fans would rejoice and hope Khloe can finally find the man she deserves. We\u2019ll have to wait and see what the future holds.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Khloe-Kardashian-Tristan-Thompson.png?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/khloekardashiantristanthompsonbirthday.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Khloe-kardashian-and-Tristian-Thompson-e1533151653372.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Khloe-kardashian-and-Tristian-Thompson-e1533151653372.png?x62514"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Khloe-kardashian-and-Tristian-Thompson-e1533151653372.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Weiler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-khloe-kardashian-fans-will-never-forgive-tristan-thompson.html/", "title": "Why Khloe Kardashian Fans Will Never Forgive Tristan Thompson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/why-khloe-kardashian-fans-will-never-forgive-tristan-thompson.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Khloe Kardashian may forgive Tristan Thompson for cheating on her, but it's unlikely fans ever will.
