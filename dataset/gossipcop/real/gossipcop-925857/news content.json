But for those in the know, the much-anticipated WrestleMania 34 was like the Super Bowl meets the Oscars meets Christmas morning. The seven-hour event at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans produced plenty of action and surprises, and naturally, a few memorable moments turned into social media memes.\n\nPerhaps the funniest meme came from John Cena. The WWE star was sitting in the crowd in civilian clothes when a uniformed official whispered something in his ear (NOT STAGED AT ALL), and suddenly Cena was off like a prom dress.\n\nJohn Cena sprinting up the ramp about to become a meme \u2014 Bill Barnwell (@billbarnwell) April 9, 2018\n\nFans had many ideas as to why Cena was running, and the snarky captions flew.\n\nBae: come over\n\n\n\nCena: I can\u2019t, I\u2019m at Wrestlemania\n\n\n\nBae: I have a free house\n\n\n\nCena: https://t.co/iUDyP1oXLD \u2014 Charlie Beckett (@Charlie_Beckett) April 9, 2018\n\nThe oven timer went off. Completely normal. \u2014 DiGiorno (@DiGiorno) April 9, 2018\n\nCena when he heard that news pic.twitter.com/HBmwX9Fqp8 \u2014 H\u039ermDray (@HermDray) April 9, 2018\n\nThat referee just told John Cena there's a 2 for 1 sale on jean shorts down the street #WrestleMania \u2014 Mitch Waddon (@MitchWaddon) April 9, 2018\n\nWhen you hear about that an early screening for Avengers Infinity War is starting in 5 minutes \u2014 Mark G. (@markstrange341) April 9, 2018\n\nMe running away from my problems \u2014 Precious\ud83c\udf39\u2728 (@precious_xo8) April 9, 2018\n\nThings the ref might have said to Cena:\n\n\n\n1) They are towing your car\n\n3) you\u2019re late for a make a wish appointment\n\n2) Golddust is in the back and he\u2019s autographing posters \u2014 Jeff Cannata (@jeffcannata) April 9, 2018\n\nNo oven timer, no Infinity War screening (we've got a new TV spot, though). Instead, Cena was racing to a match with the out-of-retirement, 53-year-old Undertaker. And in just a few minutes, the Undertaker undertook to take him under.\n\nThe match you thought you would NEVER see...is LIVE on @WWENetwork, and The #Undertaker just went OLD SCHOOL on @JohnCena! #WrestleMania pic.twitter.com/DBII59qVS7 \u2014 WWE Network (@WWENetwork) April 9, 2018\n\nthe undertaker vs. john cena feud/match summed up in three pictures pic.twitter.com/HnhvsBnBqo \u2014 el idolo gang (@TeeHaitchGee) April 9, 2018\n\nHe's like 80...he got tired walking down the ramp.

LET THE MAN RETIRE!!!! pic.twitter.com/iXdBTXmZ16 \u2014 Two Drink Minimum (@Surreal469) April 9, 2018\n\nplease stop complaining. Taker probably wanted another match but knew he couldn't deliver a 5 star. Just enjoy the moment. \u2014 Jared Davis (@Jared_Banner) April 9, 2018\n\nY\u2019all would complain about anything. That match was 3 minutes long. Who care!? It\u2019s the Undertaker! \u2014 Steven Edward Goff (@StevenEdwardGof) April 9, 2018\n\nMad respect to John Cena. Did the honours for the Undertaker. Now he can ride off into the sunset. #WrestleMania \u2014 Chamatkar Sandhu (@SandhuMMA) April 9, 2018\n\nIn other matches of note, Ronda Rousey, former UFC women's bantamweight champ, made her WWE debut with a tribute to the style of her idol, the late \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper.\n\nRousey and partner Kurt Angle defeated Stephanie McMahon and Triple H. CBS Sports dubbed Rousey \"WWE's newest full-time superstar,\" and fans had plenty to say, too.\n\nRonda Rousey just became a Top 5 favorite female wrestler of all time. Amazing first match. She carried her team. I repeat she CARRIED KURT ANGLE #wrestlemania \u2014 AK the Great (@AKSoGreat) April 9, 2018\n\nAs an absolute Rousey hater, she was absolutely great tonight in her first #WWE match. Very entertaining match \u2014 Vincent Clinco (@RealVinnyClinco) April 9, 2018\n\nCelebrating Ronda Rousey winning her WWE debut is like celebrating the Little Giants beating the Cowboys. It was written that way. \u2014 Travon Free (@Travon) April 9, 2018\n\nYeah, Ronda Rousey is gonna do just fine after MMA. \u2014 Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful.com (@SeanRossSapp) April 9, 2018\n\nBut perhaps the biggest reaction of the night came when Daniel Bryan made his WWE return after battling years of injuries and health problems. Is Bryan back? One word for that:\n\nYES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES#WrestleMania @WWEDanielBryan pic.twitter.com/N5FfpPeEDA \u2014 WWE (@WWE) April 9, 2018\n\nDid you have what meg Ryan was having? #wrestlemania \u2014 The Common Man (@commonmanpod) April 9, 2018\n\nWhy is there someone cutting onions in my kitchen? \u2014 DELETER OF WORLDS (@orbitalheel) April 9, 2018\n\nNO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOO... I\u2019ll take Randy Orton, John Cena, Edge, Chris Jericho, CM Punk, Shawn Michaels & Triple H... the great wrestlers; not this guy whose greatest achievement is marrying a Bella twin. He can\u2019t carry the mantle. But he\u2019s a nice guy. \u2014 \ud83d\udc2cNotMyPresident\ud83d\udc2c (@Chris6375) April 9, 2018\n\nDaniel Bryan the sam Bradford of wwe \u2014 Tony X.
