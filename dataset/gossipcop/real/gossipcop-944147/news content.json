How would making guacamole help with his life?\" Corden replied, referencing Porowski's not-so-secret love of avocados.\n\nClad in a hoodie and an ill-fitting T-shirt and pants, Young first met with Berk about transforming his sad outdoor space at work. \"We like succulents. I collect them,\" Young told Berk, 36, of his aesthetic. \"I have them at my house. I pick them when I go for a walk.\"\n\nWhile Corden lamented that plant picking sounds \"depressing,\" Berk easily decided on an Arabian Nights theme for the drab space.\n\nFrance was up next and opted to throw away Young's entire wardrobe after hearing that the guitarist was striving \"to look like James Bond.\" Instead, Young looked like 007 \"sort of going through an emotional break down,\" as Corden put it.\n\nThen it was Porowski's turn to talk healthy eating and he suggested a quick snack consisting of a banana with peanut butter, cinnamon, honey, and Chia seeds. Next up was Brown, 37, who schooled Young and Corden on how to do sit-ups and squats.\n\n.@antoni is serving and we're eating it all up! pic.twitter.com/0yIhEF27Iq \u2014 Queer Eye (@QueerEye) June 13, 2018\n\nThe real transformation came from Van Ness, 35, who took Young's scraggly beard and wild hair \u2014 which Corden thought made Young look \"a hipster version of Donald Trump's doctor\" \u2014 and tamed it into a Bachelorette-contestant-worthy swoop.\n\nThe Fab 5 are on the @latelateshow tonight and we\u2019re whipping our hair with excitement. \ud83e\udd29 pic.twitter.com/ijcMe7NV59 \u2014 Queer Eye (@QueerEye) June 13, 2018\n\nThe final reveal took place on the twinkle light, succulent-filled pillow fort that Berk designed. With a stylish brown jacket, a gray henley top and black pants and loafers, Young said his wife would think he was a \"handsome devil\" following his makeover.\n\nThe Fab Five recently sat down with ET's Courtney Tezeno to dish about season two. \"We have women. We have amazing women. We have an amazing trans man we get to work with,\" Van Ness said of the people whom the Fab Five help out during the show's upcoming season.\n\n\"And you get to know us a little more as well,\" France, 35, added. \"It takes a deeper dive into who we all are also.\"\n\n\"You get to see our little quirks as well,\" Porowski chimed in. \"It's fun.\"\n\nHere's more on Queer Eye's upcoming second season:\n\n'Queer Eye:' The Fab Five Dish on Fan Mail and Dream Guest Stars (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
