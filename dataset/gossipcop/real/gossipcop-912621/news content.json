She is set to play Kathryn Siddell-Bauers, a \"controlling L.A. mom who is far less cheerful than her Lululemons imply\" according to TVLine.\n\nThe eight-episode comedy is adapted from the British series of the same name and centers around a camping trip celebrating Kathryn's husband's 45th birthday. However, things go south when her docile sister, holier-than-thou ex-bestie and a free-spirited crasher gather in one place. The weekend will see marriages tested and friends clashing.\n\nGarner's starring role in Camping marks her first major TV role since Alias in which she starred from 2001-2006 alongside Michael Vartan and Victor Garber. She currently lends her voice to the Netflix animated series Llama Llama.\n\nJennifer Garner, Alias\" data-image-credit=\"Mitch Haaseth, ABC via Getty Images\" data-image-alt-text=\"Jennifer Garner, Alias\" data-image-credit-url=\"\" data-image-target-url=\"\" data-image-title=\"Jennifer Garner, Alias\" data-image-filename=\"180208-jennifergarneralias2-news.jpg\" data-image-date-created=\"2018/02/08\" data-image-crop=\"\" data-image-crop-gravity=\"\" data-image-aspect-ratio=\"\" data-image-height=\"1380\" data-image-width=\"2070\" data-image-do-not-crop=\"\" data-image-do-not-resize=\"\" data-image-watermark=\"\" data-lightbox=\"\">\n\nOther Links From TVGuide.com Lena DunhamJennifer Garner", "images": ["https://www.starnewsonline.com/storyimage/ZZ/20180208/ENTERTAINMENT/302089934/AR/0/AR-302089934.jpg", "https://www.starnewsonline.com/Global/images/head/nameplate/starnewsonline_logo.png", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9289482&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.starnewsonline.com/storyimage/ZZ/20180208/ENTERTAINMENT/302089934/AR/0/AR-302089934.jpg&MaxH=200&MaxW=200"], "top_img": "https://www.starnewsonline.com/storyimage/ZZ/20180208/ENTERTAINMENT/302089934/AR/0/AR-302089934.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tv Guide"], "canonical_link": "http://www.tvguide.com/news/jennifer-garner-lena-dunham-camping/?rss=breakingnews&partnerid=gatehouse&profileid=breaking", "title": "Jennifer Garner Returns to TV for Lena Dunham's New HBO Comedy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Wilmington Star News", "title": "Jennifer Garner Returns to TV for Lena Dunham's New HBO Comedy", "description": "Jennifer Garner is headed back to television and this time, she won't be needing any colorful wigs.
