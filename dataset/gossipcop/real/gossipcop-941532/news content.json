Faces in the crowd included Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos, CBS\u2019 Leslie Moonves and Paramount\u2019s Jim Gianopulos, just to name a few.\n\nDiane Keaton, last year\u2019s AFI honoree, took the stage early to marvel at Clooney\u2019s distant relationship with former president Abraham Lincoln and rib him over that \u201cKiller Tomatoes\u201d sequel he\u2019s never quite lived down. Laura Dern remembered cutting her teeth with Clooney in failed horror project \u201cGrizzly II: The Concert.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, returning to the Dolby stage for the first time since the 90th annual Academy Awards in March, regaled with stories of \u201crascal\u201d Clooney\u2019s infamous practical jokes, which have apparently included sending packages to Brad Pitt labeled \u201cthe porn that you ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox went ahead and took credit for Clooney\u2019s rise thanks to their hit NBC show being the lead-in for \u201cER\u201d all those years ago. \u201cWithout us you\u2019re \u2018Chicago Hope,\u2019 buddy,\u201d Cox quipped. Meanwhile a teary-eyed Julianna Margulies told the story of her \u201cER\u201d character\u2019s original fate in the pilot (she was to die of a drug overdose), and how Clooney went to bat for her to stick around with a recurring role. Clooney \u2014 his wife Amal by his side, the pair flanked by actor Bill Murray and Clooney\u2019s father Nick \u2014 was visibly touched by her comments.\n\nIn video packages filmed at Cinecitta Studios in Rome, where Clooney is in pre-production on his upcoming \u201cCatch-22\u201d adaptation, the Oscar-winning multi-hyphenate recalled how his cousin, the late actor Miguel Ferrer, coaxed Clooney out to the west coast for a stab at acting. Clooney also commended \u201cFrom Dusk Till Dawn\u201d director Robert Rodriguez for giving him a real break in movies and noted the wake-up call of 1997 superhero stinker \u201cBatman & Robin,\u201d which made him realize he needed to focus as much on the creative aspects of his projects as on his own work in front of the camera.\n\nThe clip that drew the biggest burst of applause from those gathered in the ballroom and the mezzanine above was Joel and Ethan Coen\u2019s \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve played four idiots for them,\u201d Clooney said of his work with the sibling filmmakers. \u201cThey saw in me the brilliance of my idiocy.\u201d Miley Cyrus even stopped by with a back-up band wielding fiddles and banjos for a rendition of the film\u2019s hit arrangement of \u201cMan of Constant Sorrow.\u201d\n\nClooney\u2019s ties to journalism (via his father\u2019s newsroom background) and commitment to philanthropy through aid to Darfur, Haiti and post-Katrina New Orleans, among other causes, became something of a recurring theme. AFI trustee Howard Stringer even evoked Clooney\u2019s 2005 Oscar-nominated biopic \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d which centered on pioneering newsman Edward R. Murrow. Calling the drama \u201ceerily prophetic,\u201d Stringer deemed it a movie that \u201cshould be required for modern journalists, as well as modern politicians.\u201d\n\nDon Cheadle recalled something Clooney once told him about having a platform such as he does: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to put the cameras on me, then I\u2019m going to take them to where the cameras should be.\u201d Clooney, meanwhile, spoke in the pre-taped material about his affinity for reluctant heroes and characters who stood up against the system in films like \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d \u201cHigh Noon,\u201d \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe learned to question things from my father,\u201d the night\u2019s honoree said of the elder Clooney, who offered his own toast near the end of the evening that brought his son close to tears.\n\nAnd for the first time publicly, Amal Clooney also spoke about her husband. \u201cComing here I knew there would be lots of people who could speak to George\u2019s talent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I thought I should say a few words about his character. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word and a way that seems so rare these days and perhaps outdated. Everyone who knows him will tell you he has not forgotten his Kentucky manners. On every set I visit his crews tell me he stands up for the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nOther speakers included Murray, Richard Kind, Anna Kendrick, Cate Blanchett and, via pre-taped well-wishes, Julia Roberts and former president Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI love being a part of this industry and community,\u201d Clooney said when he finally took the stage to close out the night. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the much overdue changes I\u2019m seeing now, and above all I want to thank everyone who came out tonight to say such beautiful things \u2026 and Jimmy Kimmel. I love every rotten one of you.\u201d Actress Shirley MacLaine presented him with the AFI honor.\n\nClooney is an eight-time Oscar nominee across multiple disciplines (acting, directing, producing and writing). He won the film Academy\u2019s supporting actor prize for his performance in 2005\u2019s \u201cSyriana\u201d and the best picture award for Ben Affleck\u2019s 2012 thriller \u201cArgo.\u201d He and Amal welcomed twins almost exactly a year ago.\n\nThat was just another of Clooney\u2019s practical jokes, Kimmel quipped. \u201cOn Amal\u2019s uterus.\u201d\n\nHonored earlier in the evening with AFI\u2019s Franklin J. Schaffner Award, for accomplished alumni, was \u201cMudbound\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d cinematographer Rachel Morrison. Morrison, who became the first woman ever nominated for a cinematography Oscar earlier this year, noted how when she attended the institute, there were six women in a class of 28, \u201cwhich seemed progressive at the time.\u201d She praised AFI\u2019s commitment to closing the gap on 50/50 gender parity in its program. Diversity behind the camera \u201ccan only lead to beauty, acceptance and a more expansive world view,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nTNT will air \u201cAFI Life Achievement Award: A Tribute to George Clooney,\u201d an hour-and-a-half edit of the evening\u2019s festivities, on June 21.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Fawards%2Fgeorge-clooney-afi-lifetime-achievement-award-1202837152%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202837152&comment_count=7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/george.jpg?w=1000"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/george.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kristopher Tapley"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/awards/george-clooney-afi-lifetime-achievement-award-1202837152/", "title": "Barack Obama, Miley Cyrus and Bill Murray Toast AFI Honoree George Clooney", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Hollywood\u2019s elite turned out Thursday night at the Dolby Theatre, home of the Oscars, to pay tribute to George Clooney, this year\u2019s American Film Institute Life Achievement Award recipient.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202837152, "author": "Kristopher Tapley", "pmc-category": "Awards,In The Running,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-06-07T23:12:15"}, "pmc-tag": "AFI,AFI Lifetime Achievement Award,George Clooney", "title": "Barack Obama, Miley Cyrus and Bill Murray Toast AFI Honoree George Clooney", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "film,scene", "pmc-primary-category": "Awards", "pmc-primary-vertical": "film", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Barack Obama, Miley Cyrus and Bill Murray Toast AFI Honoree George Clooney", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/awards/george-clooney-afi-lifetime-achievement-award-1202837152/", "description": "Hollywood\u2019s elite turned out Thursday night at the Dolby Theatre, home of the Oscars, to pay tribute to George Clooney, this year\u2019s American Film Institute Life Achievement Award recipient.
