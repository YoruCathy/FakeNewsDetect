The star is looking forward to being old enough to drink. During an interview with BuzzFeed on Friday, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was asked about what she\u2019s looking forward to the most about being in her 20\u2019s.\n\nThe reality star turned 20-years-old just one day before.\n\nShe claimed, \u201cProbably turning 21. I feel like that\u2019s fun. You know, I\u2019ve never had a drink before so I just wanna know what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nSomething tells us she\u2019s fibbing here. Is it really possible she\u2019s never had a drink in her entire life?\n\nIn case you missed it, back in 2013, Kylie and her sister Kendall who were 15 and 17 at the time sparked rumors they were drinking illegally at a nightclub.\n\n? A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Aug 11, 2017 at 2:58pm PDT\n\nTheir mom, Kris Jenner, said to E! news, \u201cthey don\u2019t have fake ID\u2019s and they don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\nKylie later tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint, but Kendall & I will not grow up to be let downs. I know that\u2019s what some people would, unfortunately, like to see\u2026but I\u2019m not going to sit around and let grown adults create untrue stories about me underage drinking & partying every night with a fake I.D.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Kylie was at a club in Montreal where she held her 18th birthday.\n\nIn the French speaking city of Canada, she was promoting a party there and was not seen drinking any alcohol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGood for her! During an appearance on the show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, the star said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on drinking,\u201d because her mom appeared to be worried the star would partake in intoxicated festivities.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chris-brown-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kourtney-Kardashian-and-Reign-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tris-and-Khloe-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kylie-Jenner--e1502488890409.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5b75db9b6d10b.image_-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gabrielle-union-kaavia-dwayne-wade-1-300x169.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kylie-Jenner-Claps-Back-At-Trolls-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kim-Kardashian--700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jada-pinkett-smith-300x184.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen_Shot_2020_01_26_at_5.00.03_PM.0.0-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kylie-Jenner--e1502488890409.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Shirley Temple", "Sheila Louise Bryant", "Lisa Legrano"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kylie-jenner-says-shes-never-had-a-drink-before-she-cant-wait-to-turn-21-58764/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Says She\u2019s Never Had A Drink Before \u2013 She Can\u2019t Wait To Turn 21", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "kuwk, kylie jenner, life of kylie,", "keywords": "celebrity news, kuwk, kylie jenner, life of kylie,", "description": "As CI readers know, Kylie is 20-years-old now, but she can't wait to turn 21.
