Watson said she took them off before her appointment but forgot to retrieve them afterward. Watson called the spa and was told the jewelry was not in the locker.\n\nBEN AFFLECK\u2019S MALE KISSING SCENE MADE HIM A \u2018SERIOUS ACTOR,\u2019 KEVIN SMITH SAYS\n\n\u201cWere these just any rings I could accept this, but one of them was gift from my Mum,\u201d the 27-year-old wrote. \u201cShe bought it the day after I was born and wore it for 18 years, never taking it off, and then gave it to me for my 18th birthday. I wear this ring everyday, it is my most meaningful and special possession.\u201d\n\nWatson then wrote that if anyone has any information to email: findthering@outlook.com. The actress also included a picture of the rings including a close-up of her mother\u2019s ring.\n\n\u2018GAME OF THRONES\u2019 DIRECTOR SPEAKS OUT ABOUT ED SHEERAN\u2019S CAMEO IN SEASON PREMIERE\n\nWatson said her mother\u2019s ring helped inspire jewelry she wore in the Disney live-action film \"Beauty and the Beast,\" according to Buzzfeed.\n\n\u201cThe costume designer saw that I had one which my mom had given me, and she was like, \u2018Can I design one for Belle?\u2019 because Belle\u2019s mother dies when she\u2019s really young,\u201d Watson told the outlet.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I was really proud of the ring and thought it was so beautiful that I asked if I could keep one and they said I could.\u201d", "images":
