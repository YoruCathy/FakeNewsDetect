We are all trying to survive in these frigid temperatures, but let your mind drift away to the summer months as Governors Ball announced their extensive 2018 lineup. Eminem , Travis Scott , Jack White and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs are all set to headline.\n\nEminem is currently promoting his new album Revival, so it's no surprise that he made it to the top of the Gov Ball bill (despite the record getting critically panned). We haven't heard much from Jack White or the Yeah Yeah Yeahs recently, so their showing could mean there is new music\u2014or a new album\u2014right around the corner. As for the rest of the lineup? Travis Scott, Halsey and the other younger acts all made their presence known in 2017 and seeimingly plan to continue that winning streak this year.\n\nGovernors Ball makes its return to Randall\u2019s Island Park in New York City from June 1-3. Get those group chats with your reliable friends prepped as you read this, because 3-day GA and VIP tickets (including payment plan options) are available right now at the fest's official website. It is currently at a special \u201cAnnounce Day\u201d pricing until 11:59:59pm EST. Regular pricing will kick off tomorrow (Jan. 4) at 12:00am EST.\n\nNext, watch Eminem talk about fellow superstar Lady Gaga back at Bonnaroo in 2011.", "images": ["https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/blte8181b8b0df013c6/5cab7a07037f9c9d783e6db5/The_Roots_Picnic.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://player.ooyala.com/static/v4/stable/4.24.11/skin-plugin/assets/images/loader_svg.svg", "https://www.fuse.tv/static/fuse-logo-black.svg", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/blt747a58612f5985fc/5cc8a417887e04ba69170552/Real_Street_Festival_Header.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/bltd2168a4fe7d04f91/5ccc7a1bee4bf29d69c5a9fa/Rolling_Loud_Festival_Event_Header.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/blt6a11fe88c5cb6f02/5d30968fc780b1161fc573ad/Lolla_Excited_Header.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.fuse.tv/static/fuse-logo.svg", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/RzwYztYt-720.jpg", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/blt4aeaeac1d5ad0726/5db1fa100b39e86c2f83e5ef/Events_Hub_HEADER.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/blt6bc69c248b69c1aa/5cbe043d5e2924fa1e66769e/Armin_FUSE.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/bltbc819049eadb8413/5b0668d551833b696f972738/gov-ball-2018-split.jpg", "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/blta0c32cdb7f68faa7/5b0649a47df2b6bc7146fafb/bianca-gracie-contributor-page-photo.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt1b60905dd65bfb9b/bltbc819049eadb8413/5b0668d551833b696f972738/gov-ball-2018-split.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Festival Szn"], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Governors Ball 2018 Lineup: Eminem, Travis Scott, Jack White, Yeah Yeah Yeahs & More", "meta_data": {"description": "Halsey, N.E.R.D., Khalid, Post Malone, Lil Uzi Vert, Diplo, Chvrches, Galantis and more will also be performing at the summer fest", "fb": {"pages": 10262075277, "app_id": 1272603569472546}, "og": {"site_name": "Fuse", "title": "Governors Ball 2018: See Who's Headlining the Fest", "description": "Eminem, Travis Scott, Jack White and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs will be headlining Governors Ball 2018!
