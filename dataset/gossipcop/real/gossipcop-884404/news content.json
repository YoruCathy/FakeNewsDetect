Here's what they said:\n\nFrankie is ready to bust out his best boy band dance moves -- with help from another contestant!\n\n\"My guilty pleasure is that I'm a big fan of boy bands,\" the Malcolm in the Middlestar revealed to ET's Katie Krause at Knott's Scary Farm on Friday night. \"Normally I wouldn't admit that, but you know what? I'm already wearing sequins and dancing in front of millions of people -- I can go ahead and throw out there the fact that I like boy bands! So, we're dancing to *NSYNC's 'It's Gonna Be Me.' I love the song and we do do a little breakdown, a little boy band thing in there, but most of it's samba. The boy band thing's a little more in my element than the samba, but my hips just don't move!\"\n\n\"I'm gonna blame my broken back that that's why my hips don't move, just to warn you guys,\" he added.\n\nFrankie also told ET that he asked 98 Degrees' Nick for help on the helps. Stay tuned to ETonline.com today for more on that story!\n\nNikki Bella is all about the sexy romance novels.\n\n\"I love them,\" she gushed. \"I'm not too into Fabio style. I would rather have a Viking steal me on a boat and watch him fight and then come back on and take me away. That's hot. I like it when he gets super manly.\"\n\nEmma says the choreography for Drew's dance is her \"most interesting yet.\"\n\n\"I can tell you, Sasha [Farber] is in our number,\" she exclaimed at Knott's Scary Farm. \"There may be a crime of passion going on... basically, we're going to have the funnest themed week ever on Dancing With the Stars. I don't know how much I can tell you, but it might have something to do with true crime. Forensic Files is Drew's guilty pleasure and all I gotta say is, it's the most interesting dance I've ever had to choreograph ever.\"\n\nJordan Fisher's routine is \"very fast and very hard\" -- but he's ready to nail it!\n\n\"We will be superheroes,\" he said at Knott's Scary Farm. \"I'm a massive comic book, superhero fan. So, The Incredibles, the Disney Pixar movie, it's my favorite Pixar movie ever. I feel like it's the best visual representation of a comic book, and the theme song for it is so recognizable ... it's AWESOME. It's very fun.\"\n\nDerek is channeling one of Will Smith's most iconic characters.\n\n\"[Sharna and I] are just going to have fun,\" the former NBA pro teased. \"That, to me, is what this is about.\"\n\n\"For several years, late after a game, traveling [with] the Lakers... you get to the hotel at two in the morning, you're still up and can't go to sleep,\" he continued. \"And The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is on! So, we'll have kind of a Fresh Prince theme.\"\n\nSocial media teases.\n\nBelow, see more of the best moments that the dancing duos have shared over social media as they gear up to take the stage to perform again on Monday:\n\nAre YOU excited for season 25 of Dancing With the Stars?
