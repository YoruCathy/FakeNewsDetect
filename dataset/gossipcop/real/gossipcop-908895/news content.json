I\u2019m busy, I\u2019m doing it all by myself so the days do go by and my thing is I\u2019d rather not see him every week because I feel time goes by slower. This way, it is going quick,\u201d Teresa, 45, told E! News on Wednesday, January 24. \u201cI do miss him but I feel like everything happens for a reason and maybe we needed this time apart to help us get stronger together. I just go with it. This is what God wanted. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the Bravo personality served 11 months in federal prison in 2015 after she and Joe, also 45, were indicted on 39 counts, including bankruptcy fraud. He began his 41-month sentence in March 2016.\n\nThe Standing Strong author made headlines after sharing a photo to Instagram on January 6 with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, \u201cDinner with a great friend getting great advice\u201d before quickly changing it to \u201cDinner with a great friend lots of laughs\u201d with the hashtag \u201c#webothlovefood.\u201d\n\nDuring Teresa\u2019s January 10 appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. \u201cI was helping her. Just in case \u2013 If anybody\u2019s getting divorced, she\u2019s a great divorce attorney to call,\u201d she explained at the time. \u201cGet it? I was helping her.\u201d\n\nThe television personality\u2019s attorney James Leonard Jr. also shut down split rumors. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain\u2019t happening. Period,\u201d Leonard exclusively told Us Weekly earlier this month. \u201cWhy can\u2019t people accept the fact that these two people simply want to stay married to one another and let them live their lives?\u201d\n\nTeresa and Joe tied the knot in October 1999 and are parents of four daughters: Gia, 17, Gabriella, 13, Milania, 11, and Audriana, 7. They have documented their lives on RHONJ since April 2008.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/joe-giudice-teresa-giudice.jpg?crop=72px%2C0px%2C1644px%2C928px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/joe-giudice-teresa-giudice.jpg?crop=125px%2C0px%2C1545px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/joe-giudice-teresa-giudice.jpg?crop=125px%2C0px%2C1545px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teresa-giudice-why-id-rather-not-see-joe-every-week/", "title": "Teresa Giudice: Why I\u2019d Rather Not See Joe Every Week", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Real Housewives of New Jersey\u2019 star Teresa Giudice opened up about why she\u2019d rather not see her husband, Joe Giudice, every week in jail \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Teresa Giudice: Why I\u2019d Rather Not See Joe Every Week", "description": "\u2018Real Housewives of New Jersey\u2019 star Teresa Giudice opened up about why she\u2019d rather not see her husband, Joe Giudice, every week in jail \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teresa-giudice-why-id-rather-not-see-joe-every-week/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:00:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/joe-giudice-teresa-giudice.jpg?crop=125px%2C0px%2C1545px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/joe-giudice-teresa-giudice.jpg?crop=125px%2C0px%2C1545px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-01-25T23:54:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:00:30+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Real Housewives of New Jersey\u2019 star Teresa Giudice opened up about why she\u2019d rather not see her husband, Joe Giudice, every week in jail \u2014 details", "title": "Teresa Giudice: Why I\u2019d Rather Not See Joe Every Week", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/joe-giudice-teresa-giudice.jpg?crop=125px%2C0px%2C1545px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516924472.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
