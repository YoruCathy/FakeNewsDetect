Such is the case with Teen Mom\u2019s star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.\n\nWhat Is a Mommy Makeover?\n\nA mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.\n\nMany patients will be treated with a breast lift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, and other body contouring treatments.\n\nWho\u2019s a Good Candidate?\n\nMost plastic surgeons recommend that women have a mommy makeover once they are finished having children.\n\nMany female patients may begin considering this series of surgeries anytime during their child-bearing years, but may delay treatment until after their last pregnancy.\n\nAdditionally, women that are breast-feeding will often wait until they have transitioned their child to a bottle or solid foods, before undergoing any type of surgery.\n\nWhat Surgeries Are Involved?\n\nA breast lift can tighten breast issue, remove excess skin, and resize or reposition the breast and areola for a perkier appearance. Women, especially those that breast feed, may also have a breast augmentation to address volume loss.\n\nAn abdominoplasty or tummy tuck tightens muscles, eliminates saggy skin, and creates a new belly button to restore feminine curves and a streamlined silhouette.\n\nAdditionally, liposuction may be perfumed on one or more areas of the body to target excess fat, and a Brazilian butt lift can boost a women\u2019s less than pert backside.\n\nFor DeJesus, her doctor combined a tummy tuck with a breast lift.\n\n\u201cI did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before\u2014she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier\u2014so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,\u201d said Dr. Miami, via E! News. \u201cAnd we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.\u201d\n\nRecovery\n\nDepending on the number of procedures, women may have one to four weeks of downtime following a mommy makeover. They can expect to be evaluated by their surgeon several times during this period.\n\nPatients will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician including exercise and other physical restrictions. They will continue to be under the care of their plastic surgeon for routine follow-ups over the next 12-18 months.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s important for patients to have physical and emotional support from their significant other, family, and friends during the recovery process.\n\nIf you would like additional information about a mommy makeover, please call Washingtonian Plastic Surgery today to schedule an appointment.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Instagram", "images": ["https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Briana-Mommy-Makeover-941x658.png", "https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/yt.png", "https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/logo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=618021465360057&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Briana-Mommy-Makeover.png", "https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/realself-2.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Briana-Mommy-Makeover.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonianplasticsurgery.com/briana-dejesus-mommy-makeover/", "title": "Teen Mom\u2019s Briana DeJesus Shows Off Body Transformation After Plastic Surgery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After pregnancy, many moms are expected to bounce back to their pre-baby bodies.
