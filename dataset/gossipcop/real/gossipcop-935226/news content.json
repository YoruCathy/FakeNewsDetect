During an interview for Redbook magazine, Pink recalled that she even staged a \u2018sit-in\u2019 with daughter Willow Hart at her school once!\n\nApparently, the 6-year-old was really upset with her mom and was refusing to talk to her.\n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, right?\n\nThe superstar, who explained she is a \u2018total crier\u2019 said that \u2018Willow won\u2019t ever cry, and it annoys me to no end. One day I had a sit-in at her school because I knew she was upset and she would not talk to me. I sat down on the pavement and was like, \u2018I am not moving until you tell me all about your feelings, because this is going to be a life-long conversation for you and I and you have to learn to let me in.\u2019\u2019\n\nAww\u2026what a good mother!\n\n\u2018Without batting an eye, she goes, \u2018I promise to tell you about my feelings more if you promise to tell me about yours less,\u2019\u2019 Pink went on. That is just the best thing for a six-year-old to say!\n\nPink was just as shocked to hear her say that but assured Willow that it\u2019s \u2018Not going to happen. People pay me for my feelings.\u2019 True!\n\nPink also told the magazine that raising her daughter has taught her \u2018a lot about how to deal with people. I process out loud. She does it inside, and it scares me a bit, but I have to let her go through her process.\u2019\n\nWillow and her father Carey Hart, as well as baby brother Jameson, have all joined Pink on tour!\n\nThe singer shared that she is excited to make some great memories with her family on the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I left [for the Truth About Love Tour in 2013], Willow was 14 months, and I\u2019d come right offstage to breastfeed her. That was our bonding time and some of my favorite moments. Jameson\u2019s now doing the same thing.\u2019", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pink-carey-hart-willow-hart-jameson-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ashley-Mitchell-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pink-and-daughter-willow.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/pink-2-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tristan-Thompson-and-Khloe-Kardashian-RadarOnline.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pink-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pink-and-daughter-willow.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Mitchell", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/pink-says-she-staged-a-sit-in-at-her-daughters-school-once-because-she-wouldnt-talk-to-me-146906/", "title": "Pink Says She Staged A \u2018Sit-In\u2019 At Her Daughter\u2019s School Once Because \u2018She Wouldn\u2019t Talk To Me\u2019", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ashley Mitchell", "news_keywords": "pink,", "keywords": "celebrity news, pink,", "description": "The singer revealed that she likes to solve all family conflicts as soon as possible and nothing can really stop her!
