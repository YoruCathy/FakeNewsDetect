Medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.\n\nThe Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure aged 95, followed by an emergency operation when she was 97.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding on 19 May is likely to be the first public appearance by the Queen\u2019s consort since the operation.", "images":
