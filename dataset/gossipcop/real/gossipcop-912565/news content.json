This is what you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d she said at the conference, according to Billboard. \u201cWe just talk about it. I know it\u2019s really young, but I really believe that if you start this early, there\u2019s no shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell him, \u2018Keep your private parts,\u2019 and this and that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing. You have it and mine is different and it\u2019s cool, man. We have to respect ourselves and respect each other. So I believe it starts really young.\u201d\n\nBiel\u2019s comments come just after the actress starred in a sex education PSA alongside comedian Chelsea Handler.\n\nThe PSA \u2014 titled \u201cJessica Biel and Chelsea Handler Take a Little Look-See\u201d \u2014 stresses how important it is for women to give themselves regular self-examinations.\n\n\u201cYou have to check in with your vagina! How else do you know what\u2019s going on down there?\u201d Handler instructs in the short clip.\n\n\u201cYou know, sometimes I look at my vagina, and I go, \u2018Wow, that looks like a young, smug Burt Reynolds \u2014 with the mustache,'\u201d Biel says.\n\nThe video was produced by Biel and WomanCare Global for The Tryst Network, a new organization working to \u201cimprove the sexual health IQ of women and their partners through fun, reliable and empowering online content.\u201d\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/GettyImages-902340118-1024x682.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/wi/ap/16/virus-outbreak-us-foreign-aid-april-15-2020-photo-president-donald-trump-speaks-coronavirus-ros-e1587143064108-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/coronavirus-outbreak-new-york-city-apr7-2020-AP-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Wuhan-Virology-Lab-200x133.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/Carlson87-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/us-customs-border-patrol-migrants-us-border-19-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Trump-on-Reopening-America-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/Donald-Trump-fist-pump-Manchester-New-Hampshire-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/lesliejones1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/Maher614-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/07/Sessions-Chip-SomodevillaGetty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/03/Chinese-coronavirus-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/GettyImages-1062916052-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/coronavirus-testing-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/SafariScreenSnapz001-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/11/DSC_0001-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/10/H2-B-Agricultural-Workers-Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/pelosii-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/churchill-malta-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/pelosi-angry-glare-impeachment-vote-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/04/GettyImages-466747883-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/04/Smithfield-Foods-pork-plant-employee-SD-coronavirus-AP-200x150.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=l2Y7o1IW1810vg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/02/Jayapal-224-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Nussbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/02/08/jessica-biel-starting-sex-ed-lessons-2-year-old-son/", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/02/08/jessica-biel-starting-sex-ed-lessons-2-year-old-son/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "width": 447, "height": 335, "alt": "BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JANUARY 07: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel attend The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.
