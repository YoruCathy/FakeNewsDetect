That sound like a choice,\u201d he said during his conversation with Ms. Respectability Politics, Candace Owens.\n\n\u201cLike \u2026 you was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all?\u201d he added, pouring a little more salt into the already festering wound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTurns out Kim didn\u2019t vibe with that at all, not that you would know it with the Kardashians\u2019 carefully curated image. Kim stood by her husband\u2019s side without a murmur of dissent throughout the whole ordeal as well as the release of his new album.\n\n\u201cKim and Kanye have a solid relationship, even with what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d a source told E ! News at the time. \u201cShe loves and supports her husband. Even if they have differences in views and opinions, she knows his heart.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Kanye himself, in the Times interview, he attempted to clean up his projectile vomit himself, claiming that he just said that it \u201csounded\u201d like a choice, not that he said it actually was a choice. Semantics, people!\n\n\u201cI said the idea of sitting in something for 400 years sounds\u2014sounds\u2014like a choice to me. I never said it\u2019s a choice. I never said slavery itself\u2014like being shackled in chains\u2014was a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I went from slave to 400 years to mental prison to this and that. If you look at the clip, you see the way my mind works.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the artist said that he \u201clearned so much\u201d from the incident.\n\n\u201c I learned about the context of the idea of the word \u2018slave.\u2019 I didn\u2019t take it in that context. I think that my personality and energy mirrors Nat Turner, or it had in the past, but that showed me that also that Nat Turner approach would land me in the same place Nat Turner landed, and that I would be legendary but also just a martyr,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I guess we\u2019re all martyrs eventually, and we\u2019re all guaranteed to die.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd if he could reframe his comments today, well ...\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t frame a one-liner or a headline. What I would say is actually it\u2019s literally like I feel like I\u2019m in court having to justify a robbery that I didn\u2019t actually commit, where I\u2019m having to somehow reframe something that I never said. I feel stupid to have to say out loud that I know that being put on the boat was\u2014but also I\u2019m not backing down, bro,\u201d the artist added. \u201cWhat I will do is I\u2019ll take responsibility for the fact that I allowed my voice to be used back to back in ways that were not protective of it when my voice means too much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWearing the [Donald Trump] hat, because my voice is unprotected, and I believe that the black community wants to protect my voice. By me saying \u2018slave\u2019 in any way at TMZ left my voice unprotected. So it\u2019s not a matter of the facts of if I said that exact line or not; it\u2019s the fact that I put myself in a position to be unprotected by my tribe,\u201d he said.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/i0mxahzc3x30wouirsba.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/i0mxahzc3x30wouirsba.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/kanye-west-thought-kim-kardashian-would-divorce-him-bec-1827134089", "title": "Kanye West Thought Kim Kardashian Would Divorce Him Because of His \u2018Slavery Was a Choice\u2019 Comments: Report", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "0h5mbA9rkZ-QI-vGJ0j8rPKcttrKWOTw-gtBoyuO-_k", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/efwyyktzi0a3tvjdgowk.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/efwyyktzi0a3tvjdgowk.png", "keywords": "Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West slavery was a choice, Kanye West divorce, The Grapevine", "news_keywords": "Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West slavery was a choice, Kanye West divorce, The Grapevine", "twitter": {"url": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/kanye-west-thought-kim-kardashian-would-divorce-him-bec-1827134089", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheRoot", "title": "Kanye West Thought Kim Kardashian Would Divorce Him Because of His \u2018Slavery Was a Choice\u2019 Comments: Report", "description": "If you care, it turns out that Kanye West may have been facing some serious repercussions at home after his infamous slavery comments, believing that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, might have divorced him because of his callous (not to mention misinformed) words.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/i0mxahzc3x30wouirsba.jpg"}, "description": "If you care, it turns out that Kanye West may have been facing some serious repercussions at home after his infamous slavery comments, believing that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, might have divorced him because of his callous (not to mention misinformed) words.", "og": {"title": "Kanye West Thought Kim Kardashian Would Divorce Him Because of His \u2018Slavery Was a Choice\u2019 Comments: Report", "type": "article", "url": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/kanye-west-thought-kim-kardashian-would-divorce-him-bec-1827134089", "description": "If you care, it turns out that Kanye West may have been facing some serious repercussions at home after his infamous slavery comments, believing that his wife, Kim Kardashian West, might have divorced him because of his callous (not to mention misinformed) words.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Grapevine", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/i0mxahzc3x30wouirsba.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 280492615405243}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com", "summary": ""}
