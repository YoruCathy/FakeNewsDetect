In this situation, I think I can be very happy with what I\u2019ve accomplished.\u2019\u2019\n\nMore:Mikaela Shiffrin takes silver in Alpine combined while Lindsey Vonn fails to medal\n\nMore:U.S. women end Canada's streak to win hockey gold in shootout at 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nThat\u2019s Vonn\u2019s prerogative. But no reason for anyone else to feel compelled to celebrate her Olympic performance \u2014 bronze in the downhill, sixth in the Super-G and did not finish (DNF) in the combined \u2014 with chants of \u201cU-S-A! U-S-A!\u201d Although her injuries are undeniable, she was healthy enough to have won the last two World Cup downhill races before the Olympics and even her own father, Alan Kildow, sounded underwhelmed with the bronze medal.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great skiing, but it reminds me of something that Buddy Werner used to say,\u2019\u2019 Kildow told USA TODAY Sports, referring the U.S. Alpine skier who raced in the 1950s and 1960s. \u201cHe said there\u2019s two places in the race, first and last, and I only want one of them.\u2019\u2019\n\nThis is almost without a doubt her final Olympics; she has basically said that herself. She will stay on the World Cup circuit for a while. She needs six World Cup victories to pass Ingemar Stenmark\u2019s record of 86. She is a three-time Olympic medalist. And with her bronze in the downhill, the 33-year-old became the oldest skier to win a medal in an Alpine event.\n\nVonn won Olympic gold in the downhill at the 2010 Games and, after missing the 2014 Olympics because of a knee injury, this was a chance to gild her stellar racing career with another Olympic gold. Yet it\u2019s fair to wonder if she was distracted.\n\n\n\nAt times, it felt as if she spent as much time on Twitter as she did on the slopes. The highlights: She tweeted about looking for a Valentine\u2019s Date, tweeted about the Trump-loving trolls attacking her and, well, then there was that missing deodorant.\n\n\n\nMost reporters (present company included) ate it up. And with the media, she was gracious, articulate, candid, funny and generous with her time. Too bad for Vonn there was no Olympic medal awarded for that.\n\n\n\nIt was the one gold she deserved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/12b4e26370e3c2f9a1aa71ed7815a4f2c2e81037/c=0-3-4648-2629&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/02/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636548751652173635-USATSI-10637499.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/241d3b9357eeda2f000519eda2b464f6b8e60309/c=259-191-3283-1900/local/-/media/2018/02/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636548755698839575-USP-Olympics--Alpine-Skiing-Womens-Alpine-Combined.3.jpg?width=3024&height=1709&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/241d3b9357eeda2f000519eda2b464f6b8e60309/c=259-191-3283-1900/local/-/media/2018/02/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636548755698839575-USP-Olympics--Alpine-Skiing-Womens-Alpine-Combined.3.jpg?width=3024&height=1709&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/22/womens-combined-lindsey-vonn-one-medal/362120002/", "title": "Skier Lindsey Vonn leaves the 2018 Winter Olympics with lots of tweets but just one medal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Skier Lindsey Vonn leaves the 2018 Winter Olympics with lots of tweets but just one medal", "description": "Lindsey Vonn arrived here widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, primed for gold in the downhill and poised to win a medal in Super-G.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/winter-olympics-2018/2018/02/22/womens-combined-lindsey-vonn-one-medal/362120002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/241d3b9357eeda2f000519eda2b464f6b8e60309/c=259-191-3283-1900/local/-/media/2018/02/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636548755698839575-USP-Olympics--Alpine-Skiing-Womens-Alpine-Combined.3.jpg?width=3024&height=1709&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3024, "height": 1709}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Josh Peter", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Lindsey Vonn arrived here widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, primed for gold in the downhill and poised to win a medal in Super-G.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/241d3b9357eeda2f000519eda2b464f6b8e60309/c=259-191-3283-1900/local/-/media/2018/02/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636548755698839575-USP-Olympics--Alpine-Skiing-Womens-Alpine-Combined.3.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Skier Lindsey Vonn leaves the 2018 Winter Olympics with lots of tweets but just one medal", "description": "Lindsey Vonn arrived here widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, primed for gold in the downhill and poised to win a medal in Super-G."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
