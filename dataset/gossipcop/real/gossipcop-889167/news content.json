Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato had a sweet reunion at the Instyle Awards in Los Angeles on Monday night, posing together at the event.\n\nThe childhood pals, who met on the set of Barney & Friends and went on to co-star in the 2009 Disney film Princess Protection Program, both looked glam at the event.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGomez, 25, wore a sexy black Jacquemus mini-dress while Lovato, 25, sported a lilac Alice + Olivia gown with a thigh-high slit and belted waist.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nWATCH: Selena Gomez Praises Pal Demi Lovato's Documentary: 'I Wish More People Were Like You'\n\nThough the two friends haven\u2019t been seen together in the past few years, they\u2019ve recently excited fans with friendly exchanges on social media.\n\nIn July, Lovato tweeted, \u201c@selenagomez Loving your new song Fetish, we\u2019ve come a long way since our Barney days,\u201d to which Gomez replied, \u201cYes we have \u2013 just listening to Sorry Not Sorry! You slay as always. So happy for you!\u201d\n\nThen last week when Lovato\u2019s YouTube documentary Simply Complicated was released, Gomez commented on one of Lovato\u2019s Instagrams, \u201cThis was beautiful. I\u2019m so happy for you. You always continue to [be] bold and real. I wish more people were like you. Love you.\u201d\n\nPICS: Red Hot Red Carpet Crushes\n\nFor more from the longtime pals, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_gomez_demi_lovato_gettyimages_865675078.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=_-Oka26m", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAA=", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2017-10/demi_lovato_dress_gettyimages_865625906.jpg?itok=BOBw7XHm", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2017-10/selena_gomez_dress_gettyimages_865626540.jpg?itok=RwydsDFb", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2017-10/selena_gomez_demi_lovato_full_gettyimages_865675078.jpg?itok=A6641-EY", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/rupauls_drag_race__E_1208_droop_sneak_1920x1080.jpg?h=70217200&itok=U94nGmuG", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/gettyimages-692085362.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=TnqSx9El"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_gomez_demi_lovato_gettyimages_865675078.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=_-Oka26m", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-demi-lovato-reunite-instyle-awards-see-sweet-moment-89752", "title": "Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato Reunite at the \u2018InStyle\u2019 Awards: See the Sweet Moment!", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato Reunite at the \u2018InStyle\u2019 Awards: See the Sweet Moment! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-demi-lovato-reunite-instyle-awards-see-sweet-moment-89752", "title": "Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato Reunite at the \u2018InStyle\u2019 Awards: See the Sweet Moment!", "description": "The childhood friends have been extra sweet to one another on social media lately.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_gomez_demi_lovato_gettyimages_865675078.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=_-Oka26m", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The childhood friends have been extra sweet to one another on social media lately.", "title": "Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato Reunite at the \u2018InStyle\u2019 Awards: See the Sweet Moment!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Rachel McRady\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-and-demi-lovato-reunite-instyle-awards-see-sweet-moment-89752", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_gomez_demi_lovato_gettyimages_865675078.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=_-Oka26m"}, "description": "The childhood friends have been extra sweet to one another on social media lately.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Reunions", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
