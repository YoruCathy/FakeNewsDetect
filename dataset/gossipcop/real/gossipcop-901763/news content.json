Through the series of 10 historic throwback Thursday images, fans got the message: This family is serious about holiday cheer.\n\n\u201cSome photos of Christmas past. Little, middle, big,\u201d Ripa captioned the post, referring to each of her three children, Michael, 20, Lola, 16, and Joaquin, who is 14. Dad Mark Consuelos was also in the mix.\n\nMore: Kelly Ripa Is, Like, So Embarrassing on Her Anniversary With Mark Consuelos\n\nIn the images, we see loads of smiles, dazzling Christmas decor and a range of matching holiday-themed pajamas, obviously.\n\nThe real question is: Does her Lola approve?

Moms.\n\nIn a photo Ripa shared last week, the caption read, \u201cWishing you a LIT holiday season! With love from the Consuelos gang.\u201d Ripa even added \u201c(and yes, Lola approved)\u201d to the end to stave off any questioning. Phew!
