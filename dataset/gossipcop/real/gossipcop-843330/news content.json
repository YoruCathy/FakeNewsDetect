Well, Vogue\u2018s May issue is just the thing you need to hold you over until May 1. This year\u2019s co-chair, Katy Perry, graces the cover wearing Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u2019 architectural, artistic and yes, sometimes wacky runway looks throughout the entire spread.\n\nImage zoom Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott/Vogue\n\nStyled by the legendary Grace Coddington, Perry models pieces from Comme des Gar\u00e7ons\u2019 runway collections spanning from 2005 to 2017 each more eye-catching than the next. (Which has us imagining what she\u2019ll wear for her big moment on May 1 \u2013 and wondering how she\u2019ll possibly get up the grand staircase in these restricting designs.)\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cLet me know when Zoolander 3 starts shooting,\u201d Perry joked on the set of the shoot, but added seriously: \u201cThese clothes, honestly, are walking pieces of art. It\u2019s the redefinition of sex; the sex of the mind.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott/Vogue\n\nIn the interview, she recalls her strict and sheltered childhood with her evangelical Christian pastor parents, saying that her schools were \u201cmakeshift,\u201d her days were filled with church and watching Bill O\u2019Reilly and she only knew of Madonna and Marilyn Manson because her family \u201cpicketed their concerts.\u201d\n\nBut from an early age she had an innate sense of style. In sixth grade she asked for a fake leopard-fur $175 vintage coat for Christmas and Jesus (not Santa Claus, to be clear) brought it to her that year. \u201cAll the kids made fun of me,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I knew I was doing something right when the hot moms came over to me at school and were like, \u2018Where did you get that coat, sweetie?'\u201d\n\nThese days she\u2019s trying to get away from her cartoony style image, opting for fewer \u201ccutesy\u201d clothes and more \u201candrogynous, architectural\u201d pieces. \u201cI am happy to be another interpretation of myself,\u201d she explains.\n\nShe\u2019s been fully delivering on that, making dramatic hair changes on the regular, from going platinum, to getting a pixie, to recently trimming it even shorter (it\u2019s practically a step away from a buzz cut now!).\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Celeb Hair Makeovers: Better Before or After?\n\nWhile her working style is getting more and more experimental, she goes super low-key off the clock in an Adidas tracksuit and Stan Smiths, which she wears daily to make paparazzi shots less desirable. \u201cWhen I am on, I am on,\u201d Perry says. \u201cAnd when I am not, I\u2019ve got a different job to do. Even if you\u2019re wearing a scarf, you\u2019re an advertisement, and the music is the thing that I am selling.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nThese days she says she\u2019s at peace with being in her 30s and where she\u2019s at in her career. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice place to be,\u201d she says of being 32. \u201cI love it! I wouldn\u2019t give anything to go back to my 20s; I\u2019m so much more grounded. And I\u2019ve learned a lot of lessons\u2014patience, the art of saying no, that everything doesn\u2019t have to end in marriage. That your education can start now.\u201d\n\nAnd after the breakout success of Teenage Dream in 2010, she finally feels like she can slow down a bit. \u201cI blasted off on a rocket, holding on for dear life,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I had so much ambition and determination, and that\u2019s what kept me going. The rocket was riding me for a bit, but now I am riding the rocket.\u201d\n\nYou can pick up the May issue on newsstands April 25 or order it on Amazon here.
