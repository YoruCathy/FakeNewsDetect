Online. \u201cI work out with my trainer like 4 to 5 times a week,\u201d she tells E!. \u201cI do 45 minutes of cardio, then we do dynamics and end with some weight training and abs work outs.\u201d\n\nAnother thing you need to be an It Girl? Skye says self-motivation is key. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll listen to my own music to get me motivated,\u201d Skye shares. And while pushing your boundaries may be uncomfortable, Skye believes it\u2019s also necessary if you want to become an It Girl.\n\n2. She Was Signed to Roc Nation in 2016\n\nIn 2013, Justine signed with Atlantic Records. Three years later, she switched over to Roc Nation and Republic Records. \u201cI had a record deal at Atlantic prior to my deal with Roc Nation, Atlantic and I decided to go our separate ways and Roc Nation showed a lot of interest, I met with their team and the rest is history sort of speak,\u201d she says.\n\nIn 2016, Skye spoke on Hot 97 about transitioning to Roc Nation sayng, \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be. I\u2019m from Brooklyn. To be signed to Jay Z\u2019s label, that\u2019s huge. That\u2019s a huge accomplishment.\u201d She goes on to say that Roc Nation really feels like her family, now.\n\nWhen Fader asked her how she said music helped her blossom, she responded, \u201cWell, the Internet and music. There\u2019s a space that some people get stuck in where all you have is the Internet \u2013 if your social medias got deleted today, you wouldn\u2019t have anything. There are some people that are like that, and it\u2019s cool because they benefit from it but if it was gone what is your job occupation? What do you do?\u201d\n\n3. She Was Home Schooled\n\nGrowing up, Skye was very shy. Her Roc Nation bio states that it wasn\u2019t until she attended a BMI panel that she started to come out of her shell.\n\nAccording to The Fader, Justine decided to be homeschooled at 16. She focused many of her teen years on her Tumblr page, where, in the words of The Fader, \u201cher purple-tinted hair, brightly hued lipstick, and cool girl persona earned her thousands of notes and a massive following.\u201d\n\nSkye has been printed on the covers of Vogue, V Magazine, Billboard, Fader, and more.\n\n4. She Has Made a Song with Tyga\n\nJustine Skye ft Tyga \u2013 Collide (Official Music Video)Justine Skye ft Tyga \u2013 \"Collide\" (Music Video) Produced by DJ Mustard Download on iTunes: http://smarturl.it/JSCollide Follow: http://www.twitter.com/justineskye http://instagram.com/justineskye http://www.facebook.com/justineskyefans 2014-10-08T21:56:22.000Z\n\nIn 2014, Justine made a song called \u201cCollide\u201d that featured Tyga.\n\nShe\u2019s worked with a number of other successful artists, too. In 2015, she performed at an event called TIDAL10x20 which was created by Tommy Hilfiger and Jay Z.\n\n\u201cI like to say I make A1 music, which is music that feels good,\u201d Skye tells Paper Magazine.\n\nWhile speaking on Hot 97, Justine mentioned that she lives in NYC, but splits her time between LA and the Big Apple. \u201cI go back and forth.\u201d She also spilled the beans on her romantic life, saying she isn\u2019t dating right now, but is interested in doing so.\n\n5. She Released Her Debut Album in January\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BgUmj-DHEqt/?hl=en\n\nIn January, Skye released her debut album, \u201cUltraviolet\u201d, on Apple Music.\n\nWhy the name, \u201cUltraviolet\u201d? Not only is it the color of Skye\u2019s hair, but she says it\u2019s how she feels right now. \u201cIt\u2019s just extremely powerful and I feel like that\u2019s the point that I reached, of power and confidence.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harpers Bazaar, Skye pulled together an impressive team to help with her songs. Hit-Boy (a frequent collaborator with Beyonce and Kanye West) produced the song, \u201cLil\u2019 Boy\u201d.\n\nAt first, Skye explains, the album did not feel cohesive enough. \u201cWhen we first started working on the album, we were just trying to get songs done.\u201d But the music was missing a common theme. \u201cSo we scrapped everything and started over from scratch. We scrambled,\u201d the Brooklyn native says. \u201cWe\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my God, what do we do?\u2019 Everyone\u2019s freaking out, mad at me. Like, \u2018What do you mean, Justine? We just spent all this money on this!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s just not right! I don\u2019t feel good about it!\u2019 So we started over. They trusted me and they let me do my thing\u2014and we did it.\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20567959cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-10-02-10-pm-e1521252170772.png?w=556", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=lfktn1QolK10vg", "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-10-29-21-pm.png?w=780", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d0e679621edc4bd4e5d0567c3aab2d2b?s=71&d=https%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D71&r=PG"], "top_img": "https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-16-at-10-02-10-pm-e1521252170772.png?w=556", "keywords": [], "authors": ["S.M.
