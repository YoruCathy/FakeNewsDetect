See what they had to say about their \u2018sisterhood,\u2019 empowering women and MORE right here!\n\nTotal Divas is back! This season, we\u2019ll see some of WWE\u2019s biggest female stars taking their industry by storm, as they get more opportunities than ever in the ring. \u201cI think we\u2019re all so truly grateful that we\u2019re in WWE in this time where we\u2019re literally shattering all the glass ceilings,\u201d Lana told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d Lana, along with Nattie Neidhart and Nia Jax, stopped by HollywoodLife to dish about season 8 of Total Divas, which will feature, \u201cthe return of Paige, Brie [Bella] coming back to the ring, Lana killing it at Money in the Bank and Nattie\u2026throwing some awesome barbecues,\u201d according to Nia!\n\nOf course, the show isn\u2019t all work and no fun\u2026so along with Nattie\u2019s barbecues, we\u2019ll also see the ladies take trips together and spent time together outside of their WWE commitments. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I love about the show,\u201d Lana admitted. \u201cEspecially with the brand split. We get to spend time with each other. Nattie got traded and the whole locker room at Smackdown Live was devastated, but at least I got to see her more because we were filming together!\u201d\n\nAll three girls agreed that filming has solidified their friendships with one another, to the point where they consider each other family. \u201cI don\u2019t have sisters,\u201d Nia explained. \u201cThey literally are my sisters. I call them for everything. I feel like the show definitely brought us closer.\u201d Plus, even though the show has been on for eight seasons, there\u2019s always more to learn that helps these women grow closer. \u201cWe really get to dive into who we are as people [this season],\u201d Nia said. \u201cAnd what makes us who we are today. It almost changed me as a woman, and I can\u2019t wait for viewers to see that.\u201d\n\nWith these powerful women and their co-stars helping change the face of female wrestling, this season is more about female empowerment than ever. \u201cThe world is changing so much and women \u2014 not just in the WWE, but around the world \u2014 are really at the forefront,\u201d Nattie explained. \u201cWWE is embracing women more than ever before, so to be part of that movement makes us feel so empowered and like we have a voice. We can use our impact and make the world a better place!\u201d", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/alyssa_norwin.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F09%2F19%2Ftotal-divas-season-8-lana-nattie-nia-interviews%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3322873", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/total-divas-15-embed.jpg?w=620&h=494", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/total-divas-15-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/total-divas-15-ftr.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/total-divas-15-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Deputy Editor Of New York City"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/09/19/total-divas-season-8-lana-nattie-nia-interviews/", "title": "\u2018Total Divas\u2019 Stars Reveal How Filming Made Them Closer & Why They Feel More \u2018Empowered\u2019 Than Ever", "meta_data": {"description": "We caught up with Nattie, Lana and Nia from 'Total Divas' ahead of the season 8 premiere and they dished about their friendship and more!", "news_keywords": "Lana, Natalya Neidhart, Total Divas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Total Divas\u2019 Stars Reveal How Filming Made Them Closer & Why They Feel More \u2018Empowered\u2019 Than Ever", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/09/19/total-divas-season-8-lana-nattie-nia-interviews/", "description": "Ahead of the season 8 premiere of \u2018Total Divas,\u2019 we caught up with Lana, Nattie and Nia to get some EXCLUSIVE scoop on what\u2019s to come!
