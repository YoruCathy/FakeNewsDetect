As Teen Vogue noted Tuesday, the rapper un-followed the singer. This event comes just one day after the Met Gala, where Rihanna was a co-chair and the focus of much media attention. Maybe Drake, her longtime admirer, just didn't want to see her grid anymore. Stay tuned for more social-media signals of his unhappiness.\n\nThe original story continues below.\n\nAt the 2016 V.M.A. Awards, when Drake professed his love to Rihanna as he presented her with the Video Vanguard Award, all eyes were on the two mega-stars, long rumored to have some kind of romantic connection. What would happen next? Would he propose, people across the Internet wondered? Would she return the compliments? As he wrapped up, Drake appeared to try to kiss Rihanna, and instead, she gave him the cheek. Now, in Vogue\u2019s June cover story, Rihanna talks of a new, unnamed love in her life. As for Drake? It\u2019s complicated.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a friendship now, but we\u2019re not enemies either,\u201d she told Vogue, which reported that she winced at the artist\u2019s name before her \u201ceyes glaze[d] over with cool indifference.\u201d \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d\n\nThe Grammy winner said that those moments of waiting for Drake to wrap up his long, romantic speech to her were, in a way, excruciating. She didn\u2019t say whether this had anything to do with the fact that the two are not friends, but the memory of the awkward speech certainly isn\u2019t her favorite.\n\n\u201cThe V.M.A.s is such a fan-focused awards show, so having that energy around me, and knowing the people who had received the award in the past, made it feel like a big deal,\u201d she said. \u201cWaiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don\u2019t like too many compliments; I don\u2019t like to be put on blast.\u201d\n\nThough Drake has been forward enough to allegedly write about Rihanna in his music and tell Rolling Stone in 2014 that she was the \u201cultimate fantasy,\u201d it was never clear if those feelings were entirely mutual.\n\nIn 2015, Rihanna told Vanity Fair that her ex Chris Brown was her last real, official boyfriend; she spoke of how it felt being dragged into headlines involving rumors about Brown.\n\n\u201cI got so uncomfortable because now what?\u201d she said then. \u201cHe\u2019s not even able to be seen with [another] girl, because I\u2019m dragged back into headlines that say he\u2019s cheating on me, and I don\u2019t even [really] know this guy.\u201d\n\nBut it looks like that profession from three years ago no longer remains true. Rihanna has a new guy in her life, rumored to be Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel.\n\n\u201cI used to feel guilty about taking personal time,\u201d she told Vogue of her private life, \u201cbut I also think I never met someone who was worth it before.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591a2b5c2bac0f42fb1f138a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lippman_DIOR_mg_0823.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58d57c406da7da37bc431aba/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/drakes-many-instagram-loves.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591a2b5cf9384520b86c89c2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lippman_DIOR_21A8988.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591a2b5bf9384520b86c89be/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lippman_DIOR_21A8944.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59371a8202e1d076fbe03e31/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/rihanna-miami-look.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Weaver", "Hilary Weave", "Emma Stefansk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/rhianna-says-she-and-drake-are-neither-friends-nor-enemies", "title": "Rihanna Says She and Drake Are Neither Friends nor Enemies", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hilary Weaver", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The upcoming Ocean\u2019s 8 star shares some of her personal feelings about that infamous V.M.A. speech, too.", "id": "5aeb1329ae03af0739cf340f", "keywords": "celebrity,drake,vogue,as,chris brown,rihanna", "news_keywords": "celebrity,drake,vogue,as,chris brown,rihanna", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5aeb1329ae03af0739cf340f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The upcoming Ocean\u2019s 8 star shares some of her personal feelings about that infamous V.M.A. speech, too.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The upcoming Ocean\u2018s 8 star shares some of her personal feelings about that infamous V.M.A. speech, too.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Rihanna Says She and Drake Are Neither Friends Nor Enemies", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/rhianna-says-she-and-drake-are-neither-friends-nor-enemies"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The upcoming Ocean\u2018s 8 star shares some of her personal feelings about that infamous V.M.A. speech, too.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aeb1bc5ae03af0739cf341d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/RiRi-Drake-Enemies.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Rihanna Says She and Drake Are Neither Friends Nor Enemies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
