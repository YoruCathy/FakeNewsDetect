Recognizing the search engine\u2019s comedy potential when it comes to song lyrics, Jimmy Fallon filtered through some classic hits so his Colossal guest, Anne Hathaway, could sing Google Translate versions on Monday\u2019s The Tonight Show .\n\nWhen fed through Google Translate and back again, The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d becomes the popular track \u201cMy Front Is Not Felt\u201d with the refrain, \u201cIn your presence, my front is not felt. Hey, it is good. Hey, it is good.\u201d\n\nGloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d becomes \u201cI Will Be Punctual.\u201d Fallon tried to stand alongside Hathaway, who won an Oscar for her musical performance in Les Mis\u00e9rables, by singing, \u201cNot good for me, I will be punctual unless I know with love\u2019s knowledge I\u2019m aware that I\u2019m aware.\u201d\n\nAs is the tradition with song-based games on The Tonight Show, this one ended with a duet between Fallon and Hathaway on Pink and Nate Ruess\u2019 \u201cOnly Tell Me Grounds\u201d (non-translated as \u201cJust Give Me a Reason\u201d). \u201cRight from the start you were a thief, you stole my heart,\u201d becomes, \u201cAt the outset, you are a felon who took my center.\u201d\n\nWitness their musicality in the clip above.",
