The Teen Mom 2 actress faced the estranged mother Barbara Evans in a court this Wednesday where she revealed to the press the stipulations of the custody agreement made for Jenelle\u2019s 7-year-old son, Jace Evans.\n\nBarbara was granted primary custody of their kid, but unlike their first agreement, now the pair has a visitation schedule in place, and we might say that this is quite a nice turn of events for the reality TV star.\n\nAccording to Jenelle, she will get to have Jace on weekends, holidays and during the summer season.\n\nAll fans of the MTV reality series probably know by now that Jenelle often butts heads with Barbara over when and where she would be able to see her son because she didn\u2019t have court-mandated visitation rights until now.\n\nThis agreement, on the other hand, is bittersweet for the mother of three kids.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not restricted to when my mom says I can have my son anymore,\u201d Jenelle said, \u201cand at the moment that\u2019s all I care about. [I] just want to spend time with my son. He will be home one day but today wasn\u2019t the day, sadly.\u201d\n\nThe 25-year-old actress described today\u2019s scene as being very tense and she revealed the fact that she burst into tears the moment when she heard the judge\u2019s decision in the conference room. She also said that she has no idea what she is going to do next.\n\nAfter both Barbara and Jenelle signed the agreement papers, she said that the judge addressed her mother with a warning.\n\n\u201cBarbara, you need to start thinking about the child and not yourself in the future,\u201d Jenelle recalled him telling Barbara.\n\nThe actress also said that she hasn\u2019t spoken to her mother since the ruling and she hasn\u2019t even looked at her back then. She doesn\u2019t have any plans for some reconciliation or for an active relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy we could to a decision for Jace, but it doesn\u2019t change my feelings towards my mom,\u201d Jenelle said. \u201cShe still isn\u2019t giving up my son to me but I will fight again in the future when the time is right,\u201d she concluded.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/jenelle-evans-teen-mom-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jenelle-Evans-jade-cline-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/jenelle-evans-david-eason-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Jenelle-Evans-Reached-Custody-Battle-Agreement-Over-Her-Son-Jace-And-She-Is-Both-Happy-And-Devastated.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BeyoncC3A9_16_9_1584091346-300x166.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bethenny-frankel-alex-rodriguez-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Jenelle-Evans-Reached-Custody-Battle-Agreement-Over-Her-Son-Jace-And-She-Is-Both-Happy-And-Devastated.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/jenelle-evans-reached-custody-battle-agreement-over-her-son-jace-and-she-is-both-happy-and-devastated-40295/", "title": "Jenelle Evans Reached Custody Battle Agreement Over Her Son Jace, And She Is Both Happy And Devastated", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "barbara evans, jenelle evans,", "keywords": "celebrity news, barbara evans, jenelle evans,", "description": "Jenelle Evans seems to be one step closer to having all her kids under the same roof.
