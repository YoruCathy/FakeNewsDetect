However, the \"Modern Family\" actress wasn't always so confident.\n\nSarah Hyland, who plays Winter's older sister on the popular TV show, recently opened up to People about how she mentored Winter when they first met.\n\n\"I mean, she was 11 years old when I met her. I was 18,\" she told People. \"I tried to be a good role model for her, and a true older sister for her because she\u2019s such a sweet little girl.\"\n\nHyland is now 26, and Winter is 19.\n\nOver the last eight years, Winter has become a target for body-shamers and slut-shamers who criticize her evolving style on social media.\n\nA post shared by ARIEL WINTER (@arielwinter) Jun 15, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT\n\nHowever, over time, Winter has figured out how to respond perfectly to her haters. Some of that confidence is thanks to her co-stars, according to Hyland.\n\n\"I like to think we \u2014 me, Julie Bowen, and Sofia Vergara \u2014 helped her be confident with her body and herself,\" Hyland told People.\n\nThe actress has faced her own battle with body-shamers. In May, social media users accused Hyland of being a bad role model and glorifying eating disorders because of her weight.\n\nCommenters attacked her over this photo, which was meant to promote an anti-bullying campaign.\n\n\"Sherwood (and nothing else) looks good on me\" @domsherwood \u2764\ufe0f Buy a shirt and a portion of the proceeds go to the Anti-Bullying Alliance! https://represent.com/sherwood/official-dominic-sherwood-tee-sherwood-looks-good-on-me-blue-eyes A post shared by Sarah Hyland (@therealsarahhyland) on May 23, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT May 23, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT\n\nHyland responded to her critics, sharing that her personal health issues were preventing her from gaining weight.\n\n\"I've basically been on bed rest for the past few months, I've lost a lot of muscle mass,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"My circumstances have put me in a place where I'm not in control of what my body looks like. So I strive to be as healthy as possible, as everyone should.\"\n\nDespite this, Hyland tries to remain confident. The actress shared how she stays positive with People.\n\n\"It's about being confident in your self [sic], and not letting people's hateful words get to you,\" she said. \"Just surround yourself with positivity and not let the negativity get to you.\"", "images": ["https://static.businessinsider.com/image/5bd375adcd6f3842155a1a29", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/597f459e85754f133c094abc?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/sarah-hyland-helped-ariel-winter-become-confident-2017-7?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://static.businessinsider.com/image/5cf6b11111e205471c5718a4", "https://i.insider.com/597f459f85754f133c094abd?width=1200&format=jpeg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/597f459f85754f133c094abd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susanna Heller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/sarah-hyland-helped-ariel-winter-become-confident-2017-7", "title": "'Modern Family' star Sarah Hyland says she helped co-star Ariel Winter stand up to body-shamers: 'I tried to be a true older sister'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "'Modern Family' star Sarah Hyland says she helped co-star Ariel Winter stand up to body-shamers: 'I tried to be a true older sister'", "date": "2017-07-31", "news_keywords": "Health, Mental Health, body-shaming, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter, Modern Family, Celebrities, slut shaming, Instagram, Social Media, Bullying, Susanna Heller", "description": "The actress opened up about helping her 19-year-old co-star Ariel Winter become more confident in the face of online bullies who shame her body and outfits.", "author": "Susanna Heller", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "og": {"title": "'Modern Family' star Sarah Hyland says she helped co-star Ariel Winter stand up to body-shamers: 'I tried to be a true older sister'", "description": "The actress opened up about helping her 19-year-old co-star Ariel Winter become more confident in the face of online bullies who shame her body and outfits.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/sarah-hyland-helped-ariel-winter-become-confident-2017-7", "image": "https://i.insider.com/597f459f85754f133c094abd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "'Modern Family' star Sarah Hyland says she helped co-star Ariel Winter stand up to body-shamers: 'I tried to be a true older sister'", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-31", "sailthru.tags": "Health, Mental Health, body-shaming, Sarah Hyland, Ariel Winter, Modern Family, Celebrities, slut shaming, Instagram, Social Media, Bullying, Susanna Heller", "sailthru.description": "The actress opened up about helping her 19-year-old co-star Ariel Winter become more confident in the face of online bullies who shame her body and outfits.", "sailthru.author": "Susanna Heller", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/597f459e85754f133c094abc?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/597f459e85754f133c094abc?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "variant", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "control", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "597f459f85754f133c094abe", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501430400.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
