While the situations themselves are upsetting, it\u2019s powerful to see so many women speak out. Parents may wonder how to address these multiple allegations with their children, which is why we\u2019re happy that Candace Cameron Bure opened up about sexual harassment, and how she\u2019s handling the topic.\n\nThe Fuller House star has three teens at home \u2014 Natasha, Lev, and Maksim. Natasha is already in the public eye, having competed on The Voice back in 2016. Based on her exposure, Cameron Bure stated that she\u2019s already had the conversation with her before, telling E! News that \u201cThose are conversations that we have and really that I\u2019ve been having with my children since they were young because that\u2019s what parenting is about and helping them be secure with who they are and having moral boundaries and knowing what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and what\u2019s appropriate for people to ask of you and not and not to be afraid to speak out.\u201d\n\nMaking sure to emphasize incredible lessons like this may explain why Cameron Bure and her children are so close.\n\nCameron Bure noted to E! News that she hasn\u2019t been in a situation similar to the victims who are stepping forward, but has nothing but love and support for the women who have been put in these dangerous situations.\n\nWe\u2019re so glad that Cameron Bure is addressing the topic, and applaud her for starting the conversation with her family so early.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F29235542%2Fcandace-cameron-bure-sexual-harassment.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072528/avatar-d-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F29235542%2Fcandace-cameron-bure-sexual-harassment.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-moms/candace-cameron-bure-shared-how-she-talks-to-her-kids-about-sexual-harassment/", "title": "Candace Cameron Bure shared how she talks to her kids about sexual harassment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "candace cameron bure,fuller house,sexual assault,sexual harassment", "news_keywords": "candace cameron bure,fuller house,sexual assault,sexual harassment", "description": "Candace Cameron Bure addressed the topic of sexual harassment and abuse, and explained how she talks about it with her three children.", "og": {"title": "Candace Cameron Bure shared how she talks to her kids about sexual harassment", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-moms/candace-cameron-bure-shared-how-she-talks-to-her-kids-about-sexual-harassment/", "description": "She's a great actress, and a great mom.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F29235542%2Fcandace-cameron-bure-sexual-harassment.jpg", "width": 681, "height": 985}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-moms/candace-cameron-bure-shared-how-she-talks-to-her-kids-about-sexual-harassment/", "description": "Candace Cameron Bure addressed the topic of sexual harassment and abuse, and explained how she talks about it with her three children.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F29235542%2Fcandace-cameron-bure-sexual-harassment.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/celebrity-moms/candace-cameron-bure-shared-how-she-talks-to-her-kids-about-sexual-harassment/", "title": "Candace Cameron Bure shared how she talks to her kids about sexual harassment", "description": "She's a great actress, and a great mom.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F29235542%2Fcandace-cameron-bure-sexual-harassment.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
