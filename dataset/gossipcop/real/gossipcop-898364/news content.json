Kaepernick\u2019s decision to remain seated while the national anthem played back in 2016 sparked similar protests by NFL players that continue to incite controversy in the present.\n\n\u201cThank you Colin Kaepernick. Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction,\u201d the \u201cLemonade\u201d singer said in her presentation speech. \u201cThank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better. To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still waiting for the world to catch up. It\u2019s been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America. So, let\u2019s be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selfless serve and protect our country and our communities and our families. His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. Let\u2019s not get that mistaken.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Kaepernick said that his \u201cplatform is the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say this as a person who receives credit for using my platform to protest systemic oppression, racialized injustice and the dire consequences of anti-blackness in America,\u201d he said. \u201cI accept this award not for myself, but on behalf of the people. Because if it were not for my love of the people, I would not have protested. And if it was not for the support from the people, I would not be on this stage today. With or without the NFL\u2019s platform, I will continue to work for the people because my platform is the people.\u201d\n\nKaepernick has been unable to find a new NFL position since he opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season, and sued the NFL and its owners in October for collusion against hiring him. Kaepernick also received the ACLU\u2019s courageous advocate award Monday evening.\n\nThe 2017 SI Sportsperson of the Year Show will air on NBCSN and on Univision Deportes Network at 8 p.m. ET Dec. 8 and Dec. 9, respectively.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/beyonce-colin.jpg?w=1024", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Fbeyonce-colin-kaepernick-si-muhammad-ali-legacy-award-1202631812%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202631812&comment_count=11", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/beyonce-colin.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Nyren"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/beyonce-colin-kaepernick-si-muhammad-ali-legacy-award-1202631812/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Presents Colin Kaepernick With SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 surprised ex-49ers player Colin Kaepernick Tuesday night to present him with the SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202631812, "author": "Erin Nyren", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-12-05T22:31:28"}, "pmc-tag": "Beyonce,Colin Kaepernick", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Presents Colin Kaepernick With SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "music", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Presents Colin Kaepernick With SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/beyonce-colin-kaepernick-si-muhammad-ali-legacy-award-1202631812/", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 surprised ex-49ers player Colin Kaepernick Tuesday night, presenting him with the SI Muhammad Ali Legacy Award, which honors an athlete who uses their platform to further change.
