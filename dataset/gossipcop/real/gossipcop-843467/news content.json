Revealing to us EXCLUSIVELY just how thrilled she is for Brie, WWE star Natalya Neidhart gushed about how \u2018spoiled\u2019 baby Birdie is going to be, AND that she thinks Daniel will be the diaper king!\n\nAt over 41 weeks pregnant, Brie Bella, 33, FINALLY gave birth to her and her husband Daniel Bryan\u2018s(real name Bryan Danielson,) 35, first child on May 9! The two welcomed daughter Birdie Joe Danielson into the world at 11:58 p.m., and already they\u2019re completely in love with the little angel. SO in love in fact that fellow WWE Superstar Natalya Neidhart, 34, is already predicting Birdie will be one adorably spoiled child!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy for Brie! She\u2019s wanted to be a mom her whole life and now her dreams are finally coming true,\u201d Natalya revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe and Bryan are going to make amazing parents and it\u2019s going to be such an exciting, new journey for them!\u201d Of course the athlete couldn\u2019t help mentioning the couple\u2019s newborn daughter, who she happens to think is already a daddy\u2019s girl.\u201dBirdie is going to be so loved and so spoiled,\u201d Natalya continued. \u201cI somehow have a feeling Bryan will be on diaper duty a lot!\u201d LOL.\n\nAlthough competitors in the ring, Natalya and Brie are friends IRL, and we love how excited she is for her fellow Total Divas star! After all, Natalya IS right, Brie\u2019s wanted to have a child for quite a while now. She even told Fit Pregnancy magazine earlier this year that becoming pregnant was \u201cone of the greatest moments\u201d of her life!\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the positive \u2014 you know, I\u2019m an athlete \u2014 it felt like I had won a championship! It took my breath away. I screamed out to tell Bryan,\u201d she gushed to the publication. We can totally see Daniel being an amazing dad too, and we hope Natalya\u2019s right \u2014 the athlete on diaper duty sounds WAY too precious.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers, can you too see Daniel on diaper duty a lot? Are you excited to see Birdie\u2019s first pic?", "images": ["https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/brie-bella-new-mom-ftr.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F05%2F11%2Fnatalya-neidhart-brie-bella-mom-interview-daughter-birdie%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2584860", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/brie-bella-new-mom-ftr.jpg?w=600", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/brie-bella-new-mom-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/11/natalya-neidhart-brie-bella-mom-interview-daughter-birdie/", "title": "Natalya Neidhart \u2018So Happy\u2019 For New Mom Brie Bella: Predicts \u2018Diaper Duty\u2019 For Daniel Bryan", "meta_data": {"description": "Revealing to us EXCLUSIVELY just how thrilled she is for new mom Brie Bella, WWE star Natalya Neidhart gushed about how 'spoiled' baby Birdie is going to be, AND that she thinks Daniel will be diaper duty king!", "news_keywords": "Brie Bella, Daniel Bryan, Natalya Neidhart, Sports, Total Bellas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Natalya Neidhart \u2018So Happy\u2019 For New Mom Brie Bella: Predicts \u2018Diaper Duty\u2019 For Daniel Bryan", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/11/natalya-neidhart-brie-bella-mom-interview-daughter-birdie/", "description": "Brie Bella became a new mom days ago, and already friends are showering her & hubby Daniel Bryan with love.
