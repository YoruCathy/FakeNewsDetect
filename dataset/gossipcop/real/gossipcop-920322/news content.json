I was marrying the love of my life.

Following the episode airing, he later announced on Twitter that not only had he and Parr had gotten back together, but they were now engaged!\n\n\u201cThomas and I, we have never really been apart, apart. We have been best friends for 12 years and we have known each other for 12 years,\u201d Parr told Us at the time. \u201cWe have always loved each other, that never stopped, whether we were together or not.\u201d\n\nWhile the fab five \u2014 Bobby Berk, Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness, Tan France and Karamo Brown \u2014 didn\u2019t attend the ceremony, the groom\u2019s appearance on Queer Eye played a part in his attire for his big day.
