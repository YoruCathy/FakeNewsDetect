Lacroix/WireImage)\n\nLess than 20 years ago, back when when Erykah Badu was still the love of Common\u2019s life, it would have seemed crazy\u2014ridiculous, even\u2014that an actor (especially an action actor) would go on record talking about seriously running for president.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut since we\u2019ve had Arnold Schwarzenegger as governor of the country\u2019s biggest state (and let\u2019s be clear, the only reason Arnie didn\u2019t run for president was that he wasn\u2019t born in this country) and a reality-show carnival barker as the commander in chief ... well, let\u2019s just say anything\u2019s possible. (And we can now be clear that Ronald Reagan wasn\u2019t just some fluke.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so, Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2014the black-Samoan former pro wrestler of the Fast and the Furious franchise, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Moana movie fame, as well as \u201cTyrese beefs\u201d and Ballers (the last two should preclude him from showing his face outside, much less running for the land\u2019s highest office)\u2014said in an interview published in Variety on Thursday that he would \u201c100 percent consider\u201d running for president, but it would most likely be in 2024 (not 2020 as first reported), because he has to make that Hollywood skrilla first.\n\n\u201cRealistically, as we go into 2018, when you look at my slate as we\u2019re developing and shooting into 2019 and 2020, the slate goes deep into 2021, so it feels like the realistic consideration would be 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson said that it was the people who really made him consider the move. On Saturday Night Live in May, he first touted the possibility of a run:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was never something that I trumpeted and beat my chest and ever said publicly, \u2018This is what I\u2019m going to do,\u2019 but as that story picked up, Americans picked it up and there was this sentiment of, \u2018We\u2019re not joking, and we would really love the idea if you would run,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIn the interview, the Rock also spoke his mind on the current administration.\n\n\u201cI continue to watch our leaders in government, and like all Americans, I continue to be hopeful that our leaders exhibit poise, perspective and the ability to bring our country together during these tough times\u2014which I don\u2019t feel our presidency is currently doing\u2014so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for his party affiliation, Johnson has attended both Republican and Democratic national conventions in the past and says he is a registered independent.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/ptbo6edrtwnunpyvinfr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/ptbo6edrtwnunpyvinfr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-he-s-seriously-consideri-1821353877", "title": "Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson Says He\u2019s Seriously Considering a Presidential Run ... in 2024", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "0h5mbA9rkZ-QI-vGJ0j8rPKcttrKWOTw-gtBoyuO-_k", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/efwyyktzi0a3tvjdgowk.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/efwyyktzi0a3tvjdgowk.png", "keywords": "Dwayne The Rock Johnson, 2024 presidential election, Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Rock for President, The Grapevine", "news_keywords": "Dwayne The Rock Johnson, 2024 presidential election, Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Rock for President, The Grapevine", "twitter": {"url": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-he-s-seriously-consideri-1821353877", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheRoot", "title": "Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson Says He\u2019s Seriously Considering a Presidential Run ... in 2024", "description": "Less than 20 years ago, back when when Erykah Badu was still the love of Common\u2019s life,  it would have seemed crazy\u2014ridiculous, even\u2014that an actor (especially an action actor) would go on record talking about seriously running for president.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/ptbo6edrtwnunpyvinfr.jpg"}, "description": "Less than 20 years ago, back when when Erykah Badu was still the love of Common\u2019s life,  it would have seemed crazy\u2014ridiculous, even\u2014that an actor (especially an action actor) would go on record talking about seriously running for president.", "og": {"title": "Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson Says He\u2019s Seriously Considering a Presidential Run ... in 2024", "type": "article", "url": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-says-he-s-seriously-consideri-1821353877", "description": "Less than 20 years ago, back when when Erykah Badu was still the love of Common\u2019s life,  it would have seemed crazy\u2014ridiculous, even\u2014that an actor (especially an action actor) would go on record talking about seriously running for president.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Grapevine", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/ptbo6edrtwnunpyvinfr.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 280492615405243}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://thegrapevine.theroot.com", "summary": ""}
