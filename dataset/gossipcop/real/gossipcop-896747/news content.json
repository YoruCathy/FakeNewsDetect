Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Harvey, Louis, Donna and Alex as the mysterious Samantha Wheeler is a direct threat to their status quo.\"\n\nThe Emmy-winning Heigl, who left Grey's Anatomy in 2010 to concentrate on her then-hot film career, has since starred in a pair of short-lived TV dramas, NBC's State of Affairs and, more recently, CBS' Doubt.\n\nOn Tuesday, USA announced that Markle's final episode will be April 25 and that Dul\u00e9 Hill, a veteran of The West Wing and Pysch, would replace the departing Patrick J. Adams.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/210cb3729fce047be349f403881fbb31562ba283/c=0-277-735-692/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530681855485361-GTY-671212836.jpg?width=735&height=415&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5724326634001_5724323577001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/42a7fa9b0e662a8bd72e0fd33c2889d4c2016a34/c=0-62-738-1046/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530681855485361-GTY-671212836.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/210cb3729fce047be349f403881fbb31562ba283/c=0-277-735-692/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530681855485361-GTY-671212836.jpg?width=735&height=415&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/02/01/katherine-heigl-joins-suits-wake-meghan-markles-departure/1085823001/", "title": "Katherine Heigl joins 'Suits' in the wake of Meghan Markle's departure", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Katherine Heigl joins 'Suits' in the wake of Meghan Markle's departure", "description": "The 'Grey's Anatomy' alumna will play a new partner at Pearson Specter Litt when Season 8 begins production in April.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/02/01/katherine-heigl-joins-suits-wake-meghan-markles-departure/1085823001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/210cb3729fce047be349f403881fbb31562ba283/c=0-277-735-692/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530681855485361-GTY-671212836.jpg?width=735&height=415&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 735, "height": 415}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Jayme Deerwester", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The 'Grey's Anatomy' alumna will play a new partner at Pearson Specter Litt when Season 8 begins production in April.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/210cb3729fce047be349f403881fbb31562ba283/c=0-277-735-692/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530681855485361-GTY-671212836.jpg?width=735&height=367&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Katherine Heigl joins 'Suits' in the wake of Meghan Markle's departure", "description": "The 'Grey's Anatomy' alumna will play a new partner at Pearson Specter Litt when Season 8 begins production in April."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517414400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
