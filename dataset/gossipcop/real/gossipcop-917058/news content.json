The 86-year-old actress belongs to a specific elite.\n\nBeyond her gift for collecting statuettes (she is an EGOT \u2014 having earned an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony), Ms. Moreno is sharp-minded and witty, a longtime dancer nimble enough as an octogenarian to skitter across a stage in front of millions and to do it in heels.\n\nPresenting the Academy Award for best foreign-language film \u2014 to the Chilean movie \u201cA Fantastic Woman\u201d \u2014 Ms. Moreno scored major style points by dressing in a repurposed version of an outfit she wore to collect her own Oscar, for \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d in 1962.\n\nThe full skirt was made from the weighty brocade cloth typically used for a kimono obi. Before the ceremony, Ms. Moreno explained that it had been fashioned for her in Manila. Back then, actresses were expected to provide their own get-ups for award ceremonies, without the help of stylists.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/10/world/10sorry-watching5/get-out-watching-articleLarge-v9.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The New York Times"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/oscars-2018-highlights-recap.html", "title": "The Best and Worst of Oscars 2018", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-03-05T14:37:20.000Z", "modified": "2018-03-05T14:49:23.000Z", "section": "Movies", "tag": "McDormand, Frances", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005773681, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/98e93ef9-d1f6-5878-8cbd-f144d481313d", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/21df4d2724a447128db4a2b69a16b8bb", "description": "From the red carpet scene to the stage, we share the highs and lows of the 90th Academy Awards.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By The New York Times", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Movies,TV,Oscars,Actor,Women and Girls,Tiffany Haddish,Maya Rudolph,Jimmy Kimmel,Frances McDormand", "pdate": 20180305, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/oscars-2018-highlights-recap.html", "type": "article", "title": "The Best and Worst of Oscars 2018", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Tiffany Haddish, left, and Maya Rudolph getting comfortable onstage."}, "description": "From the red carpet scene to the stage, we share the highs and lows of the 90th Academy Awards."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/oscars-2018-highlights-recap.html", "title": "The Best and Worst of Oscars 2018", "description": "From the red carpet scene to the stage, we share the highs and lows of the 90th Academy Awards.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/06/arts/06best-worst-oscars2/06best-worst-oscars2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Tiffany Haddish, left, and Maya Rudolph getting comfortable onstage."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/98e93ef9-d1f6-5878-8cbd-f144d481313d"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "movies", "CN": "awards-season", "CT": "news-event", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/oscars-2018-highlights-recap.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/98e93ef9-d1f6-5878-8cbd-f144d481313d", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/oscars-2018-highlights-recap.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/movies/oscars-2018-highlights-recap.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520179200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
