Upon arrival, Foxx could be seen acting the perfect gentleman, walking around the black SUV the pair arrived in to give Holmes his hand. The romantic night out comes amid rumors that the elusive couple -- who have never publicly acknowledged their relationship -- may have broken up.\n\nA source recently told ET that rumos of a split are false and that the couple are just \"still very, very private. You\u2019re not going to hear or see every time they\u2019re together because they don\u2019t flaunt their relationship in public.\u201d\n\nBACKGRID\n\nFoxx, 50, and Holmes, 39, have kept their relationship extremely low profile for years. They were first romantically linked back in 2013 -- a year after Holmes' divorce from Tom Cruise -- when they were spotted dancing together onstage at the 4th Annual Apollo in the Hamptons Benefit. Foxx publicly denied their relationship at the time, but evidence began to pile up over the years, whether it was a photo of the pair holding hands in his music studio, a quick dinner date in New York City or a romantic stroll on the beach in Malibu.\n\nThe couple got slightly less shy this year, making a rare public appearance together at the Clive Davis and the Recording Academy\u2019s Pre-GRAMMY Gala in New York City.\n\nBut, true to form, Foxx, just one month later, yanked off his headset at a celebrity basketball game and abruptly ended an interview when asked about Holmes.\n\nFor a look at that short interview, watch the video below.\n\nJamie Foxx Walks Off Live ESPN Broadcast After Katie Holmes Question: Watch!
