The average age, race, and body type of women depicted in media today still represents only a small fraction of the female population. Led by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), SeeHer is a collective of leading marketers committed to creating advertising and supporting content that portrays women and girls as they really are. It launched in June 2016 in partnership with The Female Quotient (The FQ) in Washington DC at the United State of Women. To help marketers benchmark success, the group developed Gender Equality MeasureTM, GEMTM, the first research methodology that quantifies gender bias in ads and programming. GEMTM shows that content portraying females accurately dramatically increases purchase intent and brand reputation, increasing return on investment (ROI) by as much as 30 percent. GEMTM won the prestigious 2017 ESOMAR Research Effectiveness Award, and the methodology became the industry standard, which led to a global rollout in 2018. In 2019 the movement expanded into new verticals including sports (#SeeHerInSports) and music (#SeeHerHearHer.)\n\nVisit SeeHer.com and follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @SeeHer2020.\n\nAbout the Association of National Advertisers (ANA)\n\nThe ANA\u2019s mission is to drive growth for marketing professionals, for brands and businesses, and for the industry.
