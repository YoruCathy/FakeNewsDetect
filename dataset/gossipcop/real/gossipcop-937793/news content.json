I said \u2018just before you go in, sit on those stairs.\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd she just slumped between his legs and there was this moment where they were just laughing because they were exhausted and thinking finally it\u2019s all over. It was one of these beautiful moments.\u201d\n\nDays after their dream ceremony, the couple got back to work, attending their first official event as a married couple.\n\nMeghan looked particularly regal at the garden party held at Buckingham Palace donning a peach dress from British brand Goat, a custom hat by Philip Treacy and nude pumps.\n\nGoat is a brand often worn by the Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan\u2019s new sister-in-law.\n\nMore than 6,000 charity workers were invited for the party, to celebrate Prince Charles\u2019s 70th birthday, where they were treated to a speech from Harry, musical performances and a customary cup of tea.\n\nThe event was held ahead of Prince Charles\u2019 actual birthday which is in November.\n\nMeghan and Harry had delayed their honeymoon so they could attend the event.\n\nThe pair looked like they were enjoying their first week as husband and wife, with Meghan touching Harry\u2019s back as they walked up the stairs of Buckingham Palace.\n\nHundreds of royal fans had lined the streets surrounding the palace in an attempt to get glimpse of the newlyweds.\n\nPrince Harry was wearing a traditional morning suit with a yellow waistcoat and blue tie.\n\nHe gave a speech where he paid tribute to his father\u2019s charity work.\n\n\u201cHis enthusiasm and energy are truly infectious; it has certainly inspired William and I to get involved in issues we care passionately about and to do whatever we can to make a difference. In fact, many of the issues William and I now work on are subjects we were introduced to by our father growing up,\u201d Harry said.\n\n\u201cSo, Pa, while I know that you\u2019ve asked that today not be about you, you must forgive me if I don\u2019t listen to you \u2014 much like when I was younger \u2014 and instead, I ask everyone here to say a huge thank you to you, for your incredible work over nearly 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe Prince, who was forced to bat off a rogue bee during the address, also asked the audience to take a minute to remember the one year anniversary of the Manchester terrorist attack.\n\nHe said his brother William would have been at their father\u2019s party were he not attending a tribute service in Manchester.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Fox News and
