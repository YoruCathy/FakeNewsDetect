Justice League and Thor: Ragnarok both come out next month. The new trailer for Black Panther just dropped last week. A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel\u2019s ever-growing stable of Netflix series.\n\nThe thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it.\n\nIt\u2019s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox.\n\nThe show \u2014 a drama set in the X-Men\u2019s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high\u2014 is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show\u2019s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren\u2019t exactly well-known for their dazzle.)\n\nBut the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men.\n\nThe Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren\u2019t celebrity superheroes\n\nThe Gifted\u2019s premise is divided into two main plots.\n\nThe first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a. Blink (Jamie Chung); mistress of magnetism Lorna Dane, a.k.a. Polaris (Emma Dumont); and photon-manipulating Marcos Diaz a.k.a. Eclipse (Sean Teale). The team\u2019s main objective is to house and protect mutants who are on the run.\n\nThe second plot centers on the Strucker family, an initially normal-seeming bunch headed up by dad Reed (Stephen Moyer) and mom Caitlin (Kate) (Amy Acker). However, the Struckers\u2019 lives become anything but ordinary when siblings Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) find out they\u2019re mutants.\n\nThese two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show\u2019s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird\u2019s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants.\n\nIn each episode, there\u2019s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed\u2019s conscience and whether he\u2019ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it\u2019ll spare his family.\n\nSince the X-Men aren\u2019t present in this world, in the public\u2019s eye, all mutants, even if they\u2019re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous. And this bleak view of humanity and its warts are what makes The Gifted\u2019s premise such a strong addition to the X-Men universe.\n\nThunderbird\u2019s team knows just how bad humans can be. The Strucker family is just learning. And the show becomes a push and pull between two ideologies, with the Struckers slowly realizing what it\u2019s like to be outsiders.\n\nLast year, I had the opportunity to speak to Chris Claremont, a comic book writer who, with artists John Byrne and Dave Cockrum, is considered to be part of the team that breathed new life into the X-Men in the \u201970s and \u201980s and turned them into the pop culture force they are today. Claremont told me that what was most crucial to the X-Men was the idea that they were outsiders.\n\n\u201cThe one core difference that made the X-universe unique, compared to the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and all of the rest of the Marvel universe, is that they were totally clandestine. People were scared because they weren't a public team,\u201d Claremont said. \u201cThey were a shadow team. There were only a few of them, comparatively speaking. If you take that away, then they are no different than any other team.\u201d\n\nThis idea is key to The Gifted. The reason it feels so different from many other superhero shows stems from the role that fear plays in its story; no one is saving the day in one fell swoop. And even though there are acts of heroism \u2014 like Thunderbird and Eclipse rescuing the Struckers in the third episode \u2014 any small miracles that would otherwise inspire hope and optimism are swallowed up by the relentlessness and influence of a government that\u2019s intent on rounding up and getting rid of mutants. It\u2019s compelling because it\u2019s not a superhero story, but rather a survival story about beings who happen to have superpowers.\n\nBut the show also smartly tweaks the classic X-Men story by changing its point of view\n\nIn addition to capturing the fear and loathing of the X-universe, The Gifted incorporates a lot of other classic X-Men elements: Family \u2014 both the one you\u2019re born into and the one you choose \u2014 is a major theme. So is the question of who helps the helpless. Villains are omnipresent and constantly spying, as the government\u2019s Sentinel program sees and hears almost everything.\n\nWhen you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who\u2019ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them. It\u2019s up to the X-Men, who themselves are hated by society, to help these marginalized groups.\n\nThose stories are largely told through the X-Men\u2019s point of view. The X-Men must help the helpless. They must protect the weak. They become symbols of hope and perseverance. And they rise above the ignorance they\u2019re greeted with.\n\nThe Gifted flips this concept by eliminating the X-Men and operating from the perspective of those who would typically need the X-Men\u2019s help.\n\nFamiliar X-Men \u2014 Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Wolverine, and friends \u2014 don\u2019t officially exist in this universe (though if The Gifted becomes a huge hit, we might see a cameo or two). That means there aren\u2019t a bunch of well-known heroes standing by to save the day. Also gone are larger-than-life villains like Magneto or Mr. Sinister. Thunderbird\u2019s team of mutants are more of the average variety; some of them are still figuring out their powers, and they aren\u2019t anywhere near as powerful or savvy as the X-Men.\n\nBasically, there\u2019s no distinct \u201csuperhero\u201d team element in the show.\n\nAs a result, The Gifted focuses on what it\u2019s like to be on the run from the government, rather than what it\u2019s like to save the day. The show doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time debating the philosophical future of mutantkind or proselytizing about saving the world. Instead, it\u2019s a more intimate, personal story.\n\nThis opens up several opportunities that allow viewers to see what discrimination looks like not from a superhero\u2019s perspective \u2014 which extends above and beyond human ignorance \u2014 but from a more grounded, human one. In episode three, for example, the Struckers visited Kate\u2019s brother Danny, only to find out \u2014 once he learns that his niece and nephew are mutants \u2014 that his anti-mutant sentiment is stronger than blood.\n\nThe Gifted is more about uncertainty and fright than action and flash, since it centers on characters who are just trying to live to see another day. In other words, it\u2019s found a unique, television-friendly story in a universe that\u2019s already told many. And that in itself has made the show worth watching.\n\nThe Gifted airs Mondays at 9 pm Eastern on Fox. Previous episodes are streaming on Fox\u2019s website and Hulu.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673215/GettyImages_1210313196.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66651909/1201158477.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673258/GettyImages_1219080127.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zq3JPaX_6jNjNZSD1o_bbQWBGM8=/0x148:1347x853/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9516647/MV5BNmQzNTY4MWMtNDhiOC00YmQxLTgzNDktOWUzNWVlY2NhYjU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5Mjg0NjU_._V1_SY1000_CR0_0_1347_1000_AL_.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672824/GettyImages_491031770.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVLpRmwOzOV4v6u86KkaSeyh3v8=/0x0:1347x1000/1200x800/filters:focal(567x393:781x607)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57267197/MV5BNmQzNTY4MWMtNDhiOC00YmQxLTgzNDktOWUzNWVlY2NhYjU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5Mjg0NjU_._V1_SY1000_CR0_0_1347_1000_AL_.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672963/GettyImages_1208286960.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673052/GettyImages_1210354251.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zq3JPaX_6jNjNZSD1o_bbQWBGM8=/0x148:1347x853/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9516647/MV5BNmQzNTY4MWMtNDhiOC00YmQxLTgzNDktOWUzNWVlY2NhYjU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc5Mjg0NjU_._V1_SY1000_CR0_0_1347_1000_AL_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Abad-Santos", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Riley Beggin", "Dylan Matthews", "Li Zhou", "Ella Nilsen", "Oct"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/23/16490708/the-gifted-x-men-review-good-show-pls-watch", "title": "Got superhero fatigue?
