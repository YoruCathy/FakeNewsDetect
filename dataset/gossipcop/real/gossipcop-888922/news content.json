'Happy Birthday to my amazing wife,' he captioned the snap.\n\nIt appears the Deadpool actor couldn't get enough of his wife's joke, and commented on the picture: 'Awesome.'\n\nEarlier in the day, Reynolds revealed to his Twitter followers how he kicked off his birthday celebrations with his family.\n\nMy kids tried to surprise me for my birthday this morning. I totally heard them coming and snuck out to start a new life somewhere else. \u2014 Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) October 23, 2017\n\nLively's joke comes day after she opened up on Good Morning America on the secret to her happy marriage with the actor.\n\n'In general, yeah, it's nice to have somebody who understands what you're doing. Especially because our job is so weird\u2014we have to, you know, like be married to other people, and it's all so strange. It's still strange. It's never normal, even when we're both doing it.'\n\nHappy birthday, Ryan!", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/36/1600x800/landscape-1504601177-taylor-swift-bff.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/4000x2000/landscape-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg?resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/4000x2000/landscape-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a39499/blake-lively-birthday-message-ryan-gosling-ryan-reynolds/", "title": "Blake Lively Gets Sweet Revenge On Ryan Reynolds With Hilarious Birthday Message About Ryan Gosling", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Blake Lively Gets Sweet Revenge On Ryan Reynolds With Hilarious Birthday Message", "description": "Revenge is a dish best served on social media", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a39499/blake-lively-birthday-message-ryan-gosling-ryan-reynolds/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/4000x2000/landscape-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-01 08:15:11", "published_time": "2017-10-24 07:49:00", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/4000x2000/landscape-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Blake Lively Gets Sweet Revenge On Ryan Reynolds With Hilarious Birthday Message About Ryan Gosling", "description": "The 30-year-old has posted a birthday tribute to the leading man in her life\u2026sort of.", "keywords": "Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, birthday message, birthday post, blake lively ryan reynolds, ryan gosling, instagram", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/2560x2560/square-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,ryan reynolds,Ryan Gosling,Blake Lively", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-24T07:49:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/4000x2000/landscape-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/35/2560x2560/square-1504167063-gettyimages-488766751-4.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Blake Lively Gets Sweet Revenge On Ryan Reynolds With Hilarious Birthday Message", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508802540.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
