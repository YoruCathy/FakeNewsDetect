{"url": "http://www.pbs.org/program/metoo-now-what/", "text": "Our five-part series aims to create a space for authentic and honest dialogue among women and men, fostering feelings of understanding, healing, and reconciliation. We\u2019ll have the uncomfortable conversations, reflecting on the times in which we - as individuals and as a society - have been complacent, as well as the times in which we may have been complicit.\n\nBeyond the sensational headlines, #METOO, NOW WHAT? will examine many of the factors that enable sexual harassment to endure in the workplace, despite the laws that are supposed to prevent it from happening. We\u2019ll take a look at how popular culture, pay inequity, gender discrimination, and the intersecting issues of race and class, affect the way society views women. We\u2019ll also explore how men can be engaged in this discussion, how some men are rethinking masculinity, and, ultimately, how we might begin to chart a path forward.\n\nWe invite Americans from all walks of life to participate in this critical conversation, using the hashtag #MeTooOnPBS. On the show, we\u2019ll be talking to activists, journalists, celebrities, chefs, and leaders from the worlds of media, academia, business, advertising, gaming, and the service industries. Online, we hope to hear from you, too. Host Zainab Salbi says, \u201cWe need to have this conversation out of awareness and compassion - and not anger - if we want to create lasting cultural change.\u201d", "images": ["https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/UaFCYB6-asset-mezzanine-16x9-6HZrc32.jpg.focalcrop.1200x630.50.10.jpg", "https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/UaFCYB6-asset-mezzanine-16x9-6HZrc32.jpg?focalcrop=767x421x50x10&format=jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/masterpiece.5d684fbaedc7.png", "https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/sU6pPIW-asset-mezzanine-16x9-nFSu7yj.jpg?focalcrop=767x431x50x10&format=jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/primevideo.4014bccdacf5.png", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/pbs-living.15fb84653c8e.png", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/google-logo.9210448685a5.png", "https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/kMmFDwF-asset-mezzanine-16x9-3l4ohsd.png?focalcrop=767x431x50x10&format=jpg", "https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/ZtR5BQ5-asset-mezzanine-16x9-xnW4zsT.jpg?focalcrop=767x431x50x10&format=jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/itunes.15926b093491.png", "https://image.pbs.org/contentchannels/fpzxiXK-white-logo-41-dAcvqsV.png?resize=300x", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/pbskids.6569d53f89d0.png", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/pbs-passport.1005997716ce.png", "https://image.pbs.org/curate-console/e070a003-1e25-4e7d-9c6b-0ca22c53e5ef.jpg", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/vudu.b60eb6ff9002.png", "http://www.pbs.org/static/images/pbs-digital-downloads/google-play.85bbdc0e577c.png"], "top_img": "https://image.pbs.org/video-assets/UaFCYB6-asset-mezzanine-16x9-6HZrc32.jpg.focalcrop.1200x630.50.10.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.pbs.org/show/metoo-now-what/", "title": "#MeToo, Now What?", "meta_data": {"description": "Executive editor and host Zainab Salbi goes beyond the headlines about sexual harassment to ask how we got here and how we move forward.
