The A-list couple took a night off from parenting their newborn twins Ella and Alexander to enjoy a night out with friends in Italy on Tuesday, July 11. The couple, who welcomed their son and daughter in June, looked tan and happy as they stepped out for dinner at il Gatto Nero, one of their favorite restaurants in Northern Italy. The Oscar winner and lawyer were joined by pal Ben Weiss for the outing. \"Everyone was so excited to see him and Amal for dinner,\" one onlooker told People magazine. \"They got many hugs and a lot of love. Amal looked gorgeous and didn't look the slightest bit tired. She kept smiling and looked so happy.\"\n\nCLICK FOR FULL GALLERY\n\nVER GALER\u00cdA George and Amal recently welcomed their twins Alexander and Ella Photo: \u00a9 2017 Mega/The Grosby Group Milano\n\nThe human rights attorney looked characteristically chic for the outing wearing a one-shoulder floral frock. Meanwhile the actor sported a grey button down shirt. The first-time parents were photographed arriving to Milan earlier this month with their bundles of joy in tow \u2014 marking the first time the duo had been seen in public with Ella and Alexander. Lake Como is a favorite retreat for George, 56, and Amal, 39, and they have often holidayed at their family home there. No doubt the pair are enjoying their first family vacation to Italy with their children.\n\nGeorge and Amal welcomed their twins on June 6 with the couple's son arriving first followed by his sister two minutes later. A rep for the actor confirmed the babies' arrival to HOLA! USA at the time with a statement that read: \u201cThis morning Amal and George welcomed Ella and Alexander Clooney into their lives. Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine. George is sedated and should recover in a few days.\u201d\n\nVER GALER\u00cdA The new parents headed out for a dinner date with friends at il Gatto Nero Photo: \u00a9 2017 Mega/The Grosby Group Milano\n\nAmal's mother, Baria Alamuddin, spoke exclusively to HOLA!'s sister brand HELLO! following the twins' birth saying, \"The babies are so beautiful and our family is complete. They are going to bring so much joy, and I hope they will be as good as their parents at bringing harmony and human rights to the world. Myself and my husband are thrilled.\"\n\nShe added, \"Amal is doing very well, and they are extremely happy and overjoyed. Everything went really smoothly with the birth. I'd like to thank the doctors and staff who looked after them. This is a very happy time in my life, and I\u2019m thrilled to be a grandmother again \u2013 I now have eight perfect grandchildren. I am very well practiced! Nothing rivals being a mother except being a grandmother, it's one of the great joys of life.\"", "images": ["http://editor2.us.hola.com/imagenes/YOU_CAN_CHANGE_THIS_TEXT/0-57-612/george-amal-date-night-z.jpg?t0", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019062525189/george-clooney-netflix-morning-moonlight-film-video/0-185-427/George-Clooney-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019062425126/barack-obama-michelle-obama-vacation-george-clooney-amal-clooney-lake-como/0-185-138/obamas-clooneys-lake-como-2019-getty-gc-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/fashion/2019062725281/amal-clooney-summer-style-venice-romantic-trip-george-clooney/0-185-912/george-amal-clooney-venice-getty-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/0-8-717/george-amal-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035866&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=XbAUn1QolK10cv", "https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hola/comunes/holacom.gif", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/hola-en-ingles/201707128975/new-parents-george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/0-57-648/georgeamalitaly-z.jpg", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019062525199/barack-obama-george-clooney-family-bond/0-185-500/barack-obama-george-clooney-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/0-8-718/george-amal-1-m.jpg?filter=w400"], "top_img": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/0-8-717/george-amal-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/", "title": "New parents George and Amal Clooney enjoy date night in Italy", "meta_data": {"title": "New parents George and Amal Clooney enjoy date night in Italy", "description": "Ella and Alexander Clooney's parents stepped out for a romantic dinner date in Italy.", "keywords": "george clooney, amal clooney, george and amal clooney, george clooney twins, george clooney lake como, george amal clooney lake como, george clooney italy, amal clooney twins, amal clooney babies, george clooney babies, alexander clooney, ella clooney, il Gatto Nero, clooneys, george clooney lake como restaurant, george clooney twins born, george clooney twins names", "dc.title": "New parents George and Amal Clooney enjoy date night in Italy", "classification": "famosos,noticias-famosos,hola", "language": "en-US", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=3, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "george clooney, amal clooney, george and amal clooney, george clooney twins, george clooney lake como, george amal clooney lake como, george clooney italy, amal clooney twins, amal clooney babies, george clooney babies, alexander clooney, ella clooney, il Gatto Nero, clooneys, george clooney lake como restaurant, george clooney twins born, george clooney twins names", "og": {"title": "New parents George and Amal Clooney enjoy date night in Italy", "description": "Ella and Alexander Clooney's parents stepped out for a romantic dinner date in Italy.", "image": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/0-8-717/george-amal-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "updated_time": "2017-07-12T08:12:30Z", "url": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/", "type": "article", "site_name": "HOLA USA"}, "fb": {"admins": 288444131299841}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-12T08:12:30Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-12T08:12:30Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@usahola", "creator": "@usahola", "url": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/", "title": "New parents George and Amal Clooney enjoy date night in Italy", "description": "Ella and Alexander Clooney's parents stepped out for a romantic dinner date in Italy..", "image": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/201707128975/george-clooney-amal-clooney-dinner-date-italy/0-8-717/george-amal-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f"}, "hmn": "true"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499847150.0, "source": "https://us.hola.com", "summary": ""}
