(In fact, Manson was the last member to join the band.) So if you count Garbage and search through every other album of the year category since the Grammys started in 1959, this actually marks the first time in history that no white men have been nominated for the night\u2019s biggest prize.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is especially notable for the Grammys, which saw lots of criticism last year when Adele\u2019s \u201c25\u201d won over Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cLemonade.\u201d The year before that, Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d beat Lamar\u2019s \u201cTo Pimp a Butterfly.\u201d And the year before that, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled album lost to Beck\u2019s \u201cMorning Phase.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the past five years, black artists have been making era-defining pop music, some of which has been nominated for the heaviest Grammy in the land, album of the year,\u201d Washington Post music critic Chris Richards wrote after last year\u2019s show. \u201cThen, when \u2018music\u2019s biggest night\u2019 eventually rolls around, each and every one of these artists loses to a white act doing less-challenging, less-timely, less-imaginative work.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Tuesday with Variety, Recording Academy president Neil Portnow acknowledged the diversity of this year\u2019s nominees and credited it to the large pool of voting members; there are about 13,000 overall. Plus, the Grammys opened up online voting for the first time this year, which led to a wider range of ballots than usual.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe results are reflecting the music of the times \u2014 hip-hop and urban music is pervasive in our society worldwide \u2014 not just in America,\u201d Portnow said. \u201cSo when that continues to be evident and evolve, this is a reflection of that.\u201d\n\nHe also explained that Sheeran being relegated to the pop album category is not necessarily a snub but simply indicative of where the voters thought he belonged.\n\n\u201cIn terms of Ed and the recordings he made, certainly our voters thought highly of him and he is nominated [for two awards]. In terms of where he\u2019s nominated, that\u2019s our members\u2019 call and I have to respect that,\u201d Portnow added.\n\nThe Grammy Awards will air Jan. 28 on CBS.\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wYkbGjrxkXhV2zqUhlmPdkXmUg0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZTMWQPC2FE3V7CXTXC2EGFL3HQ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/wYkbGjrxkXhV2zqUhlmPdkXmUg0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZTMWQPC2FE3V7CXTXC2EGFL3HQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/11/28/for-the-first-time-in-grammy-history-a-white-man-isnt-nominated-for-album-of-the-year/", "title": "For the first time in Grammy history, a white man isn\u2019t nominated for album of the year", "meta_data": {"description": "Grammy prognosticators said Kendrick Lamar and Ed Sheeran would go head-to-head.
