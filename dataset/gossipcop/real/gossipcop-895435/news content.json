But hey, at least this guy has moves! Around one minute and 15 seconds in, the couple breaks up the hell of relationship monotony with a thrilling dance routine (think more La La Land than, say, Magic Mike).\n\nThen they challenge gender norms: Pink is thrilled to see her husband wearing her clothing in the closet. After giving Tatum the finishing touch with a swipe of her bright red lipstick, Pink slips into an old-school gangster costume for some cheeky choreography. (Nice twirl, Tatum!) Though the following S&M scene is tame compared to everything Madonna did in the early \u201990s, it\u2019s clear that Pink knows how to work that Bettie Page wig.\n\nImage zoom RCA Records\n\nIt\u2019s been a busy few days for Pink, who performed \u201cBeautiful Trauma\u201d \u2014 the title track off her seventh studio album, out now \u2014 while scaling the side of a building in Los Angeles at the American Music Awards on Sunday. Elsewhere during the show, the singer-songwriter performed an emotional rendition of R.E.M.\u2019s \u201cEverybody Hurts\u201d with Kelly Clarkson and was criticized for her supposed reaction to Christina Aguilera\u2019s Whitney Houston tribute.\n\n\u201cBeautiful Trauma\u201d follows the release of \u201cWhat About Us\u201d and \u201cRevenge,\u201d Pink\u2019s headline-grabbing duet with Eminem.\n\nWatch her new clip above.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink-and-channing-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink-and-channing-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink-and-channing-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Maslow"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2017/11/21/pink-channing-tatum-beautiful-trauma-music-video/", "title": "Pink and Channing Tatum dance in drag in new 'Beautiful Trauma' music video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Channing Tatum,Pink", "news_keywords": "Channing Tatum,Pink", "description": "Watch the clip here.", "og": {"title": "Pink and Channing Tatum dance in drag in new 'Beautiful Trauma' music video", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/11/21/pink-channing-tatum-beautiful-trauma-music-video/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBt_88nxG4c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent There\u2019s something about pop divas that drives Channing Tatum to dance in drag \u2014 remember his performance as&nbsp;Beyonc\u00e9 on Lip Sync Battle? \u2014 and&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink-and-channing-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/11/21/pink-channing-tatum-beautiful-trauma-music-video/", "description": "Watch the clip here.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink-and-channing-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2017/11/21/pink-channing-tatum-beautiful-trauma-music-video/", "title": "Pink and Channing Tatum dance in drag in new 'Beautiful Trauma' music video", "description": "Watch the clip here.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F11%2Fpink-and-channing-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/EBt_88nxG4c"], "publish_date": 1511193600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
