News, ABC enforced new alcohol-consumption guidelines on the upcoming Bachelor spinoff, such as forbidding contestants from drinking immediately before competing in any challenges. (Not a bad idea!) ABC also reportedly implemented a two-drink-per-hour rule, required contestants to log all their drinks, and brought on mental-health and wellness staff members.\n\nThe alcohol crackdown is likely a response to last summer\u2019s Bachelor in Paradise sexual-misconduct scandal, in which Corinne Olympios accused fellow contestant DeMario Jackson of sexually assaulting her when she was too intoxicated to consent. According to a Bachelor in Paradise crew member, Olympios \u201cseemed to go limp\u201d during their sexual encounter in a hot tub. (Warner Bros. later claimed there was no wrongdoing.)\n\nWhile the new guidelines won\u2019t stop contestants from getting at least a little drunk \u2014 most people would be if they had four drinks in two hours, which the rules allow \u2014 E!
