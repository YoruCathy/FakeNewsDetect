Robert Pattinson is our kind of guy (and everyone\u2019s who has a heart) for refusing to masturbate a dog\u2014which is like child molestation\u2014and for talking about it so that the public can see that once again animal trainers\u2019 top priority is money and animals\u2019 interests and well-being are often ignored. PETA is currently investigating whether the law was broken in this instance.\n\nMore information about PETA\u2019s work to help animals is available at PETA.org.", "images": ["https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo-white.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-text-logo-blue.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/footer-ingrid-bg-600x320.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/full-contact-petas-media-department-300x170.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/bunny.svg", "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/themes/petaorg/assets/images/peta-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-statement-robert-pattinsons-refusal-sexually-molest-dog/", "title": "PETA Statement on Robert Pattinson\u2019s Refusal to Sexually Molest a Dog", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=421236952", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-04", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/officialpeta", "section": "Animals in Entertainment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 5647744585}, "cf-cache-tags": "ccm-857734", "description": "Below, please find a statement from PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange in response to Robert Pattinson's announcement that he had refused to perform a", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "PETA Statement on Robert Pattinson's Refusal to Sexually Molest a Dog | PETA", "description": "Below, please find a statement from PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange in response to Robert Pattinson's announcement that he had refused to perform a", "url": "https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-statement-robert-pattinsons-refusal-sexually-molest-dog/", "site_name": "PETA", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 1006}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Below, please find a statement from PETA Senior Vice President Lisa Lange in response to Robert Pattinson's announcement that he had refused to perform a", "title": "PETA Statement on Robert Pattinson's Refusal to Sexually Molest a Dog | PETA", "site": "@peta", "image": "https://www.peta.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/peta-facebook-placeholder-new.jpg", "creator": "@peta"}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "pubdate": 20170804}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501776000.0, "source": "https://www.peta.org", "summary": ""}
