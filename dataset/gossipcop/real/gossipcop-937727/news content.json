Whether stars were championing each other, honoring lives we've lost or giving a voice to those who need it most, this year's show was a powerful one from Kelly Clarkson's moving cold open to Salt-N-Pepa's nostalgic (and energetic) finish.\n\nThere were plenty of memorable, GIF-able and quote-able moments from the 2018 BBMAs on Sunday night (May 20), and we've rounded up our favorite highlights below.\n\nKelly Clarkson\u2019s call to action\n\nBefore officially kicking off the night with an awe-inspiring medley of the year\u2019s biggest Billboard hits, Clarkson started her Billboard Music Awards hosting gig by paying tribute to those who lost their lives in the tragic Sante Fe High School shooting just two days prior. In a powerful move, Clarkson went against what producers asked and called on fans and viewers to take action.\n\n\"I\u2019m so sick of the moment of silence because it\u2019s not working,\u201d she said while choking back tears. \"How about a moment of action, a moment of change. Why don\u2019t we change what\u2019s happening?\u201d\n\nKhalid dancing to Kelly Clarkson\u2019s opening performance\n\nBetween performing with Shawn Mendes and Normani and winning top new artist, Khalid had a pretty solid Billboard Music Awards experience. But his highlight of the night may have been Kelly Clarkson\u2019s opening number, especially when she sang his hit \u201cYoung, Dumb & Broke.\u201d Please see GIF evidence below.\n\nLuis Fonsi\u2019s shout-out to the Spanish-speaking community\n\nWhile accepting the award for Top Hot 100 Song for \u201cDespacito,\u201d Fonsi thanked fans for loving a mostly Spanish song and then went on to deliver an inspiring message to those who speak his language. \u201cThis goes out to all my Latino brothers, all the immigrants. All the DREAMers out there, all of those who get made fun of when you speak with an accent, all of those when they say, \u2018Hey speak English.\u2019 To you \u2014 Puerto Rico, this goes out to you.\"\n\nCamila Cabello being unapologetically herself\n\nCamila Cabello has always been a goofball, but it was especially apparent at this year's BBMAs. Camila was clearly pumped for her new tour mate when Swift won top female artist, jumping up and down while the \u201cDelicate\u201d singer made her way to the stage. Then when Swift shouted her out during her speech, Cabello let loose, and continued to throughout the rest of the night (like headbanging during Shawn Mendes' performance) \u2014 and it was awesome.\n\nTyra Bank\u2019s \u201cThat was powerful\u201d response to Christina Aguilera and Demi Lovato's performance\n\nThe dynamic divas had the whole arena on their feet after the debut of their new collaboration \u201cFall In Line,\u201d but there was one reaction that encompassed what everyone was thinking:\n\n\"That was powerful!!!!!!!!!!\" - Tyra Banks reacts to Christina Aguilera & Demi Lovato's duet pic.twitter.com/Ka4CHdp6YF \u2014 Born Salty (@cjzero) May 21, 2018\n\nCardi B\u2019s \u201ccameo\u201d during J.Lo\u2019s \u201cDinero\u201d performance\n\nWith a baby on the way in a number of weeks, Cardi B was unable to assist her latest collaborators Jennifer Lopez and DJ Khaled with their performance of \u201cDinero.\u201d Even with her absence, Cardi made sure to still make an appearance through a fabulous black-and-white video tearing up her verse \u2014 and of course having J.Lo join in for the already iconic line, \"Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx.\"\n\nShawn Mendes and Khalid giving Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students the spotlight\n\nIn line with the action that Clarkson called for in the show's beginning, Mendes and Khalid had Parkland students join them for their poignant anthem, \"Youth,\" a powerful addition that resulted in a prolonged standing ovation.\n\nChills from this moving @ShawnMendes & @thegreatkhalid performance. A huge thank you to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Show Choir for being a part of this special #BBMAs moment. pic.twitter.com/tBntNJs2J5 \u2014 Billboard Music Awards (@BBMAs) May 21, 2018\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s empowering acceptance speeches\n\nSwift was already inspiring during her first win, calling out her fellow female musicians as she accepted the award for top female artist. But she really gave fans all the feels upon accepting her second award (for top selling album), sending a heartfelt thank you to those Swifties that have helped her \u201cfeel understood again.\"\n\nLook What You Made @taylorswift13 do -- ...WIN the #BBMAs for Top Female Artist! Congrats! pic.twitter.com/adf3zY3YxG \u2014 Billboard Music Awards (@BBMAs) May 21, 2018\n\nAndy Cohen bopping to Janet Jackson\n\nThe Watch What Happens Live host had some pretty GIF-able moments throughout the entire show, but his dancing to Janet Jackson\u2019s performance was one that even GIPHY had to acknowledge:\n\nJanet Jackson\u2019s nod to #TimesUp and #MeToo\n\nThe 2018 Icon Award recipient was obviously one of the night\u2019s most-anticipated stars, and she made the most of her position with a powerful shout-out to those who have taken part in the #TimesUp and #MeToo movements. \"I believe for all our challenges, we live at a glorious moment history,\u201d she declared. \"It's a moment when, at long last, women have made it clear that we will no longer be controlled, manipulated or abused. I stand with those women and with those men equally outraged who support us in heart and mind.\"\n\nSimon Cowell and Kelly Clarkson have a mini American Idol reunion\n\nCoincidentally on the same night that the American Idol finale aired, the Season 1 winner and OG judge had a brief run-in on the BBMAs stage \u2014 and it was as adorable as any Idol fan would\u2019ve hoped. Clarkson looked genuinely excited to see Cowell as they went in for a hug, and the now-America\u2019s Got Talent judge couldn\u2019t help gushing over the singer's impressive performance. \"That was bloody fantastic, what can I say? I\u2019m very proud of you.\"\n\nJungkook\u2019s abs flash\n\nIt was no secret that BTS\u2019 performance was one of the most (if not the most) awaited of the night, and they absolutely blew expectations out of the water with their high-energy debut of \u201cFake Love.\u201d While the entire performance undoubtedly made the Internet erupt, Jungkook\u2019s quick shot of his rock-hard abs likely made fans' already melting hearts complete mush.\n\nthank u jungkook pic.twitter.com/dzXFANa2O9 \u2014 jungkook being extra (@kookbeingextra) May 21, 2018\n\nSalt-N-Pepa closing out the show\n\nPutting the cap on a night that featured hits of the last year, Salt-N-Pepa reminded the world that the '90s had some of the GOAT jams. Joining forces with another sassy bunch of legends, En Vogue, the gals delivered a fiery medley of \"Shoop/Let's Talk About Sex/Push It/Whatta Man\u201d that sent everyone off with both throwback and positive vibes.", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/2018-BBMAs-recirc.png", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/simon-cowell-kelly-clarkson-bbmas-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?5483f7d85ab28d1d2c44"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/simon-cowell-kelly-clarkson-bbmas-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8456871/billboard-music-awards-2018-best-moments", "title": "The 13 Best Moments From the 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-05-21T03:09:37-04:00", "published_time": "2018-05-21T00:14:02-04:00"}, "description": "Whether stars were championing each other, honoring lives we've lost or giving a voice to those who need it most, this year's show was a powerful one from Kelly Clarkson's moving cold open to Salt-N-Pepa's nostalgic (and energetic) finish.", "og": {"description": "Whether stars were championing each other, honoring lives we've lost or giving a voice to those who need it most, this year's show was a powerful one from Kelly Clarkson's moving cold open to Salt-N-Pepa's nostalgic (and energetic) finish.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/simon-cowell-kelly-clarkson-bbmas-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch the 13 Best Moments | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8456871/billboard-music-awards-2018-best-moments", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "The 13 Best Moments From the 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Whether stars were championing each other, honoring lives we've lost or giving a voice to those who need it most, this year's show was a powerful one from Kelly Clarkson's moving cold open to Salt-N-Pepa's nostalgic (and energetic) finish.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/simon-cowell-kelly-clarkson-bbmas-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "The 13 Best Moments From the 2018 Billboard Music Awards", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526876042.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
