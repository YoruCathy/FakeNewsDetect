They kind of struggled with criticism a lot because back then it was sort of a new concept, diversity.\"\n\n\"But me, just growing up in America, being born and raised in California, it was a little harder for me -- just trying to understand who I was and where I fit in,\" she added.\n\nKim said that when she was 8 she moved to Switzerland and \"was the only Asian girl at the school.\"\n\nWhile at school, \"Everyone was like, 'Where are you from like ... What are you?'\" she said. \"I would be like, 'I'm a Cali girl, I'm from L.A.' I got bullied a lot, especially for my eyes.\"\n\n\"The funny thing is, in Switzerland, once I told them I lived in L.A., I was, like, popular,\" she quipped. \"They were like, 'She lives in Los Angeles, that's where Paris Hilton lives.'\"\n\nWinning Olympic gold felt like 'part of my destiny'\n\nGold medalist in snowboard ladies' halfpipe, Chloe Kim of the U.S., poses for a portrait, Feb. 13, 2018, in Gangneung, South Korea.

I felt so calm.\"\n\nThe teen described the feeling she had before competing as \"at peace\" or \"the same feelings I get when I'm in like a fuzzy poncho, like ready to watch some T.V. and possibly fall asleep.\"\n\nWhile the noise and excitement at the Olympic Village was \"hectic,\" Kim said was most comfortable on the halfpipe.\n\n\"I was like, 'I'm here, I know how to do this, this is something that I'm familiar with,'\" she said.\n\nChloe Kim of the U.S. during the snowboard ladies' halfpipe final on day four of the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at Phoenix Snow Park, Feb. 13, 2018, in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

It's like, how do you know how to say that?\"\n\nIt's important to understand the true impact words can have, Kim said, \"and how ... hurtful it really can be.\"\n\n\"It's so sad,\" she added. \"So many kids have taken their lives, or are hurting themselves because of bullying. And they don't see the joys in life.\"\n\n'Inspired' by her peers\n\nKim said she was \"inspired\" by the activism she witnessed from people her own age this weekend at the \"March for Our Lives\" event in Washington, D.C., and at similar rallies throughout the U.S.\n\n\"My peers started that march ... they all came together and used their voices to make an impact,\" she said. \"I think it's so amazing that our generation is able to do those things.\"", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/chloe-kim-gty-jpo-180328_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/chloe-kim-gty-jpo-180328_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Catherine Thorbecke", "March", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/fresh-off-olympic-glory-chloe-kim-hopes-platform-54057914", "title": "Fresh off Olympic glory, Chloe Kim says she hopes to use her platform to fight bullying", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Chloe Kim, ESPNw", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
