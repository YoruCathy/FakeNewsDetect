So truly from the bottom of my heart I apologize,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThanks for pointing this out to me. In the future I\u2019ll try to be a little less ignorant about it.\u201d\n\nPratt added that he was completely in control of his social media and this was not a stunt encouraged by his publicity team.\n\n\u201cI am doing this because I\u2019m actually really sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cApologies are powerful. I don\u2019t dole them out Willy-Nilly. This is one of those moments where I screwed up and here\u2019s me begging your pardon. I hope you accept my apology.\u201d\n\nThe actor also encouraged Instagram to have an option to add subtitles to videos.\n\nPratt also recently apologized for suggesting that \u201cthe voice of the average, blue-collar American\u201d wasn\u2019t represented in movies and TV shows.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see personal stories that necessarily resonate with me, because they\u2019re not my stories,\u201d Pratt told Men\u2019s Fitness. \u201cI think there\u2019s room for me to tell mine, and probably an audience that would be hungry for them. The voice of the average, blue-collar American isn\u2019t necessarily represented in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chris Pratt and Anna Faris Win Hammiest Couple at Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Premiere\n\nAfter facing some backlash on the comment, Pratt took to Twitter to apologize.\n\n\u201cThat was actually a pretty stupid thing to say. I\u2019ll own that,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of movies about blue collar America.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fchris-pratt1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fchris-pratt1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fchris-pratt1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/chris-pratt-apologizes-sign-language-instagram-video/", "title": "Chris Pratt Apologizes in Sign Language to Hearing-Impaired Fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Movie Celebrities,News", "news_keywords": "Movie Celebrities,News", "description": "Chris Pratt said he didn't intend to offend the more than 38 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss", "og": {"title": "Chris Pratt Apologizes in Sign Language to Hearing-Impaired Fans", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/chris-pratt-apologizes-sign-language-instagram-video/", "description": "Chris Pratt&nbsp;realized he may have offended people who are hard of hearing in a recent Instagram post \u2014 and found a moving way to say&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fchris-pratt1.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 785}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/chris-pratt-apologizes-sign-language-instagram-video/", "description": "Chris Pratt said he didn't intend to offend the more than 38 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fchris-pratt1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/chris-pratt-apologizes-sign-language-instagram-video/", "title": "Chris Pratt Apologizes in Sign Language to Hearing-Impaired Fans", "description": "Chris Pratt said he didn't intend to offend the more than 38 million Americans who suffer from hearing loss", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1500&h=785&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fchris-pratt1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
