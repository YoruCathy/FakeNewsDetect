The couple just welcomed their second child to the world.\n\nAnd it's a boy!\n\nTeigen made the announcement via Twitter overnight, and what her tweet lacked in details, it made up for in enthusiasm.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\n\"Somebody's herrrrrrre!\" she wrote.\n\nSomebody\u2019s herrrrrrre! \ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) May 17, 2018\n\nThe brief message was followed by baby and baby bottle emoji, and it was immediately retweeted by proud pop Legend.\n\nThe model mom and Grammy-winning musician first revealed they were expecting back in November \u2014 with a little help from baby No.1, their 2-year-old daughter Luna.\n\nChrissy Teigen and John Legend have welcomed their new arrival to the world. Victor Boyko / Getty Images\n\n\"It's John's!\" Teigen hilariously captioned the video reveal.\n\nIn January, the 32-year-old revealed the sex of the new arrival by simply sharing a photo of her well-dressed baby bump from the Grammys red carpet with the words \"mama and her baby boy.\"\n\nEvan Agostini / AP\n\nAfter that, Teigen remained candid about her pregnancy (and even about her \"pregnancy nose\").\n\nAnd thanks to a sit down with TODAY in April, we know that she and Legend aren't the only ones who just welcomed a baby boy.\n\nTeigen explained that Luna has a love of baby dolls, saying, \"She's always changing their little diapers and burping them.\" So to mark Luna's transition into big sisterhood, she has a new addition of her own.\n\n\"The day we have baby boy, she's going to receive her own little baby boy (doll) to take care of at the same time,\" Teigen told us.", "images":
