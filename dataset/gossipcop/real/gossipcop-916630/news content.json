The RHOA star stopped by E! Daily Pop, and she revealed that she hasn\u2019t heard from Kim\u2019s lawyers regarding a supposed lawsuit that she was threatened with.\n\nJust in case you don\u2019t remember what we are referring to, back in October 2017, NeNe called Kim and her daughter Brielle Bierman \u2018racist trash\u2019 after Brielle shot a video inside her house showing a bug crawling on the floor.\n\nIn a following interview, Kim stated that \u2018I\u2019ve hired a legal counsel at this point. I don\u2019t take this lightly. It\u2019s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and had an opinion. This is far beyond just having an opinion.\u2019\n\n[media-credit name=\u201dSource: eonline.com\u201d align=\u201dalignnone\u201d width=\u201d634\u2033] [/media-credit]\n\nNeNe now said that she hadn\u2019t been made aware of any lawsuit so far.\n\n\u2018Listen. Every time Kim opens her mouth at least eighty percent of the time, she says a big fat lie,\u2019 NeNe revealed.\n\n\u2018No lawyer has ever contacted me about a lawsuit dealing with Kim. She\u2019s gone out everywhere saying she has a lawsuit. Well, they need to contact me at some point, don\u2019t you think?\u2019 she continued to say.\n\nWhen the show\u2019s co-host Morgan Stewart asked NeNe is she still has a place in her heart for Kim despite their feud, here\u2019s what she answered:\n\n\u2018This season when I came back to the show, my heart was very open to Kim. I wanted us to have a good time. Every time I was around her, I always complimented her to make her comfortable. She never brought good energy; she was always very mean.\u2019 Well, this seems a pretty loud and clear message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeNe also wanted to make things as transparent as possible and stated that Kim does not want to be friends with her under any circumstance. She also said that even if she doesn\u2019t have bad feelings for her, she wants nothing to do with Kim ever again.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/AlexisStone-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1280_garcelle_beauvais_jamie_foxx_GettyImages-171509406-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nene-leakes-rhoa-season-12-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200415_4151514_Why_Did_Denise_Richards_Stop_Filming_With_Th-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RHOAs-NeNe-Leakes-Slams-Kim-Zolciak-Calling-Her-Racially-Charged-Lawsuit-A-Big-Fat-Lie.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rs_634x1024-150330094756-634-nene-leakes-kim-zolciak.ls_.33015.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/50-Cent-Reportedly-Admits-That-He-Did-Not-Make-8-Million-In-Bitcoin-As-Recent-Media-Reports-Have-Falsely-Stated-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RHOAs-NeNe-Leakes-Slams-Kim-Zolciak-Calling-Her-Racially-Charged-Lawsuit-A-Big-Fat-Lie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexis Stone", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/rhoas-nene-leakes-slams-kim-zolciak-she-calls-her-racially-charged-lawsuit-a-big-fat-lie-120028/", "title": "RHOA\u2019s NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak \u2014 She Calls Her Racially Charged Lawsuit \u2018A Big Fat Lie\u2019", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Alexis Stone", "news_keywords": "brielle biermann, kim zolciak, nene leakes, real housewives, rhoa,", "keywords": "celebrity news, brielle biermann, kim zolciak, nene leakes, real housewives, rhoa,", "description": "NeNe Leakes is not afraid to speak her mind, especially when it comes to Kim Zolciak.
