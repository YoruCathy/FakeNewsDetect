Like a mob of Black Friday shoppers, zombies from the movie \u201cWorld War Z\u201d and a mass of crabs scrambling around on a beach.\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Ingraham also paused frequently to thank her few remaining sponsors, which included a sister product of My Pillow called \u201cMy Hemorrhoids Donut.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'SNL': Alec Baldwin's Trump Returns to Have Lunch With Kanye - 'He's Black Me!' (Video)\n\nOne of the best gags was probably Thompson as Clarke playing up conspiracy theories about voter fraud by declaring: \u201cIf these immigrants walk at a normal pace of 300 miles a day, they could be here in time to vote on election day!\u201d\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Ingraham also provided a few tips for those who are going out to vote in the midterm elections next week, such as never vote on Tuesdays\u201d and \u201cyou already voted.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'SNL' Gives Us a Glimpse at Bill Cosby's Life in Prison So Far (Video)\n\nAnd as for Baldwin, the sketch ended with a jab at \u201cdisgraced former actor Alec Baldwin, seen here molesting a young Boy Ccout.\u201d At which point \u201cSNL\u201d displayed an image of a shirtless Baldwin with Adam Sandler dressed in a Boy Scout costume from an old sketch.\n\nYou can watch the sketch in the video embedded at the top of this post.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/snl-saturday-night-live-weekend-update-michael-che-colin-jost-seth-meyers-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saturday-night-live-brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-snl-awkwafina-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/snl-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-laura-ingraham-midterms-migrant-caravan-fearmongering.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/saturday-night-live-alec-baldwin-donald-trump-kanye-west-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SNL-five-timers-club.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/snl-saturday-night-live-bill-cosby-life-in-prison-kenan-thompson-seth-meyers-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/snl-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-laura-ingraham-midterms-migrant-caravan-fearmongering.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen", "Ross A.
