Another shot shows Savannah using a different tactic to get her point across, as she gives George a big shushing.\n\nDANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt wasn't all sitting in silence, however, as Savannah loosed up her seemingly tight grip for a moment of celebration.\n\nSamir Hussein/WireImage\n\nDaniel LEAL-OLIVAS / AFP\n\nAlso present on the balcony was Queen Elizabeth, William and Kate, Prince Charles, Prince Harry and his new wife, Meghan Markle -- who broke royal protocol by wearing an off-the-shoulder ensemble to the event. Prince Philip and Kate and William's third child, Prince Louis, were not in attendance.\n\nPrince George and Princess Charlotte made quite the impact at Meghan and Harry's royal wedding last month.
