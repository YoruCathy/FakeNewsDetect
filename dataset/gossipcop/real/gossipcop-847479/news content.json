The Shades of Blue actress wore a pastel blue Valentino cape gown with massive Harry Winston diamond hoop earrings and a Judith Leiber Couture clutch, looking classier than ever.\n\nThe Bronx-born actress, singer and dancer had her new beau, former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, in tow wearing a tuxedo by Tom Ford, marking the couple\u2019s first red carpet appearance since going public with their relationship in April.
