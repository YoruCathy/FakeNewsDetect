My heart is filled with such emotion everyday it\u2019s hard to express.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the initial shock to the new \u2018normal\u2019 it\u2019s been the most emotional time in our lives and couldn\u2019t have gotten to where we are without help from many,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI wake up everyday now so grateful to see Bobby getting stronger. I\u2019ll give another update soon but wanted to share that it is never too late and you have to Live to Live!!\u201d\n\nBobby was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in June 2009 and had his thyroid removed, but the cancer returned in 2013 and spread to his lungs.\n\nThe 71-year-old checked into the hospital at the end of July, eight months after Jill revealed to Us that the cancer had spread to his brain.\n\nThe 53-year-old told Us Weekly last week that she was \u201cnumb\u201d as she remained by Bobby\u2019s side in the hospital. She added that her husband of 16 years was \u201cstable\u201d and she was hoping to get him well enough that he could \u201ccome back out to the Hamptons.\u201d\n\nJill also revealed that she\u2019s leaned on an unlikely costar for support during this difficult time.\n\n\u201cRamona [Singer] and I have gotten really close in the last few weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cShe literally came to the hospital room coming back from the gym in sweats with food in hand. She sat and talked with me for two hours. All of that crap that we went through didn\u2019t matter. Nothing mattered.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/zarin-9fa74e1d-fe16-45c8-8ac8-2308b4a521b6.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jillandbobbyzarin-c0511720-4bf7-442d-a916-75b13ec713b8.jpg?crop=1px%2C29px%2C1999px%2C1124px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jillandbobbyzarin-c0511720-4bf7-442d-a916-75b13ec713b8.jpg?crop=1px%2C34px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jillandbobbyzarin-c0511720-4bf7-442d-a916-75b13ec713b8.jpg?crop=1px%2C34px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jill-zarins-husband-bobby-leaves-hospital-amid-cancer-battle-w496203/", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Leaves Hospital Amid Cancer Battle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jill Zarin revealed on Sunday, August 6, that her husband, Bobby, has left the hospital as he battles cancer \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Leaves Hospital Amid Cancer Battle", "description": "Jill Zarin revealed on Sunday, August 6, that her husband, Bobby, has left the hospital as he battles cancer \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jill-zarins-husband-bobby-leaves-hospital-amid-cancer-battle-w496203/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:44:28+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jillandbobbyzarin-c0511720-4bf7-442d-a916-75b13ec713b8.jpg?crop=1px%2C34px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jillandbobbyzarin-c0511720-4bf7-442d-a916-75b13ec713b8.jpg?crop=1px%2C34px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-06T19:43:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:44:28+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jill Zarin revealed on Sunday, August 6, that her husband, Bobby, has left the hospital as he battles cancer \u2014 read more", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Leaves Hospital Amid Cancer Battle", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jillandbobbyzarin-c0511720-4bf7-442d-a916-75b13ec713b8.jpg?crop=1px%2C34px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502048621.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
