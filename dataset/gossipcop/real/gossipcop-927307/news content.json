And not only on #MeToo, but in a court of law.\u201d She\u2019s the only woman among more than 50 others whose case against Cosby has resulted in a conviction. \u201cI feel like my faith in humanity is restored.\u201d Constand and Cosby\u2019s story started more than 15 years ago in Philadelphia. She was 29 years old at the time, and worked for the women\u2019s basketball team at Temple University. Cosby was the university\u2019s most famous alum and a trustee. They met at a basketball game in 2002. Constand grew up in Toronto, Canada. She was a star high school basketball player and had dreams of playing professionally. Over the next two years, the pair had a friendly relationship. In 2004, Constand says Cosby assaulted her at his Pennsylvania mansion after giving her three pills that left her frozen. He claims the sex was consensual. The pills, he later said, were Benadryl. Constand reported the attack to the police a year later, but prosecutors decided not to charge Cosby at the time. She later filed a civil suit and got a settlement of over $3 million. Cosby\u2019s defense team used that to paint her her as a scheming former lover. \u201cAndrea Constand made up these fantastical stories in order to get rich.\u201d A criminal investigation was reopened in 2015. \u201cWe\u2019re here because we want to seek the truth.\u201d At this point, more than 50 women had come forward with similar accusations of sexual misconduct. Many of these cases happened outside the 12-year statute of limitations. So Constand became the lone accuser who brought criminal charges. The jury came to their decision in just two days. \u201cWe don\u2019t think Mr. Cosby is guilty of anything. And the fight is not over.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/us/26cosby-live/26cosby-live-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/us/26cosby-live/26cosby-live-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/us/27cosby-alpha2/27cosby-alpha2-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/us/26cosby-live/26cosby-live-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Graham Bowley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/television/bill-cosby-sexual-assault-allegations-timeline.html", "title": "Bill Cosby Assault Case: A Timeline From Accusation to Sentencing", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-04-25T13:44:53.000Z", "modified": "2019-12-10T16:09:17.248Z", "section": "Arts", "tag": "Temple University", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005099430, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/5c52fe08-44c3-5020-83ca-a5d8bcc150a3", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/e392af8f71d7477d96d862a73acd572a", "description": "Andrea Constand met Mr. Cosby more than 15 years ago, and she would later accuse him of sexual assault.
