The announcement came November 15, 2017 \u2013 the same day as You\u2019re the Worst season 4\u2019s finale\n\nFX co-President of Original programming Nick Grad said in a statement:\n\n\u201cStephen Falk has been an extraordinary creative partner to work with over the past four years, and it is in that spirit that we came to the mutual decision to end You\u2019re the Worst with its fifth season. Stephen\u2019s singular vision for the series has been its guiding force from the start and our decision, while difficult, will allow the series to end on its own terms and in a way most satisfying to its devoted fans. We want to thank Stephen, the cast and the crew for everything they\u2019ve done to make You\u2019re the Worst one of the best comedies on TV.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/youre-the-worst-season-5.jpg?resize=768%2C432", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/youre-the-worst-season-5.jpg?fit=1000%2C668", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/alec-bojalad.jpg?resize=80%2C80&filter=grayscale"], "top_img": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/youre-the-worst-season-5.jpg?fit=1000%2C668", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alec Bojalad", "Chris Longo", "Louisa Mellor", "Daniel Kurland", "Jake Laverde"], "canonical_link": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/youre-the-worst-news/", "title": "You\u2019re the Worst Season 5 Release Date, Trailer, News, and More", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d23226", "description": "FXX has announced that You're the Worst Season 5 will be its one final round of uncomfortable laughter", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "You're the Worst Season 5 Release Date, Trailer, News, and More | Den of Geek", "description": "FXX has announced that You're the Worst Season 5 will be its one final round of uncomfortable laughter", "url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/youre-the-worst-news/", "site_name": "Den of Geek", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/youre-the-worst-season-5.jpg?fit=1000%2C668", "secure_url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/youre-the-worst-season-5.jpg?fit=1000%2C668", "width": 1000, "height": 668}}, "article": {"tag": "FXX", "section": "TV", "published_time": "2019-01-05T01:25:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "FXX has announced that You're the Worst Season 5 will be its one final round of uncomfortable laughter", "title": "You're the Worst Season 5 Release Date, Trailer, News, and More | Den of Geek", "image": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/youre-the-worst-season-5.jpg?fit=1000%2C668"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/favicon.geek_.purple.swirl_-1.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1546651500.0, "source": "https://www.denofgeek.com", "summary": ""}
