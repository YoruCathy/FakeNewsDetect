Her mom came in to support her and there\u2019s a nice champagne toast with just the staff, and, for a few minutes everything looks like it\u2019s going fine.\n\nBut then, an hour before the launch party, there\u2019s a problem already: The catering isn\u2019t there!\n\nSo, Kristin and her very freaked out store manager, Brittainy, gets in touch with the caterer \u2013 Chef Laura. Poor Chef Laura, who I hope is someone that E! hired and isn\u2019t a real person because she will probably never get hired by anyone who saw this show, informs Brittainy that she thought the launch was tomorrow and starts also freaking out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make this happen,\u201d she promises. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I would normally do but I will (expletive) make it happen.\u201d\n\nKristin drops an f bomb.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to roll with the punches,\u201d she says later, much more calmly.\n\nAnother note in defense of Chef Laura: Since Kristin\u2019s staff has been proven to be not really great at what they do sometimes, it is totally possible someone told poor Chef Laura the wrong date.\n\nAlso, Kristin makes a good point: \u201cPeople remember the alcohol, they don\u2019t remember the food.\u201d\n\nWhich, it turns out, is good because social media manager Shannon declares the sushi is from the grocery store. \u201cIt\u2019s ratchet,\u201d she declares.\n\nThe rest of the launch party goes fine and Jay Cutler appears finally in the scene as a very supportive husband. Kristin thanks him in her speech for being a \u201csuper dad\u201d and giving her time to get her store off the ground, a dream she says she\u2019s had for seven years.\n\nThe next day the Uncommon James homegoods line launches online. Kristin reads the newsletter and immediately notices that Shannon messed up the link \u2013 again. \u201cDrop the hammer on some people,\u201d Cutler advises after Kristin\u2019s short rant about Shannon always messing up.\n\nThen, Kristin notices that the shipping price is wrong. \u201cI\u2019m actually losing money on that,\u201d she says, understandably freaking out. Cutler, somehow knowing that one of Kristin\u2019s employees messed up the shipping weights, asks who was in charge of that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d shut down the homegoods until you guys have it figured it out,\u201d he advises. \u201cGo in there and tell them you\u2019re taking it out of people\u2019s paychecks.\u201d\n\nThis, by the way, is not something you can actually do unless you play in the NFL and get fined for something, though his point is good because these people seem really bad at their jobs.\n\nKristin heads into the store and starts crying in the car after Brittainy can\u2019t figure out what went wrong with the shipping. Once she gets to the store Brittainy says she fixed the website and Shannon says she didn\u2019t include the link into the newsletter because she didn\u2019t know the link. This is the actual worst excuse, which pretty understandably sets Kristin off.\n\n\u201cThis is my whole (expletive) world right now and it got (expletive) this morning,\u201d she said.\n\nShannon then continues into a worse explanation of how she got the newsletter link wrong. \u201cI was drunk on tequila and set an alarm at 2 a.m. to post that so it would be right with Central Time and all of the times,\u201d she says, which is worse. Who tells their boss they were super drunk so then had to get up in the middle of the night instead of doing work at a normal hour and sober?\n\nLuckily, the sales end up going pretty well and Kristin ends up smiling by the end of the first day. Cutler advises just suspending someone next time they mess up that badly and offers to fill in as social media editor.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have a store if it wasn\u2019t for Instagram,\u201d Kristin explains, which probably isn\u2019t wrong.\n\nKristin later talks with Shannon and Brittainy about their futures. Brittainy, she says, is a good manager who had too much on her plate but showed excellent skills by fixing her giant mistake this week very quickly. Shannon, on the other hand, asks for more responsibilities which Kristin shuts down pretty quickly.\n\nThey then try to explain how they\u2019re cool despite Kristin always yelling at Shannon and Shannon being pretty inept.\n\nThe episode winds down with Kristin and Cutler riding in a car. Kristin asks Cutler an important question: \u201cWhat are your sunglasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cAwesome,\u201d he replies.\n\n\u201cAre they?\u201d she asks, knowing that they\u2019re not.\n\nThen, they talk about future plans \u2013 which includes her one day getting an apartment closer to the store in Nashville. She says she\u2019ll buy it with her own money after Cutler says he doesn\u2019t like that idea.\n\n\u201cYou have your money,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then all of my money is our money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be,\u201d she replies. \u201cThe girl should have her own stash. No girl should stay in a relationship because the guy is supporting her. I\u2019m with you because I love you not because I need you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d Cutler says.", "images": ["https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-ftw.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zabit.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/c02_kristin_29_46525433-e1502128880418.jpg?w=1000&h=600&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-usat-bar.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/butler.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/usp-nfl_-new-england-patriots-at-miami-dolphins_95970057-e1531144289161.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ftw-icon-section-head.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/c02_kristin_29_46525433-e1502128880418.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lamartrump.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tuatagovailoa.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/warriors.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/libertyno1.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/cutler.jpg?w=100&h=52#038;h=521", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/455101536_72969818-e1530624017887.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/writer.jpg?w=48&h=48&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen-shot-2020-04-18-at-5.44.02-pm.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/cutler.jpg?w=1000&h=521", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/fifa.png?w=34&h=20&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/c02_kristin_29_46525433-e1502128880418.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nina Mandell", "Nick Schwartz", "August"], "canonical_link": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/08/kristin-cavallari-tells-jay-cutler-im-with-you-because-i-love-you-not-because-i-need-you", "title": "Kristin Cavallari tells Jay Cutler: 'I'm with you because I love you not because I need you.'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The season finale of the show aired on Sunday.", "keywords": "nfl, jay cutler, kristin cavallari, very cavallari", "fb": {"app_id": 451360081611296, "admins": 1651440013}, "google-site-verification": "no3A69hVM5ut63_reMWqC5VegUmDtCMsgeO4Wh_iBY8", "msvalidate.01": "6C7AFE373C691E833D6444FFA7F6E8A2", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kristin Cavallari tells Jay Cutler: 'I'm with you because I love you not because I need you.'", "url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/08/kristin-cavallari-tells-jay-cutler-im-with-you-because-i-love-you-not-because-i-need-you", "description": "A very dramatic season finale.", "site_name": "For The Win", "image": {"identifier": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/c02_kristin_29_46525433-e1502128880418.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-27T14:02:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-31T04:56:00+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/usatodayftw", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ninamandell1"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@ForTheWin", "site": "@forthewin", "text": {"title": "Kristin Cavallari tells Jay Cutler: 'I'm with you because I love you not because I need you.'"}, "image": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/c02_kristin_29_46525433-e1502128880418.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "gdpr": "false", "sop-property": "581b62d42a2cc300124a6a6e", "application-name": "For The Win", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "What fans are talking about.", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://ftw.usatoday.com/feed;icon-uri=https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/2ef498b87825ac1e90fb08b478c63932?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535378545.0, "source": "https://ftw.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
