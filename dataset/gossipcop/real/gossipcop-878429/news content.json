News.\n\n\u201cI got a new debit card last month and got an email from an ex this morning, forwarding me an email that his Disneyland Annual Pass payment was declined & to update my card info\u2026I sure know how to pick em,\u201d she wrote in the since-deleted message, according to the outlet.\n\nClaiming he wanted to clarify the situation, Hayes replied with screenshots of their private e-mail correspondence.\n\n\u201cLol is this how it happened or was I was trying to help you poor thing? Let\u2019s evaluate below everyone \ud83d\ude42 (Read the whole thing),\u201d he wrote alongside images of their exchange.\n\nIn the messages, Stanton wrote that she had gotten a new debit card and wouldn\u2019t be paying for the pass moving forward.\n\n\u201cNever expected you to,\u201d Hayes replied. \u201cI simply was just being courteous to the fact that it seems like if you don\u2019t pay the outstanding balance they will probably send you to collections. Up to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBTW\u2026Nice new tits,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOh thanks Robby, You\u2019re just a gem, as usual,\u201d she responded.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

News, Stanton said that she had been \u201csurprised\u201d to receive the e-mail from her ex.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t spoke since the reunion show. I tweeted it before I heard his response email because I did think it was a little funny he was contacting me about his Disneyland pass\u2026but I never said who it was about or even hinted at it being about him or had any intention to,\u201d she continued, adding that she had \u201cfully moved on\u201d and wished \u201cnothing but happiness and peace for him.\u201d\n\nShe seemingly addressed the incident on social media as well, writing, \u201cSome people don\u2019t even deserve your time\u2026 \u201d\n\nThe pair previously got into a heated exchange on social media following the Bachelor in Paradise finale last year, when they both discussed allegations that he cheated.\n\nAfter Hayes fiercely denied that he had been unfaithful, Stanton tweeted the alleged photo proof of Hayes\u2019 infidelity, quoting Taylor Swift in the process: \u201cLook what you made me do,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI have plenty more + videos,\u201d she added. \u201cPlus multiple girls have came out and DM\u2019d me with stories since\u2026etc etc.\u201d\n\nStanton previously opened up to PEOPLE about why she decided to end her relationship with Hayes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the kind of person, when I\u2019m into someone, I put all my effort into that,\u201d she added. \u201cSo we tried it out, and I think we just have different ideas of what a relationship is like. Like, certain things that just come naturally in a relationship, like checking in with that person, answering when I call. There were photos of him with another girl. It became too much for me.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC via Getty\n\nThough the relationship was real both on and off camera, Stanton said that after the show, \u201call he wanted to do is party and not call me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m done with all the Bachelor shows,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m glad I came back this season, but I\u2019m done.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Famanda-stanton-robby-hayes-2-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Famanda-stanton-robby-hayes-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Famanda-stanton-robby-hayes-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Famanda-stanton-robby-hayes-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/robby-hayes-amanda-stanton-private-messages-disneyland/", "title": "Robby Hayes Shares Ex Amanda Stanton\u2019s Private Messages \u2014 But Twitter Is Not Having It", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Amanda Stanton,Bachelor in Paradise,News,Robby Hayes,TV", "news_keywords": "Amanda Stanton,Bachelor in Paradise,News,Robby Hayes,TV", "description": "Drama quickly broke out after\u00a0Robby Hayes\u00a0shared images from a private conversation with ex\u00a0Amanda Stanton on social media", "og": {"title": "Robby Hayes Shares Ex Amanda Stanton\u2019s Private Messages \u2014 But Twitter Is Not Having It", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/robby-hayes-amanda-stanton-private-messages-disneyland/", "description": "So much for civility between exes!
