His response was:\n\n\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re planning your retirement [laughs] The person that did Vegas better than anybody was Prince. He was like \u201cI\u2019ll just show up when I show up and I\u2019ll play 10 shows a year. It\u2019ll be me because I\u2019m the greatest that ever did it\u201d\n\nPeep the clip here:\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say recent years have seen the likes of Britney, J.Lo, and co change the semantics of the \u201cVegas residency.\u201d But ultimately we\u2019re all entitled to opinions.\n\nDo you agree with Justin?\n\nYour thoughts?", "images":
