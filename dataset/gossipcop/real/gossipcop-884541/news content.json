For those getups, I worked with the editors, makeup artists, costume designers, and seamstresses to execute some pretty ambitious designs.\"\n\nSurprisingly, Martha's personal Halloween costumes have often been thrown together at the last minute: made from simple store-bought materials, her own cosmetics, and kitsch. Her Wonder Woman was such a costume, as was her Marilyn Monroe costume\u2014both in response to attending themed Halloween parties. Her Roy Lichtenstein costume was easily assembled with bold makeup and accessories. Here, Martha emerges from behind her blue satin cloak to shock the little ones as they appear at her doorstop. Blue contacts and a streak of blue dye through her stark white wig add drama and contrast to her fiery red eyes. They make great inspiration for the perfect do-it-yourself costume.\n\nAt the studios of Martha Stewart Living, the idea for Martha's costume is set in motion as early as February. Editors create inspiration boards with several different concepts. These boards consist of images and swatches for hair, make-up, style, and mood. Martha and her editors then work together to refine the costume and the final theme. And this universal theme is often one that appeals to both kids and adults. In this creative process, Martha and her editors have created some iconic looks: the Spellbinding Sorceress with a sky-high bouffant, her magnificent Fairy GrandMartha in a pink tulle gown or the mysterious caped Motha. Of course, punny name helps personalize the ensemble to Martha even more perfectly.\n\nThis year, we pay homage to Martha's many costumes over the years\u2014from fantastical to the terrifying\u2014but all of them extravagant.", "images":
