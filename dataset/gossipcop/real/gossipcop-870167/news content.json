The magical moment was captured by celebrity photographer Michael Segal and his team at Michael Segal Photography.\n\nThe urban chic celebration, put together by Charley King of Blue Bell Events, was infused with copper, gray and blush tones throughout the decor. Guests enjoyed a buffet-style meal from Tres La Catering that included bites such as steak and eggs, Maine lobster rolls, quinoa spinach bites and more. Partygoers also jammed out to tunes from DJ Dom at Red Shoe LA.\n\nImage zoom\n\nFROM PEN: Confetti, Sweets and Dogs: How Julianne Hough Had a Picture Perfect Wedding to Brooks Laich\n\nTouni, a broker and attorney based out of northern California, popped the question to Daniel after a four-mile romantic hike overlooking San Francisco Bay on Christmas Day last year.\n\n\u201cI said yes!
