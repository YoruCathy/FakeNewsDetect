However, it wasn't until New Year's Eve that Underwood, 35, revealed the fall also caused severe cuts to her face.\n\n\u201cThere is also another part of the story that I haven\u2019t been ready to talk about since I have still been living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up,\u201d she wrote in a note to her fan club members. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how a freak random accident can change your life.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cIn addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I\u2019ll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood\u2019s husband] Mike that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in.\u201d\n\nSeven weeks after the accident, Underwood said that she\u2019s on the mend but \u201cnot quite looking the same.\u201d\n\nHowever, several weeks earlier on Dec. 12, Below Deck alum Adrienne Gang posted a photo of herself posing with Underwood at the gym. After fans pointed out it was the first time Underwood had been photographed since her accident, Gang reassured them that she looked \u201camazing\u201d and added that she had \u201cno clue\u201d Underwood was injured.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fcarrie-underwood8-2000.jpg",
