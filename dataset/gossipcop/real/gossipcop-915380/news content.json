The 26-year-old previously released sex tapes with Vivid Entertainment in 2013 and 2014 with porn star James Deen, and since then, she has done adult webcam shows and appearances at strip clubs. She has also endorsed sex toys.\n\n\u201cWe respect Farrah\u2019s decision to pursue other endeavors and we wish her the best,\u201d a Viacom spokesperson tells PEOPLE. \u201cRegarding her suit, the claims are without merit.\u201d\n\nIn the complaint, Abraham, who is mom to 8-year-old daughter Sophia, alleges Viacom \u201cwrongfully terminated her employment because she did not conform to gender stereotypes.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Farrah Abraham Rodrigo Varela/Getty\n\nAccording to Abraham, in October 2017 she was confronted by 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom executive producer Morgan J. Freeman at her Texas home, where she alleges she was \u201charassed, humiliated, discriminated against, disrespected, ridiculed, degraded and sex shamed\u201d for her \u201crecent decision to pursue opportunities in the adult entertainment industry.\u201d\n\nAbraham alleges Freeman and his production crew made threats about \u201cending her career with MTV, sabotaging future deals [she] had in place with MTV, and defaming her.\u201d She claims she \u201cfeared for her life\u201d during the confrontation due to Freeman\u2019s \u201chostile tone, mannerisms, and body language.\u201d\n\nAbraham alleges that shortly after the confrontation, production informed her she was no longer needed for the show.\n\nShe claims the harassment from the producers based on their \u201cgender stereotypes of how women should act and appear, unreasonably interfered\u201d with her work performance and psychological well-being.\n\nThe reality star is suing for emotional pain, emotional suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and other damages. She also alleges gender discrimination and a hostile work environment and says she\u2019s still owed money that was guaranteed in her contract.\n\nLast month, the MTV personality made multiple accusations against the network in a scathing Instagram post alongside a Teen Mom OG clip of her speaking with Morgan, who said she was a \u201cproblem\u201d to work with.\n\n\u201cNever apologize for being an ambitious, confident, and strong minded women,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs I become the best Farrah I can be, I won\u2019t let a man or network be little me, try to break me, lie about who I am to my core, I\u2019m bullied, surrounded & hurt by all the manipulation, I no longer will allow as a protective mother this vulgar behavior, these crews aren\u2019t trust worthy this \u2018MTV family\u2019 is a disgusting gang of power tripping failed producers & executives who have failed.\u201d\n\nIn early November, Abraham claimed she had been fired by Viacom for working as an adult entertainer. She later backtracked, clarifying that Viacom\u2019s legal team had not terminated her contract.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Ffarrah-abraham-3.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Ffarrah-abraham-3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F04%2Ffarrah-abraham-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/teen-mom-farrah-abraham-sues-viacom-5-million/", "title": "Farrah Abraham: Teen Mom Star Sues Viacom for $5 Million", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Farrah Abraham,Lawsuit,News,Teen Mom,Teen Mom OG,TV", "news_keywords": "Farrah Abraham,Lawsuit,News,Teen Mom,Teen Mom OG,TV", "description": "Abraham alleges Viacom \"wrongfully terminated her employment because she did not conform to gender stereotypes\"", "og": {"title": "Teen Mom's Farrah Abraham Sues Viacom for $5 Million, Claims She Was Fired for Working in Porn", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/teen-mom-farrah-abraham-sues-viacom-5-million/", "description": "The battle between Farrah Abraham and&nbsp;Teen Mom isn\u2019t over yet.
