Singing it is, however, encouraged from school onwards.\n\nTens of thousands of college football fans attended the match between the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/1772F/production/_99474069_p05svrk9.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/115B5/production/_98039017_p05hcn24.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/FC5F/production/_99470646_mediaitem99467592.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/F4F5/production/_97990726_p05h22s0.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/208x117/p05t7pvb.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/7511/production/_97996992_p05h3whc.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/39A5/production/_95675741_p050cky4.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/90D7/production/_99497073_p05t2p9s.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=world::us_and_canada::news.world.us_and_canada.media_asset.42616112.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:77374a3e-36af-b041-8edc-42b6a4369f37]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article-media-asset]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/13D41/production/_99471218_p05stxnr.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/51FC/production/_99488902_p05t02k3.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/200/cpsprodpb/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112/did-president-trump-forget-the-words-to-the-national-anthem", "title": "Did President Trump forget the words to the national anthem?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "x-country": "hk", "x-audience": "Asia", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Asia", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 114056484, "og": {"title": "Did Trump forget the words to US anthem?", "type": "website", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112/did-president-trump-forget-the-words-to-the-national-anthem", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
