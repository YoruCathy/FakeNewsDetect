Oprah Winfrey is Goop\u2019s inaugural guest on its podcast, hosted by founder Gwyneth Paltrow, and the hour-plus conversation touches on everything Oprah, from her decades as an inimitable television host to her experiences with Harvey Weinstein and her ultimate hope for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations, or lack thereof.\n\nWinfrey said she was friendly with Weinstein in a professional capacity from the days of her eponymous talk show, but addressed accusations that she must have known of his allegedly long history of sexually predatory behavior toward female actors and other women, saying she simply had no idea and wasn\u2019t really in that world of entertainment. But she did know that everyone dreaded getting a call from him.\n\n\u201cI was in Chicago, in my own little world, but what I knew about Harvey was that Harvey was a bully and that if Harvey\u2019s on the phone, you didn\u2019t want to take the call because you\u2019re going to get bullied in some way,\u201d Winfrey said.\n\nWhile for her a call from Weinstein generally meant being pressured, in a way left undefined, to have certain people on her show, now Winfrey is left wondering why she even let herself be bullied at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat I do question for myself is why I was willing to put up with a bullying thing?\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cI was willing to put up with, \u2018OK I\u2019ll take the call,\u2019 \u2018OK I\u2019ll do that\u2019\u2026why am I willing to put up with an a\u2013hole? Why we won\u2019t tolerate other things, but you can throw phones and call people jerks or whatever and do all this nasty stuff.\u201d\n\nAs for why Weinstein\u2019s alleged behavior was a watershed for the long-normalized harassment and sexual abuse of women, despite many previous public allegations against not only Weinstein but other high-profile men, Winfrey thinks it\u2019s something akin to critical mass.\n\n\u201cIt had been coming, it had been coming,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cIt had been coming with [Bill] Cosby and nothing happened, it had been coming with Bill O\u2019Reilly, even with the President of the United States, where people can hear the Access Hollywood tape and yet, nothing happens. It had been coming and [Weinstein] was the moment was where it all crystallized.\u2026In order for a phenomenon to be a phenomenon everything has to line up. It means the culture, the zeitgeist, for a particular moment in time to be ready, available and open to hear that message.\u201d\n\nThe idea that these issues and women\u2019s experiences with abuse and harassment have been building up in the culture for so long, with most women throughout history being unable to speak up because it would likely have meant further harm to them and their families, was what Winfrey was trying to get across in her acceptance speech at this year\u2019s Golden Globes \u2014 not a political platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to run for any office,\u201d Winfrey said of the speech. \u201cI wanted to be able to say to the #MeToo movement, I\u2019m proud of where we are and what we\u2019re doing, but you need to know you didn\u2019t get here alone. There are those who endured, suffered and didn\u2019t speak because they couldn\u2019t speak.\u201d\n\nWinfrey slipped back into her role of interviewer and asked Paltrow if her decision to go public last fall with her own Weinstein story \u2014 wherein the producer got her as a relatively unestablished young actor to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting and proceeded to unabashedly proposition her and then berate her for confiding in family and friends about the episode \u2014 was triggered by the then few other stories that had come out about him.\n\n\u201cVery, and it\u2019s been months of me trying to process through it all,\u201d Paltrow, who worked with Weinstein several times after the incident, said. \u201cIt only happened one time and I confronted him and he never tried anything like that again, but he was [always] a bully about work things, he was shaming, he was really hard on me and then was incredibly generous and would send me a private plane somewhere. It was a kind of typical abusive relationship and I hadn\u2019t processed it, because so much of my acting career and so many of the incredible highs and lows, as well, were associated with him and Miramax.\u201d\n\nPaltrow added that the experience of going public has \u201cbrought up a lot of stuff lately\u201d including abuse from her childhood, a topic that Winfrey spoke of her own experiences with during the podcast, and said she\u2019s recently begun to question whether her decision to mostly leave acting when she had her first child was actually related to her experiences with Weinstein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always told myself the story that I\u2019d lost the passion for it and then I had my daughter and I wanted to be home and now I\u2019m starting to put the pieces together and thinking did this predominate relationship in my professional life lead me to not want to do it anymore?\u201d\n\nWinfrey said that so many negative experiences with Weinstein \u201ccertainly had an influence\u201d but also admitted that her hope for the #MeToo movement goes beyond women\u2019s rights, and that it continues to facilitate what she and Paltrow agreed has become \u201ca culture of enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that it leads to a better way of all human beings treating each other and that this moment in the movement is leading to us toward saying, \u2018Not only am I not going to take your sexual harassment, I\u2019m not going to take any of your bulls\u2013t.\u2019 Period. I think we\u2019re on our way but we\u2019re still figuring it out.\u201d", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/b9/f5/1c9278c94a439e28f5150c679d6f/logo-full-black.svg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b4cbff4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/269x269+105+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F19%2Fb1%2F73bcdbba10cc9f3374e70e0adae1%2Fimg-58b0e357-turbine-la-bio-kali-hays-wwd-20170224", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8f15b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Ffe%2F3c73c88caef1679e978ddef7339c%2Fla-1520535701-iityehg66x-snap-image", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89be78b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/840x473!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Ffe%2F3c73c88caef1679e978ddef7339c%2Fla-1520535701-iityehg66x-snap-image", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8f15b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Ffe%2F3c73c88caef1679e978ddef7339c%2Fla-1520535701-iityehg66x-snap-image", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-wwd-goop-podcast-20180308-story.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Oprah talk Weinstein, #MeToo\u2019s future in first Goop podcast", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Oprah talk Weinstein, #MeToo\u2019s future in first Goop podcast", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/fashion/la-ig-wwd-goop-podcast-20180308-story.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8f15b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Ffe%2F3c73c88caef1679e978ddef7339c%2Fla-1520535701-iityehg66x-snap-image", "url": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8f15b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2Ffe%2F3c73c88caef1679e978ddef7339c%2Fla-1520535701-iityehg66x-snap-image", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "Variety's Power of Women, Roaming Arrivals, Los Angeles, America - 09 Oct 2015"}, "description": "Goop is kicking off its weekly podcast in a big way.
