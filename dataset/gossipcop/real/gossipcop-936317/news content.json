We deeply regret that the results violated GQ's rigorous standards of editorial excellence and the laws of nature.\"\n\nThe cover is a hilarious parody of the 2018 Hollywood Issue of GQ's fellow Cond\u00e9 Nast publication, Vanity Fair, in which Reese Witherspoon appeared to have three legs and Oprah Winfrey had an extra hand.", "images": ["https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg", "https://secure-nz.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=nz-stuff&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript"], "top_img": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/104015288/gq-mocks-vanity-fairs-photoshop-fail-with-spoof-cover", "title": "GQ mocks Vanity Fair's photoshop fail with spoof cover", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noarchive", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "fb": {"app_id": 207633159308175, "pages": 21253884267}, "verify-v1": "RazNiYjuvNuEsMeFXxfR9l9cDZIKxcq2VjQZA25CHgM=", "msapplication-config": "/sics-assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "The magazine which, like Vanity Fair, is owned by Conde Nast has issued an 'apology statement': \"Mistakes were made.\"", "source": "Stuff", "og": {"description": "The magazine which, like Vanity Fair, is owned by Conde Nast has issued an 'apology statement': \"Mistakes were made.\"", "title": "GQ mocks Vanity Fair's photoshop fail with spoof cover", "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/104015288/gq-mocks-vanity-fairs-photoshop-fail-with-spoof-cover", "type": "article", "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg", "site_name": "Stuff"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.stuff.co.nz", "summary": ""}
