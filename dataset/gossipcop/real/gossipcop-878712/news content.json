The latest Avengers and Ant-Man and the Wasp will be the last Marvel movies to stream on Netflix. Starting with Captain Marvel, MCU films will instead be viewable on Disney\u2019s upcoming streaming service.\n\nThe news came as part of a story from the New York Times on the still-untitled streaming service.\n\n\u201cStarting with Captain Marvel in March, all of the films that Walt Disney Studios releases in theaters will subsequently flow to the Disney streaming platform instead of to Netflix,\u201d the Times reported.\n\nDisney\u2019s streaming service is expected to launch late next year.\n\nWhy is Marvel doing this? Well, when Netflix streams an MCU movie, Disney, which owns Marvel, only gets a cut of the money, since the company licensed the film rights to a third party. But by taking all its toys back and putting them on its own streaming service exclusively, Disney gets all of the subscription money that fans will pay because it\u2019ll be the only way to stream Avengers 4 or literally any other Disney movie. All the animated classics and new Star Wars movies will also live on Disney\u2019s streaming service, to say nothing of all the new franchises the House of Mouse now owns after having bought Fox.\n\nHowever, Marvel won\u2019t be completely gone from Netflix come 2019. The New York Times reports that Netflix\u2019s Marvel shows, like Daredevil and Luke Cage, will stay on Netflix for the time being, as a spokesman said there are \u201cno current plans\u201d to take them away.\n\nMan \u2026 remember when everybody thought cord-cutting was going to save people a bunch of money? Instead of paying for cable, you could pay $9.99 a month for one streaming service that had everything you wanted on it. Except now you\u2019re gonna have to pay $9.99 a month (or more) for Netflix, Hulu, Disney\u2019s streaming service, CBS All Access, Amazon Prime, HBO Now, Showtime, and, eventually, Apple\u2019s streaming service. That\u2019s just the start.\n\nAnyway, check out Thor: Ragnarok on Netflix now.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/3/2/5578a010-da46-456a-aa79-0a84d4f89494-screen-shot-2020-03-02-at-121937-pm.png?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/ce/cc/3a/de/69a4/4adf/aaf6/069fb7f8fb5f/no-more-marvel-on-netflix.png?w=2000&h=640&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&blend=0e0000&blendAlpha=45&blendMode=normal", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/ce/cc/3a/de/69a4/4adf/aaf6/069fb7f8fb5f/no-more-marvel-on-netflix.png?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/10/30/30d529f0-3aee-4086-b262-c91b0c33c541-3-color-gradient.png?w=1380&h=500&fit=crop&duotone=b30016%2Caf0010&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/4/14/443402a4-e3d2-4a46-a632-137b96f5925a-jayandsilentbobstrikeback-bluntman-lightsaber-700x301.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/4/8/36d75f96-e632-42fe-a641-316fe8e7d421-hex_101_unit_00147r.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/ce/cc/3a/de/69a4/4adf/aaf6/069fb7f8fb5f/no-more-marvel-on-netflix.png?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inverse.com/article/47886-marvel-movies-streaming-netflix-avengers-4", "title": "Netflix Will Stop Streaming Marvel Movies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@inversedotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "Inverse", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/article/47886-marvel-movies-streaming-netflix-avengers-4", "type": "article", "title": "Netflix Will Stop Streaming Marvel Movies", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/ce/cc/3a/de/69a4/4adf/aaf6/069fb7f8fb5f/no-more-marvel-on-netflix.png?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inverse.com", "summary": ""}
