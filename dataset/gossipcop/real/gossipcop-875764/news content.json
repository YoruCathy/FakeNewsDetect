And no one\u2019s been on the receiving end of that criticism more than Taylor Swift. Despite a lengthy catalogue of hits in which she plays scorned exes and lovelorn balladeers, the country singer turned pop superstar has been seen less as a victim than as a purveyor of victimhood, using her prodigious songwriting talents and natural affability to become a megaphone for perceived injustice.\n\nSo what does Taylor Swift do to prove to us she\u2019s aware of this narrative (the one, of course, from which she\u2019d like to be excluded)?\n\nAcid gossip that borrows from better songs \u2013 Taylor Swift: Look What You Made Me Do review Read more\n\nRelease a music video \u2013 for her new single, Look What You Made Me Do \u2013 that\u2019s practically boiling over with meta-commentary and self-referential detail, from an ongoing visual snake motif to a tombstone that literally reads \u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s reputation\u201d. Yes, it\u2019s painfully on-the-nose, but Swift\u2019s brand hasn\u2019t exactly been built on subtlety.\n\nLook What You Made Me Do \u2013 or LWYMMD, as its Twitter hashtag dictates \u2013 is well on its way to smashing streaming records, but the song hasn\u2019t been as well received by critics. Continuing in the tradition of her last album, 1989, which marked Swift\u2019s official evolution into pop music behemoth, it largely abandons that which made her a household name \u2013 singable melodies; sharp, specific lyricism; grand tales of romantic enchantment \u2013 in favor of radio-engineered pop and glib proclamations of vengeance. Near the end of the song, she answers a phone call; someone\u2019s asking to speak with Taylor Swift. \u201cShe can\u2019t come to the phone right now,\u201d Swift 2.0 says. Why? \u201cBecause she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nIn the battle between Swifts, my allegiance is with the deceased version, a shrewd chronicler of young-adult courtship and seasoned, starry-eyed songwriter. So much so that hearing her new single made me nostalgic for the days of Fearless and Red. But the Old Swift be damned; this new one is all about retribution and, as the title of her forthcoming album suggests, reputation.\n\nThe music video for LWYMMD, which premiered during Sunday night\u2019s VMAs, sees Swift double down on her vengeful streak, making theatre of her scandal-laden career in an attempt to communicate a self-awareness that\u2019s mostly eluded her. The video is good fun, if a little bit mad; it\u2019s certainly the most brazen and ambitious pop music video since Beyonc\u00e9 dropped Lemonade in the spring of last year, replete with pyrotechnics and dozens of costume changes. But it doesn\u2019t amount to much more than a succession of disconnected images. And if the images could talk, they might say, \u201cI know what you think of me\u201d, or, perhaps, in the words of Joanne the Scammer: \u201cI\u2019m a messy bitch who lives for drama.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut still, in all those images, Swift left a lot to be decoded. A connoisseur of the tongue-in-cheek (remember the capitalized letters in her lyric booklets that spelled out clues about a song\u2019s subject?), it begins with a zombified T-Swift digging her own grave.\n\nGet it? The Old Swift is dead, dunzo, kaput, resigned to the graveyard of pop culture history. First, we see the aforementioned tombstone, where Swift\u2019s reputation lies, but also a second one, reading \u201cNils Sjoberg\u201d, the pseudonym Swift used as a co-writer on her ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris\u2019s song, This Is What You Came For, a collaboration widely assumed to have contributed to their breakup. Swift\u2019s writing credit was supposed to be kept secret, but when her team revealed that she had, in fact, written the Harris-Rihanna hit, her ex went on a tweetstorm about how Swift was looking for \u201csomeone new to try and bury\u201d. So she buried the fictitious Mr Sjoberg.\n\nIn the next shot, Swift luxuriates in a tub of diamonds, where there sits a single dollar bill, a possible reference to the symbolic dollar she earned in last month\u2019s sexual assault case against the radio DJ who groped her in 2013. Internet conspiracists, too, ran with this as a visual reference to Melania Trump, who could be seen forking diamond necklaces like spaghetti in a Vanity Fair spread last year. But those were the same people insistent that Swift, who kept mum during last year\u2019s presidential campaigns, is a closeted Trump supporter. That the election coincided with Swift\u2019s period of self-imposed exile did little to get her back in the public\u2019s good graces; but diamonds, unlike gilded toilet seats, do not a Trump reference make.\n\nThis next one is a dead giveaway: Swift sits atop a throne as dozens of snakes slither at her feet. One even serves her what we can only assume is piping hot tea, the kind Kim Kardashian dished out when she released audio of Swift, who publicly disputed Kanye West\u2019s lyric about her in Famous, appearing to sign off on those same lyrics in a phone conversation with West. Afterwards, Swift\u2019s reputation as a snake in sheep\u2019s clothing took off; Kardashian helped further that image by tweeting a bunch of snake emojis on international snake day. More than a year later, it seems Swift\u2019s ready to embrace the title: ahead of the single\u2019s release, she dropped cryptic reptilian teaser videos. And now, the snake has shed her skin.\n\nThere\u2019s also an inscription on Swift\u2019s gold throne that reads \u201cEt Tu Brute\u201d, the Latin phrase used in William Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar when Caesar is being assassinated by his friend Brutus. It\u2019s a far cry from the Swift of yesteryear, whose Shakespeare references were more Romeo and Juliet than Julius Caesar. But she\u2019s dead, remember?\n\nIt was at the 2016 Grammys, when 1989 beat Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly for album of the year, that Swift first began to truly test the public\u2019s patience. That was also where she publicly rebuked West\u2019s lyric about her in her acceptance speech.\n\nSo in the next shot, as the chorus begins, Swift rams a shiny gold car into a storefront where paparazzo are lurking. She opens the door, a cheetah in tow, to show off none other than her Grammy award. She proceeds to display and caress it in one of the video\u2019s most bewildering moments.\n\nSwift\u2019s love of cats is well documented. Here, she\u2019s surrounded by stacks of cash and a Girl Squad of masked felines, wielding a baseball bat and a sweater that says \u201cBlind for Love\u201d. In the next scene, the masked marauders can be seen robbing a music streaming company. Swift, if you remember, boycotted Spotify for years due to its dismal compensation of artists. She also wrote an open letter to Apple Music in 2014 arguing on behalf of increased artists compensation and then took to Tumblr, in June 2015, blasting Apple\u2019s decision to give users three-month free trials. And now she\u2019s back to rob them, cat imagery to boot.\n\nSwift first assembled her Girl Squad in the music video for Bad Blood, supposedly a shot at rival Katy Perry. She then spent her 1989 world tour parading her besties around in different cities, throwing parties for her supermodel coterie and bringing them to red carpets. This didn\u2019t work out great for Swift, adding to the perception that she surrounds herself only with similarly alpine, Aryan beauties such as Karlie Kloss, Martha Hunt and Gigi Hadid.\n\nBut she knows you think that, alright? So here\u2019s a factory of fembots united like the sentient hosts of Westworld. Swift stands before them in leather and latex, the ringleader of scorned Girl Squads the world over.\n\nThis next still made waves for its apparent resemblance to a shot from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation video. But the real hidden gem is the backup dancers\u2019 belly shirts, which read \u201cI Heart TS\u201d. Tom Hiddleston, one of Swift\u2019s ex-boyfriends, was caught in a similar shirt when splashing around the beaches of Rhode Island with Swift. All of which seems to suggest that Swift surrounds herself only with those who emblazon their love for her on T-shirts. Or, she\u2019s commenting on the fact that you think she does that.\n\nAs we get closer to the finale, we see Swift standing before a bunch of former Swifts: the lovesick high-schooler from the You Belong With Me music video, the one in a silver flapper dress who was interrupted on the VMA stage by Kanye West, the innocent, bespectacled one wearing pajamas, the one dressed as a white swan from the Shake It Off music video. They claw at her feet, aching to be resurrected. But Swift 2.0, wearing a black shirt that says \u201cRep\u201d, banishes them all and declares the \u201cold Taylor\u201d dead.\n\nThis segues into the video\u2019s utterly cringeworthy dance break which, for all I know, is more Swift meta-commentary on how bad of a dancer everyone thinks she is (an, ahem, reputation corroborated by all the times awards show cameras have panned awkwardly to Swift in the audience during a performance, writhing around like the inflatable tube men at gas stations).\n\nFinally, the Swifts both old and new assemble before an airplane, where the word \u201creputation\u201d appears again. Here, Swift on Swift reaches its thematic apex: Zombie Swift tells You Belong With Me Swift to \u201cstop making that surprised face, it\u2019s so annoying\u201d. White Swan Swift adds: \u201cYou can\u2019t possible be that surprised all the time\u201d. Top-hat Swift tells Cowboy Boots Swift that she\u2019s \u201cso fake\u201d. Cowboy Boots Swift bursts into tears. \u201cThere she goes, playing the victim again,\u201d responds another Swift, wearing spiked leather. Leopard-clad Swift holds up her phone and announces she\u2019s \u201cgetting receipts\u201d \u2013 and that she\u2019ll \u201cedit them\u201d too, a reference to Swift\u2019s belief that Kardashian artfully edited that incriminating audio of her. And finally, 2009 VMAs Swift, holding her Moonman, announces she would \u201cvery much like to be excluded from this narrative\u201d.\n\nAnd with that \u2013 as old Swifts expire and a new one is born \u2013 the narrative lives to see another day.", "images":
