Lucky for us, the couple shared quite a few photos of the intimate, outdoor nuptials!\n\nThe actress shared a photo on her Instagram after the procession. Bissett stunned in a strapless gown and went the flower crown route, with white blooms surrounding her low bun and a sweeping veil. The 46-year-old accessorized the look with chandelier earrings and a dainty silver bracelet.\n\nThe bride and groom's children (Bissett's from her previous marriage to fellow Melrose actor Rob Estes) served as members of the bridal party. Two adorable flower girls donned blush dresses with white floral headbands. Groomsmen opted for a classic black tuxedo. White blooms were also spread in front of the altar. Additional photos were shared on Bissett's Facebook page, where we get an even closer look at her gorgeous gown.\n\n\"Happily Ever After \u2764\ufe0f #love #family #wedding #blessed,\" she captioned.\n\nIf you don't know what the actress has been up to lately, she recently reunited with former Melrose Place co-star Jack Wagner to reprise their roles in the Hallmark Channel romantic comedy Wedding March 2: Resorting to Love. Naturally, starring in a TV-movie about weddings made her very excited for her second trip down the aisle.", "images": ["https://www.brides.com/thmb/nY4A0BDJVkMzjsycCnwmQ25szV4=/3543x5315/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__public__brides-services__production__2017__07__11__5964fa43b2352a05523dc69c_GettyImages-542366258-f28c5baf91de4ec8a268d54434201e80.jpg", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/sKWWK057h6quNoz8N_Sq-v_9kq0=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__public__brides-services__production__2017__07__11__5964fa43b2352a05523dc69c_GettyImages-542366258-f28c5baf91de4ec8a268d54434201e80.jpg", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/nY4A0BDJVkMzjsycCnwmQ25szV4=/3543x5315/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__public__brides-services__production__2017__07__11__5964fa43b2352a05523dc69c_GettyImages-542366258-f28c5baf91de4ec8a268d54434201e80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Santana"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/melrose-place-star-josie-bissett-wedding-photos", "title": "Melrose Place Star Josie Bissett Is Married!
