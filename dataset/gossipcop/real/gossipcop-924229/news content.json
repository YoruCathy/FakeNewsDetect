YES I WAS ATTACKED 2 DAYS AGO, YES THEY USED SOME SORT OF SHARP WEAPON, AND YES IT WENT INTO MY BODY!\u201d Feldman captioned pic of the tiny wound on his body on Thursday, March 29. \u201cTHIS IS WHAT THE SCAR LOOKS LIKE NOW, OBVIOUSLY IF IT WAS A KNIFE I GOT VERY LUCKY & IM BLESSED! IF IT WAS A SYRINGE, I WILL PRAY 4 THE BEST RESULTS! GOD BLESS!! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc#Kids2#COREYSTRUTHISCOMING#PRESERVEINNOCENCE.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the former child star, 46, tweeted pictures from the hospital on Wednesday, March 28, after he was allegedly attacked the night before.\n\n\u201cI WAS ATTACKED 2NITE! A MAN OPENED MY CAR DOOR & STABBED ME W SOMETHING!\u201d Feldman captioned pics of himself in a hospital bed with his fianc\u00e9e, Courtney Anne, close by. \u201cTHANK GOD IT WAS ONLY MYSELF & MY SECURITY IN THE CAR, WHEN 3 MEN APPROACHED! WHILE SECURITY WAS DISTRACTED, W A GUY A CAR PULLED UP & ATTACKED! I\u2019M OK.\u201d\n\nIn a second tweet, the Stand by Me actor wrote that the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the situation: \u201c@LAPD R CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING THE CASE AS AN ATTEMPTED HOMICIDE! I HAVE HAD MOUNTING THREATS ON ALL SM PLATFORMS BY THIS VILE \u2018WOLFPACK\u2019 & THIS IM SURE IS A RESULT OF THOSE NEGATIVE ACTIONS! I HAVE REASON 2 BELIEVE ITS ALL CONNECTED! ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! HOW SICK R THESE PPL?!?\u201d\n\nFeldman may be claiming that the incident had something to do with his attempts to expose the alleged \u201cpedophile ring\u201d in Hollywood that he said he experienced in the \u201880s. He claimed that he and former costar Corey Haim, who died of an accident drug overdose in 2010, were sexually abused by people in the entertainment industry.\n\nFeldman told TMZ that on Wednesday that he knows \u201c100 percent for a fact that there is a conspiracy\u201d against him and it \u201call has to do with the pedophilia claims that I\u2019ve made.\u201d\n\nOfficer Drake Madison from the LAPD confirmed to Us Weekly on Wednesday that an investigation is ongoing.\n\n\u201cAn unknown suspect opened the driver\u2019s side door of the vehicle and proceeded to make a jabbing motion with an unidentified object towards Feldman\u2019s abdomen area,\u201d Madison explained. \u201cThere were no lacerations to Feldman\u2019s abdomen or any other area of his body. There was no stabbing.\u201d", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corey-feldman.jpg?crop=244px%2C39px%2C1541px%2C809px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corey-feldman.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corey-feldman.jpg?crop=244px%2C39px%2C1541px%2C809px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/corey-feldman-shares-smallest-knife-wound-after-alleged-stabbing/", "title": "Corey Feldman Shares \u2018Smallest Knife Wound\u2019 After Alleged Stabbing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Corey Feldman shared a photo of his scar after he was allegedly stabbed earlier this week and dubbed his injury the 'world\u2019s smallest knife wound\u2019 \u2014 pic", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Corey Feldman Has \u2018World\u2019s Smallest Knife Wound\u2019 After Stabbing Report: Pic", "description": "Corey Feldman shared a photo of his scar after he was allegedly stabbed earlier this week and dubbed his injury the 'world\u2019s smallest knife wound\u2019 \u2014 pic", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/corey-feldman-shares-smallest-knife-wound-after-alleged-stabbing/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-30T18:17:53+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corey-feldman.jpg?crop=244px%2C39px%2C1541px%2C809px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corey-feldman.jpg?crop=244px%2C39px%2C1541px%2C809px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-30T18:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-30T18:17:53+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Corey Feldman shared a photo of his scar after he was allegedly stabbed earlier this week and dubbed his injury the 'world\u2019s smallest knife wound\u2019 \u2014 pic", "title": "Corey Feldman Has \u2018World\u2019s Smallest Knife Wound\u2019 After Stabbing Report: Pic", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/corey-feldman.jpg?crop=244px%2C39px%2C1541px%2C809px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522432862.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
