From her perfectly coiffed hairstyle, to her chic clutch and black heels, Kate looked elegant and completely poised ahead of the event:\n\nChris Jackson Getty Images\n\nKate's dress is designed by Roland Mouret, one of Meghan Markle's go-to designers. Sadly, Kate's exact dress is currently sold out online (per @PerthsFashion), but you can still shop similar Roland Mouret designs now:\n\nKate accessorized the dress with a Jimmy Choo Celeste velvet clutch, which looks like the ideal purse for any Holiday Season party. Luckily, you can still shop it in a number of colors, including red, dusty rose, navy, and black:\n\nAlongside Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, and Prince William, Kate Middleton is attending the annual Festival of Remembrance, which commemorates everyone who has lost their lives in combat. This year's event also celebrates 100 years since the end of the First World War. Queen Elizabeth, Prince Charles, and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, are also in attendance at the important event, and will be stepping out tomorrow for two memorial services.\n\nChris Jackson Getty Images\n\nChris Jackson Getty Images\n\nBAZAAR\n\nFor more royals and can't-miss fashion and beauty news, sign up for the Harper's BAZAAR Newsletter.\n\nSUBSCRIBE", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-attends-the-royal-british-news-photo-1059994102-1541879386.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0511xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/32/1024x512/1471207031-landscape-1470768328-gettyimages-579863702.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-attends-the-royal-british-news-photo-1059994102-1541879386.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0511xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a24941383/kate-middleton-roland-mouret-black-dress-festival-of-remembrance/", "title": "Kate Middleton Attends Festival of Remembrance Wearing a Roland Mouret Dress", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Kate Middleton Wears a Black Roland Mouret Dress with an Unusual Neckline", "description": "And her Jimmy Choo clutch is perfection.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a24941383/kate-middleton-roland-mouret-black-dress-festival-of-remembrance/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-attends-the-royal-british-news-photo-1059994102-1541879386.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0511xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2020-01-21 03:41:21", "published_time": "2018-11-10 08:16:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-attends-the-royal-british-news-photo-1059994102-1541879386.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0511xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Kate Middleton Attends Festival of Remembrance Wearing a Roland Mouret Dress", "description": "Kate Middleton\ufeff and Prince William\ufeff have just stepped out together to attend the Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
