Now, as he wraps up his long-simmering creative statement, the boy band outlier aims to prove that he has been his own man all along.\n\nZayn Malik is standing in a dimly lit studio, spliff hanging from his lips and whiskey tumbler in hand.\n\n\u201cMy fans are giving me shit every day,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, \u2018Where the f--- is your music? You\u2019ve been at it for months. Give us something.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s around 9 p.m. the Monday after Thanksgiving, and the 22-year-old is indeed about to give up something, though not to his adoring public -- they\u2019ll have to wait for a solo album due early this spring on RCA. The four others here at Los Angeles\u2019 Record Plant are part of Malik\u2019s team, and even they seem surprised at how little the slinky, propulsive music he plays has to do with anything recorded by One Direction, the band he abruptly left eight months ago, setting off a convulsion of online lament including accusations of treason and upsetting hashtags like #CuttingForZayn. In fact, the beat of shadowy, au courant R&B track \u201cShe\u201d drives so hard that Malik, grooving intensely, sloshes liquor onto his arm. He quickly grabs a tissue and self-consciously dabs his wrist.\n\nSee Zayn Malik's Sexy, Brooding Billboard Cover Shoot\n\nIf Malik\u2019s goal in leaving One Direction was to escape the kind of superfame attainable only by boy bands with obsessed, social media-armed admirers, he has failed. From the moment he quit -- Wednesday, March 25, 2015 at 6:30 a.m. ET -- the singer pegged as the group\u2019s quiet and mysterious one saw his every move dissected across countless platforms. The most retweeted message of 2015? Bandmate Harry Styles wishing him \u201clove\u201d when Malik announced his exit. The second? Malik calling the first 1D song without him \u201csick\u201d (in a good way).\n\nTo devotees of 1D -- which by March had sold 6.5 million albums in the United States (according to Nielsen Music), amassed 224 million YouTube views and, on its 2014 tour, grossed $290 million (according to Billboard Boxscore) -- the only thing more fascinating than the boys are their relationships to one another. (A small library\u2019s worth of soft- and hardcore fan fiction attests to that.) It\u2019s a bond that Malik himself can\u2019t break, although he gently distances himself from his former colleagues -- and less gently, their music. \u201cI genuinely enjoyed [the band] and did whatever I could to be myself within that, but it\u2019s just not where I sit as a musician,\u201d he says. \u201cThe other boys\u2019 taste was generally indie rock. It\u2019s good music, but I don\u2019t f--- with it. That was never cool where I was from.\u201d\n\nIn 1D, Malik was known as the \u201cBradford Bad Boy\u201d for his working-class hometown. And indeed, there\u2019s little outwardly posh or precious about him. You can hear the North of England in his speech, where \u201cother boys\u201d becomes \u201cuvah boyce.\u201d His hair juts off of his head at a near-perfect 45 degrees, but since going solo he has shaved it once and changed the color five times (it\u2019s gray today). Tattoos pour from his snug black tee, which, like his tight blue jeans and matte black boots, bears no logos. No amount of ink, hair dye or facial scruff -- today, he\u2019s what you might call inadvertently bearded -- can obscure the glow of his innate gorgeousness.\n\nZayn Malik's One Direction: A Look Back at the Singer's Road to Going Solo\n\nIn other words, Malik looks every bit the hipster heartthrob. And judging from his music, he\u2019s poised to impress the dominant music geeks of the day, who care less about guitar-slingers than artful practitioners of beats and atmosphere, like Drake and The Weeknd. Finely wrought details stand out: the sour synth of \u201cBeFour,\u201d a sweep of strings in \u201cIt\u2019s You,\u201d the whip-crack snare of \u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t feel like choreographed pop,\" says RCA chairman/CEO Peter Edge. \"It's widely rumored that Harry is working on a record and that's probably the other one there'll be some anticipation for,\" he adds (noting that he doesn\u2019t know what Styles, who is on a different label than Malik, might be planning). \"When Zayn was in the band, he had all these songs he was writing, and plans to do his own music. It just feels like maybe he's further along than the others.\" Malik\u2019s voice gives each song its center. It\u2019s a pleasantly rough thing, intimate and warm, but capable of striking falsettos. His bandmate Liam Payne \u201cwould always give me credit in terms of vocal ability,\u201d says Malik modestly.\n\nZayn Malik Manager Sarah Stennett Wants to 'Make Sure Nobody Gets in the Way of Him Becoming an Important Artist'\n\nThose pipes fit the man, who combines an easy-going sincerity with flashes of ambition. As his manager Sarah Stennett puts it, he\u2019s \u201cincredibly sensitive, but also very alpha.\u201d Private but not shy, Malik is more or less the \u201cnormal 22-year-old\u201d he said he wanted to be in his farewell from the band -- frank, easily moved to laughter, occasionally impatient, frequently stoned -- but more of a striver than a dreamer.\n\nHe has gone to unusual lengths in pursuit of his muse, for one. \u201cWe went camping for a week in the Angeles Forest -- set up a generator and a tent so we could track in the woods,\u201d says producer James \u201cMalay\u201d Ho (who has become Malik\u2019s main collaborator, Malay believes, due to his Grammy-winning work on Frank Ocean\u2019s Channel Orange). \u201cIt was the complete opposite of what he\u2019d been doing. We had the gas grill, BB guns, bows and arrows. It was a shittin\u2019-in-the-woods-type thing.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to his debut LP -- and the much-fretted-over hiatus that 1D intends to begin in March -- Malik downplays any rivalry between himself and his old mates. \u201cThere are no sides to pick,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going head-to-head.\u201d\n\nStill, Malik\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll have \u201cfour friends for life,\u201d as he wrote when he quit. \u201cThe truth of it is,\u201d he says carefully, \u201cyou can think one thing about a situation and the total opposite can happen. I had every intention of remaining friends with everybody, but I guess certain phone numbers have changed and I haven\u2019t received calls from a lot of people. I\u2019ve reached out to a few of them and not got a reply. Certain people have pride issues, but it\u2019s stuff you overcome in time.\u201d\n\nIn November 2014, Malik missed a One Direction concert and interview with NBC\u2019s Today in Florida, officially due to a stomach bug. (Matt Lauer prompted an online backlash by mentioning \u201crumors of substance abuse\u201d by Malik, which Malik promptly denied.) Four months later, he cried onstage in Hong Kong. The next day he left the tour due to \u201cstress,\u201d and the following week he was gone for good. Meanwhile, his two-year engagement to Little Mix\u2019s Perrie Edwards also seemed to be splintering. There were photos of Malik holding hands with another woman in Thailand days before the show in China. By August, he had broken that off, too.\n\nAfter all that, Malik knew what he had to do. \u201cI went home,\u201d he says. \u201cI seen my mum, who cooked me some great food. I ate for three weeks because I\u2019d lost so much weight in the band. I seen my sisters and put my dad\u2019s sheepskin on -- I walked around and everyone thought I was him. Nobody bothered me. It was good for my soul to be back in Bradford.\u201d\n\nThe Year in Zayn Malik's Changing Hair\n\nMalik was born in 1993, the second of four children, the rest girls. His birth name, Zain Javadd Malik, means \u201cbeautiful, generous king\u201d in Arabic. His father, Yaser, is British Pakistani, and raised his son on a diet of Usher, R. Kelly, 2Pac, Biggie and classic reggae like Gregory Isaacs. His mother, Trisha Malik (nee Brannan), is Irish-English but adopted her husband\u2019s Muslim faith and worked for a time as a halal chef at a local elementary school.\n\nThe family rented an apartment in the Victorian row houses of Bradford\u2019s East Bowling district. Malik has said he didn\u2019t fit in at his first two schools because of his mixed heritage. Still, he was precocious: He joined choir at 8 or 9 in order to meet girls and discovered he loved to sing. He also took the lead in school plays -- most famously, thanks to YouTube, Danny Zuko in Tong High\u2019s production of Grease.\n\nMalik\u2019s old teachers have told the media he was \u201ca model student,\u201d but he\u2019s not so sure: \u201cI was a different person then,\u201d he says. \u201cI was 17 and like, \u2018F--- the world!\u2019 I thought I was 2Pac and I\u2019m really not.\u201d He laughs, but he almost missed his 2010 tryout for The X Factor, where 1D would take shape, because he wanted to sleep in.\n\nMalik auditioned with Mario\u2019s \u201cLet Me Love You\u201d only to be eliminated during the show\u2019s boot camp stage -- he seemed nervous, initially refusing to do choreography. But X Factor creator/judge Simon Cowell paired him with four other washouts who didn\u2019t much care for dancing either -- Styles, Payne, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson -- creating a sort of \u2019N Sync spliced with pub-band DNA.\n\nZayn Malik Says One Direction's Music Was 'Generic As F***,' Simon Cowell Calls Him 'Rude'\n\nOne Direction finished third, but its obvious talent and puckish chemistry paid dividends. Its 2011 album Up All Night was the first debut by a British band to bow at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The act has made an LP a year since and toured aggressively in between -- in June, Forbes put the group\u2019s annual earnings at $130 million. In 2015, Cowell admitted that the group was \u201c100 percent overworked.\u201d Stennett calls her client\u2019s old job \u201cgrueling\u201d and compares it to being in the army. As Malik himself says, \u201cIt was like a f---ing machine going constantly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t allowed to say certain things, or word [lyrics] the way we would want to,\" says Malik. \u201cI\u2019d sit and wonder, \u2018If the fans knew how it worked, what would they think?\u2019 My argument was: People are more intelligent than that. They want to hear what\u2019s real, so why don\u2019t we write some stuff that we\u2019re actually going through?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about Malik\u2019s fame, even in the context of 1D\u2019s rabid following, is that Malik is Muslim in an increasingly hostile Western culture. He declines to discuss his faith, and it\u2019s easy to understand why. When he tweeted \u201c#FreePalestine\u201d in 2014, he was bombarded with hate and at least one death threat. Web trolls suggest vile conspiracy theories, like the infamous \u201cBoy Band Jihad\u201d essay by extreme right-wing pundit Debbie Schlussel. He even has been broadsided by left-leaning institutions like The Huffington Post (which illustrated a tweet about ISIS and Western culture using his photo) and Bill Maher (who compared him, in a joke, to one of the Boston bombers).\n\nMalik may \u201cfeel a lot for his heritage,\u201d says Fariha Roisin, author of a recent Matter article about Malik\u2019s bicultural status. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t defined by his otherness and hasn\u2019t whitewashed himself, either. Islamophobia affects the way we view ourselves -- there\u2019s a fear of being open about who you are. He has experienced persecution whenever he has said anything political, so what do you do in that situation? You remove yourself.\u201d After four years of being the person of color in 1D -- where, he has acknowledged, the dark and mysterious role was partly foisted upon him -- Malik seems content to do as he pleases and let people make of that what they will. If he has a life strategy these days, he says, it\u2019s \u201cjust trust your instincts, and keep your friends close.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, Malik moved to Los Angeles, where \u201cthere\u2019s not a lot of negative energy going around.\u201d Before he did anything else with his Bel Air \u201cbungalow,\u201d he began recording in the unfurnished rooms -- \u201cwith the sliding-glass doors open and the microphone in the backyard, underneath the stars,\u201d recalls Malay. And then he started decorating. \u201cI like to graffiti my house,\u201d says Malik. \u201cThe garden goes up three stories into the mountain. There are these walls that look white from one side, but when you walk up the stairs, the inside is all graffiti. I painted \u2018Fresh Prince\u2019 on one.\u201d\n\nAt home, he likes to cook the way his mother taught him. \u201cI have about six of her signature dishes down, and I\u2019ll pull them out for the ladies when I need to.\u201d Malik has been spotted with model Gigi Hadid, and while he maintained in November that they\u2019re \u201cjust good friends,\u201d by late December they had posted a selfie of themselves snuggling. He knows what he\u2019s looking for in a relationship: \u201cI need a challenge. Also, I like girls that are a bit chunky in certain areas -- the nice areas. I like a fuller woman. I enjoy an intellectual conversation as well, where someone can construct a sentence beyond what hair and makeup they\u2019re wearing, and talk about something political or about the world. I like an opinion.\u201d\n\nFor all the female attention he absorbs and brooding sensitivity he projects, Malik remains, in many ways, an average bro. At one point, I say, \u201cI\u2019m sure your fans tell you stories. Have you learned anything from the girls who admire you about the challenges they face particular to women?\u201d Not really, it turns out. From his vantage, the mechanics of fame are simple: \u201cI was raised by a lot of women, so there\u2019s nothing any fan girl could\u2019ve ever taught me about any woman,\u201d he says. \u201cI fully understood every person who\u2019d come and see the band, because I have crazy aunties and crazy sisters who would fan-girl over actors. If people can\u2019t have something, they want it.\u201d\n\nStill, Malik has a new gratitude for his fans, and more patience when it comes to stuff like posing for photos. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit different now because they\u2019re there for just me,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t jump in a car and be like, \u2018Yeah! Just take a picture with one of them boys.\u2019 I want to do it now.\u201d\n\nIn general, Malik is thankful for the newfound control over his life. He might eventually install \u201can obstacle course or skate park\u201d at his house (he once fell off a ramp skateboarding with Justin Bieber and broke his ankle). But for now, \u201cI base the day around whatever I\u2019m feeling at that point,\u201d he says. Back at his English country home, \u201cI might write. I might paint. I might have a barbecue. I might chill in the tepee.\u201d A good day in Los Angeles starts with guerrilla home decor -- \u201cI\u2019m doing a collage wall with Polaroids, drawings, paintings and all kinds of crazy stuff\u201d -- and includes some casual dining (he names Fat Sal\u2019s, the Hollywood deli co-owned by Jerry Ferrara, Entourage\u2019s Turtle) and ends up in the smoky room where he now sits, lit by red string lights and glowing monitors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come down here and record maybe seven songs a night,\u201d he says from the far side of a mixing board, eyes getting more slit-like as the night progresses. \u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m enjoying what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not censoring myself anymore, so I\u2019m not tired. I love it.\u201d When he gets frustrated or angry, he hits the studio instead of a punching bag or doing \u201csome bullshit where I\u2019m drunk, tagging \u2018F--- this life\u2019 on a wall\u201d (as he did at home in England). He even smokes pot with a degree of ambition -- Malik only burns sativa (the more energizing, cerebral strain of marijuana), because it\u2019s \u201ccreative weed.\u201d\n\nZayn Malik Isn't Trying to Top One Direction With New Music: 'I Don't Need You to Buy It on a Mass Scale'\n\nWhen it comes to Made in the A.M., the fifth and perhaps final 1D album, recorded without him and released about two weeks before our talk, Malik admits he hasn\u2019t even heard it. \u201cNah,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I thought the first single was quite cool. I heard the second single and\u201d -- he screws up his face -- \u201cyeah, I didn\u2019t buy the album.\u201d\n\nAsked what he accomplished as a member of the group, and he offers an inscrutable, possibly ironic answer: \u201cStatus. The capability to restrain certain things I would want to do. I also learned it\u2019s good to keep friends. Because you don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to make new ones, so you should probably just keep the old ones.\u201d\n\nMalik is much clearer on what he has discovered about himself since going solo: \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disciplined. I realized I can push myself through situations I might not necessarily want to do, but can overcome by being in the moment. No matter what, I can smile and do whatever I got to do.\u201d And then he does smile, flashing a small, not entirely un-boy-band-like grin.\n\nThis is an updated version of the cover story that originally appeared in the Jan. 16 issue of Billboard.", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/zayn-malik-bb1-2016-billboard-01-650-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/zayn-malik-cover-bb1-2016-billboard-1500.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?5483f7d85ab28d1d2c44"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/zayn-malik-bb1-2016-billboard-01-650-compressed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Martins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/cover-story/6835305/zayn-malik-solo-career-one-direction-new-music", "title": "Zayn Malik Speaks Out in Revealing Billboard Cover Story: 'I'm Not Censoring Myself Anymore'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2016-01-27T18:53:44-05:00", "published_time": "2016-01-07T09:06:00-05:00"}, "description": "In 2015, Zayn Malik abruptly quit One Direction, broke off a fairy-tale pop-star engagement and overdid the hair dye.
