I\u2019d be so grateful to anyone who can support my effort by donating to charity: water through my birthday campaign.\n\n\n\nFor most of us, it\u2019s hard to imagine being thirsty and not being able to just grab a glass of water. But 1 in 10 people around the world don\u2019t have that luxury. In many developing countries, women and girls have to walk hours every day just to collect water for their families. And every day about 1,400 children die from diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. We can help change this!!!\n\nI fell in love with charity: water and am deeply impressed with the organization and the work they do. I made a donation to fund 25 wells in Ethiopia that will bring clean water to 5,000 people, and I can't wait to see how many more lives we can change together. 100% of the money will be used to build clean water projects for these communities.\n\nEven donating $22 to celebrate me turning 22 would be so great! Every amount helps. Thank you all so much!\n\nKendall", "images": ["https://d26p6gt0m19hor.cloudfront.net/packs/media/images/icons/_campaign-icon-ff5996985dc67c90cac76e4a303cab7e.svg", "https://d26p6gt0m19hor.cloudfront.net/packs/media/images/campaigns/whats-next-ff1bc124373cbf7947093ad76fc30c88.jpg", "https://maji-production-store.imgix.net/73ff1ec8f3da2861a2267590877a0e718c0dc58d62e8f7e295e908b156eb?ixlib=rails-2.1.4&rect=0%2C0%2C2560%2C894&w=1368&h=474&fit=fill&auto=format&fm=pjpg", "https://maji-production-store.imgix.net/6a84cd6663bea64b3c3f0115ebddaf9a0e8086b21d0475f5719ca782957e?ixlib=rails-2.1.4&fit=crop&dpr=2.0&h=120&w=120&auto=format&fm=pjpg", "https://d26p6gt0m19hor.cloudfront.net/packs/media/images/icons/100-percent-22ffb5cd7daae6a965f3c747974841bf.png"], "top_img": "https://maji-production-store.imgix.net/73ff1ec8f3da2861a2267590877a0e718c0dc58d62e8f7e295e908b156eb?ixlib=rails-2.1.4&rect=0%2C0%2C2560%2C894&w=1368&h=474&fit=fill&auto=format&fm=pjpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.charitywater.org/kendall/22nd", "title": "Kendall's 22nd Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "heroku": {"slug": {"commit": "873471f1a4e22a8ac1a082f372fd89fe37117706"}}, "description": "charity: water is a non-profit organization bringing clean, safe drinking water to people in developing countries. 100% of public donations go to water projects.", "keywords": "water wells, charity water, charity, give, water, water for africa, africa, india, south america, clean water, safe water, access to clean water, digging wells, clean water for africa, safe drinking water, drinking water for poor", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@charitywater", "creator": "@charitywater", "title": "Kendall's 22nd Birthday", "description": "Hey guys!
