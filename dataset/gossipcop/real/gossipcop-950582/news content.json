He was taken to a hospital in Olbia, but his injuries were not serious and he was discharged.\n\n\u201cGeorge was treated and released from an Olbia hospital,\" his representative Stan Rosenfield told USA TODAY. \"He is recovering at home and will be fine.\u201d\n\nSurveillance video of the crash was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera. It shows a blue Mercedes veering into oncoming traffic, apparently to turn into a residential compound near Olbia.\n\nThe video shows what is reported to be Clooney's scooter crashing into the car while another scooter alongside him manages to veer around it. A figure appearing to be Clooney is thrown over the front of his bike and up in the air before landing on the asphalt, where the car driver and other witnesses come to help.\n\nClooney is in Italy filming a \"Catch-22\" miniseries that will run on Hulu, based on Joseph Heller's 1961 novel that was also made into a 1970 film.\n\nClooney will portray Col. Cathcart (played by Martin Balsam in the film), marking Clooney's first TV role since he left NBC's ER in 1999. He will also direct the series with production partner Grant Heslov.\n\nMore:George Clooney to return to TV in 'Catch-22' miniseries\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b96599b2de0143fb6b45488807609fe8b4a2bec7/c=0-109-1992-2765/local/-/media/2017/11/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636464581497270852-GTY-865187832-94785389.JPG?width=300&height=401&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/913c5edccb3859afb7a9c4900db9d4fa9a330b1f/c=0-60-1999-1189/local/-/media/2018/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636668529206890775-AP-Italy-Clooney-Hurt-101367337.JPG?width=1999&height=1129&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/913c5edccb3859afb7a9c4900db9d4fa9a330b1f/c=0-60-1999-1189/local/-/media/2018/07/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636668529206890775-AP-Italy-Clooney-Hurt-101367337.JPG?width=1999&height=1129&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/07/10/george-clooney-hospitalized-after-scooter-accident-italy/770548002/", "title": "Video emerges of George Clooney scooter accident in Italy; actor released from hospital", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Video emerges of George Clooney scooter accident in Italy; actor released from hospital", "description": "George Clooney was taken to a hospital in Italy after his scooter collided with a car.
