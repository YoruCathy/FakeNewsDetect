It got a lot of attention. Sara called me and said, 'Would you want to do a reunion show and I said, 'Yeah, definitely.' I said, 'What about John?' She goes, 'Oh, John's in.' I said, 'Well of course then I'm in.'\"\n\nBarr added, \"Everybody was in and so then it went from a special to a series and we had a deal in three weeks.\"\n\nThe cast of \"Roseanne.\" ABC via Getty Images\n\nGilbert said she did not think that a revival of the cult classic would ever happen.\n\n\"For some reason I thought I read something years ago that Roseanne said she didn't want to touch the original so I had assumed for all these years there was no way to do it,\" Gilbert said. \"When John did the [talk] show and he said he would do it in a heartbeat, it just made me reconsider. I just sort of had to go down the line and tell everybody maybe what they wanted to hear.\"\n\nThe original ABC TV series ran from 1988 to 1997. In the final episode, Roseanne reveals that Dan had died.\n\nSara Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and Roseanne Barr appear in a scene from \"Roseanne.\" Adam Rose/ABC via Getty Images\n\n\"I can't say [what happened] but somehow he's still alive,\" Goodman joked. \"I wanted to go for the whole zombie thing. That's an idea for the writer.\"\n\nNot only does Dan make a return, but both Goranson and Chalke, who played Becky Conner, will appear on the show at once.\n\n\"It was pretty fun working together I got to say,\" Goranson said. \"Our energy together was very girly and it was just kind of funny to see the traits that we have in common and our differences and all that stuff. I think the fans will have a good time with it, I'm hoping.\"\n\nIn the reboot, Goodman said the Conners will face tougher issues such as the presidential election.\n\nRoseanne Barr, left, and John Goodman appear in a scene from the reboot of \"Roseanne.\" Adam Rose/ABC/AP\n\n\"The first episode deals with the election and two different voices, two different opinions on it,\" he explained. \"It's between the sisters. I keep my yap shut. I'm out in the garage drinking.\"\n\nOscar nominee Laurie Metcalf, who is reprising her role as Aunt Jackie, agreed that stepping back on the set was like a time warp.\n\n\"It's like we were a family for nine straight seasons and worked everyday together and made that bond and then to revisit it after these 20 years have passed, you can't buy that kind of chemistry,\" she said.\n\nMichael Fishman, who plays D.J. and Roseanne Barr, Sept. 15, 1992.
