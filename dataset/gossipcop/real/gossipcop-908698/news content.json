Middleton toured the institute and talked to the doctors about the different challenges in dealing with maternal mental health like postpartum depression, biological factors affecting the mother's mental health and the support available for new moms, E! News reported.\n\n\"She was interested in the fact that we look at the whole range of issues including PTSD and self-harm,\" said Professor Louise Howard, who teaches women's mental health. \"She was interested in understanding the whole breadth of the issues and how to make people more robust.\"\n\nAside from helping women with postpartum depression, the institute is also working on a new treatment to help those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. There was a short lighthearted moment when the professionals talked about using an avatar to aid individuals with schizophrenia deal with hearing loss.\n\n\"As in the movie 'Avatar'?\" Middleton asked. However, the Duchess was told that the avatar is not similar to the ones shown in James Cameron's film in 2009.\n\nMiddleton is an active advocate of mental health. The royal mom-of-two is promoting the same advocacy for mothers. In November, Prince William's wife hosted a roundtable discussion on maternal mental health.\n\nDuring the gathering, Middleton met with experts from Maternal Mental Health Alliance, Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families and Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists. They talked about the different issues surrounding maternal mental health.\n\nIn related news during Middleton's recent engagement, the expectant mom donned a baby blue coat. On Tuesday, she also stepped out wearing a blue dress with matching blue scarf, shoes and jewelry. Many interpreted Middleton's choice of color as a hint that she is having a baby boy.\n\nHowever, it is difficult to tell if the duchess is really making a statement when it comes to the shade of her dresses because she wore pink when she visited Coventry with Prince William last week. But, Middleton is spotted more often wearing blue dresses.\n\nIn related news, the betting for the name of Prince William and Middleton's third royal baby has already started. The leading name is Alice while the runner-up is Albert.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/01/24/kate-middleton.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/trump-has-largely-left-decisions-on-easing-lockdowns.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/the-group-tours-istanbul-neighbourhoods-densely-populated-by.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/04/20/apple-tim-cook-watch.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/wuhan-is-slowly-reopening-after-a-lockdown-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/leader-of-italys-far-right-league-party-matteo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2014/01/21/target-logo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/arinew10.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/02/06/airasias-top-executives-have-stepped-aside-during-an.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/01/24/kate-middleton.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kate-middleton-talks-doctors-about-postpartum-depression-amid-third-pregnancy-2644947", "title": "Kate Middleton Talks To Doctors About Postpartum Depression Amid Third Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "kate middleton news, kate middleton duchess of cambridge, kate middleton prince william royal duties, kate middleton prince william in swededn and norway, royal duties 2018, meghan markle prince harry wedding, meghan markle bridesmaid, meghan markle", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kate-middleton-talks-doctors-about-postpartum-depression-amid-third-pregnancy-2644947", "title": "Kate Middleton Talks To Doctors About Postpartum Depression Amid Third Pregnancy", "description": "Kate Middleton talked to experts about postpartum depression when she visited Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute at King's College London.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/01/24/kate-middleton.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/01/24/kate-middleton.jpg", "height": 2469, "width": 3500, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Catherine Armecin", "modified_time": "2018-01-25T03:07:09-05:00", "published_time": "2018-01-25T03:07:09-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kate Middleton Talks To Doctors About Postpartum Depression Amid Third Pregnancy", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kate-middleton-talks-doctors-about-postpartum-depression-amid-third-pregnancy-2644947", "description": "Kate Middleton talked to experts about postpartum depression when she visited  Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute at King's College London.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/01/24/kate-middleton.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "kate middleton news, kate middleton duchess of cambridge, kate middleton prince william royal duties, kate middleton prince william in swededn and norway, royal duties 2018, meghan markle prince harry wedding, meghan markle bridesmaid, meghan markle", "author": "Catherine Armecin", "description": "Kate Middleton talked to experts about postpartum depression when she visited Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute at King's College London."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516867629.0, "source": "https://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
