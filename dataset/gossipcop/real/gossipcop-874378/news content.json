After Ray Romano attempted to get his son Matt a date on Jimmy Kimmel Live this week, the actor, 59, decided to let Matt\u2019s twin, Greg, in on the action as well.\n\nWhile on the Late Late Show on Thursday, August 17, host James Corden decided to bring out Greg, 24, who is a staffer on the CBS program, and let Ray set his son up \u2014 with a little help from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who was also making an appearance.\n\nCorden selected three women from the audience for Romano and Dreyfus to decide between. \u201cI have a question for all three of you,\u201d Romano says. \u201cAre you ok dating a virgin?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be OK,\u201d Dreyfus says as Romano hugs his son. \u201cDo you have a good therapist?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea, they don\u2019t talk to us so I have no idea.\u201d Romano joked of knowing about his sons\u2019 sex lives, before turning back to the three women. \u201cBut I do know Greg, so this is an important question for all three of you.\u201d\n\nAfter getting mixed reactions to asking the trio to choose between the Yankees and Red Sox, Romano moved on to more pressing matters.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s even more important, Julia stay out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cSeinfeld or Everybody Loves Raymond?\u201d After all three say they prefer Romano\u2019s former sitcom to Dreyfus\u2019, the actress feigned outrage over the choice.\n\n\u201cI have two sons, \u201c Dreyfus joked. \u201cGuess who you\u2019re never dating?\u201d\n\nEventually, Dreyfus picked a winner for Romano\u2019s son and the two headed off on a successful dinner date \u2014 in one of the CBS\u2019 studios conference rooms.\n\nWatch the hilarious moment in the clip above.\n\nThe Late Late Show airs on CBS Weeknights at 12:35 a.m. ET.\n\nFor
