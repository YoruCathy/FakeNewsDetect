Rose named Paltrow in an interview Monday.\n\n\"I definitely think that Gwyneth Paltrow is 'Becky with the good hair,'\" Rose said on Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt's Make Speidi Famous Again podcast. \"I feel like she's the one.\"\n\n\"They were, like, friends, and then, like, you don't see Gwyneth Paltrow with Beyonc\u00e9 anymore. It just seems like she was the one that was [expletive] Jay-Z, and now Gwyneth lost her husband, but, like, Beyonc\u00e9's still with Jay.\"\n\nPaltrow split from her husband, Coldplay singer Chris Martin, in March 2014 after 10 years of marriage. She got engaged to producer Brad Falchuk in January, and told Good Morning America in May she's enjoying wedding planning.", "images":
