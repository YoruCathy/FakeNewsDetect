The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is seeking $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the outlets. Simmons denies the charge as well as the other accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.\n\nPer the lawsuit, the woman says she met Simmons, 60, at a concert she attended with her son. After dropping her son off and spending some time together, the lawsuit says Doe hesitantly joined Simmons in his hotel room where she was raped.\n\nMore:Kimora Lee Simmons addresses sexual-misconduct allegations against ex Russell Simmons\n\nMore:Russell Simmons denies new 'horrific' rape allegations\n\nSimmons \"vehemently\" refuted all allegations in a statement issued to USA TODAY Monday per spokesperson Angela Pruitt.\n\n\"They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,\" the statement says. \"I have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests. I denied forced sex and sexual harassment allegations brought against me in each test; I also answered no to the question, 'Have you ever physically forced any woman to have sexual intercourse?' I passed all of the lie detector tests.\"\n\nSimmons is one of many powerful men accused of sexual misconduct and assault.
