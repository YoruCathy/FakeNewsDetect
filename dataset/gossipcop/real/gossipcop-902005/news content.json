That\u2019s the question Kardashian fans were asking when the reality TV family finally unveiled their annual Christmas card Monday afternoon but a reportedly pregnant Kylie Jenner was noticeably absent.\n\nIn fact, fans were fuming on Twitter and elsewhere that they had fallen for what turned out to be a 25-day-long tease to the card\u2019s release.\n\nEach day, starting Dec. 1, Kim Kardashian and other members of the clan released a photo from the family\u2019s Christmas card photo shoot, showing different group shots, including of Kim and Kanye West with their two kids, North and Saint.\n\nFans had expected that 20-year-old Kylie, reported to be well into her first pregnancy with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, would finally display her baby bump on the Dec. 25 card.\n\nInstead, the card showed nearly all the Kardashian-Jenner women and grandchildren, including Kris Jenner and grandmother Mary Jo \u201cM.J.\u201d Houghton. But there was no Kylie Jenner.\n\nKhloe Kardashian was there, though with no baby bump yet visible, possibly because the photo shoot took place sometime in early November, E! News reported. She already had confirmed her pregnancy on Dec. 20 with a baby bump photo posted to her Instagram account.\n\nKhloe\u2019s long-expected public acknowledgement that, yes, she is having a baby with NBA star Tristan Thompson raised fans\u2019 expectations that Kylie would use the family\u2019s annual card to publicly confirm her pregnancy as well.\n\nBut when Kylie didn\u2019t, fans seemed ready to declare a national state of emergency or a state of something related to the family.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should call the authorities because @KylieJenner is still missing from the damn Kardashian Christmas card,\u201d one fan tweeted.\n\n\u201cI need to see the BELLY,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cI hate that I am so invested in Kylie Jenner\u2019s alleged pregnancy,\u201d another tweeted.\n\nOthers grew more belligerent and hurled expletives:\n\n\u201cLmaoooooo THEY MIND F\u2014KED US ALL MONTH LONG!!!!\u201d one put it bluntly. \u201cWhat is this total f\u2014kery they have done to us!!! C\u2019mon @KylieJenner @KimKardashian we wanted Kylie on the damn 25th day!!!\u201d\n\nBut the young lip kit mogul wasn\u2019t in total hiding on Christmas Day. She and big brother Rob Kardashian, who also was absent from the family holiday card photos, appeared on Khloe\u2019s Snapchat on Monday. Kylie also shared a photo of herself on the cover of Love magazine, though the photo only showed her face.\n\nStill her absence from the Christmas card itself left fans wondering if she\u2019ll ever confirm her pregnancy or what other occasion she\u2019s holding out for \u2014 perhaps for the next season of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d\n\nHere are some more fan reactions:\n\nthis would\u2019ve been the perfect marketing ploy. so why didn\u2019t they use it? where is kylie and that bump? pic.twitter.com/E77ur2KJnY \u2014 \ud83d\udcbf (@squareups) December 26, 2017\n\nShe must be behind that tree \u2014 \ud83c\udf3b\ud83d\udcf7 (@IviweVikki) December 26, 2017", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kardashiancardday24.jpg?w=450&h=297", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "http://thumbnail.newsinc.com/33377251.sf.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kardashiancardday24.jpg?w=450&h=297", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
