It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect and the second installment in the Pitch Perfect film series. The film centers on the fictional Barden University Bellas, an all-female a cappella singing group, who try to beat out a competing German musical group in a world singing championship. The film features an ensemble cast, including Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Hailee Steinfeld, Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, Kelley Jakle, Shelley Regner, Katey Sagal, and Keegan-Michael Key as well as Skylar Astin, Ben Platt, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, John Michael Higgins, and Banks all reprising their roles.\n\nIt was released in the United States on May 15, 2015 by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $287 million worldwide. It surpassed the total gross of the original film ($115.4 million) in five days, and also became the highest-grossing music comedy film of all-time, overtaking School of Rock ($131.3 million).[5] A sequel, Pitch Perfect 3, was released on December 22, 2017.[6][7]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThree years after winning the previous competition, the Barden Bellas are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale. The Bellas have become ICCA champions each of these three years. However, the group gets involved in a national scandal (dubbed \"Muffgate\") when Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during a performance on his birthday at the Kennedy Center, showing her genitalia to the public as she did not wear her underwear. This scandal leads to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs. Beca makes a deal to allow the Bellas to be reinstated, should they win the World Championship of Acappella.\n\nFreshman Emily Junk begins her college career, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine, by being a Bella. Katherine tells Emily she is more than junk and that she is in fact Pitch Perfect. At orientation, she watches an Acappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Benjamin \"Benji\" Applebaum, Jesse's best friend, overhears Emily, leading to a crush on her.\n\nThe Bellas learn that Das Sound Machine (DSM), a German powerhouse group, has replaced the Bellas on their victory tour. Additionally, Beca has started an internship at a recording studio, Residual Heat, something only Jesse knows.\n\nEmily goes to the Bellas' sorority house to audition for them because of their absence from the auditions. When she sings her unfinished song \"Flashlight,\" she succeeds in joining the Bellas.\n\nAt a car show where the ICCA winners are due to perform, the Bellas scout their replacements, DSM, led by intimidating duo Pieter Kr\u00e4mer and Kommissar, who take delight in mocking the all-girl group. Later, the Bellas are invited to an exclusive riff-off against DSM. Also in attendance are the Treblemakers and the Tone Hangers (a group of former Treblemakers, including former Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen, whom Amy is now dating), as well as a group calling themselves the Green Bay Packers. The Bellas make it to the final two, but end up losing to DSM in the final showdown after Emily nervously sing out \"Flashlight,\" which is an original song and is not from the right category (\"90's Hip-Hop Jamz\").\n\nThe next day at the warmups, the Bellas' chances of winning end in disaster when the performance sets Cynthia Rose Adams's hair on fire by pyrotechnics. Even before then, John and Gail question the Bellas' identity. As the Bellas' stage has grown bigger, the scale of their performance grew bigger as well. Their choreography (designed by Chloe) became more complex and difficult, and they added probs and acrobatics (done by Flo) to their performance too. In order to regain harmony and sync of their voice, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former leader Aubrey Posen. Beca starts a heated debate with Chloe over herself being the only one thinking about life beyond the Bellas and Chloe's obsession with winning Worlds.\n\nTo prove to her boss that she can produce music well, Beca offers Emily to produce \"Flashlight\" at the studio. The group realizes that they will no longer be together and may go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing \"Cups (When I'm Gone)\" (the very song that got Beca into the Bellas in the first movie). Amy confesses that she broke up with Bumper, and the next day, she goes to apologize to Bumper by standing on a canoe and paddling across the lake to him while singing \"We Belong.\" Hurt, Bumper initially tries to turn Amy away, but as the song progresses, he forgives her, and they reconcile. At the studio, Emily and Beca present their song to Beca's boss, in which he demonstrates envy for their talent and looks forward to producing with them.\n\nThe senior Bellas graduate and they all head off to Copenhagen for the World Finals, with Jesse and Benji to cheer them on. They perform a harmonized version of \"Flashlight\" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. The Bellas win the championship and repair their damaged legacy. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated proper initiation with Fat Amy showing her how to do the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bumper performs \"All of Me\" on The Voice, chooses Christina Aguilera as his coach and makes her uncomfortable when he gives her an oddly lengthy hug.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nThe Barden Bellas [ edit ]\n\nAdditional characters [ edit ]\n\nGreen Bay Packers players Clay Matthews, David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, Josh Sitton and T.J.
