He finds the kid inside the famous red onesie and brings out the kid in even the most hardened filmgoer. The last two Spidey epics had \u201cAmazing\u201d in the title, but let\u2019s face it \u2013 both films stirred more apathy than amazement. The only suspense came in wondering how long and hard a franchise could be milked. It may be a problem winning back the comic-book fans, but after that extended cameo in Captain America: Civil War and this new solo outing, you finally feel that your friendly neighborhood web-slinger deserves to be a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming feels fresh off the drawing board, as if he was a character with the dew still on him. The movie is as high school as a John Hughes comedy \u2013 think The Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off \u2013 in which teens talk like teens instead of old-school Hollywood cynics aching to sound young. Six writers are credited with the script and I\u2019m guessing it was a bloodbath, but what\u2019s onscreen pops with the jumpy, unpolished energy of adolescents on the march through puberty. Homecoming gives his character and his teen trauma genuine context.\n\nHolland, who just turned 21, is a British actor who gets inside the role in ways that go beyond a spot-on American accent and a voice that squeaks when he\u2019s excited. As Peter Parker, the Queens, NY, sophomore who\u2019s crushing on the school\u2019s prettiest senior, Liz (Laura Harrier), Holland finds the agony of simply talking to the object of his affections. Even his genius schoolmate Michelle (Zendaya) laughs at his attempts to be cool. For our hero, the guiding light in his life is his unusually attractive Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). But the film\u2019s core relationship is between Peter and his best friend, Ned (Jacob Batalon), a science nerd who loses his shit when he finds out his buddy is Spider-Man. As for Peter\u2019s mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), the man known as Iron Man is reluctant to take the training wheels off this hormonal loose cannon. He may have the stuff to be an Avenger. Just not yet.\n\nThat\u2019s the basic plot. It\u2019s teen drama \u2013 will with Peter take Liz to the homecoming dance? Will he even find the balls to ask her? \u2013 bumping up against larger issues, i.e. will Spider-Man stop the villainous Vulture (a terrific Michael Keaton) from destroying the Washington Monument, the Staten Island Ferry and even the world. Will he even muster the power to do it? (The stunts, by the way, are spectacular.) The movie never forgets that Peter and his alter ego are still the same awkward 15-year-old. Can the webslinger see what we see \u2013 that Vulture, with the wings of a birdman (nice touch), was once a working stiff corrupted by capitalist greed? No one sewed maturity into his costume.\n\nPeter is all over the place, like an adolescent feeling his growing pains \u2013 and so\u2019s movie, as director Jon Watts wrestles to bring coherence out of na\u00efve, juvenile chaos. The result is a mess, but an exhilarating one \u2026 as it should be. It\u2019s no accident that Homecoming is the most fun when it\u2019s flying by the seat of its pants. There\u2019s a spontaneous charge to the film, a euphoric innocence, that makes it a much-needed antidote to stale franchise formula. Watts, whose 2015 indie film Cop Car expertly blended childhood curiosity and terror, has crafted the most audacious web-slinger adventure since Sam Raimi\u2019s Spider-Man 2.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t have done it without his live-wire leading man. Holland, a dancer and acrobat who headlined on the London stage in Elton John\u2019s Billy Elliot: The Musical, moves with an athlete\u2019s natural grace. It\u2019s Holland who makes us care, not to mention that he did nearly 90 percent of the stunts. This is a star performance given by a born actor (check him out in The Impossible and The Lost City of Z). Spider-Man soars because Holland gives him wings.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.rollingstone.com&path=%2Fmovies%2Fmovie-reviews%2Fspider-man-homecoming-review-new-reboot-of-marvel-webslinger-really-is-amazing-200149%2F&ct=article&lob=rollingstone&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=200149", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RS-Get-The-Magazine-Free-Tote.jpg", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/spiderman-homecoming-movie-review-travers-d032db47-19ce-4a4d-9f88-f363b48abc46.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/spiderman-homecoming-movie-review-travers-d032db47-19ce-4a4d-9f88-f363b48abc46.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Travers", "Film Critic", "Peter Travers'S Most Recent Stories", "Endings", "Beginnings", "All The Love", "Sex", "Secrets", "Shailene You Desire", "Sergio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/spider-man-homecoming-review-new-reboot-of-marvel-webslinger-really-is-amazing-200149/", "title": "Peter Travers: 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' Really Is Amazing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#df3535", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Rolling Stone", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2018/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cropped-rs-favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "application-name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is an amazing reboot on the iconic Marvel superhero, thanks to the new Spidey Tom Holland.
