The British soulman returns with \u201cToo Good At Goodbyes,\u201d his first release since 2015\u2019s \u201cWriting\u2019s On The Wall\u201d from Spectre, which became the first James Bond theme to hit No. 1 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart.\n\nWritten with longstanding collaborator Jimmy Napes and Stargate, \"Too Good At Goodbyes\" builds into a gospel chorus and showcases Smith's exceptional range. The torch track is \u201cabout a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt's been a long while since I've put any music out and I feel that this first single sets the tone of what is to come.\u201d\n\nOn it, Smith sings \"Every time you hurt me, the less that I cry / And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry / And every time you walk out, the less I love you / Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true,\" hitting high notes which suggest he's put behind him the vocal cord injury which plagued him in 2015.\n\nSmith is coming off a spectacular start to his recording career. His debut album In The Lonely Hour was a smash, hitting No. 1 in the U.K. and shifting more than 12 million units worldwide. He\u2019s gone on to collect an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, three Brit Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and four Grammys.\n\nIn support of his new release, Smith will play four dates later this month at venues yet to be confirmed. He\u2019ll start Sept. 11 in Los Angeles, then head east with stops in New York (Sept. 13), London (Sept. 15) and, finally, Berlin (Sept. 18).\n\nListen to \u201cToo Good At Goodbyes\u201d below.\n\nThis story first appeared on billboard.com.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/02/gettyimages-512927486.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2016/02/gettyimages-512927486.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/02/gettyimages-512927486.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lars Brandle", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7957695/sam-smith-comeback-too-good-at-goodbyes", "title": "Sam Smith Releases First Song in Two Years, \"Too Good at Goodbyes\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The torch track is \u201cabout a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,\u201d he says.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7957695/sam-smith-comeback-too-good-at-goodbyes", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Sam Smith Releases First Song in Two Years, \"Too Good at Goodbyes\"", "description": "The torch track is \u201cabout a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,\u201d he says.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2016/02/gettyimages-512927486.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Sam Smith Releases First Song in Two Years, \"Too Good at Goodbyes\"", "description": "The torch track is \u201cabout a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,\u201d he says.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/sam-smith-releases-first-song-two-years-good-at-goodbyes-1036744", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/02/gettyimages-512927486.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Sam Smith Releases First Song in Two Years, \"Too Good at Goodbyes\"", "sailthru.description": "The torch track is \u201cabout a relationship I was in and it's basically about getting good at getting dumped,\u201d he says.", "sailthru.author": "Lars Brandle, Billboard", "sailthru.vertical": "Music", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-08 10:06:38", "sailthru.tags": "Music,Sam Smith"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504836398.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
