He gets that it\u2019s her job, but wants her to post more covered up pictures.\u201d\n\nThe mother of three recently returned from an extravagant European vacation that she spent with her boyfriend and her three children with ex Scott Disick: Mason, 8, Reign, 3, and Penelope, 5.\n\nDuring the three-week trip, Kardashian traveled around Italy and posted multiple photos on Instagram showing off her toned physique in bathing suits, including two photos of her eating bread in a bikini while on a yacht.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Strike a Pose!

Kourtney\u2019s family really likes him. He\u2019s the opposite of Scott. He doesn\u2019t party, isn\u2019t flashy and really treats Kourtney with a lot of respect. It\u2019s obvious that he really cares about her.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fsimon-huck-1-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkourtney-b1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1413&h=740&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkourtney-b1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fsimon-huck-2-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1413&h=740&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fkourtney-b1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-boyfriend-younes-trolls-himself-on-instagram/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian's Boyfriend Younes Trolls Himself on Instagram After Leaving Shady Comment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Couples,Kourtney Kardashian,News,TV,Younes Bendjima", "news_keywords": "Couples,Kourtney Kardashian,News,TV,Younes Bendjima", "description": "Younes Bendjima left a playful comment on Kourtney Kardashian's Instagram post after receiving backlash for criticizing her sexy snaps", "og": {"title": "Kourtney Kardashian's Boyfriend Younes Trolls Himself on Instagram After Leaving Shady Comment", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-boyfriend-younes-trolls-himself-on-instagram/", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s boyfriend&nbsp;Younes Bendjima&nbsp;is poking fun at himself.
