In one of the first big twists of the new season, it was unveiled that she decided to keep the baby, due in five months, which even surprised actress Karla Souza. \u201cAs actors, we assume that the baby wouldn\u2019t really happen because, production-wise, it gets a little complicated to have the prosthetic bellies and little babies and kids running around,\u201d Souza told Deadline. \u201cI assumed that it wasn\u2019t going to go through and when I came back from hiatus, it was pretty much assured that we were going to have a baby.\u201d\n\nRelated Story 'American Idol': ABC Plots Remote Live Shows Following COVID-19 Production Shutdown\n\nThe reveal came at the end of the episode when Laurel shares the news with her fellow accomplices during a dinner meeting prompted by Annalise. However, she chooses to withhold this information from her father, telling him at the top of the season opener that she got an abortion instead.\n\n\u201cThe reason why she decides to not tell her father is because she has a very big suspicion that he indeed killed Wes,\u201d said Souza, which becomes apparent when Laurel types \u2018why did you kill Wes\u2019 in a text message to her father but doesn\u2019t send it. \u201cIf she tells her father that she\u2019s pregnant, her father is going to assume that Laurel is going to look out for more clues about the killer. Whereas if she makes it all go away in his mind, it buys time and also space to do some snooping around, without him being aware of it.\u201d\n\nABC\n\nSouza added that she also \u201ctells him that she\u2019s pregnant to see if he already knows\u201d because, \u201cit gives her power in the relationship because she has something that he hasn\u2019t been able to infiltrate in her life.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of Laurel, it seemed like Annalise and the gang were ready to close the \u201cwho killed Wes?\u201d case and leave the crime life behind, with Annalise assuming the blame for the loss of her student. \u201cIt was a huge shock to [the audience] to see that Laurel\u2019s father made that phone call to Dominic to murder Wes. We\u2019re going to find out, through Laurel\u2019s digging, why exactly that happened,\u201d and in turn, \u201cit\u2019s going to resurface everyone\u2019s passion for finding the truth. Laurel is hoping that once she\u2019s able to prove [her father\u2019s involvement], she\u2019ll have more people on her side seeking revenge.\u201d\n\nThe dinner, which was teased throughout the episode, served as the last supper with Annalise essentially letting the team go, much to the chagrin of the group.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cWhen [Laurel] tells Annalise she\u2019s having the baby, I think Laurel is telling her, \u2018we\u2019re having it together,'\u201d said Souza. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be their redemption and it comes to her as such a blow when, despite that, Annalise fires her. That\u2019s a big rejection for Laurel. However, she\u2019ll take it as an engine to keep on with her plan [to uncover Wes\u2019 killer], with or without Annalise \u2026 that will be her arc in at least these first eight episodes.\u201d\n\nTonight\u2019s episode ended in a three-month time jump with Laurel waking up in a hospital bed in a panic over the whereabouts of her infant.\n\n\u201cLast season the hashtag was #WhoKilledWes. I think [this season] it\u2019ll be #WhereIsTheBaby. As in past seasons, it\u2019s just a piece of the puzzle,\u201d said Souza, assuring that will know what happen to the baby by the midseason finale. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to how Jimmy Smits\u2019 character and Frank (Charlie Weber) are there and little by little we\u2019re going to find out more about what happened that night\u2026 the baby is definitely going to be at the center of it all.\u201d\n\nCreated by Peter Nowalk, How to Get Away With Murder airs Thursdays as part of ABC\u2019s Shondaland TGIT lineup.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2017%2F09%2Fhow-to-get-away-with-murder-karla-souza-interview-season-4-spoilers-1202179086%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202179086&comment_count=6", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_0242.jpg?w=300&h=200", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_1672.jpg?w=300&h=200", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_0516.jpg?w=300&h=200", "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_0029.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_0029.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda N'Duka"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/09/how-to-get-away-with-murder-karla-souza-interview-season-4-spoilers-1202179086/", "title": "\u2018How To Get Away With Murder\u2019: Karla Souza On Season 4 Premiere Reveals & What\u2019s In Store", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about tonight\u2019s Season 4 premiere of How to Get Away With Murder. \u00a0 ABC's How to Get Away With Murder returned tonight for its fourth season and the Viola Davis-led series picks up right where it left off, with Davis' Annalise Keating putting the piec...", "news_keywords": "ABC, How To Get Away With Murder, Karla Souza, Viola Davis", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018How To Get Away With Murder\u2019: Karla Souza On Season 4 Premiere Reveals & What\u2019s In Store", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/09/how-to-get-away-with-murder-karla-souza-interview-season-4-spoilers-1202179086/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT: This story contains details about tonight\u2019s Season 4 premiere of How to Get Away With Murder. \u00a0 ABC\u2019s How to Get Away With Murder returned tonight for its fourth season and the\u2026", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/147214_0029.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1200, "height": 800, "alt": "HOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER - \"I'm Going Away\" - In the wake of Wes' tragic death, Annalise returns to her family home to pick up the pieces of her shattered life, and realizes that, in order to rebuild, she must make a tough and shocking decision.
