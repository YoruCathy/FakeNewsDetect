Unfortunately, that was me.\u201d He said that the discussion continued for so long because he thought Hoffman\u2019s answers \u201cwere pretty bad\u201d.\n\nDownload the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\n\u201cI wanted to try and get him to a point of self-reflection and to try and get something out of the conversation, but that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he added.\n\nDuring the panel, Oliver first breached the subject by stating: \u201cThis is something we\u2019re going to have to talk about because... it\u2019s hanging in the air.\u201d The host was referencing allegations that he sexually harassed Anna Graham-Hunter as a 17-year-old production assistant on the set of his 1985 TV film Death of a Salesman.\n\nAudience members \u2013 including The Washington Post journalist Steve Zeitchik \u2013 were said to be \u201cvisibly shocked\u201d by the interaction, in which Oliver expressed disappointment in Hoffman\u2019s original apology in which he claimed the behaviour is not reflective of who he is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that part of the response to this stuff that pisses me off,\u201d Oliver stated. \u201cIt is reflective of who you were. You\u2019ve given no evidence to show that it didn\u2019t happen. There was a period of time when you were a creeper around women. It feels like a cop-out to say, \u2018Well, this isn\u2019t me.\u2019 Do you understand how that feels like a dismissal?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you believe this stuff you read?\u201d Hoffman asked to which Oliver replied he did \u201c...because there\u2019s no point in [an accuser] lying.\u201d Hoffman returned, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a point in her not bringing it up for 40 years.\u201d\n\nHoffman spent the remainder of the Q&A attempting to contextualise his behaviour, words which were continually combatted by Oliver who later expressed why he couldn\u2019t stay silent.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t leave certain things unaddressed,\u201d he reportedly told the audience. \u201cThat leads to me at home later tonight hating myself, asking, \u2018Why the f*ck didn\u2019t I say something? No one stands up to powerful men.\u2019\u201d\n\nA second allegation of sexual harassment was made against Hoffman by producer Wendy Riss Gatsiounis who alleges that, as a playwright in 1991, a meeting with the actor and Tootsie screenwriter Murray Schisgal turned unprofessional following inappropriate remarks.\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and more.", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/09/john-oliver-0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/09/john-oliver-0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/john-oliver-dustin-hoffman-sexual-harassment-why-confront-allegations-last-week-hbo-a8207951.html", "title": "John Oliver explains why he confronted Dustin Hoffman over sexual harassment allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/john-oliver-dustin-hoffman-sexual-harassment-why-confront-allegations-last-week-hbo-a8207951.html", "title": "John Oliver explains why he confronted Dustin Hoffman over sexual harassment allegations", "description": "'I wanted to try and get him to a point of self-reflection and to try and get something out of the conversation, but that didn\u2019t happen'", "updated_time": "2018-02-13T09:14:02+00:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/09/john-oliver-0.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5668655759001_5668648777001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5668648777001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8207951"}, "description": "John\u00a0Oliver has revealed why decided to confront Dustin Hoffman with the allegations against him in a December interview.", "keywords": "John Oliver, Dustin Hoffman, Culture", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "John Oliver", "published_time": "2018-02-13T08:29:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-13T09:14:02+00:00", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Video", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 508, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 8, "external_link_count": 1}, "twitter": {"title": "John Oliver explains why he confronted Dustin Hoffman over sexual ha\u2026", "description": "John\u00a0Oliver has revealed why decided to confront Dustin Hoffman with the allegations against him in a December interview.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518510540.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
