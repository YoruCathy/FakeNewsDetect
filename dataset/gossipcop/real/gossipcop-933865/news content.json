I was 17 and a junior in high school,\" Palin recalled of learning she was pregnant with Tripp.\n\n\"It took hearing your heartbeat for a positive pregnancy test to really mean anything to me.. and took holding you in my arms to realize my life was going to be changed forever,\" she said.\n\n\"I am so thankful for God's plan over our life, and His grace that has covered us entirely.. my kids truly are my biggest blessing #purpose,\" the star added.\n\nPalin is parent to Tripp with Levi Johnston and to Sailor and Atlee with her estranged husband, Dakota Meyer.
