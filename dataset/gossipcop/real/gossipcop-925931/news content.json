Turns out, Girls Next Door alum Bridget Marquardt is remaining neutral in the ongoing feud between her former costars Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson.\n\nThe one-time Playboy model, 42, spoke out about her fellow blonde bombshells\u2019 beef during an appearance on the Wednesday, May 18, episode of Hollywood Today Live, and told hosts Garcelle Beauvais and Kristen Brockman that she is not picking sides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad. Like I feel like we have a bond, the three of us,\u201d the TV personality began. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like, it\u2019s not like a sisterhood, it\u2019s not like friends, I mean it is friends, but it\u2019s something totally different than any other relationship you could possibly imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so in that sense, it kind of makes me sad, but at the same time, I mean,\u201d she added, \u201cHolly came out with a book and she gave her experience.\u201d\n\nWhile she looks at the fight between Hugh Hefner\u2019s exes from a diplomatic perspective, she didn\u2019t sugarcoat her feelings when telling Wilkinson, 30, she didn\u2019t agree with the mom of two\u2019s expletive-filled Twitter tirade against Madison, 36, on May 12.\n\n\u201cThis is what I told Kendra, \u2018She\u2019s writing about her experience and this is how she\u2019s reflecting on it and she has a right to do that,\u2019\u201d Marquardt continued. \u201c\u2019And you have a right not to agree with her, but lashing out like this and saying such vile things and stuff isn\u2019t really the way to handle it either.'\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Wilkinson ripped into Madison after taking issue with comments the Vegas Diaries author made in a recent interview, in which she spoke candidly about her time living in the Playboy Mansion with Hefner, 90, and his harem of girlfriends.\n\n\u201cNow Holly is on cover of People mag sayin she lived in fear at the mansion. She wasn\u2019t in fear with that d\u2013k in her ass for a paycheck,\u201d Wilkinson wrote in her now-deleted posts. \u201cThat bitch is in fear now knowing so many of us saw her doing some nasty s\u2013t. She\u2019s embarrassed and in shame. She was the clean up girl \u2026 Hollys job was to get Hef hard again and clean him up with her mouth.\u201d\n\nWilkinson and Madison rose to fame together as stars of E!\u2019s Girls Next Door in the mid-aughts; the series ran for six seasons from 2005 until 2009. In 2015, Madison released her first memoir, Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny, which became the catalyst for the conflict between herself and Wilkinson.\n\nAlthough Wilkinson memorably lashed out at Madison for the claims she made in the tome (which included stories about Hef allegedly giving Madison Quaaludes and verbally attacking her, among others), Marquardt revealed that Wilkinson hasn\u2019t even read the book.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not sure, she must be referring to the first book that Holly wrote, not the one that\u2019s coming out right now,\u201d she said during her chat on Hollywood Today Live. \u201cBut Kendra hasn\u2019t read the book. I asked her, she hasn\u2019t read it.\u201d\n\nAs fans will recall, Wilkinson and Marquardt had a heart-to-heart over the aftermath of leaving the Playboy Mansion on the May 6 episode of Kendra on Top.\n\n\u201cYou know, I did have\u2014as we all did, probably, a hard time transitioning into like a world outside the mansion,\u201d Wilkinson told her. When the WE tv star left the Playboy Mansion in 2009 to marry her husband, Hank Baskett, she slammed Marquardt in the press, saying they were never friends, which she admitted to regretting. \u201cWhen I was saying those things, it was more about like, trying to distance myself from the mansion as much as I could, which was the wrong thing to do,\u201d she shared with Marquardt.\n\nMarquardt, who is engaged to her beau of seven years, Nick Carpenter, told Hollywood Today Live that she felt Wilkinson\u2019s apology was the real deal.\n\n\u201cI do feel it was sincere and I do think there\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d she noted. \u201cThere\u2019s been a long track record of things, you know, so I think that that\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction, and we both feel really good about it. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re BFFs or anything right now.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-promos-e371fcd1-6c9d-4c64-b1ce-82d1fdb8b879.jpg?crop=146px%2C30px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-inline-206b936e-c8bc-4a52-b065-c538d36f699f.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-holly-madison-kendra-wilkinson-hugh-hefner-87e77469-ada3-4a9d-b48a-5241a28e22eb.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-promos-e371fcd1-6c9d-4c64-b1ce-82d1fdb8b879.jpg?crop=146px%2C30px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bridget-marquardt-talks-holly-madison-kendra-wilkinson-feud-w207059/", "title": "Bridget Marquardt Talks Holly Madison, Kendra Wilkinson Feud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Girls Next Door\u2019 alum Bridget Marquardt weighed in on Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson\u2019s ongoing feud on Wednesday, May 18 \u2014 see what she said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bridget Marquardt: My Take on Holly and Kendra\u2019s Feud", "description": "\u2018Girls Next Door\u2019 alum Bridget Marquardt weighed in on Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson\u2019s ongoing feud on Wednesday, May 18 \u2014 see what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bridget-marquardt-talks-holly-madison-kendra-wilkinson-feud-w207059/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-09T00:28:09+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-promos-e371fcd1-6c9d-4c64-b1ce-82d1fdb8b879.jpg?crop=146px%2C30px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-promos-e371fcd1-6c9d-4c64-b1ce-82d1fdb8b879.jpg?crop=146px%2C30px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2016-05-19T15:14:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-09T00:28:09+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Girls Next Door\u2019 alum Bridget Marquardt weighed in on Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson\u2019s ongoing feud on Wednesday, May 18 \u2014 see what she said", "title": "Bridget Marquardt: My Take on Holly and Kendra\u2019s Feud", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bridget-marquardt-promos-e371fcd1-6c9d-4c64-b1ce-82d1fdb8b879.jpg?crop=146px%2C30px%2C1331px%2C699px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1463670840.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
