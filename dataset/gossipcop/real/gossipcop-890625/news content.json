We are thrilled to be able to honor her as our Woman of the Year.\u201d\n\nGomez\u2019 career has never been in better shape. In 2015 and 2016, she enjoyed top 10 Billboard Hot 100 smashes with \u201cSame Old Love\u201d and \u201cHands to Myself\u201d and \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk Anymore.\u201d The trend continues, with hits \u201cBad Liar,\u201d \u201cFetish\u201d (featuring Gucci Mane) and \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d (with Kygo) in the past year.\n\nFive of her albums have cracked the top 10 of the Billboard 200, with the studio albums Revival (2015) and Stars Dance (2013) leading the chart.\n\nNot confined to music, Gomez also executive-produced the Netflix drama 13 Reasons Why, launched partnerships with Coach and Puma, and worked tirelessly across various philanthropic endeavors, from the Step Up Foundation to coaching for World Kindness Day, and raising more than $500,000 for the Lupus Research Alliance. Also, Gomez has been an active ambassador for UNICEF since 2009.\n\nThe prestigious event, held in conjunction with the publication of Billboard\u2019s Women in Music issue, also recognizes the most powerful female executives in the industry. Additional Women in Music honorees will be unveiled in due course.\n\nFor the first time, the Women in Music event and a red-carpet pre-show will be broadcast live for on Twitter from 9pm-midnight EST on Nov. 30.
