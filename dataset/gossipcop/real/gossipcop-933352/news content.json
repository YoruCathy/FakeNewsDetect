Jennifer Lopez sizzled on both the carpet and the after-party scene in similar dresses with black, red, blue and touches of gold. Gigi Hadid on the other hand looked like a fairy on the carpet and then channeled her inner pink, punk rock princess afterwards in a fabulous pants-jacket combo.\n\nRihanna turned heads the moment she arrived at the Met Gala. She looked like a diamond-crusted Pope and we\u2019re still in awe of her look. When she hit the party scene however she donned a sheer glitter blue pantsuit and we don\u2019t know which look we love more.\n\nPhotos\n\n2018 Met Gala: Red Carpet Couples\n\nBlake Lively looked like a queen in her red Versace jeweled gown before rocking plaid at the parties. It was like looking at Serena van der Woodsen at a gala and then on the steps of the Met before school on Gossip Girl.\n\nWhile we loved the original Met Gala looks from these stars, their after-party ensembles were fun and fierce and so fresh. So, how do we choose our favorite? Luckily, we\u2019re putting that in your hands.\n\nCast your vote for which of these stars\u2019 looks you like best.
