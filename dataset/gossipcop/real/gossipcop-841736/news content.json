The show originally premiered three years ago, but was revived by Raftery after President Donald Trump rolled back bathroom guidelines for transgender students.\n\nIn an interview with V Magazine, Raftery described Wintour\u2019s decision to donate her sunglasses to the auction, which also includes a $1,000 gift certificate for the men\u2019s clothing store Bergdorf Goodman, as \u201cthrilling.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m very happy that the proceeds\u200b will\u200b benefit this organization so dear to me and\u200b necessary to\u200b thousands of LGBT youth across the country.\u201d\n\n[H/T Refinery29]\n\nGet our Health Newsletter.
