But Will Smith brought it back to life the day he joined Instagram.\n\nWhile the social media platform launched back in 2018, it wasn't until one fateful day in December 2017 that the Fresh Prince decided to post his first IG picture. It's been on ever since.\n\nThe charismatic super star let fans into his childhood when he shared a baby photo that required no filters. Approximately seven IG posts later, he had everyone hooked, especially when he showed just how proud he is to be a father by uploading a split image of Jaden and himself in similar poses at two different events.\n\nWill then reminded his fans and binge watchers everywhere to keep watching Netflix (before the whole Mo\u2019Nique boycott went down).\n\nBut it isn't just his wit and family pics that has everyone following Smith\u2014it's his life advice. From inspirational posts laced with comedic timing, to his musings on what it takes to make a marriage last, Smith's insight never comes off as preachy, which people obviously relate to.

Somewhere along the way he transformed into an inebriated super hero, but not before experiencing life as one of the world's soul survivors. Now he's a full blown family man who's still doing backflips on a big screen while banking millions.

But sometimes, it\u2019s not about the money or the fame. Sometimes it\u2019s just having a lot of (high-ranking) celebrity friends who care just as much about the culture as you do.\n\nHe Shows His Family A Lot Of Love\n\nThrough all his stardom, Will has always seems to put family first.
