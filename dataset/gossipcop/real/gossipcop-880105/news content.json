Bizzle has used the word \u201cDench\u201d as a synonym for anything amazing, and even launched his own clothing line \u201cStay Dench.\u201d\n\nWhile they recorded her verses, Dench can be seen wearing one of Dizzle\u2019s flat brimmed hats that read \u201cDENCH.\u201d\n\nFans of both performers immediately took to social media to celebrate the collaboration.\n\nThe actress proved she\u2019s never afraid to try new things last year when, at the age of 81, she got her first tattoo. Situated over her right wrist, the phrase \u201ccarpe diem\u201d is written in bold font.\n\nAccording to Surrey Life magazine the ink was a gift from her daughter Tara \u201cFinty\u201d Williams. \u201cThat\u2019s my motto: Seize the day,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cFinty gave it to me for my 81st birthday \u2014 she\u2019s wonderful with surprises.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fjudi-dench2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F09%2Fjudi-dench2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/pow-watch-dame-judi-dench-learn-how-to-rap-with-lethal-bizzle/", "title": "Dame Judi Dench Learn How to Spit Bars in Rap Session with Lethal Bizzle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Judi Dench,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,Music News,News", "news_keywords": "Judi Dench,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,Music News,News", "description": "Oscar-winning actress Judi Dench can now add rapping to her list of career accomplishments", "og": {"title": "Dame Judi Dench Learn How to Spit Bars in Rap Session with Lethal Bizzle", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/pow-watch-dame-judi-dench-learn-how-to-rap-with-lethal-bizzle/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7ojygIbMYk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent Dame Judi Dizzle?
