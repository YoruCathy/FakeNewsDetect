Justin Bieber made his first public appearance since canceling the remaining 14 shows of his Purpose world tour in July.\n\nThe \u201cSorry\u201d singer, 23, enjoyed a night out on Thursday, August 3, at the launch party for celebrity stylist Karla Welch\u2019s Bieber-inspired collection with Hanes. The Grammy winner, who sported clear glasses and a small black backpack, was all smiles as he posed for photos with fans outside the event, held at Maxfield in West Hollywood.\n\nBieber socialized with his manager Scooter Braun and Braun\u2019s wife, Yael Cohen, throughout the evening, and also took a moment to admire a large photo of himself on the wall.\n\nAs previously reported, the \u201cWhat Do You Mean\u201d crooner canceled the remainder of his tour, citing \u201cunforeseen circumstances.\u201d Bieber took to Instagram on Wednesday, August 2, to address the news and apologize to his fanbase.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful for this journey with all of you.. I\u2019m grateful for the tours but most of all I am grateful to get to go through this life with you. Learning and growing hasn\u2019t always been easy but knowing I\u2019m not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them! I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life! I am blessed to have people in the past few years help me build by character back up reminding me of who I am and who I want to be,\u201d he wrote in the heartfelt message. \u201cI want you all to know this tour has been unbelievable and has taught me so much about myself.. I am reminded of how blessed I am to have a voice in this world. I\u2019ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling. Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nBraun, 36, also shared an Instagram post congratulating Bieber on \u201can incredible tour\u201d and thanking the cast and crew for their \u201cunending support.\u201d\n\nA source close to the pop star told Us Weekly exclusively that his decision to cancel the tour \u201cwas very last minute.\u201d Added another insider, \u201cHe found the world tour to be really challenging. he wasn\u2019t able to have a routine. He shouldn\u2019t have gone on a world tour that size because he\u2019s just exhausted. He just didn\u2019t want to do it anymore. People around him didn\u2019t think he was going to finish it and knew from the start this was very ambitious for him.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/826395854_justin-bieber-zoom-938462ea-3c6f-4539-b617-037217f521a6.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/826395854_justin-bieber-zoom-14ac123f-e31f-491d-b233-769026119798.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/826395854_justin-bieber-zoom-14ac123f-e31f-491d-b233-769026119798.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Sloane", "Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-bieber-makes-first-appearance-since-canceling-world-tour-w496074/", "title": "Justin Bieber Makes First Appearance Since Canceling World Tour", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Justin Bieber stepped back into the spotlight shortly after canceling the remaining concerts of his Purpose world tour \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber Makes First Public Appearance Since Canceling World Tour", "description": "Justin Bieber stepped back into the spotlight shortly after canceling the remaining concerts of his Purpose world tour \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-bieber-makes-first-appearance-since-canceling-world-tour-w496074/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:49:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/826395854_justin-bieber-zoom-14ac123f-e31f-491d-b233-769026119798.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/826395854_justin-bieber-zoom-14ac123f-e31f-491d-b233-769026119798.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-04T19:41:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:49:03+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Justin Bieber stepped back into the spotlight shortly after canceling the remaining concerts of his Purpose world tour \u2014 details", "title": "Justin Bieber Makes First Public Appearance Since Canceling World Tour", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/826395854_justin-bieber-zoom-14ac123f-e31f-491d-b233-769026119798.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501875694.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
