Dawson, 29, reposted the same image with the caption, \u201cThe love of my life is now OFFICIALLY the love of my life. Never been happier. :).\u201d\n\nThe pair, who are fellow musicians in the band All Time Low, have been going steady since 2010. Dawson, who drums for the band, is still a little camera-shy, however. In an interview with Taste of Country, Pope explained that though she \u201cbegged\u201d her boyfriend to costar with her in her music video for \u201cSummer,\u201d he politely declined.\n\nWE\u2019RE ENGAGED \u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764 A post shared by Cassadee Pope (@cassadeepope) on Feb 10, 2017 at 5:59pm PST\n\n\u201cI actually begged him to be in the video,\u201d she said in the interview last July. \u201cBut he\u2019s, first of all, is an amazing, amazing, supporter of mine, and he has been since the beginning, since six and a half years ago before The Voice, before everything. And he was just like, \u2018I\u2019m not an actor. I want you to get the best of the best for this video. I want it to be amazing, and I don\u2019t think I will be able to deliver that because I\u2019m not an actor \u2014 I\u2019m a drummer in All Time Low, that\u2019s what I do.\u2019\u201d\n\nPope would go on to costar with actor and model Sam Krumrine in the steamy video. \u201cYes! So excited for everyone to see this video!!\u201d Dawson tweeted upon the video\u2019s release. \u201cIt is so damn good and Cass is \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 to be fair, the hunk is too\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd the season 3 Voice winner, who won on coach Blake Shelton\u2019s team in 2012, has more than one thing to celebrate. On Sunday, February 12, the crooner will attend the 2017 Grammys, where she is nominated for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for her duet with Chris Young, \u201cThink of You.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, I\u2019m beside myself right now,\u201d Cassadee previously told The Boot. \u201cIt\u2019s so amazing to be coupled in with all these incredible artists, and I get to go to L.A. to hang out with even more incredible artists. \u2026 I have to thank The Voice for everything they\u2019ve done for me. The real work started after the show, so I\u2019m really glad I stuck with it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/cassadee-pope-rian-dawson-88103b3c-80f9-448d-b6a3-df9115731ae4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/cassadee-pope-rian-dawson-8553b9d1-c2cf-47b3-9fea-9b92039b5b1a.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/cassadee-pope-rian-dawson-88103b3c-80f9-448d-b6a3-df9115731ae4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-voice-winner-cassadee-pope-is-engaged-to-rian-dawson-w466400/", "title": "\u2018The Voice\u2019 Winner Cassadee Pope Is Engaged to Rian Dawson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018The Voice\u2019 season 3 winner Cassadee Pope announced her engagement to longtime boyfriend Rian Dawson (her bandmate in All Time Low) in a sweet post to Instagram on Friday, February 10 \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Voice\u2019 Winner Cassadee Pope Is Engaged to Rian Dawson", "description": "\u2018The Voice\u2019 season 3 winner Cassadee Pope announced her engagement to longtime boyfriend Rian Dawson (her bandmate in All Time Low) in a sweet post to Instagram on Friday, February 10 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-voice-winner-cassadee-pope-is-engaged-to-rian-dawson-w466400/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:12:38+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/cassadee-pope-rian-dawson-88103b3c-80f9-448d-b6a3-df9115731ae4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/cassadee-pope-rian-dawson-88103b3c-80f9-448d-b6a3-df9115731ae4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Love Lives", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-02-11T16:39:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:12:38+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018The Voice\u2019 season 3 winner Cassadee Pope announced her engagement to longtime boyfriend Rian Dawson (her bandmate in All Time Low) in a sweet post to Instagram on Friday, February 10 \u2014 read more", "title": "\u2018The Voice\u2019 Winner Cassadee Pope Is Engaged to Rian Dawson", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/cassadee-pope-rian-dawson-88103b3c-80f9-448d-b6a3-df9115731ae4.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1486831140.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
