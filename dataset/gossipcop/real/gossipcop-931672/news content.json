As law enforcement is involved, we cannot comment further as it could affect the investigation.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Los Angeles FBI field office said the agency neither confirms nor denies investigations. And asked whether his agency is involved in the matter, a spokesman for the Los Angeles District Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know to understand what\u2019s going on:\n\nHart\u2019s Instagram post\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at a place in my life where I feel like I have a target on my back, and because of that, I should make smart decisions,\u201d Hart said in the video, not directly addressing extortion allegations. \u201cAnd recently, I didn\u2019t. You know, I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not going to sit up here and say that I am, or claim to be in any way shape or form, and I made a bad error in judgement and put myself in an environment where only bad things can happen, and they did. And in doing that, I know I\u2019m going to hurt the people closest to me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe details that then emerged\n\nSoon after Hart\u2019s video went live, TMZ was out with a report that \u201ca woman has allegedly demanded money from Kevin\u201d with a video showing him and a woman engaged in \u201csexually suggestive\u201d conduct. The outlet wrote that Hart\u2019s Instagram confession was him \u201cgetting out in front of a messy situation.\u201d\n\nTMZ, which has been covering the saga closely, followed up with a report that said an anonymous person demanded millions of dollars in exchange for keeping the video private. But the outlet, citing law enforcement sources, wrote that it\u2019s unclear whether the woman in the video or another person made the alleged demand.\n\nOn Tuesday, the outlet published a blurry still frame that is purportedly from the video in question.\n\nAD\n\nThe woman at the center of the scandal goes public\n\n\u201cI am not an extortionist,\u201d Montia Sabbag said at a Wednesday press conference. \u201cI had nothing to do with these recordings.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe model/actress, who had been identified by TMZ days before, retained high-powered lawyer Lisa Bloom.\n\nBloom has represented Blac Chyna (after her ex-fiancee posted explicit photos of her on social media) and women who have accused Bill Cosby and Bill O\u2019Reilly of sexual misconduct.\n\nOn Wednesday, Bloom said Sabbag was secretly taped about a month ago in Hart\u2019s Las Vegas hotel room.\n\n\u201cMontia is a crime victim,\u201d said Bloom, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cSomeone apparently snuck cameras into Kevin Hart\u2019s private hotel suite in Las Vegas and recorded bedroom images of the two of them. It is a crime to secretly put cameras in a private place like a hotel room. It is another crime to secretly record people in a private place. It is yet another crime to distribute those images. Montia is the victim of multiple felonies under state and federal laws.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBloom dismissed reports of an investigation as her client had not been approached, she claimed. She added that they will be meeting with law enforcement \u201cimmediately\u201d to report the crime. \u201cMontia and I are not asking for a cent from Kevin Hart. This is not about money,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cWe are not suing him. We are not making any claims against him. Kevin Hart appears to be the victim of this criminal, just as Montia is a victim of this criminal.\u201d\n\nCheating rumors that bubbled up over the summer\n\nThis all followed a summer when celebrity gossip sites ran stories about Hart possibly cheating on his pregnant wife \u2014 including a blurry photos showing a man and a woman cozying up in a car.\n\nHart posted this on Instagram about the same time, seemingly addressing the rumors:\n\n#LiveLoveLaugh .....SMDH A post shared by Kevin Hart (@kevinhart4real) on Jul 19, 2017 at 5:28pm PDT\n\nA public back-and-forth between his former wife and current wife\n\nThose cheating rumors eventually died down. And then on her wedding anniversary, Parrish posted a tribute to Hart \u2014 which then caused its own mini-controversy.\n\n\u201cI love you every day,\u201d she wrote. \u201c8 years together.. 1 year married.. Forever to go!\u201d\n\nBut Hart separated from first wife, Torrei Hart, in February 2010, and the two divorced in 2011 \u2014 and that timeline caused a stir on social media, even prompting a back-and-forth between the two women on social media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParrish, in now-deleted comments on Instagram, wrote that \u201ctheir marriage was broken way before I came in the picture. They were separated, living in separate homes. I was never a secret. She knew that as well. Don\u2019t believe the hype.\u201d\n\nTorrei Hart, who co-parents her two children with Hart, told TMZ that \u201cshe forced my hand to address this publicly. The most important thing to me is my children, so if my children see something that she\u2019s writing that makes me look like a liar, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told them before I\u2019m happy for them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re about to have a baby. My kids are very happy they\u2019re about to have siblings on the way, I\u2019m honestly happy for them, and I don\u2019t understand where all this is coming from.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHart\u2019s ex-wife sits down with \u2018Inside Edition\u2019\n\nAmid the reports about a possible extortion plot, Torrei Hart did a sit-down interview with \u201cInside Edition\u201d that aired Monday night. She told the outlet that \u201clies and infidelity\u201d led to the demise of her marriage with Hart, and that they had \u201cgrown apart.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nShe was also asked to comment on whether Hart would cheat again. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cAll I can say is if it happened to me, it could happen to anyone.\u201d\n\nHart has publicly addressed his history with cheating\n\n\u201cLying ruined my marriage. . . . That\u2019s a lie, I cheated,\u201d Hart said in his 2013 stand-up special \u201cKevin Hart: Let Me Explain.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, people, I cheated. Am I ashamed of it? No, I\u2019m not,\u201d he joked. \u201cDo I wish I could take it back? No, no I don\u2019t. Let me tell you why. You can\u2019t evolve as a man if you never make a mistake. The only way that you can be perfect is to not f\u2011\u2011\u2011 up. I did it, I f\u2011\u2011\u2011ed up. Don\u2019t cheat!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe comedian\u2019s career has blown up in the past decade as he\u2019s evolved his act to take his personal stories to the stage. Of course, a stand-up comic\u2019s act can\u2019t always \u2014 and often shouldn\u2019t \u2014 be treated as a factual recounting of the past. But Hart has also, in sit-down interviews, talked about his first marriage with Torrei Hart.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was young on my first marriage,\u201d Hart told Chelsea Handler in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to say it, guys. I got married at the age of 22. I was still all over the place. I didn\u2019t really understand the definition of marriage. So I wasn\u2019t ready for it, so I take responsibility. I can say I messed my first marriage up. I\u2019m man enough to say that.\u201d\n\nHart added: \u201cAt the same time, that was when I was in the prime of my sexy, so don\u2019t blame me. That\u2019s when I was figuring it out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe interview with Handler came just a few months after he married Eniko Parrish.\n\n\u201cI will say that me and my ex-wife, regardless of the problems we went through, are in an amazing place now where we\u2019re friends, we\u2019re great parents, we\u2019re co-parents, but we have a relationship,\u201d Hart continued. \u201cAnd now that I\u2019ve moved on and I\u2019ve met somebody else, to make this step was a big step. It took some time, it took seven years, but I was like, you know what, she deserves it because I can\u2019t keep letting us walk around free. That\u2019s not fair to her, like, I got to lock this up \u2014 I\u2019m talking about my body.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHandler began laughing uncontrollably as he kept going: \u201cSo I proposed, man, and I can honestly say \u2014 that wasn\u2019t a joke! I was serious. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m in love. I found a good woman.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5zX9Uk8VWyGMTfz75jNhoGiiPj4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4PSQEHCDXUYA5AMQH2QKRLBO2Y.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4EGPVNVCUA4J3KTLCIHUMBSE7U.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/5bd13033-50c2-4ef3-a231-2f9d3ef43dcc.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/5zX9Uk8VWyGMTfz75jNhoGiiPj4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4PSQEHCDXUYA5AMQH2QKRLBO2Y.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/09/19/kevin-harts-alleged-cheating-and-extortion-scandal-explained/", "title": "Kevin Hart\u2019s alleged cheating and extortion scandal, explained", "meta_data": {"description": "He recently made a public apology to his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, and children.
