And now, with two years of wedding bliss behind her, Us Weekly Video takes a look back at the Friends alum and her husband Justin Theroux\u2019s love story. Watch the video above.\n\nPrior to connecting with the Cake actress, who famously split from ex-husband Brad Pitt in 2005 after he romanced now-estranged wife Angelina Jolie, Theroux was in a relationship with stylist Heidi Bivens for 14 years.\n\nWhile Theroux was still dating Bivens, Aniston was mending a broken heart and getting back in the dating game. The Just Go With It actress dated her Break-Up costar Vince Vaughn in 2006 before moving on to bad boy John Mayer, who she dated for a year prior to splitting in March 2009.\n\nAlthough they met in 2007 on the set of Tropic Thunder (which Theroux cowrote with Aniston\u2019s close friend Ben Stiller), it wasn\u2019t until Aniston and Theroux worked alongside each other in 2010 on Wanderlust that she found her Prince Charming. \u201cMy first [thought] was that this was completely easy,\u201d she explained to Pop Sugar of Theroux. \u201cHe is funny, kind and easy to be with.\u201d\n\nFast-forward two years and Theroux was ready to make it official. The Leftovers actor popped the question to Aniston on his 41st birthday on August 10, 2012. \u201cJustin Theroux had an amazing birthday Friday, receiving an extraordinary gift when his girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston, accepted his proposal of marriage,\u201d his rep told Us at the time.\n\nThe pair then kept fans on their toes during their three-year-long engagement before they stunned even their closest friends by throwing a surprise wedding at their Los Angeles home on August 5, 2015.\n\n\u201cI got a good one,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight in April 2016. \u201cI got a sweet, kind man.\u201d\n\nRelive their adorable story in the video above.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-inline-f76beae2-eff0-4bef-b779-9e6c09285dc8.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-main-e865068b-555b-4e8c-82c6-1a1518dca8dd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-main-e865068b-555b-4e8c-82c6-1a1518dca8dd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/relive-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-therouxs-love-story-w469954/", "title": "Relive Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s Love Story", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jennifer Aniston found her happily ever after with husband Justin Theroux \u2014 relive their love story", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Relive Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s Love Story", "description": "Jennifer Aniston found her happily ever after with husband Justin Theroux \u2014 relive their love story", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/relive-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-therouxs-love-story-w469954/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:33:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-main-e865068b-555b-4e8c-82c6-1a1518dca8dd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-main-e865068b-555b-4e8c-82c6-1a1518dca8dd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-03-02T13:20:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:33:13+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jennifer Aniston found her happily ever after with husband Justin Theroux \u2014 relive their love story", "title": "Relive Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s Love Story", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-main-e865068b-555b-4e8c-82c6-1a1518dca8dd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488460800.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
