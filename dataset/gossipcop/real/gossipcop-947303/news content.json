The Bachelorette star Luke Pell has reportedly split from his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Holly Allen.\n\nLuke, who vied for JoJo Fletcher\u2019s affections on season 12 of the ABC dating series, rekindled his romance with Holly in March following his stint on Bachelor Winter Games. According to E! News, the pair broke up in late May due to challenges they faced after moving in together in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe reality star made headlines in February during the Winter Games\u2019 tell-all special when he had a candid, televised conversation with contestant Stassi Yaramchuk about his unresolved feelings for Holly. Although Luke and Stassi shared a whirlwind romance on the show, they split shortly after filming wrapped.\n\nSince news broke of their split, Luke and Holly have unfollowed each other on social media. The Malibu Wine Safaris tour guide seemingly opened up about the breakup via an emotional post on her Instagram Story.\n\n\u201cQuick real moment. It\u2019s not always cheesy smiles and pretty pictures. I\u2019ve walked onto airplanes with tears streaming down my face twice this month (I never cry, especially not in public.) It seems that life throws curveballs in multiples,\u201d she wrote on Tuesday, June 26. \u201cBut every blow is a reminder of all the blessings. Crappy days happen. If you\u2019re having one too, let it out and keep on truckin.\u2019\u201d\n\nSince his appearance on The Bachelorette, Luke has also been linked to Nick Viall\u2019s contender Danielle Lombard. \u201cShe\u2019s a great girl,\u201d he told Us in March 2017. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t gotten to know each other yet. We haven\u2019t had a real, proper date or anything \u2026 Some people assume it\u2019s easier to date after the show, because people know who you are and are comfortable with you already are. But I\u2019m, like, no, it\u2019s more complicated because people assume things and everything\u2019s in public.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luke-pell-holly-allen-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1686px%2C953px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luke-pell-holly-allen-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1693px%2C889px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luke-pell-holly-allen-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1693px%2C889px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-bachelorettes-luke-pell-girlfriend-holly-allen-break-up/", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s Luke Pell, Girlfriend Holly Allen Break Up", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 alum Luke Pell and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Holly Allen, are reportedly on the outs again \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s Luke Pell and GF Holly Allen Split \u2014 Again", "description": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 alum Luke Pell and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Holly Allen, are reportedly on the outs again \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-bachelorettes-luke-pell-girlfriend-holly-allen-break-up/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-27T00:03:10+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luke-pell-holly-allen-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1693px%2C889px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luke-pell-holly-allen-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1693px%2C889px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-26T23:45:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-27T00:03:10+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 alum Luke Pell and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Holly Allen, are reportedly on the outs again \u2014 get the details", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s Luke Pell and GF Holly Allen Split \u2014 Again", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/luke-pell-holly-allen-split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1693px%2C889px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530056736.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
