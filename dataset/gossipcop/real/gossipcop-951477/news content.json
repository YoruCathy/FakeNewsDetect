Shannon Beador is ready to move on from ex-husband David Beador.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County star, 54, spoke candidly about dipping her toes back in the dating pool during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cMy good friend Tamra [Judge] pulls out the stops for her friend, you\u2019ll see that,\u201d Shannon recently told Us of the upcoming RHOC season. \u201cThe whole thing is awkward to me, especially when you get set up with someone. It\u2019s all new, so new, but it\u2019s kind of exiting at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe Real for Real Cuisine creator added that while she \u201cwas hoping\u201d to double date with fellow single costar Kelly Dodd, it didn\u2019t happen. Even so, the duo have a \u201cgreat\u201d friendship this season and have \u201ccome to an understanding with each other\u201d amid their respective divorces.\n\nShannon also spoke candidly about mourning her split from David after 17 years of marriage. \u201cI shed a lot of tears those seven months. It was hard and my kids saw it too and you want to try and be as positive as you can,\u201d she explained. \u201cI just kept saying, \u2018Mom\u2019s sad. Your mom\u2019s sad.\u2019 I had to cry it out I guess. I don\u2019t know. I had to get it out of my system.\u201d The duo called it quits in December 2017, one month after announcing they had separated.\n\nThe Bravo star noted that the breakup has caused a great deal of drama. \u201cMy divorce is anything but friendly right now. There\u2019s a lot of anger, not necessarily coming from me, but there\u2019s just a lot of emotion out there,\u201d she admitted to Us. \u201cIt makes it difficult. I just keep trying to look past it and know that at some point, everything is going to be settled and over and I can completely shut that chapter in my life and move on. I\u2019m really looking forward to that day.\u201d\n\nDavid has since moved on with Lesley Cook, who he began dating shortly after Shannon filed for divorce.\n\nShannon and David have chronicled the ups and downs of their relationship on the reality series. Although David was unfaithful, the duo participated in therapy before renewing their vows in August 2016. They share three daughters: Sophie, 16, Stella, 14, and Adeline, 14.\n\nReal Housewives of Orange County season 13 premieres on Bravo Monday, July 16, at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nWith reporting by Brody Brown", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shannon-beador.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shannon-beador-david.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shannon-beador.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shannon-beador-is-dating-again-after-david-beador-divorce/", "title": "Shannon Beador Is Dating Again After David Beador Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Shannon Beador spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about getting back on the market following her split from husband of 17 years David Beador \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Shannon Beador Dishes on \u2018Awkward\u2019 Experience Dating Again After David Divorce", "description": "Shannon Beador spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about getting back on the market following her split from husband of 17 years David Beador \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shannon-beador-is-dating-again-after-david-beador-divorce/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-16T21:03:06+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shannon-beador.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shannon-beador.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Real Housewives of Orange County", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-07-16T20:33:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-16T21:03:06+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Shannon Beador spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about getting back on the market following her split from husband of 17 years David Beador \u2014 get the details", "title": "Shannon Beador Dishes on \u2018Awkward\u2019 Experience Dating Again After David Divorce", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shannon-beador.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531773196.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
