Find Out the Fate of All Your Favorite Shows\n\n\n\nAddison Agen (Team Adam)\n\nAt only 16 years old, Agen has a voice beyond her years. She also has a sound that's both all her own and similar to some of the greatest female artists ever. We wouldn't be even a little shocked if she takes home the win Tuesday night.\n\nBrooke Simpson (Team Miley)\n\nOur hearts jumped a bit when we realized Cyrus and Simpson were going to duet on \"Wrecking Ball\" during Monday's final four. Simpson's voice is a little more traditional than Cyrus', which is why \"O Holy Night\" was a perfect choice for her finale cover, and she knocked it out of the park. She is definitely a powerhouse.\n\nThe Voice, Pitch Perfect 3 Team for Your New Favorite Mash-Up\n\n\n\nChloe Kohanski (Team Blake)\n\nWhat a shame Team Miley lost this Miley 2.0 in the knockouts, because we can only imagine what those two could accomplish together. However, Sheldon has done some serious good for her too, and she's got a great unique sound.\n\nRed Marlow (Team Blake)\n\nGuys like Red Marlow have a history of winning \"The Voice,\" but there's also always a guy like Red Marlow on the show. He's fine but the ladies have outshone him regularly.\n\n(E! and NBC are both part of the NBC Universal family.)", "images": ["https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/GettyImages-1219262470.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1024px%2C576px&resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/Chicago_On_Light@3x.png?fit=486%2C102", "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/goodnews2-apr17.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/Chicago_On_Dark@3x-1.png?fit=486%2C120", "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/voiceGettyImages-895757838.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcchicago.com/2019/09/voiceGettyImages-895757838.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Piester"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/901005/the-voice-season-13-who-should-win", "title": "\u2019The Voice\u2019 Season 13 Winner: Chloe Kohanski", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Chicago", "type": "article", "description": "We\u2019ve reached another season finale of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d and with that comes a new winner.
