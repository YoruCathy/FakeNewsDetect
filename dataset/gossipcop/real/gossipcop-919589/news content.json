The couple\u2019s rep sent a statement to British newspaper The Times on Thursday addressing the affair with Italian journalist Marco Brancaccia.\n\nFilm producer Giuggioli had claimed that Brancaccia, 55, had been leaving \u201cfrightening\u201d messages for her, according to The Times. Brancaccia has denied the allegations and told people that Giuggioli, 48, was lying to conceal their affair, which took place between 2015 and 2016.\n\nThe statement obtained by The Times confirmed the couple\u2019s acknowledgment of the relationship: \u201cA few years ago Colin and Livia privately made the decision to separate. During that time Livia briefly became involved with former friend Mr. Brancaccia. The Firths have since reunited. . . . Subsequently, Mr. Brancaccia carried out a frightening campaign of harassment over several months, much of which is documented. For obvious reasons, the Firths have never had any desire to make this matter public.\u201d\n\nFirth, 57, and Giuggioli have two sons \u2014 Luca, 16, and Matteo, 15.", "images": ["https://www.newsday.com/img/newsday/newsdayLogo.svg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.22642050.1556723435!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_768/image.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43908722.1587069202!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43908034.1587085834!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43885963.1587080063!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.22642050.1556723435!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_384/image.png", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43925255.1587144510!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.17224027.1520609511!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_456/image.jpeg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43740316.1586625604!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.17224027.1520609511!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.43903156.1587058761!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_375/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.17224027.1520609511!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Bubbeo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/colin-firth-wife-livia-giuggioli-affair-1.17224028", "title": "Colin Firth\u2019s wife admits to past affair with alleged stalker", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=100%,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Oscar winner Colin Firth and his wife, Livia Giuggioli, have admitted that she had an intimate relationship with the man she later accused of stalking her, People reports.
