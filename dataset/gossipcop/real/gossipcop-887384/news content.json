He earned the season's first perfect score.\n\nDi Pace commemorated the year he left Buenos Aires to follow his artistic abilities in the United States. The \"Grease\" actor revealed he fled because of bullying and found his life-long passion as a result.\n\n\"Argentina wasn't the happiest place for me. I was heavily bullied in school,\" he said. \"I was called all kinds of things under the sun. I was beaten up and spat on, all that because I was a little different ... awkward ... artistic.\"\n\nRelated: 'Dancing With the Stars': Nancy McKeon fractures foot ahead of NYC tribute night\n\nThe actor chose to celebrate how far he's come with a fiery samba to \u201cNi Tu Ni Yo\u201d by Jennifer Lopez featuring Gente de Zona, alongside pro partner Cheryl Burke.
