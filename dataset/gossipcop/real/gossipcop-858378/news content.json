Olympios played both a villain and a heroine, a tightrope walk that defied reality TV conventions. While the self-described manager of a \u201cmultimillion-dollar company\u201d was at times rude and over-assertive, she was also self-aware and funny, with natural charisma and a talent for transparency. Olympios\u2019 sex-positive approach to camera-ready courtship may have earned her a number of nemeses, but it also gave rise to a growing fan base (#TeamCorn). While Corinne and Nick ultimately were not a love match, Olympios\u2019 fan-favorite status all but guaranteed her a second chance on the spinoff show Bachelor in Paradise. And that\u2019s when this reality-TV success story took a dark turn.\n\nIt takes a major scandal to break out of the bubble that is Bachelor Nation and into the mainstream conversation. This summer, niche Bachelor blogs and tabloid empires alike found themselves breathlessly reporting one of the biggest scandals in the franchise\u2019s 15-year history. The media frenzy began when word leaked that Bachelor in Paradise had shut down just days into its summer shoot. Paradise, a show on which ex-Bachelor and Bachelorette contestants drink and date until Chris Harrison tells them to stop, has always been wilder than its relatively buttoned-up sister shows. But according to those first reports, a sexual interaction on set had crossed the line, forcing ABC to send home the cast and crew pending further investigation.\n\nThe dalliance in question was between Olympios and DeMario Jackson, another \u201cvillain\u201d character from the latest Bachelorette season. Rumors swirled that Olympios was perhaps too intoxicated to give her consent, a hunch that appeared to be validated by Olympios\u2019 first public statement on the matter. \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4,\u201d Olympios began. \u201cAlthough I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production. As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.\u201d While Olympios initially hired a lawyer to look into the incident, she subsequently dropped the investigation after Warner Bros.\u2019 own found that no misconduct had occurred on set.\n\nIn two subsequent interviews on Good Morning America and Bachelor in Paradise, Olympios, who did not return to the show when production restarted, elaborated on her blacked-out state during the controversial hook-up, while also insisting she has no ill will toward Jackson or the show's production team. The Bachelor star went so far as to say that she was \u201csuper thankful\u201d to the producers, and felt primarily victimized not by her fellow cast mate, but by the subsequent media scrutiny. \u201cI was a victim of, you know, just being blown into the media and having people make these crazy assumptions and judgments about what happened that day,\u201d Olympios explained on Good Morning America. In an interview with The Daily Beast, Olympios reiterates: \u201cYou know, Bachelor Nation, I\u2019ll always have a lot of love for because they\u2019re like family to me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Beast from her new home in Los Angeles, Olympios says putting this scandal behind her has been both a struggle and a relief. \u201cI\u2019m just really glad that it\u2019s all kind of unfolding, that people are seeing the bigger picture, as opposed to just like \u2018media scandal in Paradise.\u2019 I\u2019m really happy that everyone\u2019s moving past it now,\u201d she croaks, explaining that she lost her voice on a recent girls\u2019 trip. Perhaps in an effort to preserve her vocal cords, Olympios declines to elaborate on the specifics of the scandal, demurring, \u201cI feel like I explained myself pretty well [on Bachelor in Paradise.]\u201d\n\nDuring that recently aired sit-down interview with host Chris Harrison, Olympios set out to tell her side of the story. \u201cI feel like people weren\u2019t really understanding because I didn\u2019t speak out for so long,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like everyone was just trying to get to the bottom of it quickly, so they were just making up whatever came to their minds. But everyone should have just waited to hear it from me.\u201d\n\nWhile Harrison and Olympios\u2019 talk dwelled on the difficult summer that Olympios has endured in the eye of the tabloid storm, she\u2019s quick to assure me that the painful-to-watch interview was actually a cathartic experience. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI was so nervous, I was afraid that there would be even more backlash, but I\u2019m really glad that it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nWhile Olympios was aware that signing up for The Bachelor would make her something of a public figure, she had no way of knowing she would become the subject of one of the summer\u2019s biggest entertainment scandals. \u201cI never thought it would be like this,\u201d Olympios reveals, explaining that the constant headlines have taken a toll on her and her loved ones. \u201cIt\u2019s never easy, especially for my friends and family, seeing this stuff in the media\u2014they\u2019ll see something in an article and be like, \u2018Is this true? What\u2019s true, what\u2019s not true?\u2019\u201d she sighs. \u201cIt was just really hard because I was trying to keep myself OK and also keep my close friends and family OK at the same time.\u201d\n\nDespite a summer from tabloid hell, Olympios is doubling down on her newfound fame with a litany of projects that ought to keep her in the public eye for more news cycles to come. She\u2019s \u201cstill in the creating process\u201d of a reality-TV show that she\u2019s reticent to speak about. But she is happy to share details of an upcoming scripted show, a collaboration between herself and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days producer Christine Peters.\n\nThe show, which will feature Olympios both in front of and behind the camera, will \u201cbe about dating in this millennial world we\u2019re in,\u201d she divulges, adding, \u201cI think people just get so worked up about creating, like, dating pages, or\u2026 I feel like it just becomes such a topic of conversation, like, \u2018Oh my God, who are you dating? What kind of guy are you going to date? Does this person even look like their picture?\u2019 I just feel like there are so many questions and new ways of dating, so it\u2019s comical in itself.\u201d Olympios plans to mine her own and her friends\u2019 romantic lives for fodder, but demurs when I ask if she\u2019s playing the field for more material. \u201cFor material? No!\u201d she laughs. \u201cI have enough material built up, believe me.\u201d\n\nOlympios is \u201cconstantly busy!\u201d with a charitable collaboration with IVI sunglasses in the works (\u201cwe\u2019re doing some really cool frames\u201d) and a relaunch of her clothing line, which she\u2019s trying to shift \u201cfrom a merch line to more of a fashion-forward line.\u201d Corn fanatics ate up the first iteration of Olympios\u2019 line, which emblazoned items with \u201cCorinneisms\u201d like \u201cPlatinum Vagine\u201d and \u201cMake America Corinne Again.\u201d By the way, Olympios swears that her controversial catchphrase isn\u2019t a political statement, and that she can\u2019t even remember how she came up with it. \u201cI wish I could tell you how that was born,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI think it was just a really long and tedious interview that I was probably doing at 4 a.m. somewhere in the world. And I was probably delusional.\u201d\n\nOn top of two new television projects and conquering the world of non-merch fashion, Olympios is writing a book that she swears will reveal the real Corinne. \u201cI really am excited for my fans to read it, because a lot of fans are like, \u2018How are you just OK all the time? How are you so you?\u2019 and it\u2019s like no, this is me letting you in,\u201d Olympios continues. \u201cI\u2019m not OK all the time. It took me a lot to get me to where I am. It took me hard times, happy times, sad times. I\u2019ve had 25 million breakdowns. It\u2019s OK to be in situations where you think that things aren\u2019t going to be OK, but they always will be. You have to stay true to yourself. So I feel like a lot of people will be able to relate to that.\u201d\n\nWhen I ask Olympios if she is working on anything else, she responds with an exuberant \u201cMyself!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really just taking my time to be with friends and family, to heal, and just really working on myself,\u201d she elaborates. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna keep doing all this great stuff, I\u2019m not going to stop, I\u2019m going to keep doing what I love, and I trust myself to lead me to the right path.\u201d\n\nOne direction that path won\u2019t be leading her toward is Nick Viall, her recently single onscreen ex. Olympios shuts down any intimations that a Nick-Corinne reunion could be in the cards (\u201cNo probably not, honestly\u201d) adding, \u201cWe\u2019re friends! I love the guy, but just as friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504582753/170905-zimmerman-corinne-olympios-hero_lwc8uv", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504582753/170905-zimmerman-corinne-olympios-hero_lwc8uv"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504582753/170905-zimmerman-corinne-olympios-hero_lwc8uv", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/corinne-olympios-on-moving-past-the-bachelor-in-paradise-sex-scandal", "title": "Corinne Olympios on Moving Past the \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Sex Scandal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Corinne Olympios on Moving Past the \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Sex Scandal", "keywords": "The Bachelorette, Chris Harrison, ABC News, Bachelor", "og": {"title": "Corinne Olympios on Moving Past the \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Sex Scandal", "description": "The contestant at the center of the biggest scandal in \u2018Bachelor\u2019 franchise history is determined to move on, despite a summer of overbearing media scrutiny.", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/corinne-olympios-on-moving-past-the-bachelor-in-paradise-sex-scandal", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504582753/170905-zimmerman-corinne-olympios-hero_lwc8uv"}, "description": "The contestant at the center of the biggest scandal in \u2018Bachelor\u2019 franchise history is determined to move on, despite a summer of overbearing media scrutiny.", "authors": "Amy Zimmerman", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2017-09-05T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/amy-zimmerman"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@ahzimm", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1504582753/170905-zimmerman-corinne-olympios-hero_lwc8uv"}, "sailthru.date": "2017-09-05T05:00:00.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2017-09-19T05:00:00.000Z", "publicationDate": 201709050500, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Amy Zimmerman\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/corinne-olympios-on-moving-past-the-bachelor-in-paradise-sex-scandal\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\",\"rubric\":\"SHE\u2019S BACK\"},\"post_id\":\"corinne-olympios-on-moving-past-the-bachelor-in-paradise-sex-scandal\",\"pub_date\":\"2017-09-05T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"tags\":[\"The Bachelorette\",\"Chris Harrison\",\"ABC News\",\"Bachelor\",\"typeArticle\"],\"title\":\"Corinne Olympios on Moving Past the \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Sex Scandal\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1mBZTRIZHo?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yf5eCBoEuAQ?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0"], "publish_date": 1504587600.0, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
