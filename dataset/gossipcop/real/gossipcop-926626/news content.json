During her appearance on Wednesday\u2019s The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the Mom star, 41, reveals that applying for private schools has been \u201cterrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went to this private school where they had all the parents sit around in a circle -- and I don\u2019t know anybody -- and there were a bunch of toys in the middle of a circle and we were supposed to pick a toy out and talk about the weather,\" she recalls of the awkward icebreaker. \"That was the only instruction.\"\n\nFaris says she viewed the exercise as therapeutic, and picked up a stuffed bear to talk about how scared she was to be doing this and her fears of rejection. She remembers speaking for a while before forcing herself to stop.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m realizing as I\u2019m saying this, I\u2019m putting my foot in my mouth, so I pass the bear on to the next person, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Well, it\u2019s pretty sunny outside for me!\u2019\u201d Faris remembers another parent touting.\n\nShe notes that the rest of the moms and dads solely commented on the weather. \u201cI wanted to run out of there so fast,\" she exclaims. \"Anyway, we got rejected.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing the story, DeGeneres quips, \u201cI could have told you that about two minutes ago!\u201d\n\nEmbarrassing moment aside, Faris knows her son is being well cared for following her split from ex Chris Pratt. \u201c[Jack]\u2019s amazing and he is so happy and sweet and he\u2019s surrounded by love,\u201d she shares.\n\nFor more on Faris and Pratt\u2019s life co-parenting Jack after their breakup, check out the clip below!\n\nKaty Perry Seemingly Nicknames Orlando Bloom This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
