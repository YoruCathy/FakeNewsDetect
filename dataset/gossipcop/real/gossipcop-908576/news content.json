{"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/28/grammy-awards-2018-ranking-the-live-performances-from-best-to-worst/", "text": "Among some of the show\u2019s more serious moments (which we didn\u2019t rank), country artists Brothers Osborne, Maren Morris and Eric Church dedicated an emotional performance of Eric Clapton\u2019s \u201cTears in Heaven\u201d to the victims of mass tragedies at recent concerts in Las Vegas and Manchester, England. Logic, Cara and Khalid performed \u201c1-800-273-8255\u201d to bring awareness to suicide prevention. And before going into the official \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment of the show, Chris Stapleton and Emmylou Harris performed Tom Petty\u2019s 1994 hit, \u201cWildflowers.\u201d (Petty died in October at 66.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe\u2019ve ranked all the other performances, from best to worst.\n\n\n\n1. Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar did not come to play around. I mean, he sort of did. He brought along Dave Chappelle to interject his performances with gems of knowledge cloaked in humor. (\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man being honest in America is being an honest black man in America.\u201d He added, \u201cIs this on cable? CBS? Because it looks like he\u2019s singing and dancing, but this brother is taking enormous chances.\u201d)\n\nThen there was the whole \u201cThis is a satire, by Kendrick Lamar\u201d message that flashed behind the Compton rapper, which came after a rather unfortunate cameo from U2. But, upshot: Chappelle got more cameos than Bono and the Edge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKendrick opened with American flags and was surrounded by dozens of dudes in Army fatigues who ended up dancing their hearts out. Among the songs he performed was his mega-banger \u201cDNA,\u201d during which it\u2019s metaphysically impossible to stay still. There was also a drummer with a giant drum that set off crazy pyrotechnics. (Ah, yes, fire, an old classic. Can\u2019t go wrong.) Solid opener, and far, far preferable to a carpool karaoke bit.\n\n2. Kesha\n\nKesha did more than just perform \u201cPraying.\u201d She made a powerful declaration in a performance that was as moving as it appeared to be cleansing for the singer, who spent years in a legal battle with Sony Music producer Dr. Luke after sexual-abuse allegations.\n\nAD\n\nFlanked by an army of women \u2014 including Andra Day, Bebe Rexha, Camila Cabello, Cyndi Lauper, Julia Michaels and the Resistance Revival Chorus \u2014 Kesha sang her heart out, belting her lyrics with dripping, raw emotion. After she finished, shaking with sobs, the audience gave her a standing ovation. The Grammy telecast showed some audience members crying. She may have been on a stage in Madison Square Garden singing for thousands, but Kesha\u2019s performance felt about as intimate as it gets.\n\nAD\n\n3. Bruno Mars and Cardi B\n\nThank heavens for these two and their resurrection of new jack swing. Bruno Mars and Cardi B, in head-to-toe Cross Colours attire, kept the \u201cIn Living Color\u201d tribute strong while performing \u201cFinesse.\u201d Cardi B wore a giant medallion around her neck, and Bruno Mars did the running man as if it were \u201cHouse Party\u201d and \u201cHouse Party 2.\u201d As to be expected with Bruno Mars, this performance was incredibly well-produced with very, very good dancing. And Cardi B just being Cardi B is enough to lift the spirits of anyone with a beating heart.\n\n4. Childish Gambino\n\nHello, Sam Smith? I hope you are taking notes. This is how you rock a white suit while singing an R&B song. And also how you sing one live.\n\nDonald Glover, a.k.a. Childish Gambino, performed \u201cTerrified\u201d with an updated-for-2018 Teddy Pendergrass vibe. (Think: A sext, actualized.) Also, this man kept his hand in his pocket nearly THE ENTIRE TIME. At the end, he wailed like the best of \u2019em as he was joined by impressive young singer JD McCrary, Glover\u2019s \u201cThe Lion King\u201d castmate, to take it home.\n\n5. Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee\n\n\u201cDespacito\u201d might have been the song of the summer, but thanks to this performance, it\u2019ll probably be stuck in our heads for the rest of winter, too. All together, everyone: Des *pause* pa *pause pause* cito.\n\nDaddy Yankee showed up with all the gold in the world around his neck, while Luis Fonsi opted for some wrinkly leather pants. The performance was underwhelming given the energy of the song, but we\u2019re commending its lack of Justin Bieber. (Remember that \u201cburrito\u201d disaster?) It probably could\u2019ve done without that backup dancer, too.\n\n6. SZA\n\nSZA sings the music of the edgy youth, a concept best captured by her outfit: a cutup cheerleader top. \u201cBroken Clocks\u201d was an unusual choice for the R&B artist to perform at the Grammys, given the immense popularity of hits \u201cLove Galore\u201d and \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d but she sang the heck out of it in front of a \u201cMatrix\u201d-esque backdrop. This performance further convinced us that SZA was #snubbed for Best New Artist.\n\n7. Lady Gaga\n\nLady Gaga transformed her piano into a giant bird, complete with feathers \u2014 so really, one of her more understated awards show performances. (Or maybe they were angel wings?) Either way, she started things off with \u201cJoanne,\u201d the title track of her latest album and a ballad that honors her late aunt, who died of lupus in 1974 at age 19.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is for my father\u2019s late sister, Joanne,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is for love and compassion, even when you can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nWhen she was done, she looked up and said \u201cTime\u2019s up,\u201d a reference to the legal fund to help fight sexual harassment and inequality in the workplace. Then she segued flawlessly into another ballad, \u201cMillion Reasons,\u201d ending it with a questionable high note.\n\nI\u2019m not too proud to admit that I\u2019ve always been a little scared of Lady GaGa, but after seeing what she did to this bird with this piano, I\u2019m petrified. #Grammys pic.twitter.com/4bxjOWF8BP \u2014 John Dedman (@JohnDedman) January 29, 2018\n\nWas it a bird or an angel that died to make @ladygaga piano?! #Grammys2018 #Grammys \u2014 Michael Dorsey BL14 (@mldorsey78) January 29, 2018\n\n8. U2\n\nWhen Camila Cabello appeared on stage and told the audience how proud she is to be a Cuban Mexican immigrant, nobody expected her to introduce U2 immediately after. In fact, the Irish rock band\u2019s performance popped up out of the blue just as its album \u201cSongs of Innocence\u201d did on everyone\u2019s iTunes libraries back in 2014.\n\nU2 sang \u201cGet Out of Your Own Way\u201d on an outdoor stage, standing in front of a screen flashing pairs of eyes a la \u201cOrange Is the New Black.\u201d Bono yelled into an American-flag-printed megaphone on a platform situated in front of the Statue of Liberty. Points for vocals, but we might subtract a few for the painfully political image.\n\n9. Jon Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. (Chuck Berry and Fats Domino tribute)\n\nTribute performances can be tricky undertakings, but John Batiste and Gary Clark Jr. did a fine job paying homage to Chuck Berry and Fats Domino \u2014 and in doing so, reminded all the nominated young \u2018uns about the roots of American popular music.\n\nBatiste impressively tickled those ivories, and the two rocked out in proper fashion while playing \u201cMaybellene.\u201d Well done, gentlemen.\n\n10. DJ Khaled, Rihanna and Bryson Tiller\n\nEven Her Royal Highness Robyn Rihanna Fenty\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t enough to save this performance from being a bit of a disaster. Rihanna work, work, work, work, worked while DJ Khaled yelled a bunch of nonsense, ranging from \u201cSing it!\u201d (duh, she is) to \u201cThis the Grammys!\u201d (duh, we know). He bumped this performance down a notch each time he decided to open his mouth. Bryson Tiller showed up for a hot second, too, but he was hidden by a bunch of finger-wave-sporting backup dancers who looked as though a police raid had forced them out of the speakeasy.\n\n11. Little Big Town\n\nDressed as always in coordinated outfits (but with a bit more sparkle this time), country music\u2019s most harmonious quartet delivered a pleasingly solid performance of \u201cBetter Man.\u201d Upon release in 2016, the song\u2019s writer was kept a closely guarded secret until they revealed that it was none other than TAYLOR SWIFT, who wrote the song by herself but felt that it might fit the group\u2019s sound. (Indeed, the lyrics have Taylor written all over them, including a reference to being wide-awake at 4 a.m. thinking about a lost love.) Vocalist Karen Fairchild took the lead on this ballad about a toxic relationship, which already won best country group/duo vocal in the Grammys pre-telecast.\n\n12. Elton John and Miley Cyrus\n\nElton John is notable for his ability to command the stage from the seat of a piano. In a characteristically sparkly jacket with \u201cElton\u201d emblazoned on the back, he sang along to \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d with Miley Cyrus, who is clearly working very, very hard to create her image as a Serious Performer. Whatever Elton gave us, Cyrus took away, as she dragged the performance down with some off-key notes spattered throughout.\n\n13. Pink\n\nYou may remember Pink swinging from a trapeze at a previous Grammys show \u2014 here she is in grocery-shopping clothes! And just standing behind a microphone and not scaling a building, as she did at the American Music Awards. Granted, this was one of her more serious songs; \u201cWild Hearts Can\u2019t Be Broken\u201d was originally written for a movie about the suffragette movement. At the end, the camera panned to her young daughter for a certifiably Adorable Grammy Moment\u2122.\n\n14. Ben Platt and Patti LuPone\n\nRemember when that a cappella group in \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d wouldn\u2019t let Ben Platt perform? Normally, that would have seemed like a remarkably silly move. Platt has the voice of a young angel. But his rendition tonight of \u201cSomewhere\u201d from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d can best be described as textbook, in that it was technically perfect but kind of boring. It instead got us thinking about whom we\u2019d cast in Steven Spielberg\u2019s upcoming adaptation of the musical. Get James Corden as far away from that as possible.\n\nSpeaking of Tonys, Broadway legend Patti Lupone\u2019s performance of \u201cDon\u2019t Cry for Me Argentina\u201d went on and on and on. Was it great? Sure. Was it right for the Grammys? Probably not. But LuPone can do whatever she wants, and the audience will listen intently.\n\n15. Sting and Shaggy\n\nThe Grammys are very pleased with themselves that they transported the show from Los Angeles all the way to New York, so to celebrate, they brought Sting out for a perfectly passable but dull rendition of \u201cEnglishman in New York.\u201d Then Shaggy arrived to increase the weirdness factor because these two recently collaborated on an album together. Your guess is as good as ours.\n\n16. Sam Smith\n\nDressed in an outfit best described as Boyz II Men meets pajama chic, Sam Smith stood still on stage and reminded us all that we should\u2019ve gone to church this morning. Seriously, this performance was full of finger wagging and disappointed head nods that would put a grandmother to shame. But who is Smith to tell us what to do if he didn\u2019t even make sure the choir was lit properly?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhich black choir has Sam Smith kidnapped now \u2014 Shakira (@jodecicry) January 29, 2018", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/5bd13033-50c2-4ef3-a231-2f9d3ef43dcc.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Eu3iYH4AAOOaEif1q6vaFGCHM_g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NS75RJNZFQYXPM6TN6FDEQFEQ4.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/9624aab6-2742-4553-9ae0-96a331f3e138.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Eu3iYH4AAOOaEif1q6vaFGCHM_g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NS75RJNZFQYXPM6TN6FDEQFEQ4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer", "Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture", "Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/28/grammy-awards-2018-ranking-the-live-performances-from-best-to-worst/", "title": "Grammy Awards 2018: Ranking the performances from best to worst", "meta_data": {"description": "From Kendrick Lamar to Bruno Mars, we picked who did the best at the 60th annual awards.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/28/grammy-awards-2018-ranking-the-live-performances-from-best-to-worst/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Eu3iYH4AAOOaEif1q6vaFGCHM_g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NS75RJNZFQYXPM6TN6FDEQFEQ4.jpg", "title": "Analysis | The 2018 Grammy performances ranked, from best to worst", "description": "From Kendrick Lamar to Bruno Mars, we picked who did the best at the 60th annual awards."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analysis | The 2018 Grammy performances ranked, from best to worst", "description": "From Kendrick Lamar to Bruno Mars, we picked who did the best at the 60th annual awards."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-26T00:16:41.218Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517068800.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
