Nikki Bella is going to find that out very soon.\n\n\u201cThis year was really fun because I hosted Thanksgiving for the first time and I\u2019m going to do the same for Christmas and it\u2019s fun because my daughter actually starts to care about some stuff around the holidays, so I can have those moments with her,\u201d Brie Bella told Us exclusively at Jingle Ball 2018 in New York City on Friday, December 7, adding, \u201cand, you know, feed Nikki a ton of wine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Santa better bring me something to your house!\u201d Nikki chimed in. \u201cI need diamond earrings.\u201d\n\nBrie, 35, and her husband, Daniel Bryan, welcomed their daughter, Birdie, in May 2017. \u201cThe greatest feeling in the world!!!\u201d she captioned a photo later that week. \u201cCan\u2019t even express the love I feel for her \ud83d\udc97 from the moment I saw her I was in love.\u201d Birdie will be 1 and a half years old around the holidays.\n\nNikki\u2019s Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve traditions will also be different this year. The Total Bellas star, 35, and John Cena called off their engagement in April 2018, ending their six-year relationship.\n\nThe twin plans on living the single life this holiday season. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to really enjoy the single life properly,\u201d the wrestler told Us exclusively at Jingle Ball. \u201cIt\u2019s hard being a single girl. Over the holidays, I\u2019m really looking forward to wandering into some bars and being a single girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another,\u201d the couple told Us in a statement at the time. \u201cWe ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.\u201d\n\nThe professional wrestlers attempted to reconcile, but ultimately called it quits for good in July.\n\n\u201cAfter I called off the engagement, we tried to work on our relationship to get back to where it was in order to move forward with our wedding,\u201d Nikki explained in a statement to Us at the time. \u201cAfter much time and soul-searching alone, and together, we have decided to officially part ways. I had a beautiful and loving six-year relationship with a wonderful man. I have the utmost respect for John, but I know this is what\u2019s best for me.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C1418px%2C745px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C37px%2C1418px%2C801px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C1418px%2C745px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlin Cubria"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nikki-brie-bella-christmas-plans-include-wine-and-kids/", "title": "Nikki and Brie Bella\u2019s Holiday Plans Include \u2018a Ton of Wine\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Total Bellas' Nikki and Brie Bella's revealed exclusively to Us Weekly that their Christmas plans include 'a ton of wine - details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nikki and Brie Bella\u2019s Holiday Plans Include \u2018a Ton of Wine\u2019", "description": "Total Bellas' Nikki and Brie Bella's revealed exclusively to Us Weekly that their Christmas plans include 'a ton of wine - details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nikki-brie-bella-christmas-plans-include-wine-and-kids/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C1418px%2C745px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C1418px%2C745px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Holidays With Us", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-12-09T15:21:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Total Bellas' Nikki and Brie Bella's revealed exclusively to Us Weekly that their Christmas plans include 'a ton of wine - details", "title": "Nikki and Brie Bella\u2019s Holiday Plans Include \u2018a Ton of Wine\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nikki-and-Brie-Bella.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C1418px%2C745px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@KCubes"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544368919.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
