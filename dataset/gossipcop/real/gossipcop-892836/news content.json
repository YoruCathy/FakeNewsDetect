I was never going to be alone with him. And I\u2019m pretty happy I had that instinct, because that could have well been me chopped up in the trunk of his car,\u201d says Backderf, audibly shivering as he alludes to the gruesome fate of Dahmer\u2019s 19-year-old first victim, Steven Hicks.\n\nWe are talking because Backderf\u2019s acclaimed 2012 graphic novel, My Friend Dahmer, has been adapted into a well-received movie, featuring a chilling performance by ex-Disney star and singer Ross Lynch as the teenage Dahmer, spiralling towards the abyss.\n\nWhen Backderf visited the set, the unnerving accuracy of Lynch\u2019s transformation made it hard for him to talk to the actor when he was in costume. \u201cHe just reminded me so much of Jeff. It was spooky.\u201d\n\nThis was undoubtedly enhanced by writer-director Marc Meyers\u2019s decision to film scenes at Dahmer\u2019s actual boyhood home in Bath, Ohio, which today is owned by a musician-friend of Backderf\u2019s. The house is where Dahmer became a murderer, and Backderf admits that he didn\u2019t think they would film there.\n\n\u201cI understand why they did, especially on an indie-film budget,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s sacred ground, and I kept telling them, \u2018You really can\u2019t lose sight of that. You can never lose sight, making this movie, where it ends.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d\n\nDahmer\u2019s house was around eight miles from Backderf\u2019s, and when they were juniors their paths mainly crossed at school, as lab partners and whatnot.\n\n\u201cThe problem with our town was it was a rural town, and there were these country roads that were not safe to bike on with long distances, so you were limited to kids in your immediate area to be friends with. So we were not going to really become friends. And I don\u2019t know whether I had any interest in becoming his friend at that point.\u201d\n\nWhen they reached high school, Dahmer changed. Previously quiet, he started throwing fake fits and doing a mocking impression of a local interior designer with cerebral palsy (Backderf later discovered that in fact he was copying his own mother, who was known to have mental health issues).\n\nIn the film, Backderf and his friends are fascinated by this behaviour and recruit him, forming the Dahmer Fan Club, with Backderf as its minister for propaganda. In reality, Dahmer came to them, claims the cartoonist.\n\n\u201cThe film strikes a different tone than what it really was, which was that he was a very willing participant in all of this. He loved every minute of it.\u201d\n\nDahmer \u201cinserted himself\u201d into their group, bringing a \u201cweirdness to the table\u201d that they \u201cwholeheartedly embraced\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were bored stiff,\u201d recalls Backderf, \u201cand just looking to get through the day, and Jeff was entertainment. He was a little bit dangerous, he was a little bit unpredictable, and that was fun for us.\u201d\n\nHe insists they weren\u2019t as casually cruel as the film suggests. \u201c[Meyers] makes my character a little meaner than I was in real life. I wasn\u2019t a mean kid. I certainly was not empathetic, I don\u2019t know many 17-year-olds that are. I don\u2019t shy away from my role in this, and never have, but the truth is that we were all kind of doing it together.\u201d\n\nThey joined in the disablist mockery (\u201cThat\u2019s hard to explain away\u2026 pretty inexcusable by any stretch of the imagination. But I chalk it up just to being 17 and being an idiot\u201d), tried to hide Dahmer in plain sight in school club group photographs, placed drawings of him wherever they could. It was a laugh, until it wasn\u2019t \u2013 Dahmer started drinking heavily and grew noticeably darker, frightening Backderf so much that he eventually \u201cwrote Jeff off\u201d.\n\nDahmer\u2019s arrest years later threw Backderf into a state of confusion. \u201cWith a snap of a finger, my entire personal history changed\u2026 Suddenly all these silly things, all of this stuff that we did as teenagers, it becomes something very different. It becomes very dark, almost dangerous.\u201d\n\nUnknown to him, while they were playing, Dahmer had been secretly struggling with his emerging homosexuality, and necrophiliac urges that scared and repulsed him to such an extent that he\u2019d tried to tamp them down with alcohol.\n\nPut into context his \u201cbehaviour at school became very chilling,\u201d says Backderf, \u201cbecause he was perfecting the tools that he would use to become such a lethal killer. The ability to vanish. The ability to not give anything away and to charm people. The ability to hide everything that was going on in his head.\n\n\u201cAll those things he perfected when he was very young through our goofball antics, he used them when he was a monster. That\u2019s a little hard to live with.\u201d\n\nBackderf doesn\u2019t believe the course Dahmer\u2019s life took was inevitable, though, and his question has always been: where were the adults? Dahmer\u2019s behaviour was bizarre, and his drinking was obvious to everyone, but no one in authority intervened.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t care. They just pushed him along and figured, \u2018Well, next year he\u2019ll be somebody else\u2019s problem.\u2019 And of course he was somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nHe could easily have been Backderf\u2019s. When he put the timeline of Dahmer\u2019s activities together for the graphic novel, he was shocked to discover that he and his friends had been nearby when Dahmer had killed Hicks and cut up his corpse. \u201cWe were all around it at various points, in some cases mere yards away. That was a little tough to process.\u201d\n\nWhile Dahmer would go on to kill again and again, it is the slaughter of Hicks that resonates most with Backderf.\n\n\u201cHe haunts me still,\u201d he says sadly. \u201cI think about him from time to time.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t know each other, as Hicks went to a different school, \u201cbut he was like so many kids that I knew,\u201d says Backderf. \u201cJust kind of this affable rock\u2019n\u2019roller who just wanted to smoke a little weed, listen to some music, have a beer, hang out with friends, and his life was snuffed out just because he took a ride with the wrong guy. It was just so arbitrary.\u201d\n\nIt took him a long time to deal with the truth about his friendship with Dahmer, and the role he\u2019d unwittingly played in encouraging parts of his pathology. He didn\u2019t start writing about it until after Dahmer was beaten to death in prison in 1994.\n\nSeeing their relationship recreated on screen (Alex Wolff plays him in the film) has been surreal. \u201cBut in a long list of things that are surreal about this story, it\u2019s just another entry,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cAt this point, after 25 years, I just kind of shrug and say, \u2018Well that was weird\u2019, and move on. It doesn\u2019t really have an impact on me anymore.\u201d\n\nListening to him talking about Hicks, however, it seems clear that not all of the wounds have healed.\n\n\u2018My Friend Dahmer\u2019 is in cinemas on 1 June; \u2018My Friend Dahmer\u2019 by Derf Backderf is published by Abrams ComicArts", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/30/12/my-friend-dahmer-0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/30/12/my-friend-dahmer-0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephen Applebaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/my-friend-dahmer-john-backderf-film-jeffrey-comic-book-interview-serial-killer-a8375866.html", "title": "'There was always a darkness about him': My Friend Dahmer author John Backderf on growing up with a serial killer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/my-friend-dahmer-john-backderf-film-jeffrey-comic-book-interview-serial-killer-a8375866.html", "title": "'There was always a darkness about him': My Friend Dahmer author John Backderf on growing up with a serial killer", "description": "The comic book artist known as Derf went to the same school as Jeffrey Dahmer.
