Abrams is working on with the upcoming Episode IX. No release dates have been set for the series from the HBO power duo.\n\n\u201cIn the summer of 1977 we traveled to a galaxy far, far away, and we\u2019ve been dreaming of it ever since,\u201d Benioff and Weiss said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are honored by the opportunity, a little terrified by the responsibility, and so excited to get started as soon as the final season of Game of Thrones is complete.\u201d\n\nBenioff and Weiss' Star Wars involvement immediately puts the future of HBO's controversial slave drama Confederate in question. The duo were set to write and serve as showrunners on the straight-to-series drama alongside Nichelle Tramble Spellman (Justified, The Good Wife) and Malcolm Spellman (Empire), who will also serve as writers.\n\nThe concept of the show \u2014 which takes place in an alternate timeline where the Southern states have successfully seceded from the Union, giving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution \u2014 immediately drew controversy. That series was eyed to launch in either 2018 or 2019, after Benioff and Weiss completed their work on the final season of Thrones.\n\nWith the delay of Thrones' final season as well as their involvement in Star Wars \u2014 for which there is no timetable \u2014 the future of the project remains murky. HBO did not immediately respond for comment on the future of Confederate.\n\nDuring a Disney earnings call Tuesday, Disney CEO Bob Iger said talks with Benioff and Weiss, repped by CAA, had been ongoing \"for a long time.\"\n\n\"They have an idea for number of films and at some later date I'm sure we'll disclose to all of you just what those are,\" Iger said. \"They are focused on a point in time in the Star Wars mythology and taking it from there.\"\n\nNext up on the docket for Lucasfilm is Solo: A Star Wars Story (due out May 25), followed by Episode IX (Dec. 20, 2019).", "images": ["https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/blogs/promoflag-thr-latest-news.png?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-grey.png?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2017/07/d.b._weiss_and_david_benioff_photo_taken_by_art_streiber_-_august_-_h_2017_0.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2020/04/hikari_molly_smith_metzler__cover_art_of_dan_and_sam_split-h_2020.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2020/04/shailene_woodley_-_getty_-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/d.b._weiss_and_david_benioff_photo_taken_by_art_streiber_-_august_-_h_2017_0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/07/d.b._weiss_and_david_benioff_photo_taken_by_art_streiber_-_august_-_h_2017_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aaron Couch Lesley Goldberg", "Aaron Couch", "Lesley Goldberg", "Aaron.Couch Thr.Com", "Lesley.Goldberg Thr.Com", "Brian Davids", "Borys Kit", "Phil Pirrello", "Richard New", "Graeme Mcmillan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/game-thrones-creators-tackling-new-star-wars-films-1082388", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Creators to Write New 'Star Wars' Film Series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "David Benioff and D.B.
