Roselyn S\u00e1nchez certainly doesn\u2019t think so. The Puerto Rican actress recently came under fire from fans who criticized her for hosting the Latin Grammys just weeks after giving birth to her son, Dylan Gabriel.\n\nIn a post to her Instagram page, the \u201cDevious Maids\u201d star reminded social media that she\u2019s got the whole \u201cworking mom\u201d thing on lock, is a bit too busy for their opinions.\n\nThe whole thing started when S\u00e1nchez posted a photo of herself glamming and ramping up to host the Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nAmanecida.. acabada! Con ojeras y stress.. pero ah\u00ed vamos ?? Getting ready to host the Latin Grammy\u2019s. Vegas here we come.. con beb\u00e9 y to\u2019! pic.twitter.com/u4Ba09O2vG \u2014 Roselyn Sanchez (@Roselyn_Sanchez) November 13, 2017\n\nTons flooded her Twitter and Instagram with comments of how excited they were for her.\n\nAhhh y yo estoy s\u00faper contenta que tu eres una de las presentadoras, boricua power. \u2014 pam.?? (@demilyangels) November 13, 2017\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super happy you\u2019re one of the presenters. Boricua Power,\u201d wrote a fan.\n\nBella! Eres una inspiraci\u00f3n! Arriba Boricua con bebe y to\u2019!!?? \u2014 Yari Juliano Chaar (@Yariju) November 14, 2017\n\nAnother celebrated S\u00e1nchez, saying, \u201cBeautiful! You\u2019re an inspiration! Arriba Boricua, and with a baby and everything!\u201d\n\nStill, some were quick to remind her that she\u2019d been in the delivery room just two weeks before and told her to stay home.\n\n??? ni\u00f1aaa acabas de tener al beb\u00e9 , qu\u00e9date tranquila en casa. \u2014 Giannina Antinori (@Giannin93046740) November 14, 2017\n\n\u201cNi\u00f1a, you just had the baby, stay relaxed at home,\u201d one fan wrote to the actress.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before S\u00e1nchez reacted to the comments with a video telling fans there\u2019s no reason to worry.\n\nEverything under control! Don\u2019t worry mi gente\u2026 It\u2019s going to be great and a lot of fun. Pasito a pasito suave suavecito! Promise!! Baby Dylan Gabriel est\u00e1 conmigo!! Tranquilito\u2026 ?? A post shared by roselyn sanchez (@roselyn_sanchez) on Nov 15, 2017 at 12:29pm PST\n\nI mean, just because she\u2019s the mom of a newborn it doesn\u2019t mean she has to stop the hustle.\n\nS\u00e1nchez patiently took some time from rehearsals to explain to fans and critics that she and baby Dylan are totally fine, and she\u2019s ready to host the show.\n\n\u201cI have read comments on my social media that show there are a lot of people worried. They tell me, \u2018Roselyn, take care of yourself. You just had a baby and it\u2019s dangerous. You have to rest for 40 days.\u2019 You are absolutely right, but I already committed,\u201d say says in the video.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m not 100 percent recovered, but I feel good. I promise you that I\u2019m taking care of myself. The baby is at the hotel with his two nannies and he is calm. Everything is Okay, so don\u2019t worry. We are going to do the show tomorrow. It\u2019s going to come out great. I\u2019m doing it with a lot of love for all my people in Puerto Rico. To represent my country, I\u2019ll make the sacrifice. Pray for me. The show will be spectacular,\u201d she continues.\n\nIn the lead up to the awards show, S\u00e1nchez has been flaunting her #workingmom skills and ability to get back in the saddle.\n\nToday is going to be crazy amazing!! Pero lo primero es primero\u2026 nursing baby Dylan to start my day right! ???? #latingrammys #workingmom #agradecida #pa\u2019lante #?? A post shared by roselyn sanchez (@roselyn_sanchez) on Nov 16, 2017 at 7:35am PST\n\nBefore the show, S\u00e1nchez posted a photo of her nursing (because clearly anyone\u2019s opinion about where/how she breastfeeds doesn\u2019t phase her in the least bit).\n\n\u201cToday is going to be crazy amazing! Pero lo primero es primero\u2026 [but first things first] nursing baby Dylan to start my day right! #latingrammys #workingmom,\u201d Sanches wrote in the post.\n\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s response to critics is a reflection of the various expectations that tend to hold back so many of today\u2019s working moms. In a world where things like the motherhood penalty and the fatherhood bonus are very much alive and well, S\u00e1nchez serves as a face representing millions of women dispelling the harmful patterns that prevent mothers from getting paid equally and moving forward in their careers. Gotta love a badass Latina who knows how to juggle many hats and keep up the good fight!\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommend this story to your friends by clicking the share button below!", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=981841528666204&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d18ufwot1963hr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/26090201/BHlogo.png", "https://d18ufwot1963hr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/17231154/Woman.jpg", "https://dd2d9j2i66w9u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/02103344/banner-05.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KNDAJyf-PrtnR.gif", "https://d18ufwot1963hr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/26094737/mitu_logo.png", "https://d18ufwot1963hr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/09/26090015/MiTu_logo_black-1.png"], "top_img": "https://d18ufwot1963hr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/17231154/Woman.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Port\u00e9e"], "canonical_link": "https://fierce.wearemitu.com/entertainment/internet-slamming-roselyn-sanchez-hosting-latin-grammys-weeks-giving-birth-just-shut/", "title": "Roselyn S\u00e1nchez Criticized For Hosting Latin Grammys After Giving Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "The Puerto Rican actress recently came under fire from fans who criticized her for hosting the\u00a0Latin Grammys last night just weeks after giving birth", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Internet Came For Roselyn S\u00e1nchez For Hosting The Latin Grammys Weeks After Giving Birth And She Graciously Shut It Down", "description": "Are working women supposed to surrender to the limits society shoves onto them the minute they become moms?
