They are waiting for tests results to come back and then they would know more.\"\n\nNewshub.", "images": ["https://www.newshub.co.nz/common/clientlibs/assets/newshub/imgs/other/newshub.seo.logo.png", "https://www.newshub.co.nz/common/clientlibs/assets/newshub/imgs/ui/logo-desktop.svg", "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1526099888368/Getty_abby-lee-miller_190418_1120.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1526099888368/Getty_abby-lee-miller_190418_1120.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Newshub Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis.html", "title": "Dance Moms reportedly cancelled due to Abby Lee Miller's cancer diagnosis", "meta_data": {"description": "Abby Lee Miller is currently receiving treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "uumI2OyeOotXTsQTpam2IRld56y7UffZn_SC9xkj8Jo", "hideAds": "false", "keyword": "entertainment,tv-shows,united-states", "adTargeting": "sect1=entertainment>sect2=dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis>tags=entertainment,tv-shows,united-states>article-content-type=pics>pagetype=content", "designPath": "/common/", "commonDesignPath": "/common/", "og": {"title": "Dance Moms reportedly cancelled due to Abby Lee Miller's cancer diagnosis", "description": "Abby Lee Miller is currently receiving treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.", "type": "article", "site_name": "Newshub", "url": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis/_jcr_content/par/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1526099888368/Getty_abby-lee-miller_190418_1120.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1120, "height": 640}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-12T16:38:19+12:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-12T16:38:08+12:00", "section": "Entertainment"}, "sitename": "newshub", "brandname": "newshub", "pageName": "entertainment:2018:05:dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller's-cancer-diagnosis", "pageType": "content", "primaryContentType": "pics", "articleId": "dance-moms-reportedly-cancelled-due-to-abby-lee-miller-s-cancer-diagnosis", "articleTitle": "Dance Moms reportedly cancelled due to Abby Lee Miller's cancer diagnosis", "articleCategory": "entertainment", "breadcrumb": "Entertainment>2018>05>Dance Moms reportedly cancelled due to Abby Lee Miller's cancer diagnosis", "endpoint": "Newshub Web", "mwEnableHeaderBidding": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewshubNZ", "title": "Dance Moms reportedly cancelled due to Abby Lee Miller's cancer diagnosis | Newshub", "description": "Abby Lee Miller is currently receiving treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma."}, "fb": {"pages": 314879818534}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526099899.0, "source": "https://www.newshub.co.nz", "summary": ""}
