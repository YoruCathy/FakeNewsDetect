Don\u2019t be so bloody grand!\"\n\nShe also speaks affectionately about her late brother Mark Shand who died in 2014 after a fall in New York.\n\n\"Mark always wanted something. When I heard his voice on the phone saying 'Camillsy', I knew immediately that he wanted something. But God, I miss him,\" she said.\n\nIn the UK she relaxes by spending time in her own home, Ray Mill in Wiltshire, where she scrambles breakfast eggs on her Aga, and entertains her five grandchildren.\n\nShe is a fan of Nordic noir crime shows on television and reads Robert Harris novels and books from the Booker Prize list. She is also devoted to her Jack Russells Beth and Bluebell.", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/28/11/camilla2805.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/28/11/camilla2805.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robert Jobson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/camilla-i-was-prisoner-in-my-own-home-after-prince-charles-affair-exposed-a3550951.html", "title": "Camilla: I was prisoner in my own home after Prince Charles affair exposed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#dc062b", "og": {"url": "http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/camilla-i-was-prisoner-in-my-own-home-after-prince-charles-affair-exposed-a3550951.html", "title": "Camilla was 'prisoner in own home' after Charles affair exposed", "description": "The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken publicly for the first time about the anguish she suffered when her affair with Prince Charles was revealed.\u00a0 In a rare interview, she told the Mail on Sunday how she became a prisoner in her own home due to public animosity towards her.", "updated_time": "2017-05-28T11:19:56+01:00", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/28/11/camilla2805.jpg", "site_name": "Evening Standard", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "fb": {"pages": 165348596842143, "app_id": 193840110715213, "admins": 36903991}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/3550951"}, "description": "The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken publicly for the first time about the anguish she suffered when her affair with Prince Charles was revealed.\u00a0 In a rare interview, she told the Mail on Sunday how she became a prisoner in her own home due to public animosity towards her.", "keywords": "Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Charles, UK, News", "article": {"tag": "Duchess of Cornwall", "published_time": "2017-05-28T11:12:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-28T11:19:56+01:00", "publisher": 165348596842143, "section": "UK", "author_name": "Robert Jobson", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 366, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 5, "external_link_count": 1}, "twitter": {"title": "Camilla was 'prisoner in own home' after Charles affair exposed", "description": "The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken publicly for the first time about the anguish she suffered when her affair with Prince Charles was revealed.\u00a0 In a rare interview, she told the Mail on Sunday how", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@standardnews"}, "google-site-verification": "fI_fn7lv1QlqGWXMIJoqDICBG1ynAC0UDsrriO8e_m8", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Evening Standard"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495966320.0, "source": "https://www.standard.co.uk", "summary": ""}
