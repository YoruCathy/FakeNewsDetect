Nearly a week later, she shared another picture of at Florida\u2019s Jacksonville Zoo, writing, \u201cShould we talk about the elephant in the room\u2026?\u201d\n\nShould we talk about the elephant in the room\u2026? A post shared by Kathryn Palmer (@kathrynpalmerr) on Apr 14, 2017 at 4:06pm PDT\n\nYes, we should. \u201cWe enjoy getting to know each other and have fun hanging out,\u201d Hayes, 28, exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cShe\u2019s a super sweet girl, but there\u2019s nothing too serious going on. We\u2019re definitely not dating.\u201d\n\nAfter all, Hayes, originally from Jacksonville, Florida, is still in contention for ABC\u2019s Bachelor in Paradise this summer. \u201cShe knows that\u2019s in the cards for me,\u201d explains the model, who considers himself single. \u201cIf that happens, we don\u2019t want any drama between us.\u201d\n\nThe Florida State alums \u2014 he graduated in 2011; she started in 2012 \u2014 were introduced by her mom and a mutual friend who knows Hayes\u2019 sister. While in Fort Lauderdale for an event, he invited her to hang out. \u201cWe have a mutual knowledge of reality TV, so it\u2019s fun to talk to her about that and share our experiences,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re Florida born and raised, so we have a lot in common.\u201d\n\n\n\nReality TV\u2019s Breakout Stars\n\nBut long distance isn\u2019t appealing to either of them. Hayes recently moved into Bachelorette alum Jef Holm\u2019s Venice Beach pad with best friend Chase McNary while Palmer, who recently competed on AYTO season five, is in Tallahassee \u2014 for now, at least. \u201cShe wants to move out to L.A. and that was something she wanted to do before I met her,\u201d the former competitive swimmer tells Us. \u201cShe wants to get a house out here with Shannon [Duffy] and Carolina [Duarte] from her show, which I encouraged. I\u2019d love to hang out with her here. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/robby-hayes-kathryn-palme-zoom-7f03d999-dab8-4c2f-9397-cdd02abaa34b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1537px%2C806px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/robby-hayes-kathryn-palme-zoom-f9fcdea5-ea93-4159-b4e7-8263d69ec9c0.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/robby-hayes-kathryn-palme-zoom-7f03d999-dab8-4c2f-9397-cdd02abaa34b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1537px%2C806px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jamie Blynn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/is-bachelorettes-robby-hayes-dating-mtvs-kathryn-palmer-w477679/", "title": "Is Bachelorette's Robby Hayes Dating MTV's Kathryn Palmer?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Are Bachelorette\u2019s Robby Hayes and 'Are You The One?' star Kathryn Palmer an item?
