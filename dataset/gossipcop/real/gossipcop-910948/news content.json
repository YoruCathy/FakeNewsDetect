And he wants to clear the air.\n\nThe dancer, who became a viral sensation during Katy Perry\u2019s halftime show three years ago for seemingly botching the choreography, broke his silence to NPR and insisted his performance was intentional.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s a set choreography. There\u2019s also what\u2019s called freestyle choreography, or like you get to move around or play your character as a dancer, right?\u201d the dancer, Bryan Gaw, told NPR.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Well I\u2019m gonna play a different character \u2026 this is an underdog. It\u2019s an everyday person.\u201d\n\nGaw, who toured with Perry for five years, left the road about a year ago and is now a hair stylist in West Hollywood.\n\nDuring his 2015 performance, which became one of the most talked-about moments during Super Bowl halftime history, so-called \u201cRight Shark\u201d seemed to follow the choreography with Perry, while \u201cLeft Shark\u201d seemed off, flailing and spinning around in circles.\n\nGaw\u2019s character became an internet sensation overnight, with #LeftShark trending all over social media. But Gaw said he didn\u2019t reveal his identity or give any interviews at the time because he didn\u2019t draw attention away from Perry.\n\nBut today he wants people to know it\u2019s not a bad thing to dance to the beat of your own drum.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take life so seriously,\u201d Gaw advised. \u201cI was on the biggest stage in the world, acting crazy, and I got a lot of press and a lot of attention for it, in the most positive ways. It\u2019s great. Be you. Do you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. Nobody has to be perfect in life,\u201d he told NPR.\n\nNo word on if Justin Timberlake, who is performing during Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show, has plans for dancers in giant animal costumes to join him on stage.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_klg_superbowl_giveaway_180123_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_05/1314634/katy-perry-sharks-today-180131-tease_a620473a9a46c772dea5baab2ef52344.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_05/1314634/katy-perry-sharks-today-180131-tease_a620473a9a46c772dea5baab2ef52344.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/left-shark-katy-perry-halftime-show-i-didn-t-flub-t122060", "title": "'Left Shark' on Katy Perry halftime show: I didn't flub it!", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/left-shark-katy-perry-halftime-show-i-didn-t-flub-t122060", "title": "\u2018Left Shark' breaks silence on Katy Perry halftime show: I didn\u2019t flub it", "description": "The \"Left Shark\" dancer from Katy Perry's 2015 Super Bowl halftime show revealed in a new interview with NPR that his big viral moment wasn't actually a mistake.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_05/1314634/katy-perry-sharks-today-180131-tease_a620473a9a46c772dea5baab2ef52344.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_05/1314634/katy-perry-sharks-today-180131-tease_a620473a9a46c772dea5baab2ef52344.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_05/1314634/katy-perry-sharks-today-180131-tease_a620473a9a46c772dea5baab2ef52344.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "\u2018Left Shark' breaks silence on Katy Perry halftime show: I didn\u2019t flub it", "description": "The \"Left Shark\" dancer from Katy Perry's 2015 Super Bowl halftime show revealed in a new interview with NPR that his big viral moment wasn't actually a mistake.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The \"Left Shark\" dancer from Katy Perry's 2015 Super Bowl halftime show revealed in a new interview with NPR that his big viral moment wasn't actually a mistake.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_05/1314634/katy-perry-sharks-today-180131-tease_a620473a9a46c772dea5baab2ef52344.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517423880.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
