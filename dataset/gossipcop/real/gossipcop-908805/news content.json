This year\u2019s Hollywood cover featuressome of film and television\u2019s most iconic and beloved women (and the roster of men\u2014Han Solo, anyone?\u2014isn\u2019t too shabby, either). Unsurprisingly, managing to assemble the group of 13 cover stars for the ultra-glam, white-tie-and-shimmery-gown shoot was no simple feat.\n\nPhotograph by Annie Leibovitz.\n\nPhotographed in Los Angeles and New York by Annie Leibovitz, this year\u2019s cover marks the last one in the 25-year tenure of Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter. And yes, Carter\u2014nestled between Wonder Woman herself, Gal Gadot, and New York institution Robert De Niro\u2014appears on the cover for the first time ever. \u201cWe wanted to celebrate all things Graydon on this cover,\u201d V.F. creative director (fashion and style) Jessica Diehl explained. Said Annie Leibovitz, \u201cIn honor of Graydon, we went to the full white-tie . . . which is his style.\u201d\n\nPart of the fun of soaking up a Vanity Fair Hollywood cover is imagining what went on during the photo session. Who whispered to whom? Who made whom laugh? Who exchanged phone numbers and followed each other on Instagram the next day? This year, our Hollywood Portfolio is composed of photos from behind the scenes of the shoot. \u201cIt\u2019s an insider look into the magic of what goes on at this special cover shoot,\u201d said Jane Sarkin, V.F. features editor. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a very closed set.\u201d We get to see Tom Hanks crack up Oprah and Reese Witherspoon (perhaps pitching himself for an arc on the second season of Big Little Lies?). We get to see Nicole Kidman have her luminous hair touched up. (We always assumed cartoon bluebirds dressed and prepped Kidman, but apparently humans do it.) We get to see the charming De Niro having his collar adjusted, the ethereal Jessica Chastain awaiting the lens, and the serene Michael Shannon surveying the scene.\n\nThe selection of stars from a variety of age brackets also sets this year\u2019s installment apart. \u201cThis is what is great about Hollywood,\u201d V.F. executive West Coast editor Krista Smith said, \u201cwhere you can have Michael B. Jordan, who\u2019s 30, or Gal Gadot, who\u2019s 32, or Harrison Ford, who is 75\u2014all of them are totally relevant.\u201d Zendaya, 21, expressed the excitement she felt, surrounded by so many legends on set: \u201cI\u2019m like this little kid. \u2018Hey, I\u2019m coming up.\u2019 You know, it\u2019s pretty cool. I just want to keep working and live up to the people I\u2019m surrounded by.\u201d Witherspoon\u2014who has appeared on several V.F. Hollywood covers\u2014reflected on what this means to an actor: \u201cBeing on the cover of Vanity Fair was just sort of this incredible moment that validated all that work. . . . You really feel it can give you the momentum that you need to push forward and to do great things.\u201d\n\nMANAGING TO ASSEMBLE THE GROUP OF 13 COVER STARS WAS NO SIMPLE FEAT.\n\nAs one gazes at the photos of these actors and actresses on set, waiting in anticipation of their moment in front of the lens, it feels like you\u2019re right there with them. It\u2019s the Hollywood Issue, and it happens once a year, and it\u2019s magic.\n\nThe Hollywood Issue of Vanity Fair is available on newsstands in New York and Los Angeles, and on the iPhone, Kindle, and other devices, on Thursday, February 1, and nationally on Tuesday, February 6.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a68fc21670d532dc755842b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/HWD-portfolio-2018-13-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a68fc2199cee10af75da53b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/HWD-portfolio-2018-13-ss03.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a68fc21670d532dc755842a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/HWD-portfolio-2018-13-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a677c47039b5b08b91d0cfd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a692ca315161b0b11f7cb67/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/HWD-cover-gate-vf-logo-2018-13.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a69da74c0b51434fe5e89d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a69da74c0b51434fe5e89d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Duboff", "Josh Dubof", "Annie Leibovit", "Jessica Dieh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/hollywood-issue-cover-oprah-nicole-kidman", "title": "The 2018 Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue Cover Is Here", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Josh Duboff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "See Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo of Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hanks, and more.", "id": "5a6742f85409151b148bc78c", "keywords": "movies,magazine,archive,hollywood 2018,behind the scenes,hollywood cover,hollywood issue 2018", "news_keywords": "movies,magazine,archive,hollywood 2018,behind the scenes,hollywood cover,hollywood issue 2018", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a6742f85409151b148bc78c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"See Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo of Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hanks, and more.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a69da74c0b51434fe5e89d5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a69da74c0b51434fe5e89d5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "See Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo of Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hanks, and more.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a69da74c0b51434fe5e89d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "The 2018 Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue Cover Is Here", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/01/hollywood-issue-cover-oprah-nicole-kidman"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "See Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo of Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hanks, and more.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a69da74c0b51434fe5e89d5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-HWD-cover-panel-coverlines-2018-13.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "The 2018 Vanity Fair Hollywood Issue Cover Is Here"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
