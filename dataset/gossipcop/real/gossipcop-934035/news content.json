More specifically, she carried them with her: Lively had a Judith Leiber clutch custom-made with the Reynolds family crest.\n\nIf you look closely, you'll see that Lively's rhinestone-embellished handbag has intricate scenes depicted on either side. On the front, it's classic \"sacred heart\" iconography behind a veiled woman, in keeping with the theme of this year's Costume Institute exhibit, \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\"; on the other, there's a riff on a medieval family crest, which, at the very center of a scroll, reads \"Reynolds.\"\n\nHere's a close-up of both sides of Lively's clutch.\n\nCourtesy of Judith Leiber\n\nCourtesy of Judith Leiber\n\nThe Reynolds crest is in the shape of a cross, and on each of the four points there's a jewel with a letter in the middle: B, R, J, and I\u2014the first initials of each member of the Reynolds-Lively family. Does this count as James and Ines's first Met Gala appearance?\n\nKevin Mazur/MG18/Getty Images\n\nThe clutch paired perfectly with the rest of Lively's breathtaking ensemble: She wore a crimson Versace gown with a gold, richly embroidered bodice, bejeweled straps, and an extra-long train\u2014all of which took more than 600 hours to create by hand. Besides the meaningful handbag, she accessorized with a golden, halo-esque headpiece, Christian Louboutin pumps, bright green earrings, and a stack of gold bracelets.\n\nKevin Mazur/MG18\n\nReynolds attended the 2017 Met Gala in human, rather than bedazzled accessory form. Inside the event last year, he shared a sweet love note to his wife via the popular Humans of New York Instagram account: \"She always responds with empathy. She meets anger with empathy. She meets hate with empathy. She'll take the time to imagine what happened to a person when they were five or six years old. And she's made me a more empathetic person.\"\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nAll the Best Looks From the 2018 Met Gala After-Parties\n\nSelena Gomez's 2018 Met Gala Look Featured a Hidden Message\n\nBlake Lively's Met Gala Dress Took Over 600 Hours to Make", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f3c61d01a66b5bdeb03d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955783218.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed392865d05a333a2d8c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Seamless%252520Sacred%252520Heart%252520Back%252520MET.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed39295117594719a052/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Seamless%252520Sacred%252520Heart%252520Front%252520MET.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed39295117594719a051/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-955783218.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park", "Andrea Par"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/met-gala-2018-blake-lively-clutch-family-initials", "title": "The Hidden Message You Probably Missed in Blake Lively's Met Gala 2018 Outfit", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "At the 2018 Met Gala, Blake Lively carried a clutch decorated with the initials of her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their daughters, James and Ines.", "id": "5af1ed396cb7e538be078c41", "keywords": "snd,blake lively,met gala,ryan reynolds", "news_keywords": "snd,blake lively,met gala,ryan reynolds", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5af1ed396cb7e538be078c41", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"At the 2018 Met Gala, Blake Lively carried a clutch decorated with the initials of her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and their daughters, James and Ines.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1ed391d01a66b5bdeb037/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Ryan Reynolds and the couple's daughters were with her in spirit.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "You Probably Missed the Sweet Family Tribute in Blake Lively's Met Gala Outfit", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/met-gala-2018-blake-lively-clutch-family-initials"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Ryan Reynolds and the couple's daughters were with her in spirit.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af1f057da4fd95ca000f4b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-955778036-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "You Probably Missed the Sweet Family Tribute in Blake Lively's Met Gala Outfit"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
