The 53-year-old must perform 50 hours of community service, is barred from drinking alcohol, must attend two Alcoholics Anonymous meetings per week, attend a victim impact class with Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and write a letter of apology to a Palm Beach Police officer, according to court documents.\n\nThe plea agreement was signed by de Lesseps on July 3, according to court documents, about seven months after the Bravo TV star was arrested at The Colony in Palm Beach, an 89-room hotel a block from the beach.\n\nThere, police said de Lesseps and a man were found drunk in a hotel room and refused to leave. De Lesseps locked herself in the bathroom, according to a sworn affidavit, and when officers tried to open the bathroom door, de Lesseps shoved one of them in the chest and slammed the door on another officer, hitting the officer in the face.\n\nAfter being handcuffed and put in a police car, de Lesseps removed her handcuffs and later threatened officers, police said.\n\n\"I\u2019m going to (expletive) kill you,\" de Lesseps said, according to the affidavit.\n\nDe Lesseps was arrested on felony charges of battery on an officer, resisting arrest without violence and two counts of crimes against a person as well as a misdemeanor charge of disorderly intoxication. Her charges have been reduced with the plea deal.\n\nThe terms of De Lesseps plea deal, including the one-year probation, will be transferred to New York where she lives, according to court documents.\n\nA judge must still sign off on the plea deal.", "images": ["https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9289482&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/Global/images/head/nameplate/palmbeachdailynews_logo.png", "https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/storyimage/LK/20180724/NEWS/812064192/AR/0/AR-812064192.jpg&MaxH=200&MaxW=200", "https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/storyimage/LK/20180724/NEWS/812064192/AR/0/AR-812064192.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/storyimage/LK/20180724/NEWS/812064192/AR/0/AR-812064192.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Cohen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/crime--law/real-housewives-star-strikes-plea-deal-palm-beach-arrest/KjofTwywWsXq00Q0vexDLJ/", "title": "\u0091Real Housewives\u2019 star strikes plea deal in Palm Beach arrest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Palm Beach Daily News", "title": "'Real Housewives' star strikes plea deal in Palm Beach arrest", "description": "Luann de Lesseps, the reality TV star who was arrested in Palm Beach in December, reached a plea deal to potentially stay out of jail, according to court", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.palmbeachdailynews.com/storyimage/LK/20180724/NEWS/812064192/AR/0/AR-812064192.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 422}, "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "7E15F9269E2CE66F2A488ABB04B5015E", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1437758955?at=1000lkC&ct=sb-palmbeachdailynews", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.ghm.palmbeachdailynews", "description": "Luann de Lesseps, the reality TV star who was arrested in Palm Beach in December, reached a plea deal to potentially stay out of jail, according to court documents.
