The country star and his wife, Brittany, announced the news via Instagram on July 10 with a photo of his 7-month-old son.\n\nIn the picture, Memphis is lounging in a onesie that reads: Big Brother.\n\nAldean has two older daughters, Keeley and Kendyl, from his first marriage, and he made no secret of the fact that he and Brittany planned to have another child as soon as possible after he and Brittany welcomed Memphis on Dec. 1, 2017.\n\n\"Our theory is, 'Hey, we got one in diapers and formula right now so, while we're in this mindset we might as well knock it out,'\" Aldean told Taste of Country Nights in April. \"We both agreed that we wanted to have two. I have two older daughters and there's a pretty big age difference in my two older daughters and Memphis, so we wanted to have one who's a little closer in age to him so he has somebody to hang out with.\"\n\nThese Country Singers Have All Welcomed Babies in 2018:\n\nFans can probably look forward to Aldean and Brittany sharing quite a bit of her second pregnancy with fans. The couple turned to Instagram when they revealed they were expecting their first child together in May of 2017, and they subsequently announced the baby was a boy just a few weeks later.\n\nThey revealed the name they'd chosen for their first son when they shared pictures of his nursery online, and they have chronicled his childhood extensively via social media, sharing personal glimpses and special moments on a weekly, sometimes daily basis.\n\nProof Jason Aldean's Baby Is Cooler Than Us", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Brittany-Kerr-Jason-Aldean.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Brittany-Kerr-Jason-Aldean.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sterling Whitaker"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/jason-aldean-brittany-second-child/", "title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Expecting Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany, are expecting their second child!", "keywords": "jason aldean, jason aldean wife, jason aldean son, jason aldean wife pregnant, jason aldean expecting child, jason aldean wife brittany pregnant", "fb": {"app_id": 193351250697247, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 173910492638623}, "og": {"title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Expecting Baby No. 2", "description": "Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany, are expecting their second child!", "url": "https://tasteofcountry.com/jason-aldean-brittany-second-child/", "site_name": "Taste of Country", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Brittany-Kerr-Jason-Aldean.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tasteofcountry"}, "sailthru.description": "Jason Aldean and his wife, Brittany, are expecting their second child!", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-10 11:20:27", "sailthru.title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Expecting Baby No. 2", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, jason-aldean, baby-news, country-music-news", "sailthru.author": "sterlingwit", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Brittany-Kerr-Jason-Aldean.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/05/Brittany-Kerr-Jason-Aldean.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "e19BTQtucrkVk-O5axdlPIIJWMrqGU-QRWcldJZvxnA", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531192827.0, "source": "http://tasteofcountry.com", "summary": ""}
