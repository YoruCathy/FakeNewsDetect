News about the public\u2019s immediate reaction to claims of sexual misconduct on set after an alleged hot and heavy hookup between himself and Olympios.\n\n\u201cThe minute you release this black man\u2019s face and this white girl\u2019s face, before either of us commented on it, I was already a \u2018rapist,\u2019\u201d the 30-year-old explained to E! News, adding that Olympios was labeled a \u201cwhore\u201d and \u201cslut.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were slut-shaming her because of what she did last season with Nick [Viall]. For me, it goes back to the human race. We failed,\u201d the contestant, who appeared on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season 13 of Bachelorette, said. (Olympios previously got topless on Viall\u2019s season 21 of The Bachelor and encouraged him to touch her bare breasts as cameras rolled.)\n\nJackson also claims she was the \u201caggressor\u201d during the night of their poolside encounter. \u201cShe gets up out of the pool and puts her lady parts in my face. Like, right on my face,\u201d he claimed to E! News. \u201cI don\u2019t think any single man \u2014 some married ones \u2014 would turn down Corinne.\u201d\n\nOlympios, however, claimed she was a \u201cvictim\u201d and had \u201cno memory\u201d of what happened between her and Jackson.\n\nLast week, Warner Bros. concluded its investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and found no evidence to support the claims. \u201cAs we previously stated, we recently became aware of allegations regarding an incident on the set of Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico. We take all such allegations seriously. The safety, security and well-being of the cast and crew is our No. 1 concern, and we suspended filming so that the allegations could be investigated immediately and thoroughly,\u201d Warner Bros. told Us Weekly in a statement on June 20. \u201cOur internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed.\u201d\n\nDespite no evidence found by Warner Bros., Olympios\u2019 lawyer, Marty Singer, says they plan to continue to investigate.\n\nProduction has resumed on season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise without both contestants.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/684496154_demario-jackson-zoom-bfa14a32-4d23-48f4-82a9-f7d9c8524770.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/684496154_demario-jackson-zoom-3452168e-140e-4ae6-b50a-375172d6aa27.jpg?crop=381px%2C143px%2C1137px%2C597px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/684496154_demario-jackson-zoom-3452168e-140e-4ae6-b50a-375172d6aa27.jpg?crop=381px%2C143px%2C1137px%2C597px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelor-in-paradises-demario-jackson-defends-corinne-olympios-over-slut-shaming-comments-w489983/", "title": "Bachelor in Paradise\u2019s DeMario Jackson Defends Corinne Olympios Over Slut-Shaming Comments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 star DeMario Jackson responds to being labeled a rapist and critics slut-shaming Corinne Olympios \u2014 see what he said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "DeMario Jackson Defends Corinne Olympios Over Slut-Shaming Comments", "description": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 star DeMario Jackson responds to being labeled a rapist and critics slut-shaming Corinne Olympios \u2014 see what he said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelor-in-paradises-demario-jackson-defends-corinne-olympios-over-slut-shaming-comments-w489983/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:57:58+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/684496154_demario-jackson-zoom-3452168e-140e-4ae6-b50a-375172d6aa27.jpg?crop=381px%2C143px%2C1137px%2C597px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/684496154_demario-jackson-zoom-3452168e-140e-4ae6-b50a-375172d6aa27.jpg?crop=381px%2C143px%2C1137px%2C597px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-06-27T17:56:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:57:58+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 star DeMario Jackson responds to being labeled a rapist and critics slut-shaming Corinne Olympios \u2014 see what he said", "title": "DeMario Jackson Defends Corinne Olympios Over Slut-Shaming Comments", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/684496154_demario-jackson-zoom-3452168e-140e-4ae6-b50a-375172d6aa27.jpg?crop=381px%2C143px%2C1137px%2C597px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498586160.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
