He refused to submit to a breathalyzer or blood and urine testing for driving under the influence, and was charged on suspicion of DUI, possession of marijuana, and possession of drug-related objects.\n\nAccording to the celebrity gossip site, Carter's girlfriend Madison Parker, who was also in the car, has also been arrested.\n\nHours before his arrest, Carter told fans on Twitter he would be unable to make a concert in Kansas City due to \"transportation issues.\"\n\nThe New York Daily News reports the couple was still in custody as of Sunday morning.\n\nThe incident follows a dramatic episode three weeks ago where he checked himself into the emergency room at St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse, hinting he needed treatment for exhaustion. Carter posted photos of himself smiling in a hospital bed and wheelchair for \"a little check up\" after performing \"lots of shows lately.\"\n\nPop singer Aaron Carter shared this photo of himself at St. Joseph's Hospital in Syracuse after performing at a HOT 107.9 concert Thursday, June 22, 2017.\n\nCarter, the younger brother of Backstreet Boys singer Nick Carter, later said on Twitter that he had been bullied and \"body shamed\" earlier that evening at a HOT 107.9 concert in Liverpool.\n\n\"I'm entirely hurt by a so-called fan that I just encountered she wasn't realizing I was listening, she said I look like I have cancer,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"This is body shaming. You guys are bullying me. I've already adressed (sic) my medical issues... A grown woman was gossiping bout me w I have a eating disorder telling people I need to eat 5 cheeseburgers cause I look like I'm dying.\"\n\nCarter's \"issues\" include a hiatal hernia condition in April, causing him to lose weight uncontrollably. A hiatus hernia occurs when part of the stomach pushes up into the chest through an opening in the diaphragm, which can cause food and acid to back up into the esophagus and can lead to heartburn.\n\nCarter said his eating disorder has also led to people saying he looks like a \"meth head\" and a heroin \"addict.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm not fat enough. For my fake fans,\" he continued. \"So please leave me alone you and all your friends. It's body shaming and against the law and defamation of character.\"\n\nAaron Carter performing at the New York State Fair on August 24, 2001.\n\nCarter added that he was especially upset after a tough few weeks: His father Bob Carter, former owner of the Yankee Rebel bar near Buffalo, where Nick was born, died at the end of May; and last month would've been the 31st birthday for Nick and Aaron's sister Leslie Carter, who was found dead of an apparent overdose in Upstate New York in 2012.\n\nCarter, best known for 2000 hits \"Aaron's Party (Come and Get It),\" \"I Want Candy\" and \"That's How I Beat Shaq,\" was also hospitalized earlier this year after being attacked on stage at an Illinois concert in February. A Hispanic member of the opening act was removed from the venue and reportedly punched Carter for what he thought was a racially charged remark, but Carter said he only said \"Bye Felipe\" because it's the male version of \"Bye Felicia.\"\n\n\"To all those who project negativity, speak cruel words to hurt others. I send you love & forgiveness. Know that all gods children are beautiful, Tall, short thick or thin,\" he tweeted last month.", "images": ["https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/common/ps-images/ad-choices-arrow.png?d=235", "https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/syracuse/logos/logo_main_inverse.svg?d=235", "https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/common/icons/sign-out-lock.svg?d=235", "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/gY0EKEqQPEHC0kyiXsrFfuF3Ur4=/450x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.advance.net/home/adv-media/width2048/img/newyorkupstatecom_national_desk_blog/photo/2017/06/23/22976988-standard.jpg", "https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/footer-logo-advance.svg?d=235", "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/I8donukGGiBfui3QzhMQsNR_8Ww=/450x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.advance.net/home/adv-media/width2048/img/newyorkupstatecom_national_desk_blog/photo/2017/06/23/22973581-standard.jpg", "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/rN9X00NzuG0f_2AbAzfjtWBFm2o=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/parade/photo/2017/07/16/aaron-carter-df61458bd0229eb9.jpg", "https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/syracuse/logos/logo_main_sm.svg?d=235", "https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/common/icons/Arrow_back.svg?d=235"], "top_img": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/rN9X00NzuG0f_2AbAzfjtWBFm2o=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/parade/photo/2017/07/16/aaron-carter-df61458bd0229eb9.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Geoff Herbert", "Gherbert Syracuse.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.syracuse.com/celebrity-news/2017/07/aaron_carter_arrested_dui_drugs_health_issues_syracuse.html", "title": "Aaron Carter arrested for DUI, possession 3 weeks after Syracuse 'health issues'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 116541301723191}, "title": "Aaron Carter arrested for DUI, possession 3 weeks after Syracuse 'health issues'", "og": {"title": "Aaron Carter arrested for DUI weeks after Syracuse 'health issues'", "url": "https://www.syracuse.com/celebrity-news/2017/07/aaron_carter_arrested_dui_drugs_health_issues_syracuse.html", "site_name": "syracuse", "type": "article", "description": "The singer's girlfriend has also been arrested.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/rN9X00NzuG0f_2AbAzfjtWBFm2o=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/parade/photo/2017/07/16/aaron-carter-df61458bd0229eb9.jpg", "width": 1280}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-16T15:53:55Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-16T16:53:55Z", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "@app-carousel,@topstory,Aaron Carter,celebrity news,music,Top Entertainment", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/deafgeoff"}, "twitter": {"title": "Aaron Carter arrested for DUI weeks after Syracuse 'health issues'", "site": "@syracusedotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The singer's girlfriend has also been arrested.", "image": "https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/rN9X00NzuG0f_2AbAzfjtWBFm2o=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width2048/img/parade/photo/2017/07/16/aaron-carter-df61458bd0229eb9.jpg"}, "article_publication_name": "https://www.syracuse.com/celebrity-news/2017/07/aaron_carter_arrested_dui_drugs_health_issues_syracuse.html", "article_date_original": "Sunday, July 16, 2017, 11:53 AM", "article_date_updated": "Sunday, July 16, 2017, 12:53 PM", "sailthru.tags": "celebrity news,aaron carter,music,carter,st. joseph 's hospital,nick carter,backstreet boys,upstate new york", "sailthru.date": "Sunday, July 16, 2017, 11:53 AM", "sailthru.title": "Aaron Carter arrested for DUI, possession 3 weeks after Syracuse 'health issues'", "sailthru.author": "gherbert", "sailthru.description": "The singer's girlfriend has also been arrested.", "machine_tags": "@app-carousel,@topstory", "sections": "celebrity-news,music,entertainment", "byline": "Geoff Herbert | gherbert@syracuse.com", "subscriber_only": "false", "Description": "The singer's girlfriend has also been arrested.", "article_author": "Geoff Herbert | gherbert@syracuse.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500220435.0, "source": "https://www.syracuse.com", "summary": ""}
