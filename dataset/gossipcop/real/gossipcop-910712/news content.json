Break out the tequila,\" Johnson wrote.\n\nJungle Cruise is based on the classic Disney theme park attraction that takes guests on a guided tour through the world's rivers. But what if something were to go amiss?\n\nFilm website Variety.com, which broke the casting news Wednesday, says Disney sees the film as a possible major franchise similar to the Pirates of the Caribbean \u2014 another series based on a famed Disney attraction.\n\nJohnson and the team hope the film will convey the same kind of actor chemistry as the classic African Queen, which paired Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, according to Variety. Disney execs have been floored with early footage of Blunt in Mary Poppins Returns (due out Dec. 25) and want to keep the star in the family.\n\nJaume Collet-Serra is on board to direct.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5686549763001_5686545615001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce0f066445079cf74a51fd29a9862c5052dbdd7b/c=0-322-1298-1055/local/-/media/2018/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530240480431967-AFP-AFP-XH224-96813257.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce0f066445079cf74a51fd29a9862c5052dbdd7b/c=0-322-1298-1055/local/-/media/2018/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530240480431967-AFP-AFP-XH224-96813257.JPG?width=1298&height=733&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce0f066445079cf74a51fd29a9862c5052dbdd7b/c=0-322-1298-1055/local/-/media/2018/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530240480431967-AFP-AFP-XH224-96813257.JPG?width=1298&height=733&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/31/emily-blunt-joins-disneys-jungle-cruise-where-shell-drink-tequila-rock/1085228001/", "title": "Emily Blunt joins Disney's 'Jungle Cruise' where she'll drink tequila with The Rock", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Emily Blunt joins Disney's 'Jungle Cruise' where she'll drink tequila with The Rock", "description": "Emily Blunt will star in the action adventure 'Jungle Cruise' where tequila is the beverage of choice.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/31/emily-blunt-joins-disneys-jungle-cruise-where-shell-drink-tequila-rock/1085228001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce0f066445079cf74a51fd29a9862c5052dbdd7b/c=0-322-1298-1055/local/-/media/2018/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530240480431967-AFP-AFP-XH224-96813257.JPG?width=1298&height=733&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1298, "height": 733}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bryan Alexander", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Emily Blunt will star in the action adventure 'Jungle Cruise' where tequila is the beverage of choice.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce0f066445079cf74a51fd29a9862c5052dbdd7b/c=0-322-1298-1055/local/-/media/2018/01/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530240480431967-AFP-AFP-XH224-96813257.JPG?width=1298&height=649&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Emily Blunt joins Disney's 'Jungle Cruise' where she'll drink tequila with The Rock", "description": "Emily Blunt will star in the action adventure 'Jungle Cruise' where tequila is the beverage of choice."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517328000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
