I will now do all grocery shopping like this pic.twitter.com/DLAzKvDezI \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nThere was also a dog dressed a bellhop in the background, because why not?\n\nyes my dog is a bellhop and no I have no reasoning \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nA couple of hours passed without incident until the mum-of-one realised that she needed just one more banana for her famous banana bread.\n\nI really, really hate to say this but. I need one more banana pic.twitter.com/DBqKjQpSM7 \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nShe tweeted a guy called Jake who she had been in touch with earlier that day. Jake had two bananas he was willing to sacrifice to the cause.\n\nmy mom just goes \"if I go he better have 2 bananas I not going in traffic for 1\" she's like a real dealer \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nJake looked only delighted to be receiving a pair of John Legend's underwear, too.\n\none of the cutest things I've ever seen @onairjake pic.twitter.com/5YxPXsnPNK \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 22, 2017\n\nthis is no longer my banana bread. this is *our* banana bread. \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 22, 2017\n\nThankfully, Chrissy then had enough bananas to continue with her banana bread.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude for the help Twitter had given her.\n\nShe then posted a couple of videos of the finished banana bread.\n\nAnd, to be fair to her, it does look pretty unreal.\n\nFair play, Chrissy.", "images": ["https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtaGVyLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA5XFxcLzIyMTA0ODI0XFxcL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTY0NjU2MDgxMi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1kNDgyODZlN2RlZWNmYzIzZWVjNlwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiIwNzU3NzljOTA1MGI4NWU3NGU5ODZhMjVmYWE2YTY4NDk1YzQwN2I0In0=/gettyimages-646560812.jpg", "https://www.her.ie/assets/images/her/main-logo.svg?id=5d83db2642088bed19e5", "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5oZXIuaWVcXFwvYXNzZXRzXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9oZXJcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nP2lkPWQ0ODI4NmU3ZGVlY2ZjMjNlZWM2XCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEzMyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjc3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1kNDgyODZlN2RlZWNmYzIzZWVjNlwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI4MDNkZmFmNjA4ZThmNzZjNDU3OTZmMDRhNmQ5OGQyNTdhNDE2NjUzIn0=/no-image.png?id=d48286e7deecfc23eec6"], "top_img": "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtaGVyLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA5XFxcLzIyMTA0ODI0XFxcL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTY0NjU2MDgxMi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1kNDgyODZlN2RlZWNmYzIzZWVjNlwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiIwNzU3NzljOTA1MGI4NWU3NGU5ODZhMjVmYWE2YTY4NDk1YzQwN2I0In0=/gettyimages-646560812.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jade Hayden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.her.ie/celeb/chrissy-teigen-enlisted-the-help-of-twitter-to-make-banana-bread-365748", "title": "Chrissy Teigen enlisted the help of Twitter to make banana bread", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Chrissy Teigen wanted to make some banana bread, but she didn't have appropriate bananas.
