{"url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/23/bill-cosby-returns-stage-first-time-since-sexual-assault-trial/", "text": "Bill Cosby has performed in public for the first time since a sex abuse scandal embroiled him in 2015, telling stories and honouring old friends in his hometown on Monday as a retrial looms in his criminal sexual assault case.\n\nThe 80-year-old entertainer took the stage for about an hour at a Philadelphia jazz club for his first show since May 2015. He told stories, honoured old friends and finished by leading the band in a set, first using his mouth to scat in place of a missing horn section and then taking a turn at the drums.\n\nCosby, handing the drumsticks off to the 11-year-old son of the bass player, asked if the boy knew who he was and then told him.\n\n\"I used to be a comedian,\" Cosby deadpanned.\n\nCosby reminisced about his childhood, telling the crowd about how when he was 4 he grilled a relative about the impending birth of his brother.", "images":
