The pair announced their split several weeks ago, and since then fans have been speculating that G-Eazy cheated on his ex. Mostly because Halsey tweeted 1) A scissors emoji which is a possible reference to G-Eazy's lyrics, \"Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my d*ck off,\" and 2) the words \"pumpkin eater,\" which is a possible reference to the rhyme \"cheater, cheater pumpkin eater.\"\n\npumpkin eater. \u2014 h (@halsey) July 4, 2018\n\nBut now? Now Halsey's jumped into G-Eazy's Instagram comments with a bunch of emojis and fans have no idea what to make of it. Especially because his caption is \"Big Dick Energy\" and one of her comments is \"lmao.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nSounds like she's shading him, right? Correct, but please note that when someone theorized that she was being petty, Halsey wrote \"no petty here. caption dumb funny and stage looks dope. jealous of everyone who gets to see the show.\"\n\nNaturally, this supportive musing has prompted fans to think they're getting back together, and now it's just like: What! Is!
