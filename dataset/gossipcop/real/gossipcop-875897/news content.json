The archives will remain available here; for new stories, head over to Vox.com, where our staff is covering consumer culture for The Goods by Vox. You can also see what we\u2019re up to by signing up here.\n\nFive years ago, The Mindy Project introduced audiences to the colorful and chaotic world of Dr. Mindy Lahiri, creator and star Mindy Kaling\u2019s alter ego. Since then, we\u2019ve watched Mindy grow both as a working professional and a woman looking for love \u2014 and from navigating the New York City dating scene to opening a fertility clinic to becoming a mom, she\u2019s done it all while dressed in some truly memorable clothes.\n\nToday, the sixth and final season premieres on Hulu, and costume designer Salvador Perez went all out for Mindy\u2019s last hurrah. Below, Perez discusses Mindy\u2019s style evolution, dressing the men of Mindy, and what makes the final season\u2019s fashion so special. (Hint: It involves a lot of Dolce & Gabbana.)\n\nHow does it feel to be working on the final season of The Mindy Project?\n\nIt\u2019s bittersweet. I\u2019m a gypsy; I normally do feature films because I like a beginning and an end. I\u2019ve stayed on for six seasons of The Mindy Project because I\u2019ve been having a great time. Part of me thinks, \u201cAll good things come to an end,\u201d and part of me is like, \u201cHow can I not shop for this character for the rest of my life?\u201d It\u2019s the dream job. I cannot imagine not shopping for Mindy Lahiri ever again. That\u2019s just daunting to me.\n\nDo you think you\u2019ll be out and about and see pieces that make you think of her?\n\nOh my god, I\u2019ve done three features in the middle of the show \u2014 I\u2019ve done the Pitch Perfect movies and I did Think Like a Man. The whole time I was shopping for those, I was like, \u201cOh, this will be great for Mindy.\u201d I\u2019d literally pick something up and realize, \u201cWait, no, I\u2019m not shopping for that show.\u201d It\u2019s such a natural part of what I do \u2014 to shop for that character \u2014 that it will take a couple years to break my habit of subconsciously shopping for Mindy.\n\nHow do you think Mindy\u2019s style has \u2014 or hasn\u2019t \u2014 evolved over the show\u2019s six seasons?\n\nIt\u2019s funny because people always think about Sex and the City as an arbiter of fashion. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou\u2019re remembering Sex and the City\u2019s final season. Look at the first six episodes of Sex and the City.\u201d It was not the same show, because you have to find your rhythm. In the first few episodes, you see Miranda in, like, overalls and a parka.\n\nI think it was the same for us. At the beginning of The Mindy Project, it was little cute cardigans layered over a blouse and a skirt. It was color-blocked. But now she\u2019s a full-on fashionista. I mean, the Dolce & Gabbana, the Roksanda, the Prada, the Mary Katrantzou, and all of the custom stuff that we make for her. It\u2019s a completely different show now than it was at the beginning.\n\nI love that you brought up the custom design. I\u2019ve heard that each episode features at least one custom piece.\n\nOne custom outfit. So that means dress and coat. [Laughs]\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about creating those custom looks?\n\nI started out as a fashion designer, and I fell into costume because I could sew. So I\u2019m still a closet fashion designer. To be able to design contemporary fashion for a woman like this is just a dream. It\u2019s what I went to school for. As costume designers, we have many things in our arsenal. I can rent, I can borrow, I can pull. But to be able to build \u2014 and building things that don\u2019t exist \u2014 is the ultimate. I even have somebody who does hand-knit clothes for us \u2014 hand-knit sweaters, skirts, and dresses. That\u2019s how decadent we are on the show.\n\nWhat have been some of your favorite custom pieces?\n\nI love the finale of season 4, which tied into season 5. Mindy wore that little yellow Madeline dress with the collar and black bow with the matching floral coat.\n\nThat was super cute.\n\nIt\u2019s one of my favorite pieces. This season alone we\u2019ve done so much. You haven\u2019t seen the episodes yet, but I found this beautiful cream silk fabric with tassels printed on it. I made a purple coat to go with it, and then we sewed tassels on the coat as an embellishment. To be able to be that decadent and to do couture-level clothing on a half-hour sitcom is unheard of.\n\nWhen we did a flashback to her first day at work, I did a pink jacquard suit lined in a printed silk with a matching silk blouse. Then we trimmed it with pearls and crystals. The fact that I can do that kind of quality work for a TV show is pretty amazing.\n\nColor and embellishment are such a big part of Mindy\u2019s world. Was it a deliberate decision to make her wardrobe so vibrant?\n\nThat\u2019s always been my aesthetic. You can talk to any director I\u2019ve ever worked for. It\u2019s like, \u201cSal, bring the color down. Sal, less crystals. Sal, less rhinestones.\u201d My whole career has been that way. So to finally have a partner who said, \u201cMore crystals, more rhinestones, more color,\u201d has been a gift. Mindy lets me do what I want. If it were my world, everybody would live in color.\n\nOn that note, does Mindy Lahiri actually own any black or neutral clothing?\n\nWe try to keep it special because I think black is such a crutch. I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, no \u2014 everybody has a little black dress. You can\u2019t wear that.\u201d It\u2019s gotta be chocolate brown or navy blue or hunter green. But every now and then \u2014 like at the beginning of season 4, when she had that dream marriage to Matt [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] \u2014 I put her in a black plunge dress with crystals. It was appropriate for that. She was in a dream world, and I wanted the dream world to be more black. But I use black very sparingly because I think that\u2019s just the easiest. It\u2019s easy to look great in a black dress. Anybody can do it.\n\nMindy has some really great loungewear, too. Where do all those stylish pajamas come from?\n\nThose PJs are from Bedhead Pajamas. I love their aesthetic. I go into their showroom at the beginning of each season and buy one of everything. And we always have them in our arsenal. People are like, \u201cDo you have 10, 20 pairs?\u201d Try 60. I have 60 pairs of Bedhead Pajamas. They\u2019re luxurious. They\u2019re comfortable. They\u2019re in great colors. There\u2019s an episode where we had one on her and one on Anna [Rebecca Rittenhouse]. They look great on everybody.\n\nHow did you decide that fashionable PJs would be a part of her character\u2019s aesthetic?\n\nAs much as Mindy loves being a chic diva, she also likes being comfortable. But she wants to be comfortable and still be a chic diva. So you would never see her in just a T-shirt and sweats. It would be comfy pajamas, because she\u2019s a diva.\n\nYou\u2019re not going to see her in a ratty T-shirt from high school.\n\n[Only] if it were scripted that way. I did it once when she slept over at Danny\u2019s [Chris Messina]. But as a general rule, no. Her sleepwear is fabulous. And the real Mindy loves it because it\u2019s the most comfortable thing to wear on set, and she just loves being comfortable.\n\nWhat can viewers expect fashion-wise in the final season? Will there be anything particularly outrageous or unique?\n\nLet\u2019s just say that I spent $100,000 on Dolce & Gabbana. And we\u2019re using it. There\u2019s a lot of Gucci. It\u2019s our last season. I figured no one could yell at me. They can\u2019t fire me, so I\u2019m just going to spend like the wind.\n\nWith the real Mindy expecting, what\u2019s the difference between designing and fitting for a fake pregnancy versus a real one?\n\nWhen we had the fake pregnancy, Mindy wrote that episode. When I made the pregnancy vest for her, she was like, \u201cUgh.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat do you mean, ugh? You have to wear this.\u201d She hated fitting in the pregnancy vest.\n\nAs a general rule, [her real pregnancy] shouldn\u2019t affect us too much because we\u2019ll be done hopefully before she starts showing. Some days after lunch, there is a little bit of a belly, but she still looks great.\n\nWhat I liked about the pregnancy storyline was that her maternity style didn\u2019t differ much from her actual style.\n\nWhich is my philosophy as a designer in general. I remember when I was little, my mom, sisters, and cousins would all buy maternity dresses. That\u2019s over. You just buy a little bit of knit and work it. You might have to buy some maternity jeans. But I don\u2019t think you should have to buy maternity clothes. Why spend the money on clothes that you\u2019ll never wear again? We made a very conscious effort to not buy her maternity clothes. There were just lots of knits.\n\nDescribe your conversations with Mindy about designing for the final season. Was there anything she really wanted to see before the show came to an end?\n\nIt\u2019s more like an aesthetic. We go to the designers. What do we see? What do we like? We love what Gucci is doing right now. Dolce & Gabbana always has the best prints, so there\u2019s a lot of Dolce & Gabbana. It\u2019s funny because I used to have to do these mixed-prints things myself, but now I\u2019m finding those pieces [already made]. I found an MSGM dress the other day that had two different prints of orange flowers on the top, and an orange and black plaid skirt. I used to have to put those together, and now I can just buy them because people are doing my aesthetic.\n\nSo you were way ahead of the curve.\n\nI take full credit for it. I was at Nordstrom, and there was a lace pinafore dress over a polka-dotted blouse. I\u2019m like, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fully us.\u201d Nobody did that before us. That\u2019s great that we are influencing fashion, because people are taking their clothes and wearing them in ways they never planned on before, which gives them more wardrobe.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to have a huge ego here, but the prints and the way we use prints have really exploded since I\u2019ve been on the show. The reason we started building them is because it wasn\u2019t out there, and now it\u2019s out there. So what came first, the chicken or the egg?\n\nMindy, when I first met her, did not want to wear prints or florals. I said, \u201cWell, no \u2014 they look good, you have to find the right one.\u201d There has to be movement in the fabric. It can\u2019t be repetitive. There has to be a lot of motion. And now she\u2019s on the cover of InStyle in a floral dress, and I\u2019m like, \u201cHa!\u201d\n\nIf you absolutely had to pick, what are a few of your favorite looks from the show?\n\nThe green Christmas dress [from season 3]. As a designer, it\u2019s very satisfying to have that idea and to have the resources. I know the beader who beaded [for] Funny Girl and Titanic; she\u2019s a friend of mine, and I got her out of retirement to bead that dress for Mindy. It\u2019s just beautiful. For the fans, seeing the handiwork that was done to that dress is fabulous. Again, the yellow Madeline dress and coat. I love that outfit. It\u2019s the epitome of Mindy\u2019s style \u2014 the color-blocking, the floral, the coordination. It\u2019s very Mindy.\n\nThe one that people haven\u2019t seen yet is the purple tassel dress. Again, it\u2019s the workmanship.\n\nAre there any supporting characters\u2019 style that you have really enjoyed designing for?\n\nOh god, yes. People always think of Mindy because the show is called The Mindy Project, but I am very proud of the men on the show. Danny had his little Ralph Lauren look. Jeremy [Ed Weeks] \u2014 I mean, I live vicariously through him. If I were to wear a suit every day, I would look like Ed Weeks. He\u2019s a peacock. It\u2019s all purples, blues, and pinks \u2014 very put-together and polished. Then they brought in Jody [Garret Dillahunt]. He\u2019s Southern, he wears suspenders, he\u2019s very traditional.\n\nNow that I pull for Jeremy and Jody at the same time, I have to make sure their colors don\u2019t clash and that they aren\u2019t both in blue suits. There\u2019s a little bit of crossover because my whole point is that they were college buddies, so they had to have some similarities. It\u2019s a very funny thing that I\u2019m sure only I notice, but I have a lot of fun with the shirt-and-tie combinations. The men on the show have been equally well-dressed.\n\nThat goes across the board to all of our guest stars. Since Mindy\u2019s clothes are heightened and so special, I couldn\u2019t put everybody else in, you know, Gap. It would look odd. So I really heightened everybody around her. Anna, who\u2019s very steely and wears black and navy, is still couture. It\u2019s Roland Mouret, Hugo Boss, and Theory. She\u2019s the complete antithesis of Mindy: There\u2019s no color. There\u2019s no embellishment. It\u2019s very sleek. It\u2019s icy. But I love having that contrast between her and Mindy.\n\nWhat have you enjoyed most about working on The Mindy Project?\n\nThe collaboration with Mindy. You talk to any costume designer, and the biggest part of our job is begging actors for fittings. They don\u2019t want to do it. They don\u2019t want to take the time. They just want to look fabulous, but nobody wants to take the time for fittings because they\u2019re busy.\n\nMindy has always given me the time. Mindy will give up her lunch break. Mindy will come in on a Saturday. Mindy will stay after work because she understands that fittings are important. I can only make her look that good if I have her try it on, alter it, fit it to her, and accessorize. I will never have a collaborator like Mindy Kaling. She has been there for us and has been a part of the process. She allows me to do my job and inspires me to do my job. She really is my muse.\n\nThe Paley Center for Media is hosting a costume exhibit in honor of the show right now. How did that come about?\n\nHulu had come to us and asked, \u201cWould you consider doing a museum exhibit of the costumes from the show?\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cHello!\u201d It\u2019s a huge honor because the shows that have had exhibits before were Outlander, Hairspray, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, and American Horror Story \u2014 these big, costume-y shows.\n\nThe fact that they\u2019re putting our contemporary show in that same category really speaks to the audience and the appreciation of what we\u2019re doing. People think contemporary clothes just happen. I put the same amount of effort \u2014 if not more \u2014 into my contemporary shows as most people do into period shows. It\u2019s so detailed. A lot of it is built, a lot of it is remade, and a lot of it is layers. When people think contemporary clothes, they think you pull them from the store and that\u2019s it. No, no, no. When you see what I start with and what I finish with, that\u2019s what costume design is.\n\nThe exhibit\u2019s been called \u201cimmersive.\u201d What will that look like for visitors?\n\nI put so much detail into the clothes that you never see on camera. What I\u2019ve found is that when Mindy puts them on, she notices the beautiful silk linings and the handiwork, and it makes her feel special. I think that shows on camera, but the audience never gets to see any of those details. Now they get to see them up close and personal. And the exhibit not only shows my design work and Mindy\u2019s costumes, but [also] my cutter and fitter support, who have made all of these clothes.\n\nI\u2019m so flattered and honored by the response of the fans [to the show\u2019s clothes]. My Instagram following is huge because of The Mindy Project. People have their favorites, but now they get to actually see them in one room and see the details. I think it\u2019ll be a fun opportunity for the fans.\n\nThe Mindy Project season 6 premieres September 12th on Hulu.", "images":
