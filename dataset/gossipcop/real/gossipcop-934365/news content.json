Fans finally learned how it all ended in the big wedding-day finale titled \u201cThe Bow Tie Asymmetry.\u201d\n\nThe episode opens with the gang in full strategy mode. Family are coming into town from all over the place and it\u2019s up to them to facilitate getting them together in time for the wedding. Penny is in charge of grabbing Amy\u2019s parents from the airport while Raj is tasked with grabbing Sheldon\u2019s mom and sister Missy. As the trio drive, Mrs. Cooper reveals that Missy is pregnant with her second baby and notes that her husband is at home watching their first child. Missy, however, reveals that they\u2019re actually separated and her mom just can\u2019t deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Howard is in his living room playing with a dog that wandered into his backyard. Bernadette is about to chastise him for adding another member to the already-crowded household, but he tells her he\u2019s already called the owner to come retrieve the little guy. When the doorbell rings, he\u2019s shocked to discover that he\u2019s holding none other than \u201cStar Wars\u201d star Mark Hamill\u2019s pooch. The star offers Howard a reward for finding his dog, Bark Hamill, but Howard says he can\u2019t accept money.\n\nInstead, he asks Hamill to officiate the wedding, stealing the job away from Sheldon\u2019s former rival, Wil Wheaton. Wheaton takes the news poorly, due in large part to the fact that Howard waited until the day of the wedding to break it to him. He approaches Hamill and tells him that he was awake all night working on notes for the wedding.\n\n\u201cThanks, this\u2019ll be a big help!\u201d an oblivious Hamill says, walking off with Wheaton\u2019s notebook.\n\nThe episode cuts to Leonard doing his best to straighten Sheldon\u2019s bowtie and getting emotional. He has no problem telling his friend that he\u2019s proud of him and that, after today, he\u2019ll officially be Amy\u2019s problem.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly Leonard,\u201d Sheldon says while embracing Leonard. \u201cI will always be your problem.\u201d\n\nMary Cooper enters the room and asks if Leonard will give them a minute. She mentions Sheldon\u2019s dad and how he\u2019d be proud of him before trying to fix the tie herself. However, Sheldon stops her noting that Amy said sometimes a little asymmetry is a good thing. That\u2019s when he gets a sudden burst of inspiration with regard to his work. He throws tradition to the wind and goes to Amy\u2019s dressing room and explains his breakthrough and the couple starts to work on it.\n\nOutside, as the guests wait for the ceremony to start, Howard asks Hamill to host an impromptu Q&A about \u201cStar Wars\u201d to help fill the time. This holds over everyone except Amy\u2019s brash mother, who assumes Sheldon has walked out and stands up to go retrieve her daughter. This, however, is something Penny doesn\u2019t allow. She finally stands up to the old woman telling her that Sheldon loves Amy and would never, under any circumstances, hurt her.\n\nEventually, Penny personally goes in back to see what\u2019s up, only to find Leonard has joined their calculations and can confirm that they\u2019re onto something world-changing. Penny, though, is completely unamused.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, we have our whole lives to do science together,\u201d Sheldon says. \u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201d\n\nAs they walk down the aisle, Sheldon is shocked to see his wedding will be officiated by Hamill, and notes that he has literally 4,000 things for him to sign afterwards. That\u2019s when the big moment comes.\n\nAmy walks down the aisle and the two exchange vows.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little girl, I used to dream about my wedding, but eventually I stopped because I thought that day would never come. And then I met you. From the first moment in that coffee shop, I knew that there was something special between us. Even though I did work on a study that disproved love at first sight,\u201d Amy says. \u201cClearly it was wrong, because I felt something that day and those feelings have only gotten stronger with time. I can\u2019t imagine loving you more than I do right now, but I felt that way yesterday and the day before yesterday and the day before that.\u201d\n\nThen it\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s turn, and the man who doesn\u2019t understand social interaction knew that acknowledging he didn\u2019t know what to say was the perfect thing to say.\n\n\u201cin this moment\u2026 I have no words. I guess I\u2019m overwhelmed by you. In a good way\u2026 Not in the elevator in the Haunted Mansion way. Even if I can\u2019t tell you now how I feel\u2026 I will spend my life showing you how much I love you.\u201d\n\nWith that, a visibly choked up Hamill finally said the words fans have been waiting many years to hear and pronounced Sheldon and Amy husband and wife.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/bbts11finale.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/Gwyneth-Paltrow-GETTY-cropped.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bbts11finale.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/270/152/Brad-Paisley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bbts11finale.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/big-bang-theory-season-11-finale-recap-sheldon-and-amys-wedding-gets-a-big-shocker", "title": "'Big Bang Theory' Season 11 finale recap: Sheldon and Amy's wedding gets a big shocker", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It\u2019s all been leading to this, after proposing at the top of the Season, Sheldon and Amy\u2019s wedding date finally arrived in Season 11, Episode 24.
