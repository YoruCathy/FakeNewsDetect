Everyone of a certain age who grew up in New England had a dad or an uncle with a fading \u201cSquish the Fish\u201d t-shirt from 1986 \u2014 and it can be difficult to shake those cultural ties.\n\nOf course, the more likely scenario is that the two grown adults found their relationship untenable for a variety of reasons that had less to do with the uniform he now wears and more to do with the fact that they\u2019re now based in two different cities.\n\nA source told Us Weekly that \u201c[the breakup] had to do with the distance and them barely seeing each other\u201d because Culpo had no intention of moving to Miami, adding that he wasn\u2019t thrilled with her nude photo shoot in Sports Illustrated.\n\nAnother source who spoke with E! News compounded the drama, claiming that Amendola was unhappy with Olivia\u2019s life choices.\n\nVia Eonline.com:\n\n\u201cDanny couldn\u2019t handle Olivia\u2019s demanding lifestyle and wasn\u2019t pleased with certain choices she was making,\u201d says the source. \u201cThe constant travel was also causing a rift.\u201d\n\nCulpo, a Rhode Island native who rose to fame after being crowned Miss USA and then Miss Universe in 2012, lives in the Northeast and has a very busy career as a model. Amendola is an NFL wide receiver. The fact that the two made it as long as they did was a miracle, honestly.\n\nAt least we\u2019ll always have this iconic moment:", "images": ["https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/gettyimages-1169690207.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/gettyimages-1188285945.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/usatsi_9964125.jpg?w=1000&h=600&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/patriotswirelogo.png", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/gettyimages-1169931828.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/gettyimages-462644368.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gettyimages-1189879738.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/patriotswirefavicon.png", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/usatsi_9964125.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/gettyimages-487641306.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/usatsi_13551623.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/2000-tom-brady-patriots-080400.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/usatsi_10549172.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1173232224.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/usatsi_13276831.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://usatpatriotswire.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/usatsi_9964125.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tanya Ray Fox", "Isaiah Houde", "Henry Mckenna", "March", "Pm Et"], "canonical_link": "https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/2018/03/27/new-england-patriots-danny-amendola-reportedly-couldnt-handle-olivia-culpos-demanding-lifestyle/", "title": "Danny Amendola reportedly couldn't handle Olivia Culpo's lifestyle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Photos of Amendola and Culpo after SBLI became iconic, but E!
