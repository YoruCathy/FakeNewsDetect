However, in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival on Tuesday, where \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d is about to screen, Emilia Clarke said that the shift from directors Chris Lord and Phil Miller to Ron Howard was \u201cseamless.\u201d\n\nHoward, the Oscar-winning director of \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d had no time to prep, Clarke said, but on his first day he immediately earned the trust of his cast and crew.\n\n\u201cHe took us all in and listened to everyone,\u201d said Clarke, adding, \u201cHe took us from this kind of \u2018what are we doing\u2019 to a place of such ease and comfort and fun.\u201d\n\nDuring an hour-long talk as part of the Kering Women in Motion talks, Clarke didn\u2019t say what happened to lead to Lord and Miller\u2019s firing, but the duo\u2019s improvisation-heavy style was reportedly alienating some actors and led to clashes with LucasFilm head Kathleen Kennedy. She did allude to substantial re-shoots, saying that her response when she\u2019d revisit certain scenes was, \u201cYes, thank goodness.

She confessed that she\u2019s not certain how all the palace intrigue and clashes for the Iron Throne will end.\n\n\u201cIt will be what none of us think it will be,\u201d Clarke predicted.\n\nAfter seven seasons of playing the \u201cmother of dragons,\u201d Clarke sounds emotional about saying goodbye to the role that made her famous. \u201cIt really feels like preparing to leave home\u2026that\u2019s exciting, but it\u2019s sad and scary all at the same time,\u201d she said.\n\nMuch of the Women in Motion talk centered on issues facing female performers and filmmakers \u2014 it\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s taking place as many women in the industry are pushing for equal pay, better opportunities, and a safer workplace.\n\nClarke said the \u201ctemperature changed dramatically\u201d on sets after sexual harassment allegations broke against powerful industry figures such as Harvey Weinstein, Brett Ratner, and Kevin Spacey.\n\n\u201cYou break the mold \u2026and then there\u2019s a huge amount of work that goes into addressing all that needs to be addressed,\u201d said Clarke.\n\nPart of that change may be instituting quotas on the number of women and minorities working on films and shows, Clarke said. Another component could require educating men about how they should behave in the workplace and the kinds of comments that are appropriate in a professional setting.\n\nOn \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Clarke is paid the same as all of her male co-stars.
