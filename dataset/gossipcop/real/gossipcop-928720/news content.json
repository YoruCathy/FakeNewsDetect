She is independent and their marriage is solid. Having a child is a natural desire. They have been married long enough to know each other which is a mature step to be sure nothing goes wrong.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Paul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan via Getty\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Brigitte Nielsen, Rachel Weisz and More Celebs Who Welcomed (and Are Expecting!) Children After 45\n\nThe notoriously private couple largely keeps their relationship out of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just too famous,\u201d Weisz told More for its the December/January 2016 cover story when asked why she\u2019s decidedly secretive about their marriage. \u201cIt would be a betrayal. You have to protect your marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you tell your girlfriends everything,\u201d the star added. \u201cOne of the great pleasures of not being an adolescent is that you don\u2019t have to share everything. When you\u2019re married, that door closes. The audience goes, and you\u2019re in your own life.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Frachel-weisz-11-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Frachel-weisz-daniel-craig-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=698&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fdaniel-craig-1-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Frachel-weisz1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fdaniel-craig-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1333&h=698&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fdaniel-craig-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/rachel-weisz-daniel-craig-welcome-first-child/", "title": "Rachel Weisz, 48, Welcomes a Baby Girl with Husband Daniel Craig, 50: Reports", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Births,Daniel Craig,News,Rachel Weisz", "news_keywords": "Births,Daniel Craig,News,Rachel Weisz", "description": "Rachel Weisz, 48, revealed she was pregnant in an April interview with The New York Times, while promoting her film Disobedience", "og": {"title": "Rachel Weisz, 48, Welcomes a Baby Girl with Husband Daniel Craig, 50: Reports", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/rachel-weisz-daniel-craig-welcome-first-child/", "description": "Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig&nbsp;are new parents!
