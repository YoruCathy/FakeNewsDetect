Too bad the Real Housewives Of New York reunion filmed before Lu confirmed the split. Oh, the drama we could\u2019ve had. Andy Cohen should request a do-over.\n\nSo many rumors, so few days of marriage! Although Luann only announced last week that her marriage was officially over, Luann and Tom seemed to be over since they began.\n\nFollowing news of their divorce, rumors swirled that Luann caught Tom being unfaithful, and that she was even rekindling things with ex-boyfriend Jacques. Reportedly, Luann and Tom even had a very public fight where she slapped him. Luann has already denied that infidelity played a role in their split and explained that they simply grew apart. Which is kind of what cheating is, right?!\n\nRELATED \u2013 RHONY Castmates React To Luann\u2019s Divorce\n\nNow a source claims that we\u2019ve had it all wrong and that Luann never considered Tom anything more than a showmance. The source told The Daily Mail that Luann only married Tom because she was \u201cbecoming irrelevant on [RHONY] and needed a new story line,\u201d which is why she was never bothered by his affairs and Housewives hookups.\n\nAnd contrary to the Legend Of The Head Of Heels In Love Luann, the source insists it was actually TOM who was madly in love with her and is having a \u201cdifficult time\u201d accepting that he was used for RHONY. Has he been talking to Jason Hoppy lately? Yes, apparently Tom was soooooooo in love he cheated, right?!\n\nThe allegations go even further, accusing Luann not just of being unfaithful, but also asserting that she \u201cwas prone to violent outbursts,\u201d which left Tom bruised and bloodied. \u201cIt does not take much for her to punch, bite, slap or scratch him,\u201d the insider revealed. Is that source Ramona?\n\nTom is now denouncing the lurid tale. In a statement issued through his rep, he defends Luann and maintains that the exes are on good terms despite the split. \u201cThere is no truth in this at all,\u201d Tom\u2019s rep told People. \u201cTom and Luann spoke this morning and they have been nothing but kind to each other.\u201d\n\nThe countess also doesn\u2019t believe Tom continued cheating. \u201cWe were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things,\u201d Luann shared with Page Six, \u201cand we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work.\u201d\n\nRELATED \u2013 Photos From Real Housewives of New York Reunion\n\nPersonally, I think Luann got caught up in the idea of finding love again, and when Tom cheated, she dug her heels in to prove their love was real and avoid embarrassment. Luann didn\u2019t appear to be faking happiness. It\u2019s sad they could not work it out, but it was probably for the best. Perhaps the third time\u2019s a charm for the Countess no-more!\n\nLuann changed her last name back to \u201cde Lesseps\u201d on Twitter and Instagram, so that means this divorce is like for-realz, y\u2019all!\n\nTELL US \u2013 DO YOU THINK LUANN ONLY MARRIED TOM FOR RHONY?! WAS SHE UNFAITHFUL AND ABUSIVE?\n\n[Photo Credit: Instagram]", "images": ["https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2020/04/rhony-sonja-236x140.jpg", "https://secure-au.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-evolve&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/facebook-icon.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/rss-icon.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/logo-th.svg", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2020/02/Realitytea.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/twitter-icon.svg", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/pinterest-icon.svg", "https://cdn1-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2020/04/rhobh-garcelle-236x140.jpg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2020/03/NUP_189419_2687-e1585426776960-236x140.jpg", "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/luann-de-lesseps-tom-d-agostino-happier-times-min-1.jpg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/wp-content/themes/realitytea/images/svg/logo-stacked.svg", "https://cdn2-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8309-236x140.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036161&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/luann-de-lesseps-tom-d-agostino-happier-times-min-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mary Mcclelland"], "canonical_link": "https://www.realitytea.com/2017/08/07/tom-dagostino-denies-cheating-abuse-ended-marriage-luann-de-lesseps/", "title": "Tom D'Agostino Denies Cheating & Abuse Ended Marriage To Luann de Lesseps", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=1.0,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Tom D'Agostino denies explosive report that claims cheating and abuse ended his marriage to Luann de Lesseps!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tom D'Agostino Denies Cheating & Abuse Ended Marriage To Luann de Lesseps", "description": "Tom D'Agostino denies explosive report that claims cheating and abuse ended his marriage to Luann de Lesseps!", "url": "https://www.realitytea.com/2017/08/07/tom-dagostino-denies-cheating-abuse-ended-marriage-luann-de-lesseps/", "site_name": "Reality Tea", "updated_time": "2017-08-07T13:54:21-05:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/luann-de-lesseps-tom-d-agostino-happier-times-min-1.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/luann-de-lesseps-tom-d-agostino-happier-times-min-1.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 365}}, "article": {"tag": "Tom D'Agostino Jr.", "section": "Real Housewives of New York", "published_time": "2017-08-07T14:00:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-07T13:54:21-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 448899675149426}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Tom D'Agostino denies explosive report that claims cheating and abuse ended his marriage to Luann de Lesseps!", "title": "Tom D'Agostino Denies Cheating & Abuse Ended Marriage To Luann de Lesseps", "image": "https://cdn3-www.realitytea.com/assets/uploads/2017/08/luann-de-lesseps-tom-d-agostino-happier-times-min-1.jpg"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.14", "google-site-verification": "LBqyyLK8qWrqIWY868cC4RSBMNqyCO6IaDcvqmgonVc"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502035200.0, "source": "https://www.realitytea.com", "summary": ""}
