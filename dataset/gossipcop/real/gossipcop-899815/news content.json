Thank you Harry for stepping in to host the show at 2 and a half hours notice!\u201d (Harry Styles hosted the show on Tuesday night.)\n\nToday we welcomed a beautiful baby daughter into the world. Both she and her mother are doing great. We can\u2019t stop smiling. Thank you Harry for stepping in to host the show at 2 and a half hours notice! x x x \u2014 James Corden (@JKCorden) December 13, 2017\n\nA rep for the 39-year-old Late Late Show host and actress confirmed in July that the pair were expecting their third bundle of joy. They are already parents of son Max, 6, and daughter Carey, 3. In September, Corden revealed the sex of the couple\u2019s child to Extra\u2019s Mario Lopez while appearing on the red carpet at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be arriving Christmas \u2013 we\u2019re very excited. It will be great, lovely,\u201d the TV personality, who was also on hosting duty, gushed. \u201cWe\u2019re having a little girl, it\u2019s going to be terrific.\u201d\n\nCorden continued: \u201cI\u2019m here with my wife and she\u2019s five months pregnant, so it\u2019s mostly just thinking of places that I could hide snacks. Because she\u2019s gonna get hungry every seven minutes\u2026 It\u2019s just I will face the wrath if she\u2019s not fed.\u201d\n\nCorden and Carey tied the knot in September 2012. He opened up about their relationship during a Rolling Stone interview in August 2016. \u201cI could never understand when I watch romantic comedies the notion that for some reason unattractive or heavy people don\u2019t fall in love,\u201d he said at the time.\u201cIf they do, it\u2019s in some odd, kooky, roundabout way \u2014 and it\u2019s not. It\u2019s exactly the same. I met my wife; she barely owned a television and worked for Save the Children. We sat down one night and we fell in love and that was it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C1136px%2C596px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C1136px%2C596px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/james-corden-wife-julia-carey-welcome-third-child/", "title": "James Corden, Wife Julia Carey Welcome Third Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "James Corden, and his wife, Julia Carey, have welcomed their third child together \u2014 get the details!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "James Cordan and Wife Julia Carey Welcome Third Child", "description": "James Corden, and his wife, Julia Carey, have welcomed their third child together \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/james-corden-wife-julia-carey-welcome-third-child/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:10:36+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C1136px%2C596px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C1136px%2C596px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marc.lupo.9", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-12-13T02:53:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:10:36+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "James Corden, and his wife, Julia Carey, have welcomed their third child together \u2014 get the details!", "title": "James Cordan and Wife Julia Carey Welcome Third Child", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/james-corden.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C1136px%2C596px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@Marcandrewlupo"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513133622.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
