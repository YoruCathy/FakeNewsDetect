The memory is still fresh, so when Harry Styles performed at the arena on April 9, he gave a tribute to the victims and survivors.\n\n\u201cI grew up coming to my first concerts in this room, I love this room,\u201d Styles said on stage. \u201cThe next song that we\u2019re going to play, I wrote a few years ago, and I gave it to a singer called Ariana Grande. She sang it a few times, and now we\u2019re going to do our version of it for you \u2014 and if you can find some way to join in please do so. I stand with you, Manchester.\u201d\n\nStyles proceeded to cover \u201cJust a Little Bit of My Heart,\u201d a song from Grande\u2019s 2014 album My Everything that he co-wrote. Styles has been covering the song consistently on his current tour, but the track had extra resonance in Manchester given what happened to Grande\u2019s concert on May 22, 2017.\n\nMusic had always been part of the recovery process for Manchester. Just two weeks after the original attack, Grande assembled a benefit concert of musical all-stars \u2014 including Mumford & Sons, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, and Chris Martin, among others \u2014 to raise money for victims.\n\nWatch Styles\u2019 heartfelt performance above.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fgettyimages-876613748-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fgettyimages-876613748-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christian Holub"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/music/2018/04/11/harry-styles-honors-manchester-bombing-victims/", "title": "Harry Styles honors bombing victims at Manchester show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Harry Styles", "news_keywords": "Harry Styles", "description": "The singer covered Ariana Grande's 'Just a Little Bit of Your Heart' in the arena where her concert was attacked last year", "og": {"title": "Harry Styles honors bombing victims at Manchester show", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/04/11/harry-styles-honors-manchester-bombing-victims/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FvH5hnXES8?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent It\u2019s been almost a year since Ariana Grande\u2019s concert at the Manchester Arena was attacked by an explosion that left 22 dead and many&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fgettyimages-876613748-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/04/11/harry-styles-honors-manchester-bombing-victims/", "description": "The singer covered Ariana Grande's 'Just a Little Bit of Your Heart' in the arena where her concert was attacked last year", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fgettyimages-876613748-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/music/2018/04/11/harry-styles-honors-manchester-bombing-victims/", "title": "Harry Styles honors bombing victims at Manchester show", "description": "The singer covered Ariana Grande's 'Just a Little Bit of Your Heart' in the arena where her concert was attacked last year", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fgettyimages-876613748-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FvH5hnXES8"], "publish_date": 1523376000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
