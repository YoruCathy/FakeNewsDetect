Stefani dropped the asking price to $29 million earlier this year.\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nDesigner Kelly Wearstler lent her trademark glam to the 10-bedroom house, which is a whirlwind of marble facades, graphic patterns, and neon colors. The decor ranges from Hollywood regency to space age to ultra modern. Floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto the San Fenando valley, and vaulted ceilings, skylights, and hardwood flooring complete the package.\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nSix of the bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, and the master bedroom boasts a walk-in closet with chic carpeting and wood paneling. The black-and-white striped kitchen is a true show stopper though, with hidden storage space and an adjoining breakfast room with a built-in leather banquette.\n\nJennifer Lopez also once owned the estate, which checks off the necessary criteria of a celebrity home in Cali: a home gym and screening room, thick hedges shielding the pool from view, a 250-foot private driveway, and a gated entry to keep the paps at bay.\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nThe backyard area is also nicer than most tropical resorts, complete with an infinity pool, a full tennis court, chicken coop, detached guest house, and a playground for Stefani\u2019s children. If you need further proof that Stefani lived here, just take in the statement outdoor pizza oven.\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nStephen Shapiro of Westside Estate Agency holds the listing.\n\nSee more photos below.\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nSimon Berlyn\n\nh/t: Domino\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gwen-stefani-main-1523982216.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gwen-stefani-main-1523982216.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danielle Fox"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elledecor.com/celebrity-style/celebrity-homes/a19840971/gwen-stefani-gavin-rossdale-home/", "title": "See Inside Gwen Stefani's Over-The-Top Beverly Hills Mansion", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE Decor", "title": "See Inside Gwen Stefani's Over-The-Top Beverly Hills Mansion", "description": "The home she shared with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale is on the market for $29 million.
