He teased at a possible retirement before last season, but opted instead to sign a 1-year, $10 million contract with Miami. The Vanderbilt graduate was expected to become an analyst for FOX before returning to football.\n\nCutler has played 12 seasons in the NFL for the Broncos, Chicago Bears and Dolphins. He has made just two playoff game appearances, throwing for a combined 354 yards, two touchdowns and one interception.\n\nLast season, Cutler took over the starting role from the injured Ryan Tannehill and threw for 2,666 yards, 19 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.", "images": ["https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTkzNzM5NDk0ODYwNzAx/chicago-bears-jay-cutler-practice-limitedjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTAyNTgzMzc3MDc3NjMy/jay-cutler-future-retirement-television-broadcasting-careerjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTA2ODE2NjA0MzQ5NzEz/jay-cutler-nfl-career-bears-broncos-fox-retirementjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTA2MzI1NjQzNDM3NDQw/jay-cutler-bears-releasedjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_600/MTY3NDcxMDIwMjQ3MDk4OTky/si_logo_60x600_red.png", "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDMxNjIwODU5MjQxODU2/jay-cutler-retirementjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTY3NDQ0MjMyMjY3NjM4Mzg0/si_mobile_sticky_nav_logo_435x100-1.svg", "https://www.si.com/assets-global/play-button-blk.svg?v=2020-04-17-205441-3d5ce40-015427", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTI1OTkzMzY2NzI2MDE2/adam-gase-jay-cutler-chicago-bearsjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTk5MDY3NDAzNjkxOTA1/jay-cutler-trade-market-titans-interest.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTkzNjA0MjAzMjU5ODA1/bears-jay-cutler-struggles-future.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTY4MTk1ODkzNDI2OTg4OTI5/bears-jay-cutler-struggles-future.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDMxNjIwODU5MjQxODU2/jay-cutler-retirementjpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nihal Kolur"], "canonical_link": "https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/04/27/jay-cutler-retirement-television-return", "title": "Report: Jay Cutler Expected to Retire, May Return to TV", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "Zxtw3BlUC0tAgI2yiNKzgXU8BuqxJ_-54-jrOZ6BN1E", "generator": "Tempest - www.saymedia.com", "pinterest": "nohover", "author": "Nihal Kolur", "description": "Cutler flirted with retirement before joining the Dolphins last season.", "keywords": "jay cutler retirement,jay cutler fox,Jay Cutler,jay cutler tv,NFL,jay cutler nfl,jay cutler bears", "section": "NFL", "pagetype": "article", "item-id": "ci0254f7e530052580", "published": "2018-04-27T17:25:49Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "ABG-SI LLC.
