It just piles up.\u201d In fact, he admits he sees the Oscar statue everywhere, burns his tux, and feels like he\u2019s losing his mind. \u201cThe worst part is,\u201d he concludes, \u201cthey want me to do it again.\u201d\n\nOf course, all of this just falls on deaf ears. As it turns out, Kimmel\u2019s been talking to Warren Beatty, himself an Oscar winner and one of the presenters, along with Faye Dunaway, who read the wrong name and ushered the La La Land crew on stage last year. Beatty\u2019s moved on much faster than Kimmel has, it seems: \u201cI don\u2019t care what you do,\u201d he tells the repeat Oscar host. \u201cJust get out of my house.\u201d\n\nWatch the full promo above. The 90th Oscars telecast airs Sunday, March 4, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fkimmel5-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F01%2Fkimmel5-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Li"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/oscars/2018/01/23/oscars-2018-jimmy-kimmel-warren-beatty-promo/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel can't get over last year's Best Picture blunder in new Oscars promo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel talks to Warren Beatty \u2014 not his therapist \u2014\u00a0about the trauma of the 2017 Oscars telecast, when the wrong Best Picture winner was announced", "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel can't get over last year's Best Picture blunder in new Oscars promo", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2018/01/23/oscars-2018-jimmy-kimmel-warren-beatty-promo/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGZ1xaJglLU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent Jimmy Kimmel still has last year\u2019s Oscars on his mind.
