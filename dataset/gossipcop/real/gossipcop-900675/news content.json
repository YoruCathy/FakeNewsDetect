She accused Simmons of inappropriate touching her in an interview on November 1.\n\nAs she spoke to Simmons and bandmate Paul Stanley, the woman claims that Simmons touched her and \u201cturned standard interview questions into sexual innuendos.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, The Blast has secured court documents to confirm that Simmons has reached a settlement. The settlement amount is yet to be announced.\n\nSimmons has denied the claims, and at the time insisted that he intented to \u201cdefend myself against any alleged charges you may have been reading about in the media.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Simmons spoke out on the MeToo movement.\n\nThe rock \u2018n\u2019 roll legend admits that the movements are generally forces for good, but has slammed the \u201ccollateral damage\u201d of those he sees as falsely accused, as \u201cthere\u2019s no presumption of innocence\u201d.\n\nLet me put it bluntly. I think the shitstorm is going to be here for a while and the pendulum will finally get to reality after,\u201d Simmons said during a press event. \u201cRight now it\u2019s in the extreme. But I\u2019m the last guy to understand any of this stuff.\u201d Advertisement \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful for women to be engaged in the conversation and the positive side is there have been a lot of bad guys who have gotten away with it (and aren\u2019t anymore) \u2013 that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d the KISS co-founder says. He added, \u201cThe collateral damage is heinous because anybody can say anything and there\u2019s no presumption of innocence. That\u2019s the problem; the problem is you don\u2019t have your day in court.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-850457484-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-850457484.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-850457484.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Reilly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/kiss-gene-simmons-settles-sexual-assault-lawsuit-2352371", "title": "Kiss\u2019 Gene Simmons settles sexual assault lawsuit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "KISS star Gene Simmons has reportedly settled a lawsuit that accused him of sexual assault.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Kiss' Gene Simmons settles sexual assault lawsuit", "description": "KISS star Gene Simmons has reportedly settled a lawsuit that accused him of sexual assault.", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/kiss-gene-simmons-settles-sexual-assault-lawsuit-2352371", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-850457484.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-850457484.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "Music News", "published_time": "2018-07-10T09:29:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "KISS star Gene Simmons has reportedly settled a lawsuit that accused him of sexual assault.", "title": "Kiss' Gene Simmons settles sexual assault lawsuit", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-850457484.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531214998.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
