On the talk show, Julie Chen asked Smith if he ever asked Jeff Probst or the show\u2019s producers not air the segment that effectively outed him to the world. Smith\u2019s answer is transcribed in full below:\n\nI love Survivor and I was drawn to apply to Survivor because of the integrity in the storytelling. And when I first applied, I didn\u2019t tell casting that I was trans. That was developed later in our relationship. And I had a chat with Jeff Probst in which we agreed if, how, and when I\u2019m gonna talk about this part of my life\u2014it\u2019s gonna be up to me, as opposed to being outed by a fellow contestant being the exception. But in the aftermath of being outed, I\u2019ve been granted unprecedented autonomy in how I wanted to tell my story. We started having conversations all the way back in Fiji nine months ago about the care with which this episode was going to be handled. I came to Jeff and asked if I could write a personal essay about what happened and he immediately said yes. And I was really proud of how I responded. And I wanted the world to see how much I\u2019d grown and I also thought by showing what happened, maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen to someone else and something good could come of it.\n\nSo that\u2019s neither a yes or no, and in many ways brings up more questions, such how these conversations started all those months ago after the events that aired during the episode took place. Was it with CBS saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re definitely airing this footage, so you can either work with us or...not\u201d? Now that both Varner and Smith have explained themselves, it seems that CBS should take some responsibility and do the same.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/rbufftbk6azitlxqxh8n.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/rbufftbk6azitlxqxh8n.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://jezebel.com/zeke-smith-says-he-had-unprecedented-autonomy-in-tellin-1794306581", "title": "Zeke Smith Says He Had 'Unprecedented Autonomy' in Telling the Story of His Survivor Outing", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "qtdmeMUkQ1jhQhHGFHv6CO2FpKGPcUfc9TYEabpRR0A", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/pch44wvo0v6acpdlt0f6.png", "keywords": "Zeke Smith, Survivor, Jeff Probst, The Talk, Transgender rights, Transgender people, Reality TV, Outing, CBS, Julie Chen, Jezebel", "news_keywords": "Zeke Smith, Survivor, Jeff Probst, The Talk, Transgender rights, Transgender people, Reality TV, Outing, CBS, Julie Chen, Jezebel", "twitter": {"url": "https://jezebel.com/zeke-smith-says-he-had-unprecedented-autonomy-in-tellin-1794306581", "card": "summary", "site": "@jezebel", "title": "Zeke Smith Says He Had 'Unprecedented Autonomy' in Telling the Story of His Survivor Outing", "description": "The big question regarding last night\u2019s Survivor scandal, in which contestant Zeke Smith was outed as trans by his fellow contestant Jeff Varner, was how much culpability could be placed on CBS for airing the outing of a man who started his lengthy Hollywood Reporter essay on the matter with, \u201cI\u2019m not wild about you knowing that I\u2019m trans.\u201d Writing about this earlier today, I wondered how much agency Smith had in this matter.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/rbufftbk6azitlxqxh8n.jpg"}, "description": "The big question regarding last night\u2019s Survivor scandal, in which contestant Zeke Smith was outed as trans by his fellow contestant Jeff Varner, was how much culpability could be placed on CBS for airing the outing of a man who started his lengthy Hollywood Reporter essay on the matter with, \u201cI\u2019m not wild about you knowing that I\u2019m trans.\u201d Writing about this earlier today, I wondered how much agency Smith had in this matter.", "og": {"title": "Zeke Smith Says He Had 'Unprecedented Autonomy' in Telling the Story of His Survivor Outing", "type": "article", "url": "https://jezebel.com/zeke-smith-says-he-had-unprecedented-autonomy-in-tellin-1794306581", "description": "The big question regarding last night\u2019s Survivor scandal, in which contestant Zeke Smith was outed as trans by his fellow contestant Jeff Varner, was how much culpability could be placed on CBS for airing the outing of a man who started his lengthy Hollywood Reporter essay on the matter with, \u201cI\u2019m not wild about you knowing that I\u2019m trans.\u201d Writing about this earlier today, I wondered how much agency Smith had in this matter.", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "Jezebel", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/rbufftbk6azitlxqxh8n.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 40338819712}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://jezebel.com", "summary": ""}
