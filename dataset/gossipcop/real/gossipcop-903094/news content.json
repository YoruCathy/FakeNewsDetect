Black Mirror also won the award for outstanding TV movie for \u201cSan Junipero\u201d in 2017.\n\nIn \u201cUSS Callister,\u201d Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) is the chief technical officer of a gaming company who is the starship captain in a virtual reality world. Digital clones of his real-life coworkers make up the virtual crew of the ship. While he\u2019s bossed around in real life, he\u2019s the one in charge in his video game.\n\nThe episode also stars Cristin Milioti as a coworker who leads a rebellion against Daly in the virtual world and destroys the DNA samples he has of his coworkers in his apartment in the real world. Jimmi Simpson plays Daly\u2019s real-life boss.\n\nThe potential of the story to continue was also addressed when Netflix first released the episode. \u201cI was talking with Louise Sutton, who produced this and \u2018Metalhead,\u2019 and she cooked up the brilliant idea of spinning it off into a TV series,\u201d director Toby Haynes told The Hollywood Reporter in January. \u201cI\u2019d love to do a TV series of \u2018USS Callister\u2019\u2014it\u2019s probably one of the best pilots for a space show ever. \u2026 I think Charlie [Brooker] might revisit it as a Black Mirror.\u201d\n\nWhile the episode ended with Daly defeated in and unable to leave the virtual reality, its director wouldn\u2019t rule out seeing Plemons if there is a series or sequel. \u201cThat\u2019s the fun of it, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what this idea is,\u201d Haynes said to the publication. \u201cThere is this brilliant idea that he is still alive, and his attempted murder gets pinned on someone. Whose fingerprints do they find in the apartment? There\u2019s so much you could do.\u201d\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nJonathan Prime / Netflix\n\nMilioti would like to reprise her role and explore that point from Haynes. \u201cIf this were ever a spinoff, in the fake world she would be kicking ass and battling aliens,\u201d she told THR in December. \u201cAnd then there is the real world where her prints have been found inside Daly\u2019s apartment. He\u2019s dead in his apartment and she has to figure that out.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/gettyimages-73355638_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/22/image-00_2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/09/10/blackmirrors4callister00658v1-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/santa-ana-high-school-principal-racism-trump-build-wall.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/09/25-most-powerful-passports-world.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/02/21/worlds-highest-paid-actors_29.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/01/03/black-mirror-callister2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/12/29/black-mirror-uss.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/11/trailer-large-image_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/06/13/6-13-17-black-mirror-book-series.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/rts20nl9_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/kevin-hassett.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/07/16/image-00_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/could-jay-manuel-return-americas-next-top-model.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/15/queen-elizabeth-ii-slideshow-cover.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/1127181968b.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/daniel-brayn-wwe-2k19.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/09/10/blackmirrors4callister00552v1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/09/10/gettyimages-495337030.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149im_/https://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/09/10/blackmirrors4callister00658v1-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180910200149/https://www.newsweek.com/uss-callister-spinoff-possible-1114207", "title": "Will 'Black Mirror's' 'USS Callister' Become a Series?
