There is an underlying buzz of a thing,\u201d he told Colbert. \u201cAnd I keep reminding myself of it. Like, I kind of forget and then I\u2019m like, \u2018We really did it! We\u2019re a legal thing, just like Mom and Dad were or whatever.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe went on to describe the sensation he feels being married, one that he equates to a sense of \u201cdivinity.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be in love, to find a love in that way, is as close to anything I can imagine doing in life that brings me close to the feeling of God \u2014 or whatever that is for you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we first got together, I remember lying in bed and closing my eyes but not being asleep. And that sensation of \u2018light.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on exactly, but it\u2019s sort of close to eternal,\u2019 \u201d Parsons continued. \u201cMy dad had passed a couple of years before I met Todd. And I remember very early on that sensation I would have when I closed my eyes and I felt that light, it was like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s him.\u2019 He\u2019s going like, \u2018Hi, I see. All good. This is a great thing.\u2019 And it both was and it wasn\u2019t, obviously \u2026 but I still feel that now. Maybe not as often, because life gets in the way. But sometimes that sensation in closing the eyes and going, \u2018This is so close to God.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhile Parsons admitted to Colbert he \u201cdidn\u2019t know any other word for it,\u201d Colbert had an answer.\n\n\u201cLove,\u201d the 53-year-old talk show host responded.\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs weeknights (11:35 p.m. ET) and The Big Bang Theory returns Monday at 8 p.m. ET, both on CBS.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1611&h=843&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fjim-parsons-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1611&h=843&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fjim-parsons-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/jim-parsons-opens-up-about-todd-spiewak-marriage/", "title": "Jim Parsons Explains Why He and Todd Spiewak Waited Nearly 15 Years to Get Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jim Parsons,News,The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,TV", "news_keywords": "Jim Parsons,News,The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,TV", "description": "The Big Bang Theory star and Spiewak said their \"I dos\" in May\u00a0at the Rainbow Room in New York City", "og": {"title": "Jim Parsons Explains Why He and Todd Spiewak Waited Nearly 15 Years to Get Married", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/jim-parsons-opens-up-about-todd-spiewak-marriage/", "description": "Jim Parsons&nbsp;and his husband&nbsp;Todd Spiewak&nbsp;were together for nearly 15 years before they decided to finally tie the knot&nbsp;earlier this year \u2014 and according to the&nbsp;Big&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1611&h=843&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fjim-parsons-2000.jpg", "width": 1611, "height": 843}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/jim-parsons-opens-up-about-todd-spiewak-marriage/", "description": "The Big Bang Theory star and Spiewak said their \"I dos\" in May\u00a0at the Rainbow Room in New York City", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fjim-parsons-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/jim-parsons-opens-up-about-todd-spiewak-marriage/", "title": "Jim Parsons Explains Why He and Todd Spiewak Waited Nearly 15 Years to Get Married", "description": "The Big Bang Theory star and Spiewak said their \"I dos\" in May\u00a0at the Rainbow Room in New York City", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1611&h=843&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fjim-parsons-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUDQvKtkMwE"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
