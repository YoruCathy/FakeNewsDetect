The season finale revealed that Jerrika Hinton\u2019s Dr. Stephanie Edwards is leaving her job and the medical profession entirely. The storyline comes as the actress is exiting the ABC series for a role in Alan Ball\u2019s new HBO drama, as Variety previously reported.\n\nIn Thursday night\u2019s episode, after fighting off a rapist and dodging an explosion, Edwards spent the season-ender ignoring her own life-threatening burns to save a little girl \u2014 which she did, by the way \u2014 in the process, she realized what she wants out of life: to stop spending all her time in hospitals.\n\nAs for Hinton, the actress joined \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d in 2012. She expanded her Shondaland relationship last season when she was cast as the lead in the company\u2019s comedy pilot \u201cToast,\u201d which ultimately did not go to series.\n\nRegarding Hinton\u2019s exit, in a statement provided to Variety, series creator Shonda Rhimes said: \u201cActors evolve differently and when an actor like Jerrika comes to me and says she wants to try something new creatively, I like to honor that. Jerrika has shared so much of herself with Stephanie and I am incredibly proud of the journey we\u2019ve taken together. While I\u2019m sad to see Stephanie leave Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, I am excited to see what\u2019s next for Jerrika.\u201d\n\nHere, Hinton fights back tears as she speaks to Variety about her decision to leave \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d her new HBO series, and why you shouldn\u2019t expect to see Edwards back in Seattle any time soon\u2026\n\nWhen did you decide to leave the show?\n\nShonda and I met almost a year ago now, and we had a very lengthy and gratifying and really splendid conversation about work and creative process. She was immensely supportive of my wishes, and she\u2019s really lovely, Shonda. Every private conversation I\u2019ve had with her has left with me feeling just heard and seen and respected as a human being and as an artist, and I really appreciate that.\n\nHave we seen the last of Edwards full time, or could we see her come back in a guest role?\n\nI genuinely don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I will say, though, that because of the nature of her injuries and because of what she says she wants to experience in her next chapter of life, if we do see her come back through those doors, it will be a long time. I think that she needs to heal. She needs to heal in a variety of ways before that place becomes a viable option again.\n\nCan you pinpoint a favorite moment you had with your character over the years?\n\nTo be honest, that final scene \u2026 with Jim Pickens [who plays Dr. Webber], that stands out in my memory. That was, for a scene that\u2019s so weighty, so heavy, tapping into it was a beautifully straightforward process. Jim is a fantastic scene partner. I always feel very safe with him. And Debbie [Allen, who directed the episode], the way that Debbie really just let us do what we needed to do allowed for all elements to really coalesce. And I haven\u2019t seen it, [so] I hope that it comes across on screen. But on the day, shooting that was lovely.\n\nDo you have a favorite memory from your time on the show?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna have an opportunity to talk about what I will miss about Stephanie, is that okay? I\u2019m gonna miss \u2014 wow, I didn\u2019t expect this. I\u2019m feeling emotional now. Need to go grab some Kleenex. I think I\u2019m just gonna miss her willingness to go the extra mile for what she believes in. I think it\u2019s a quality that has been there from day one. I was thinking about this a few weeks ago, and something I remember from back in Season 9 is the way she really rallied Leah and Joe when Shane was going through a hard time. She told them not to give up and that we are all a part of this together. \u2026 I think that she has such great fortitude and empathy and brilliance, and she\u2019s just, I think, for all of the folly of youth that she has, she\u2019s such a wonderful person. I was friends with her, and that\u2019s a great compliment because I choose friends carefully.\n\nCan you tease anything about your HBO show?\n\nI will say this: Five years of working in Shondaland makes me nervous about teasing things. I think I can, but all of my instincts in my body say, \u201cKeep your mouth shut,\u201d and I\u2019ve gotta work on letting go of that. But it\u2019s a really wonderful new project. It\u2019s a new drama from Alan Ball, who is a phenomenal writer. And I will say that we\u2019ve already started working on it, and it\u2019s genuinely been a gratifying, collaborative, generous, and welcoming experience, and I feel so fortunate. I used to say, all the time, that being welcomed into Shondaland felt like winning the lottery, and I still feel that way. And now, moving from there to this, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s beyond the lottery.\n\nEven though you\u2019re leaving, do you have any intel on \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d Season 14?\n\nI literally have zero idea, and I have not asked because I don\u2019t work there anymore. When I worked there, I would ask all of those questions, and now that I don\u2019t, it\u2019s a beautiful mystery.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/greys-anatomy-finale.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fgreys-anatomy-season-finale-stephanie-edwards-jerrika-hinton-leaving-1202434888%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202434888&comment_count=14", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/greys-anatomy-finale.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jean Bentley"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/greys-anatomy-season-finale-stephanie-edwards-jerrika-hinton-leaving-1202434888/", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Season 13 Finale Says Goodbye to Another Cast Member (SPOILERS)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jerrika Hinton is leaving \"Grey's Anatomy.\" The actress spoke to Variety about her exit and the Season 13 finale.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202434888, "author": "Jean Bentley", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-05-18T18:00:19"}, "pmc-tag": "ABC,Grey's Anatomy,Jerrika Hinton", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Season 13 Finale Says Goodbye to Another Cast Member (SPOILERS)", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Season 13 Finale Says Goodbye to Another Cast Member (SPOILERS)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/greys-anatomy-season-finale-stephanie-edwards-jerrika-hinton-leaving-1202434888/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT:\u00a0Do not\u00a0read ahead, if you have not watched the season finale of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d Season 13, which aired on\u00a0Thursday, May 18.
