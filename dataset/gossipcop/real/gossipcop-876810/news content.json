One in particular: the introduction of new character Toni Topaz, who reportedly gets close to Jughead while he's at Southside High \u2014 and causes a rift between him and Betty Cooper, AKA Bughead.\n\nBughead fandom was already intense, even before fans learned that actors Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart were dating in real life too. Vanessa Morgan, the actress who's playing Toni (and who's also on The Shannara Chronicles), hasn't even appeared on the show yet but is already feeling the Bughead backlash, which sometimes even comes in the form of death threats. Over a fictional couple in a fiction show.\n\nIf that seems a little much, Morgan's like, yeah me too. In an interview with Glamour, she shared:\n\n\"I\u2019ve already had some death threats. But the thing is, it's half death threats because they don't want that [actually] happening, and there's half that's just all love. Who knows if [my character coming between Bughead] is even going to happen. People are just jumping to conclusions.\"\n\nThat is a pretty damn chill response to death threats, but Morgan shares that this hasn't affected her relationships with her actual cast members:\n\n\"Lili and Cole are awesome, and they have been nothing but welcoming to me. It\u2019s great doing scenes with them. I feel lucky that everyone has been so nice. And Madelaine Petsch [who plays Cheryl Blossom] is my best friend in real life!\"\n\nWith friends by her side, Morgan hopes to focus on what matters most \u2014 doing well by Toni and her bisexual representation:\n\n\"I hope the lesson is, Don't judge a book by its cover, by someone's upbringing, or by who they love. I hope people watch Toni and think, Why are we judging people? I would love that if people took that from my character.\"\n\n\n\nFollow Lilian on Twitter.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.662xh;0,0.0215xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.662xh;0,0.0215xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lilian Min", "I'M The Night Shift At Cosmopolitan.Com", "A Writer", "Reporter Around The Web."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a12114325/riverdale-actress-bughead-death-threats/", "title": "This Riverdale Actress Says She's Getting Death Threats Because of Bughead", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "This \"Riverdale\" Actress Says She's Getting Death Threats Because of Bughead", "description": "Vanessa Morgan plays newcomer Toni Topaz.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a12114325/riverdale-actress-bughead-death-threats/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.662xh;0,0.0215xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-03-16 05:31:08", "published_time": "2017-08-30 03:22:24", "section": "TV", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.662xh;0,0.0215xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "This Riverdale Actress Says She's Getting Death Threats Because of Bughead", "description": "Vanessa Morgan plays newcomer Toni Topaz.", "keywords": "Riverdale, Vanessa Morgan, riverdale season two, riverdale s2, riverdale bughead, riverdale jughead, bughead", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=0.761xw:1.00xh;0.143xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,tv,Vanessa Morgan,Riverdale", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-30T03:22:24Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.662xh;0,0.0215xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bughead-1504057467.jpg?crop=0.761xw:1.00xh;0.143xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "This \"Riverdale\" Actress Says She's Getting Death Threats Because of Bughead", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504034544.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
