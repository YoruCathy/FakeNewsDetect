Relationships come and go but friendship is always there,\" she explains.\n\nMarie Claire UK/ David Roemer\n\nIt's no surprise that Turner and Williams have become such good friends. The actresses have spent nearly half their lives playing Sansa and Arya Stark, respectively.\n\n\"[Game of Thrones] has been a huge chunk of my life,\" Turner admits.\"When it's done, it's going to feel like a death in the family. I just completely gave everything to [playing Sansa Stark], all of my emotions. I never used to cry when I was younger. Now I cry all the time -- I am an emotional human being.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Maisie Williams Wishes Sophie Turner a Happy 21st Birthday With Amazing Throwback Snap -- See the Pic!\n\n\"There was a period in my life when I was 14/15, and I was like, 'I want to be seen as a real actress -- I can't f**k around. This is my career,'\" she says. \"Now I'm like, 'Just enjoy it,' the painful part is finding another job. There's a certain sense when you're 15 and you're just kind of like, a pawn, and you'll say, 'Yeah, I will do what you want,' but now I'm like, 'You know, actually I don't like this.'\"\n\nTurner's X-Men co-star, Jennifer Lawrence, seems to have rubbed off on her.\n\n\"She would do a take and be like, 'Cut! That was such bad acting!'\" Turner recalls. \"Her being able to stop [the scene]; it was inspiring to see someone so in control.\"\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Watch Sophie Turner's Emotional Audition for 'X-Men: Apocalypse'", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2017-07/sophie_turner_marie_claire_cover.jpg?itok=205L6RkO", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg?itok=SKnoHmbs", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg?itok=FC09ntt1"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg?itok=SKnoHmbs", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220989_sophie_turner_opens_up_about_dating_joe_jonas_you_feel_like_you_re_living_a_fishbowl", "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220989_sophie_turner_opens_up_about_dating_joe_jonas_you_feel_like_you_re_living_a_fishbowl", "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl'", "description": "The actress also dishes on the final seasons of 'Game of Thrones' and what she learned from Jennifer Lawrence.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg?itok=SKnoHmbs", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actress also dishes on the final seasons of 'Game of Thrones' and what she learned from Jennifer Lawrence.", "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220989_sophie_turner_opens_up_about_dating_joe_jonas_you_feel_like_you_re_living_a_fishbowl", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg?itok=SKnoHmbs"}, "description": "The actress also dishes on the final seasons of 'Game of Thrones' and what she learned from Jennifer Lawrence.", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Joe Jonas, Game Of Thrones", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
