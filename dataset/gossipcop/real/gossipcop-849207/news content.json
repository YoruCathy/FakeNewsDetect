Those numbers were good enough to top CBS and NBC in the hour in both measures, but were still well short of what \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d has been drawing in the same time slot. The freshman medical drama closed out its first season last week averaging a 1.8 and 9.8 million viewers per episode.\n\nNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d (1.9, 9.9 million) was steady with last week and was the top show of the night. \u201cGood Girls\u201d (0.9, 4.3 million) was even at 10.\n\nOn The CW, \u201cLegends of Tomorrow\u201d (0.4, 1.3 million) was even. The special \u201cPenn & Teller: April Fool Us Day\u201d drew a 0.3 and 920,000 viewers.\n\nCBS aired mostly repeats except for a new episode of \u201cLiving Biblically\u201d (0.8, 3.2 million).\n\nFox aired only repeats.\n\nNBC topped the night with a 1.5 and 8 million viewers. ABC was second with a 1.3 and 6.5 million. CBS was third with a 0.9 and 5.5 million. Fox was fourth with a 0.4 and 1.7 million. The CW averaged a 0.3 and 1.1 million.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-crossing-abc.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fthe-crossing-american-idol-ratings-abc-1202742291%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202742291&comment_count=14", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-crossing-abc.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-crossing-american-idol-ratings-abc-1202742291/", "title": "TV Ratings: \u2018The Crossing\u2019 Gets OK Start as \u2018American Idol\u2019 Hits New Low", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"American Idol\" and the series debut of \"The Crossing\" made for a lackluster night in the Monday overnight Nielsen ratings for ABC.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202742291, "author": "Joe Otterson", "pmc-category": "News,Ratings", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-04-03T08:38:50"}, "pmc-tag": "ABC,American Idol,The Crossing", "title": "TV Ratings: \u2018The Crossing\u2019 Gets OK Start as \u2018American Idol\u2019 Hits New Low", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music,tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TV Ratings: \u2018The Crossing\u2019 Gets OK Start as \u2018American Idol\u2019 Hits New Low", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-crossing-american-idol-ratings-abc-1202742291/", "description": "\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and the series debut of \u201cThe Crossing\u201d did not make for an effective combination for ABC in the Monday overnight ratings. \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d drew a \u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-crossing-abc.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "THE CROSSING - \"Pilot\" - Refugees from a war-torn country seek asylum in a small American fishing town, only the country these people are from is America... and the war they are fleeing hasn't happened yet..
