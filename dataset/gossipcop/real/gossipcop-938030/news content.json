Rodgers, a 20-year-old Texas woman, filed a suit in a New York court. Rodgers said she was 19 when she started a relationship with Kelly.\n\n>> Read more trending news\n\nNYT reported that, according to the filing, Rodgers said she met Kelly in March 2017 after he performed in San Antonio, Texas. She said she was flown to New York by Kelly after months of phone contact. It was in New York that Rodgers alleges Kelly \u201cinitiated unwanted sexual contact\u201d in a hotel room and did not tell Rodgers he was infected with herpes. The suit claims she contracted the disease.\n\n\u201cHe turns on all the lights ...And he\u2019s like, \u2018Take off your clothes.\u2019 And he says it, you know, with authority in his voice,\u201d Rodgers told CBS News Tuesday. \u201cNot just, you know, he\u2019s demanding me to do this. And I didn\u2019t take off my clothes because why would I? I just wasn\u2019t ready\u2026 Sex isn\u2019t something, you know, I\u2019m ready for.\u201d\n\nRodgers said she ultimately submitted and had sex with Kelly even though she didn\u2019t want to. She claimed Kelly recorded the act on his iPad without her consent.\n\nRodgers said after the incident, Kelly asked how old she was.\n\n\u201cI told him and he\u2019s like, \u2018You know, if you\u2019re really, you know, 16, that you can tell daddy, right?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018You know, you just look about 14, 15 or 16,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nRodgers said in the suit that she was in a relationship with Kelly for a year, in which he \u201croutinely engaged in intimidation, mental, verbal and sexual abuse, during and after sexual contact.\u201d The suit alleges Kelly\u2019s actions were \u201cdesigned to humiliate, embarrass, intimate and shame her.\u201d\n\nThe suit is seeking unspecified damages, alleging sexual battery, false imprisonment and failure to disclose a sexually transmitted disease. CBS News reported that Rodgers previously filed a criminal complaint with the Dallas Police Department in April.\n\nIn the past, Kelly has routinely denied allegations of sexual abuse. In response to the April criminal complaint, Kelly\u2019s representative said the musician \u201ccategorically denies all claims and allegations.\u201d\n\nSupport real journalism.
