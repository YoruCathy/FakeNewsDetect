The MTV personality revealed in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online that she doesn\u2019t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child\u2019s father is Chris Lopez.)\n\nCelebrity Babies of 2017\n\nThe 25-year-old, who is also mom to son Isaac, 7, (whom she shares with ex Jo Rivera), and son Lincoln, 3, (whom she shares with Marroquin) acknowledged that while Marroquin, 24, has played a father figure role in Isaac\u2019s life\u2014 she doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary for him to form a similar bond with the child she shares with Lopez.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a reason for him to be involved other than knowing and acknowledging that this is Lincoln\u2019s half sibling. That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,\u201d the mom shared with Radar.\n\nAnd while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask how he was handling it,\u201d she explained to the outlet. \u201cBut he did say congratulations.\u201d\n\nMaking things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.\n\nAttorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry\u2019s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: \u201cDelaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.\u201d\n\nIn order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to \u201cdischarge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.\u201d\n\nThe pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.\n\nBut the MTV star doesn\u2019t seemed too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation. \u201cJavi is not the father,\u201d she explained to Radar. \u201cChris is the father so I think we\u2019re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and that that\u2019s established.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kailyn-lowry-baby-zoom-673c6582-0dae-4f99-bbe7-e62c3adc61e5.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/488185536_kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-zoom-2ddfe904-be5f-4c0d-ab64-ee2a50f212f1.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/488185536_kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-zoom-b6f9ef81-e551-4965-a09d-8df084217faa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/488185536_kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-zoom-b6f9ef81-e551-4965-a09d-8df084217faa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kailyn-lowry-doesnt-want-javi-marroquin-involved-in-her-third-childs-life-w498172/", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Doesn\u2019t Want Javi Marroquin Involved in Her Third Child\u2019s Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Kailyn Lowry revealed in a new interview that she doesn\u2019t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her newborn son with whom she shares with Chris Lopez \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Doesn\u2019t Want Javi Marroquin Involved in Her Third Child\u2019s Life", "description": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Kailyn Lowry revealed in a new interview that she doesn\u2019t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her newborn son with whom she shares with Chris Lopez \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kailyn-lowry-doesnt-want-javi-marroquin-involved-in-her-third-childs-life-w498172/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:45:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/488185536_kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-zoom-b6f9ef81-e551-4965-a09d-8df084217faa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/488185536_kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-zoom-b6f9ef81-e551-4965-a09d-8df084217faa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-08-16T20:18:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:45:48+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Kailyn Lowry revealed in a new interview that she doesn\u2019t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her newborn son with whom she shares with Chris Lopez \u2014 get the details", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Doesn\u2019t Want Javi Marroquin Involved in Her Third Child\u2019s Life", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/488185536_kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin-zoom-b6f9ef81-e551-4965-a09d-8df084217faa.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502914680.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
