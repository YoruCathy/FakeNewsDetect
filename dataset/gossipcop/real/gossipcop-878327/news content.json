Because this is 2017, the whole ordeal was captured for Instagram, and thus, for eternity.\n\nPrince George arrives for his first day of school at Thomas's Battersea with his father The Duke of Cambridge PA A post shared by Kensington Palace (@kensingtonroyal) on Sep 7, 2017 at 2:03am PDT\n\nThe father and son duo were greeted by the Head of Lower School \u2014 a woman who could only be described as a blonde version of Kate Middleton \u2014 who was clad in a dusty rose dress (the color, not the daughter of Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo) and sensibly flat shoes.\n\nThe little prince looked understandably nervous, replacing his usually jovial grin with a look of grave apprehension as he began to comprehend his fate. Yep, it's Monday through Friday for the rest of your life.\n\nThis morning Prince George, accompanied by The Duke of Cambridge, attended his first day of school at Thomas's Battersea in London. Their Royal Highnesses were met by the Head of Lower School on arrival, before The Duke took Prince George inside to his reception classroom.
