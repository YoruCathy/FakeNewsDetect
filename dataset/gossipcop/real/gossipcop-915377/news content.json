Composite: BBC\n\nA spokeswoman for Weinstein said: \u201cEven though Mr Weinstein has worked with hundreds of actresses and actors who had only professional and mutually respectful experiences with him, Mr Weinstein has directed in the future that no specific names be used by his counsel, even where those actors have made previous public statements about him.\n\n\u201cMr Weinstein acknowledges the valuable input both Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence have contributed to this conversation and apologises.\n\n\u201cOnce again, moving forward, Mr Weinstein has advised his counsel to not include specific names of former associates; and to avoid whenever possible, even if they are in the public record.\u201d\n\nIn response to the motion, Lawrence described Weinstein as a \u201cpredator\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the record, while I was not victimised personally by Harvey Weinstein, I stand behind the women who have survived his terrible abuse and I applaud them in using all means necessary to bring him to justice whether through criminal or civil actions. Time\u2019s up,\u201d she added in a statement.\n\nHer comment follows Streep firing back at Weinstein, who said the action was \u201cpathetic and exploitative\u201d after his lawyers cited her saying she was never harassed by the producer in an attempt to shut the case down.\n\nLawyers Phyllis Kupferstein and Mary E Flynn wrote that this would include actresses such as Streep and Lawrence who have not made allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\n\n\nThey pointed to Streep saying Weinstein had always been respectful with her during their collaborations in a statement to the press.\n\n\n\nThey did not mention that Streep also praised the \u201cheroes\u201d who made allegations about his behaviour, which she said was \u201cinexcusable\u201d and an \u201cabuse of power\u201d.\n\n\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyers also tried to undermine the lawsuit\u2019s claims by saying Gwyneth Paltrow went on to work with him again after he allegedly harassed her.\n\n\n\nThe original lawsuit argued the statute of limitations on the allegations does not apply because the alleged victims were under duress not to make the claims earlier.\n\n\n\nWeinstein, 65, has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e320af4836ec42757f25f357cb01525e1896253d/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=07adeb7d1b25fd303a92d32b5d5058d6", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03bbc88eb6c702db70ef917ef4f531541188c49a/1_0_5694_3417/master/5694.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=dd988d01cff83e1728a9765e16299e93", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Harvey+Weinstein%2CJennifer+Lawrence%2CMeryl+Streep%2CSexual+harassment%2CFilm%2CWorld+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e320af4836ec42757f25f357cb01525e1896253d/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=717cab7811de122d17065229f5310d15", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e320af4836ec42757f25f357cb01525e1896253d/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=07adeb7d1b25fd303a92d32b5d5058d6", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Greenfield"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/harvey-weinstein-meryl-streep-jennifer-lawrence-apologises", "title": "Weinstein apologises for citing Streep and Lawrence in defence", "meta_data": {"description": "Lawyers for disgraced mogul used past comments in effort to dismiss class action", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Patrick Greenfield", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e320af4836ec42757f25f357cb01525e1896253d/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e94f7b504c924d41987be9e03844c908", "keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Jennifer Lawrence,Meryl Streep,Sexual harassment,Film,World news", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Jennifer Lawrence,Meryl Streep,Sexual harassment,Film,World news", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/harvey-weinstein-meryl-streep-jennifer-lawrence-apologises", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e320af4836ec42757f25f357cb01525e1896253d/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=07adeb7d1b25fd303a92d32b5d5058d6", "description": "Lawyers for disgraced mogul used past comments in effort to dismiss class action", "type": "article", "title": "Weinstein apologises for citing Streep and Lawrence in defence", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-greenfield", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2018-02-22T23:25:51.000Z", "tag": "Harvey Weinstein,Jennifer Lawrence,Meryl Streep,Sexual harassment,Film,World news", "modified_time": "2020-02-24T18:37:16.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2018/feb/22/harvey-weinstein-meryl-streep-jennifer-lawrence-apologises?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2018/feb/22/harvey-weinstein-meryl-streep-jennifer-lawrence-apologises?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/harvey-weinstein-meryl-streep-jennifer-lawrence-apologises", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2018/feb/22/harvey-weinstein-meryl-streep-jennifer-lawrence-apologises?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e320af4836ec42757f25f357cb01525e1896253d/0_99_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=c525c51738c5de9008e1e4938aeeaaba", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pgreenfielduk", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519228800.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
