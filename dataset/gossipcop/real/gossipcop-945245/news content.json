Seriously, who's the fkn adult here? How would you even know if I'm a bad kid, you're not even around enough to know what kind of person I am.\"\n\nThe message came after Brandon -- who allegedly assaulted Tommy back in March -- shared a video of his seemingly unconscious dad on social media, which appeared to be in response to Tommy's Instagram rant on Father's Day about the lack of respect he receives from his son.\n\nThe feud continued when Tommy started listing all of the money he's allegedly spent on Brandon. \u201cRehab for son: $130,000, Party for son\u2019s 21st birthday last year: $40,000,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMedical Bills after son knocks his father unconscious and uses \u2018alcoholism\u2019 as scapegoat: $10,000, Son acting like a victim on social media on father\u2019s day: Priceless.\u201d\n\nThe Motley Crue drummer concluded the post, writing: \u201cI\u2019m out [mic] drop!\u201d\n\nAs for Pamela Anderson, Tommy's ex-wife and Brandon's mother, she's still siding with her son.\n\n\u201cPamela stands by Brandon\u2019s reaction to his father's post,\u201d a source tells ET. \u201cShe believes Brandon has the right to protect himself and the family. In Pam's eyes, while Brandon is Tommy's biological son, that doesn't make Tommy a real father.\u201d\n\nTommy Lee's Son Brandon Shares Video Of His Dad Unconscious This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

I wish the best for everybody, but, you know, we\u2019re all growing and learning and this is part of it,\u201d the 50-year-old actress said at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad, but like I said, it\u2019s the past.\"\n\nFor more from the feud, watch the clip below:\n\nTommy Lee's Son Brandon Lee Posts Disturbing Video of His Dad Seemingly Passed Out This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
