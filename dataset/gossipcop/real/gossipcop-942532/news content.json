In that interview, he said he had no interest in ending the show or retiring.\n\n\u201cI gave up on that. I\u2019ve tried. I just think I\u2019m just too nervous, neurotic, driven,\u201d he told PEOPLE. \u201cI would have had a different answer a few years ago. I might have deluded myself into thinking that I\u2019d be happy in a hammock or gardening. But no, I\u2019m quite sure I can\u2019t... I\u2019m going to pretty much die in the saddle.\u201d\n\nBourdain also told PEOPLE he was \"happy in ways that I have not been in memory\u201d and \u201chappy in ways I didn\u2019t think I ever would be, for sure.\u201d\n\nAs Bourdain had done in many interviews in the past, he spoke about his past demons, including his addiction to heroin and cocaine, and his use of alcohol. At the end of his days in the restaurant industry, he was \"definitely drinking too much\" because of the stress and the free alcohol.\n\n\"When there\u2019s something that I like... films or books or a particular author, I do pursue them with more zeal than perhaps a lot of other people,\" Bourdain said. \"I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s addictive, habitual or whatever.\u201d\n\nBourdain also made sure he spent at least five days a month with Ariane, who lives in New York with Busia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go back, see my daughter, unpack, repack, mimic a normal life, which is extraordinarily pleasurable to me,\u201d he told PEOPLE.\n\nBourdain was found dead Friday morning from an apparent suicide in a hotel in France, where he was filming a new episode of Parts Unknown. He was 61.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/anthony-bourdain-20037091-640x320.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/anthony-bourdain-20037091-640x320.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/2018/06/08/anthony-bourdain-said-had-responsibility-live-for-daughter/", "title": "Anthony Bourdain Had a 'Responsibility' to Live for His Daughter in Last Interview", "meta_data": {"description": "In one of his last interviews, Anthony Bourdain said he felt a 'responsibility' to live for his 11-year-old daughter, Ariane.During his final interview with PEOPLE in February, the Parts Unknown host said he felt 'some responsibility' to 'at least try to live' for Ariane.'I also do feel I have [...]", "keywords": "Anthony Bourdain,Celebrity Deaths,suicide", "news_keywords": "Anthony Bourdain,Celebrity Deaths,suicide", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@PopCulture", "creator": "dsl89", "title": "Anthony Bourdain Had a 'Responsibility' to Live for His Daughter in Last Interview", "description": "In one of his last interviews, Anthony Bourdain said he felt a 'responsibility' to live for his [...]", "image": "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/anthony-bourdain-20037091-640x320.jpeg"}, "og": {"title": "Anthony Bourdain Had a 'Responsibility' to Live for His Daughter in Last Interview", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/2018/06/08/anthony-bourdain-said-had-responsibility-live-for-daughter/", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/anthony-bourdain-20037091-640x320.jpeg", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "In one of his last interviews, Anthony Bourdain said he felt a 'responsibility' to live for his [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528387200.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
