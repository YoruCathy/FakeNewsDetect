The pair officially became co-anchors of the Today show earlier this month when Kotb replaced Matt Lauer after the longtime anchor was fired late last year.\n\nIt marks the first time in the morning show\u2019s history that there have been two female anchors.\n\n\u201cSavannah and I started anchoring together, and it was just weird,\u201d Kotb recalled on Wednesday\u2019s Tonight Show. \u201cIt was like if you\u2019ve ever met a friend and had, like, a great moment where you say to yourself, \u2018Wow, that was so much fun. It worked.\u2019 I think we had an instant thing\u201d\n\nGuthrie agreed, joking, \u201cHoda said it was like a first date, and I was like, \u2018and I\u2019m easy and desperate,\u2019 so no problem! It just clicked, and it felt so good. And we\u2019re so happy.\u201d\n\nSee photos of Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie together:\n\n\n\n51 PHOTOS Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie together See Gallery Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie together THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON -- Episode 0863 -- Pictured: (l-r) TODAY Co-Anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb during an interview on May 2, 2018 -- (Photo by: Andrew Lipovsky/NBC) NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 30: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie are seen on the set of the today show on April 30, 2018 in New York City.
