But lucky (or unlucky) for me, I get to hear it all\u2014Bethenny\u2019s drumbeat of insults, her spate of digs, and her self-serving narrative. Live on Bravo Wed 9e/8c!\u201d\n\nAccording to Carole, she does her best to brush off Bethenny\u2019s remarks because she seems \u201cso angry and unhappy.\u201d However, at the same time, she\u2019s sad to see how much their relationship has changed.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel sad that I let into my life a person who I thought supported me, respected me, and enjoyed me, and she has revealed herself to be the complete antithesis,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was taught to stand up for myself. To be heard. To defend my family and people I love. And to never let anyone question my character, intelligence, or integrity. And that is exactly what Bethenny has been slowly, insidiously trying to do all season with her hidden agenda. It\u2019s pathetic, and I\u2019m not about to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn Bethenny\u2019s myopic world, she\u2019s the judge, jury, and executioner. Her narcissistic point of view doesn\u2019t permit any dissenters\u2014only her truth matters. It\u2019s astounding to watch,\u201d Carole added of Bethenny\u2019s antics.\n\nDuring the latest episode of The Real Housewives of New York City, it was revealed that Bethenny had been offended by Carole\u2019s on-again, off-again boyfriend, Adam Kenworthy, after the photographer asked to be compensated for potentially traveling to Puerto Rico with Bethenny to take shots of the hurricane aftermath. It was also revealed that Bethenny had chosen to tell their co-star, Dorinda Medley, about her thoughts instead of going directly to Carole.\n\nSo, we have to ask\u2026\n\nWhose Side Are You On?
