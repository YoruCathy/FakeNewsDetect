especially high - and this year, some celebrities fell flat.\n\nThe worst:\n\nThis year's worst-dressed were mostly those who didn't incorporate the heavenly theme into their outfits - or did so to disastrous outcomes.\n\nKylie Jenner left viewers unimpressed with her secular ensemble, opting for a simple black gown and sunglasses indoors. Sister Kendall Jenner made the list as well.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker's Dolce & Gabbana ensemble captured attention, but not necessarily for the right reasons. Featuring an over-the-top gold headpiece and equally busy dress, the usually-fashionable actress's outfit was a lot to take in.\n\nScarlett Johansson looked beautiful, but her outfit was forgettable, as it had nothing to do with the theme. The same was true for Miley Cyrus, whose daring low-cut satin gown would have been better suited for a different red carpet.\n\nAnd Amal Clooney's outfit of flowers paired with pants by Richard Quin was gorgeous - but the co-host of the event didn't bring the dazzle that one expects from outfits at the Met Gala.\n\nOverall, this year's Met Gala, filled with extravagant headpieces and lots of gold, was one to remember.\n\nAs exhibition curator Andrew Bolton said of the theme: \"Dress is central to any discussion about religion.\"", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/08/04/gettyimages-955798338.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/08/04/gettyimages-955798338.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel", "Sarah Young"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/met-gala-best-worst-outfits-red-carpet-a8340586.html", "title": "Met Gala 2018: Best-dressed guests on the red carpet, from Rihanna to Katy Perry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/met-gala-best-worst-outfits-red-carpet-a8340586.html", "title": "The best and worst dressed on the Met Gala red carpet", "description": "Some celebrities stunned while others blended into the background", "updated_time": "2018-05-08T12:30:16+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/08/04/gettyimages-955798338.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5781707813001_5781702428001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5781702428001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8340586"}, "description": "The annual Met Gala is one of the biggest fashion events of the year, and this year\u2019s outfits did not disappoint.
