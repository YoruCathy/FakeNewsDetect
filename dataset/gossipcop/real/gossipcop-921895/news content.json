The premiere of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation is right around the corner, and MTV is really coming through with the promos, teasers, and sneak peeks. Last week, we got the first official trailer for the series \u2015 which airs on April 5 \u2015 and this week, well\u2026 MTV has outdone themselves.\n\nFans of the original series will be thrilled to see MTV\u2019s March 20 release: the most dramatic reading of \u201cThe Note\u201d ever.\n\nYes. Yep. MTV has had the Jersey Shore fam do a dramatized reading of the piece of writing that spelled the beginning of the end for Ronnie Ortiz-Magro and Sammi \u201cSweetheart\u201d Giancola way back when.\n\nAnd, yes, it\u2019s exactly as amazing as you\u2019re picturing.\n\nThey\u2019re Back! Thank god for MTV and their Jersey Shore: Family Vacation marketing plan. With the series premiere set for April 5, the promos are kicking into high gear, and they truly don\u2019t disappoint. The first stop on the PR train for MTV\u2019s reboot was a deliciously nostalgic trailer that showed MVP and the Meatballs partying it up on South Beach. \u201cWe\u2019re back, b**ches,\u201d Snooki screams to kick off the nostalgic romp, and she couldn\u2019t be more right. Parenthood and family life definitely hasn\u2019t slowed down the Shore stars\u2019 love for a good party. The trailer shows everyone\u2019s favorite Jerseyans getting up to their old hijinks, from screaming in their vacation home to drinking at clubs and grinding up on each other! Can you say #TBT? \u201cWe\u2019re older, but I don\u2019t think many of us are wiser,\u201d Ronnie says in the minute-and-a-half long video. We\u2019re inclined to believe that\u2019s true\u2026\n\nAdvertisement Yes! Now, we have part two of the promos and \u2015 dare we say it \u2015 it\u2019s even better than the first. The newest video released by the network shows the entire cast doing a top-notch dramatic reading of perhaps the most influential piece of writing in the modern western canon: The Note. For those who don\u2019t remember every salacious minute of the original Jersey Shore, The Note marked the beginning of the end for on-and-off couple Sammi \u201cSweetheart\u201d Giancola and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro as it detailed all of the latter\u2019s misdeeds after Sammi left a club in tears. Written by Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi and Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley to expose Ronnie\u2019s cheating ways, The Note lives in infamy as one of the most bombastic moves in the show\u2019s history. And it somehow just got more dramatic.", "images": ["https://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2018/03/Jersey-Shore-Family-Vacation-last-day-photo-shoot-1519919447.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035951&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2018/03/The-Note-Social-Jersey-Shore-Family-Vacation-1521644980-1024x534.jpg", "https://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2018/03/Snooki-The-Note-Reading-promo-1521645238.png", "https://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2018/03/Jersey-Shore-Family-Vacation-whole-cast-trailer-1521210545.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bDyt5XZ5yC-sg.gif", "https://www.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celebuzz_logo_alt.png"], "top_img": "https://static.celebuzz.com/uploads/2018/03/The-Note-Social-Jersey-Shore-Family-Vacation-1521644980-1024x534.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebuzz.com/g/jersey-shore-casts-dramatic-reading-the-note/", "title": "LOL! \u2018Jersey Shore\u2019 Cast Does a Dramatic Reading of the Infamous Note to Sammi Sweetheart", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "https://www.celebuzz.com/g/jersey-shore-casts-dramatic-reading-the-note/", "title": "LOL!
