Naturally, the news came as a shock to Tatum's and Dewan's fans\u2014though they took solace in the fact that the split is seemingly amicable. In their statement announcing the news, Tatum and Dewan said they'd \"lovingly chosen\" to separate and that \"nothing has changed\" about how much they love each other.\n\nIt's not so surprising, then, that Dewan was completely gracious on The Ellen DeGeneres Show Wednesday (May 2) after DeGeneres accidentally called her \"Jenna Dewan Tatum.\"\n\n\"Please welcome Jenna Dewan Tatum\u2014Jenna Dewan, sorry,\" DeGeneres said right before bringing her and the other World of Dance judges out to discuss their show. Before the segment wrapped, DeGeneres apologized for her slip-up. \"I'm so sorry; I introduced you [as Jenna Dewan Tatum], and it was just such a habit. I have to say the way that you and Channing are handling everything is beautiful\u2014for your daughter [Everly], and the statements have been great. And I apologize. I just have known both of you for so long, and I'm so used to saying it.\"\n\nDewan's response was warm and calm. \"I know, thank you. And, honestly, thank you\u2014and everybody\u2014for all the love and support. It's truly so moving,\" she said.\n\nWatch all this happen for yourself in the video below:\n\n\"There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision\u2014just two best friends realizing it\u2019s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible,\" Dewan and Tatum also said in their joint statement about the split. \"We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly.\"\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nJenna Dewan Has a Message for Everyone Who Supported Her After Channing Tatum Split\n\nJust a Friendly Reminder From Jenna Dewan That Her Split With Channing Tatum Isn't Messy\n\nJenna Dewan Tatum's Sparkly AMAs Dress Was Literally Made For KiraKira", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ae9d4f4b157cc62710dff0c/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jenna-dewan.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ae9d4f4b157cc62710dff0c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jenna-dewan.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1524774973/glamour_grace-vanderwaal-watches-fan-covers-on-youtube.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ae9d4f4b157cc62710dff0c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jenna-dewan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa", "Christopher Ros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/ellen-degeneres-apologizes-to-jenna-dewan-after-accidentally-calling-her-tatum", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Apologizes to Jenna Dewan After Accidentally Calling Her a 'Tatum'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres slipped up and accidentally called Jenna Dewan 'Jenna Dewan Tatum' on her show.
