The singer posted a video on her Instagram, dedicated to her ex-husband, where their little boy dances and sings along to the song \"(You Gotta) Fight For Your Right (to Party)\" by the Beastie Boys.\n\n\"Happy Birthday Dad!!!! Love #AxlJack ??? @joshduhamel,\" the former Black Eyed Peas singer wrote alongside a video slideshow. In the second clip, Axl sends a silly message to his pops, saying, \"Hi dad, you have stinky feet and rats are on your feet, and I love you.\"\n\nThe video ends with the message, \"Happy birthday, dad! Don't forget to Paaaarrrtay! Love, Axl Jack.\"\n\nFergie and Duhamel separated after eight years of marriage in September of 2017.\n\n\"With absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,\u201d Fergie and Duhamel said in a statement at the time. \u201cTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\"\n\nThe two, however, have remained friendly and praised each other for successfully co-parenting their son.\n\n\u201cWe just love our kid and want the best for him,\u201d the actor told ET in June of 2018. \u201cFergie and I get along great. We have a lot of love and there's no reason to not do the best we can to raise our kid. He\u2019s number one.\u201d\n\nFergie echoed the sentiments, also telling ET that same month, \"We split it up really balanced,\" she said of their custody arrangement. \"We're all love and we love each other. We're all cool and just a family. I have a good co-parenting partner, so we work it out.\"\n\nSee more on the former couple in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nFergie Says She's Not Dating, Just 'Play-Dating' With Son Axl (Exclusive)\n\nJosh Duhamel Says He And Fergie Have 'A Lot of Love' When It Comes to Co-Parenting (Exclusive)\n\nFergie Sweetly Calls Ex Josh Duhamel a 'Good Co-Parenting Partner' (Exclusive)\n\nFergie Calls Ex Josh Duhamel a 'Good Co-Parenting Partner' (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
