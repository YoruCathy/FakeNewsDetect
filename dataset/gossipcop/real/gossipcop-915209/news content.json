However, Chapman doesn\u2019t see herself as a victim and has reportedly been \u201cincredibly strong\u201d over the past few months, according to her close friend.\n\nSince announcing their separation and expressing sympathy for the women who suffered due to her husband\u2019s \u201cunforgivable actions,\u201d Chapman has remained mostly out of the public eye. The fashion designer and Marchesa co-founder even canceled her runway show at New York Fashion Week.\n\nHowever, according to Chapman\u2019s best friend and business partner, Keren Craig, Weinstein\u2019s ex-wife has been focusing intensely on her fashion to take her mind off of things. In a recent interview with Grazia Craig spoke about how the past few months have influenced Chapman\u2019s work, but emphasized that she has been strong and doesn\u2019t think of herself as a victim.\n\n\u201cEverything you see here today Georgina sketched while she was out of the office and going through a very, very tough time,\u201d Craig said of Marchesa\u2019s Fall/Winter 2018 collection. \u201cGeorge was just sending sketches through. It was unbelievable. This collection is the result of that time. I feel emotional about it because I actually couldn\u2019t believe how incredibly strong she was.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe threw herself into her work. She threw herself into protecting her kids,\u201d Craig continued. \u201cMarchesa is her life. It is her passion. You see it here: even though she was going through all that, these beautiful things have somehow come out of such a hard time.\u201d\n\nDespite the tough time she\u2019s been going through, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t see herself as a victim,\u201d Craig said. \u201cThat\u2019s very important. She\u2019s just trying to get on with her life. You\u2019ve got to realize George is such a strong woman. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014it\u2019s a very hard time. But she\u2019s quite inspirational.\u201d\n\nJust about every actress in Hollywood has gone through awards season without wearing Marchesa on the red carpet for obvious reasons, but Craig and Chapman are hoping to change that by supporting the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements in some fashion.\n\n\u201cWe want to support them. We want to make a gesture,\u201d Craig said. \u201cWe need to properly process how it can be the most beneficial.\u201d", "images": ["https://dailycaller.com/files/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1660572110829759&ev=PageView\r\n\t&noscript=1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10110104&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://dailycaller.com/files/images/newsletter-small.jpg", "https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=960,height=411,fit=cover,f=auto/https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Harvey_Weinstein_wife-e1519229743805.jpg", "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Harvey_Weinstein_wife-e1519229743805.jpg", "https://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Harvey_Weinstein_Georgina_Chapman.jpg", "https://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Marchesa.jpg", "https://dailycaller.com/files/images/logo-white.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Harvey_Weinstein_wife-e1519229743805.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/21/weinsteins-wife-not-a-victim/", "title": "Georgina Chapman \u2018Doesn\u2019t See Herself As A Victim\u2019 Of Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "https://dailycaller.com/2018/02/21/weinsteins-wife-not-a-victim/", "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Harvey_Weinstein_wife-e1519229743805.jpg", "title": "Georgina Chapman \u2018Doesn\u2019t See Herself As A Victim\u2019 Of Harvey Weinstein", "description": "Of all the women who have been intimately involved with Harvey Weinstein over the years only one doesn't see herself as a victim of the disgraced producer."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "dailycaller", "title": "Georgina Chapman \u2018Doesn\u2019t See Herself As A Victim\u2019 Of Harvey Weinstein", "description": "Of all the women who have been intimately involved with Harvey Weinstein over the years only one doesn't see herself as a victim of the disgraced producer.", "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Harvey_Weinstein_wife-e1519229743805.jpg"}, "description": "Of all the women who have been intimately involved with Harvey Weinstein over the years only one doesn't see herself as a victim of the disgraced producer.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=381099982", "fb": {"pages": 182919686769}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519142400.0, "source": "https://dailycaller.com", "summary": ""}
