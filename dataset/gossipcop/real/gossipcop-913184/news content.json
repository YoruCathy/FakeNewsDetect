The match-ups will get even more intense and competitive from here on out, especially since our Elite 8 couples have such loyal fandoms. Good luck to you all in your next battle of the ships!\n\nHere are some highlights from the Sweet 16 round:\n\nOnce Upon a Time\u2019s Emma and Regina have proven their prowess yet again. These magical moms are totally in it to win it, and their victory against Riverdale\u2019s Cheryl and Toni has solidified them as an unstoppable force. Is #SwanQueen the one to beat this year?\n\nNewcomers Sara and Ava from DC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow took out Bellamy and Clarke from The 100. It was a tight race, but #Avalance is not to be trifled with, y\u2019all.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Supergirl\u2019s Alex and Sam ousted Pretty Little Liars\u2019 veteran couple, Emily and Alison. That wasn\u2019t the only win for Supergirl. Kara and Lena knocked out The Flash\u2019s beloved Barry and Iris with relative ease.\n\nWhich couples will advance to the Final 4?
