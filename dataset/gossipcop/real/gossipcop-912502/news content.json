WATCH HERE!\n\nRaise your hand if you\u2019ve been personally victimized by the #DiddyShop OR #DiddyCrop!\n\nAs we reported, after the 2018 Grammys, Diddy was called out when he shared a snap on his Instagram page completely cropping Fabolous and Photoshopping French Montana out of a pic with JAY-Z, Kendrick Lamar, and Nas!\n\nRelated: Diddy Says He\u2019s Down For Kids With Girlfriend Cassie!\n\nAs seen here:\n\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t the first time the hip-hop mogul \u2014 who jokingly changed his name to \u201cLove\u201d for one day \u2014 has been savage with the crop tool!\n\nNine months ago, the Sean John designer axed Kendall and Kylie Jenner out of a pic taken at the 2017 Met Gala.\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of Ellen DeGeneres\u2018 talk show, the Bad Boy founder opens up about the harsh edits, and says he isn\u2019t the one clipping people out!\n\nAccording to the 48-year-old:\n\n\u201cI take a lot of pictures with a lot of different celebrities \u2018cos we\u2019re all just family and stuff. And sometimes my photography editor, he doesn\u2019t let me know when he\u2019s taking people out of the pictures\u2026 There were people that were taken away that didn\u2019t deserve to be taken away, I had nothing to do with it. It was just this young kid that works for me, he wanted a picture of JAY-Z, Nas, and Kendrick.\u201d\n\nSadly, because of the controversy, some of Diddy\u2019s friends haven\u2019t been speaking to him for two weeks!\n\nWATCH the clip at the 5:50 mark (below):\n\n[Image via The Ellen Show/YouTube.]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20118%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20111%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20244%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20112%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20188%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-hilton-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20225%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20113%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20437%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20538%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20162%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20275%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20308%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20163%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2083%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20236%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20101%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20311%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg"], "top_img": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/diddy-ellen-degeneres-photoshop-crop-diddyshop-diddycrop-video/", "title": "Diddy Finally Explains His Photoshop Savageness!
