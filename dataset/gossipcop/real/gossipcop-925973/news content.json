They didn't announce the breakup on social media or anything, but Beckham did just introduce the paparazzi to Moretz's successor, 19-year-old model Lexi Wood. They were photographed kissing in the window of Honorable Society Tattoo Parlor in West Hollywood Saturday, where Beckham was getting a new tattoo of a pinup girl.\n\nBACKGRID\n\nMeanwhile, Moretz shared an Instagram story of herself listening to Cardi B's \"Be Careful\" the day the kissing photos surfaced. The chorus of that song goes, per Genius, \"Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?/Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?/You gon' gain the whole world/But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?/Be careful with me/Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'.\" She followed that up with three cute photos of herself...coincidence or secret message?\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nSome fans, distraught that Moretz had been replaced and that Beckham could be cheating, are already spamming Wood's Instagram page with mean comments. Breaking up is hard to do when kids on the internet are invested in your real-life relationship.\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\nMoretz and Beckham had spent a couple weeks apart and off each other's social media, leading LaineyGossip to speculate things may have ended between them on Friday. The report kicked off the breakup rumor Beckham confirmed a day later.\n\nMoretz's last photo of Beckham is from March 4, where she wrote \"I love you\" for his birthday:\n\nBeckham's last shot with Moretz was from Valentine's Day:\n\nThe two have been on-off in the past. They originally broke up in September 2016, only to get back together a year later, so who knows what the future holds.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bgus-1196885-002-30-1523285698.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0553xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bgus-1196885-002-30-1523285698.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0553xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Bailey", "News", "Strategy Editor", "Alyssa Bailey Is The News", "Strategy Editor At Elle.Com", "Where She Oversees Coverage Of Celebrities", "Royals", "Particularly Meghan Markle", "Kate Middleton ."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19718059/brooklyn-beckham-kissing-lexi-wood-photograph-chloe-moretz-breakup/", "title": "Brooklyn Beckham Was Photographed Kissing a Model Who's Not Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Brooklyn Beckham Was Photographed Kissing a Model Who's Not Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz", "description": "Well, that's one way to announce your breakup.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a19718059/brooklyn-beckham-kissing-lexi-wood-photograph-chloe-moretz-breakup/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bgus-1196885-002-30-1523285698.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0553xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-04-09 03:30:21", "published_time": "2018-04-09 03:19:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2020", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bgus-1196885-002-30-1523285698.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0553xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Brooklyn Beckham Photographed Kissing Model Lexi Wood - Chloe Grace Moretz Breakup and Response", "description": "\u200bBrooklyn Beckham and Chloe Grace Moretz, two barely-twentysomethings who found love in SoulCycle class\u200b, appear to be done.
