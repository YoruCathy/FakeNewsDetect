When she'd leave the set from 2011 to 2016, she tells the magazine, \"I would just take everything off\u2014the makeup, all of it\u2014and would blast hip-hop, or Nirvana, 'Creep,' Slayer. Anything like that to get me out of that zone, that TV mode.\"\n\nAguilera said she felt \"suffocated and restricted\" during that period.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b?ops=gravity(\"center\"),ratio(1,1),fit(190,190),quality(70)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5de67f10d5f1413dc35cee90?ops=gravity(\"center\"),maxcontain(150,52),quality(80)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=004d2133385513d6a3dbfd9993b43474ab", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036262&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://kdwb.iheart.com/featured/raven/content/2018-05-04-heres-why-christina-aguilera-is-done-with-the-voice-forever/", "title": "Here's Why Christina Aguilera Is Done With 'The Voice' Forever", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I didn't get into this business to be a television show host and to be given all these [rules],\" the singer told 'Billboard.'", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "keywords": "kdwb, 101.3, dave ryan, kdwb morning show, morning show, twin cities radio, Minneapolis, MN, St. Paul, Twin Cities, dave ryan in the morning show, falen, falenkdwb, steve-o, steveokdwb, war of the roses, zach dillon, zachkdwb, tina, ewhite", "og": {"title": "Here's Why Christina Aguilera Is Done With 'The Voice' Forever | 101.3 KDWB | Raven", "type": "article", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "url": "https://kdwb.iheart.com/featured/raven/content/2018-05-04-heres-why-christina-aguilera-is-done-with-the-voice-forever/", "description": "\"I didn't get into this business to be a television show host and to be given all these [rules],\" the singer told 'Billboard.'", "locale": "en_us", "site_name": "101.3 KDWB"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://kdwb.iheart.com/featured/raven/content/2018-05-04-heres-why-christina-aguilera-is-done-with-the-voice-forever/", "site": "@1013KDWB", "creator": "@1013KDWB", "title": "Here's Why Christina Aguilera Is Done With 'The Voice' Forever | 101.3 KDWB | Raven", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "description": "\"I didn't get into this business to be a television show host and to be given all these [rules],\" the singer told 'Billboard.'", "domain": "kdwb.iheart.com"}, "parsely-title": "Here's Why Christina Aguilera Is Done With 'The Voice' Forever | 101.3 KDWB | Raven", "parsely-link": "https://kdwb.iheart.com/featured/raven/content/2018-05-04-heres-why-christina-aguilera-is-done-with-the-voice-forever/", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "parsely-tags": "kdwb, 101.3, dave ryan, kdwb morning show, morning show, twin cities radio, Minneapolis, MN, St. Paul, Twin Cities, dave ryan in the morning show, falen, falenkdwb, steve-o, steveokdwb, war of the roses, zach dillon, zachkdwb, tina, ewhite", "parsely-type": "post", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5aec60fd5507170113edf207?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(740,416),quality(65)", "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "application-name": "101.3 KDWB", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"pages": 31591671036, "app_id": 362549017100440}, "parsely-pub-date": "Fri, 04 May 2018 13:24:00 GMT", "parsely-author": "@ravenonair", "parsely-section": "Raven Blog"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525363200.0, "source": "https://kdwb.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
