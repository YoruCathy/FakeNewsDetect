The boy and girl are the first children for the attorney and her husband, George Clooney.\n\nClooney's rep has also already weighed in with some humor:\n\nJulie Chen, a friend of the couple, first announced the Clooney\u2019s pregnancy news on her CBS show, The Talk, in February. Since then, Amal Clooney has been spotted with her husband at the Cesar Awards in February and at the United Nations in March; she has been continuing her work as a human-rights lawyer, which she has done since the early 2000s.\n\nGeorge Clooney, who was one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors before marrying Amal in September 2014 at the age of 53, told People in February that his friends, whose children are all grown and in college, had taken to jokingly ribbing him about his late-in-life fatherhood. Despite the quips from his pals, Clooney was ready to take on the challenge.\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s exciting,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re really happy and really excited, and it\u2019s going to be an adventure. We\u2019ve sort of embraced it all . . . with arms wide open.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Celebrity Parents Who Have Twins\n\nJulia Roberts, mother of twins and Clooney's longtime pal, has already stepped in with advice for the new dad, per People.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as wisdom when you have twin babies in the house,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just hopes and prayers and tears and holding on tight to each other.\u201d\n\nThe Clooneys will reportedly raise their twins in London, where they have been living in the months leading up to the babies\u2019 birth.\n\nFriends are already weighing in on how the 56-year-old will be as a brand new father. Matt Damon added his insight in an interview with Entertainment Tonight:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be great, he\u2019ll be a mess, but [Amal] will take care of everything.\"", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c6abe90a144505fae9ea23/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Pregnancy-Looks-ss-3.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c6abe20a144505fae9ea20/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Pregnancy-Looks-ss-1.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/590b43056231b140f4d5c2c3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-510547808.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58dc1405a6c57958a7d862b5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/amal-clooney-barrister.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c6abe20a144505fae9ea21/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Pregnancy-Looks-ss-2.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Weaver", "Hilary Weave", "Karen Bril"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/06/amal-clooney-twins-names", "title": "Amal Clooney Gives Birth to Twins", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hilary Weaver", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Ella and Alexander were born on Tuesday, June 6.", "id": "5936d4d93203e923160a4873", "keywords": "celebrity,amal clooney,george clooney,twins,birth", "news_keywords": "celebrity,amal clooney,george clooney,twins,birth", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5936d4d93203e923160a4873", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Ella and Alexander were born on Tuesday, June 6.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Ella and Alexander were born on Tuesday, June 6.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Amal Clooney Gives Birth to Twins", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/06/amal-clooney-twins-names"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Ella and Alexander were born on Tuesday, June 6.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5936d5d102e1d076fbe03e2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/George-Amal-Clooney-Twins.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Amal Clooney Gives Birth to Twins"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
