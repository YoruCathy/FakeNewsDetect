Getting her braids done by Toni\u2764\ufe0f A post shared by Tina Knowles (@mstinalawson) on Oct 7, 2017 at 12:40pm PDT\n\nCommenters agreed with her, writing, \u201cOmg thought it was blue!\u201d \u201cTwins!\u201d wrote another.\n\nA lot of people have remarked over the years how much Beyonc\u00e9 and husband Jay-Z\u2019s oldest child looks like her daddy, but this pic proves that the 5-year-old takes after both her mom and her dad.\n\nR&B singer Melanie Fiona previously told Us Weekly that when Blue was a baby she resembled the rapper. \u201cBeyonce says Blue changes every day and looks just like Jay now,\u201d Fiona told Us in 2012.\n\nLena Dunham, a card-carrying member of the Beyhive, told Us in February, shortly after the Grammy winner announced that she was expecting twins, that Blue Ivy \u201cis an icon.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 welcomed twins Sir and Rumi in June, and while the singer shared a pic of the babies shortly after their birth, they\u2019ve been kept under wraps since then, so it remains to be seen which of their parents they resemble.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, Blue is a doting big sister to her siblings. Knowles Lawson told Us last month that her new grandbabies are \u201cadorable and just beautiful and healthy\u201d and Blue is \u201cexcited\u201d to help look after them and pick out their outfits. \u201cShe feeds them,\u201d Knowles Lawson added. \u201cAnd she feels responsible for them being here because she prayed for them.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jay-z-blue-ivy-59th-grammy-awards-73779a95-c1de-4dc4-b442-64482f10323d.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-blue-ivy-2016-mtv-video-music-awards-a700b392-5ed9-4879-a25a-1032a8f6b69a.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-59th-grammy-awards-2ef76b69-eb62-419d-ab96-027798351663.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1124px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-59th-grammy-awards-2ef76b69-eb62-419d-ab96-027798351663.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-59th-grammy-awards-2ef76b69-eb62-419d-ab96-027798351663.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/beyonce-looks-exactly-like-daughter-blue-ivy-in-throwback-pic-w507710/", "title": "Beyonce Looks Exactly Like Daughter Blue Ivy in Throwback Pic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Beyonce looks exactly like daughter Blue Ivy in a throwback photo her mother, Tina Knowles Lawson, shared on Instagram on Saturday, October 7 \u2014 see the pic!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beyonce Looks Exactly Like Blue Ivy in Throwback Pic", "description": "Beyonce looks exactly like daughter Blue Ivy in a throwback photo her mother, Tina Knowles Lawson, shared on Instagram on Saturday, October 7 \u2014 see the pic!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/beyonce-looks-exactly-like-daughter-blue-ivy-in-throwback-pic-w507710/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:27:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-59th-grammy-awards-2ef76b69-eb62-419d-ab96-027798351663.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-59th-grammy-awards-2ef76b69-eb62-419d-ab96-027798351663.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-10-07T22:03:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:27:12+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Beyonce looks exactly like daughter Blue Ivy in a throwback photo her mother, Tina Knowles Lawson, shared on Instagram on Saturday, October 7 \u2014 see the pic!", "title": "Beyonce Looks Exactly Like Blue Ivy in Throwback Pic", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/beyonce-59th-grammy-awards-2ef76b69-eb62-419d-ab96-027798351663.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507413819.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
