Historian Hugo Vickers said the permission may also have been granted because Harry has retired from active service. British Army rules do not usually allow beards, except in rare circumstances, such as because of skin complaints, or for religious reasons.

A bearded royal bridegroom is a rarity. Indeed none of the current Royal Family sported facial hair on their own wedding days. But the Queen's grandfather, George V, did have a beard when he married Mary of Teck. Mr Vickers said: \"Theoretically the Army don't like it which is why at one point he took the Salute at Sandhurst in a suit.\" In December, Harry wore a dark suit and overcoat, with medals on the outside, when he represented the Queen and inspected graduating officer cadets at the Sovereign's Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Camberley, Surrey.\n\nGETTY Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel\n\n\"But on the other hand if you think back to King George V, who had a beard, obviously he was Admiral of the Fleet but he was also a Field Marshall and he often wore Army uniform with a beard,\" Mr Vickers added. \"I think if you've retired from the Army you probably do need somebody's permission to wear your old uniform. \"But I think the statement covers all those possibilities.\" Harry's uniform revealed that some time after leaving the Army in 2015 he was promoted to the rank of major, an honour that was bestowed by the Queen.\n\nGETTY Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform\n\nPA Permission may have been granted because Prince Harry has retired from active service", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/962277_1.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035737&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/covers/70x91/front_2020-04-19.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/369898.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/285x190/962232_1.jpg", "https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/preloaderbig.gif", "https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=l4f18&p_id=Twitter"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Historian Hugo Vickers"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/962318/the-queen-prince-harry-royal-wedding-beard", "title": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "THE Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform as he married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel today.", "fb": {"pages": 129617873765147, "app_id": 823607694325129}, "og": {"title": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/962318/the-queen-prince-harry-royal-wedding-beard", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "headlines,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Royal Wedding,Prince Harry,Queen,Beard,Meghan Markle,UploadExpress,", "section": "Royal", "description": "THE Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform as he married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel today."}, "news_keywords": "headlines,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Royal Wedding,Prince Harry,Queen,Beard,Meghan Markle,UploadExpress,", "article": {"tag": "UploadExpress", "published_time": "2018-05-19T17:15:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-19T17:38:54+01:00", "expiration_time": "2018-06-18", "section": "Royal", "image_count": 5, "video_count": 2, "word_count": 588, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg"}, "title": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "description": "THE Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform as he married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel today."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir,all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526746500.0, "source": "https://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
