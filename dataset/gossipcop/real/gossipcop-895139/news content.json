In a recent interview with People, the Bravolebrity revealed she bought a $5,000 toilet for Tom Girardi. She took the plunge and picked out a present that's as useful as it is hilarious. Well played, Erika Jayne. Well played.\n\nWhen People asked her what she got her husband of 18 years for Christmas, the Beverly Hills Housewife's answer sounded like something that you might hear in yet another Erika Jayne Saturday Night Live sketch. \u201cI bought him the top of the line Toto toilet that has heated seats and oscillation,\u201d she laughed. \u201cYeah, I got him a toilet.\u201d If gifting someone with a high-end crapper isn\u2019t true love, then what is? Erika added, \u201cComplete with custom made toilet paper, but I\u2019m not going to tell you what\u2019s on it.\u201d Yes, she had custom T.P. made for Tom, too. This gift just keeps getting better and better.\n\nSurprising her spouse with an elaborate porcelain throne on Xmas is so on brand; Erika is no stranger to being wonderfully over-the-top, and this toilet situation is one of the many reasons why she's a true legend. Here are just some of the things Erika has done in the last few years that are delightfully extra.\n\nThis Yuletide Hairdo\n\nShe sure had a hairy, jolly Christmas.\n\nHer Office\n\nLast year, she opened up an \u201coffice\u201d in Hollywood called the Pretty Mess Clubhouse. In lieu of cubicles and fax machines, Erika's office boasts an enormous closet, a well-lit makeup room, a lounge, and a bar. It\u2019s a space where she and the Erika Jayne team conduct all Erika Jayne-related business, aka the greatest place on the planet.\n\nThe Octopus Tank That\u2019s Nestled In A Bookshelf\n\nAnimal Planet on YouTube\n\nIn a 2016 episode of Animal Planet series Tanked, fish tank designers Brett Raymer and Wayde King built an aquarium for Tom and Erika\u2019s pet octopus. Yes, an eight-legged cephalopod lives in the study of their home. There are no words.\n\nThe Gold Room From The \u201cHow Many F**ks?\u201d Music Video\n\nerikajayneVEVO on YouTube\n\nOK, this entire music video is wild, but everything happening in that gold room? Whew. That gold lipstick is next-level.\n\nThe Money-Stuffed Pillows From The \"XXPEN$IVE\" Music Video\n\nerikajayneVEVO on YouTube\n\nPerfect. Just perfect.\n\nThe House She Rented In Greece\n\nBravo on YouTube\n\nWhen Erika booked a performance in Greece in Season 7, she and Kyle Richards stayed in a place that rented for $50,000/week. Ah, chump change.\n\nThe Beginning Of This Dancing With The Stars Performance\n\nDancing With The Stars on YouTube\n\nRemember when she kicked off her routine to \u201cXXPEN$IVE\u201d perched atop a unicorn? No one is worthy.\n\nHer Vacation Lookbooks\n\nLeave town without a binder full of vacation outfits? Erika would never. Who wants to waste valuable trip time trying to figure out what they\u2019re going to wear or attempting to recall why they packed what they packed?\n\nHer Pair Of Private Planes\n\nHer family owns not one, but two private planes. Two. Why? As she told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in 2016, \u201cBecause one is small and one is big.\u201d Well, there you have it.\n\nAnd now, she\u2019s given her significant other a toilet for Christmas. A fancy, xxpen$ive, and heated toilet. Here\u2019s an important question: Did she wrap the toilet in wrapping paper and put it under the tree, or did she have it installed while Tom was at work? Gosh, it really is too bad RHOBH isn't filming right now. It would've been life-changing to see a toilet-shaped package waiting under the Girardi Xmas tree on an episode of the reality show.\n\nHow will she possibly top such an iconic present next year? No idea. But if history tells us anything, it's that Erika will undoubtedly figure out how to outpoo, er, outdo a $5,000 toilet.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/14/efcd4f59-9964-4c6d-a6ad-4634b0b09f8a-getty-1156675580.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/28/d54fe8ab-1fc8-40c3-baaa-3ac24513a087-getty-875976230.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/15/37f4f60e-5d87-4523-9a7d-39f782b3c0e4-getty-1209799355.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/2/948eaa3d-8423-428e-aff3-e7157351d9a6-getty-1205159727.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/2/6534f3ff-ed4a-48a5-867b-2a0737fbc057-getty-1154921708.jpg?w=100&h=100&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/28/d54fe8ab-1fc8-40c3-baaa-3ac24513a087-getty-875976230.jpg?w=970&h=546&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/28/d54fe8ab-1fc8-40c3-baaa-3ac24513a087-getty-875976230.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/erika-jaynes-christmas-gift-for-her-husband-may-be-the-most-extra-thing-you-hear-all-day-7715414", "title": "Erika Jayne\u2019s Christmas Gift For Her Husband May Be The Most Extra Thing You Hear All Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/erika-jaynes-christmas-gift-for-her-husband-may-be-the-most-extra-thing-you-hear-all-day-7715414", "type": "article", "title": "Erika Jayne's Christmas Gift To Her Husband May Be The Most Extra Thing You Hear All Day", "description": "Here's a fact that will never stop being incredible: Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star and \u201cPainkillr\u201d songstress Erika Girardi gave her husband a toilet for Christmas this year \u2014 and it's not just any ol' commode.
