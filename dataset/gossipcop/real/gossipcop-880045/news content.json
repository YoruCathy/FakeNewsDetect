This is all I got. Don\u2019t take my baby, OK?\u201d Gibson says in the video as he sobs while wearing a \u201cShayla Rocks\u201d sweatshirt. \u201cI\u2019ve been away from my baby for two months. I just want my baby and no one\u2019s listening cause no one\u2019s in the courtroom.\u201d\n\nIn court documents, Norma accused the actor \u2013 whom she wed in 2007 and divorced in 2009 \u2013 of physically abusing their 10-year-old daughter, which Gibson denies.\n\nI\u2019m at $13,000 a month, what more do you want from me?\u201d Gibson says in the Facebook video. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you Norma. I don\u2019t know why you hate me, but I don\u2019t hate you. But you just can\u2019t wake up on September 11th and accuse me of something I didn\u2019t do!\u201d\n\nJohnson has yet to publicly acknowledge Gibson\u2019s comments.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-tyrese.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-tyrese.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tyrese-gibson-i-was-never-mad-at-the-rock/", "title": "Tyrese Gibson: \u2018I Was Never Mad at The Rock\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Tyrese Gibson clarified the ongoing drama between him and Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson \u2013 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tyrese Gibson: \u2018I Was Never Mad at The Rock'", "description": "Tyrese Gibson clarified the ongoing drama between him and Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson \u2013 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tyrese-gibson-i-was-never-mad-at-the-rock/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:20:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-tyrese.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-tyrese.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-02T16:37:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:20:30+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Tyrese Gibson clarified the ongoing drama between him and Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson \u2013 get the details", "title": "Tyrese Gibson: \u2018I Was Never Mad at The Rock'", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-tyrese.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509640632.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
