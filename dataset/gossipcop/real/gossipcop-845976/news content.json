Why why why,\u201d she wrote, retweeting Feldman\u2019s post. (Looking to make a similar mistake? Vale's drum is $36 on Amazon.)\n\nVale appears to be enjoying a wonderful holiday seasons so far. In addition to getting a fun new toy, she recently got to visit one of her idols, Peppa Pig.\n\nThe face-to-snout meeting came when Peppa, a rockstar among the preschool bunch, paid a visit last week to TODAY's Studio 1A. Vale initially appeared stunned by her brush with fame, but began jumping up and down with excitement after the shock wore off.\n\nThese items were hand-picked by our editorial team because we love them - and we hope you do, too.
