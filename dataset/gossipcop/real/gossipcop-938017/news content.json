Then, Lucasfilm fired the duo and brought in Ron Howard to both finish and reshoot a large portion of the film. A new piece details the process behind the Solo firing of Lord and Miller and the hiring of Howard.\n\nThe ever-expanding Star Wars franchise made headlines when Lucasfilm gave Solo directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller the axe after months of filming. Rumors abounded that the 21 Jump Street directors had clashed with Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy. Reports also stated Lord and Miller were stunned to \u201cfind that they were not being granted freedom to run the production in the manner that they were accustomed to.\u201d\n\nNow, a detailed piece from Entertainment Weekly breaks this down and explains the inside story behind Lord and Miller being fired and Ron Howard being brought in to finish the film.\n\nLord and Miller\n\n\u201cI think both Chris and Phil are enormously talented and incredibly funny,\u201d Kathleen Kennedy tells EW. But apparently, they weren\u2019t talented or funny enough to deliver the type of Han Solo film Lucasfilm was looking for.\n\nPer the EW piece, Lord and Miller took an experimental approach to Solo: A Star Wars Story. The filmmakers were open to improvisation. Improvisation isn\u2019t discouraged in the Star Wars franchise, yet Lord and Miller\u2019s approach was allegedly slowing things down. Kathleen Kennedy explains:\n\n\u201cI think these guys are hilarious, but they come from a background of animation and sketch comedy and when you are making these movies you can do that and there\u2019s plenty of room for improvisation, we do that all the time, but it has to be inside of a highly structured process or you can\u2019t get the work done and you can\u2019t move the armies of people to anticipate and have things ready. So, it literally came down to process. Just getting it done.\u201d\n\nThis squares with the statement Lord and Miller released after they left the production:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, our vision and process weren\u2019t aligned with our partners on this project. We normally aren\u2019t fans of the phrase \u2018creative differences\u2019 but for once this clich\u00e9 is true. We are really proud of the amazing and world-class work of our cast and crew.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everybody went in with really good intentions and our approach to making the movie was different than theirs,\u201d Lord said later (via Vulture). \u201cThat was a really big gap to bridge, and it proved to be too big\u2026Sometimes people break up, and it\u2019s really sad, and it\u2019s really disappointing, but it happens and we learned a lot from our collaborators and we\u2019re better filmmakers for it.\u201d\n\nRon Howard\n\nLucasfilm announced Ron Howard would take over Solo two days after the news of Lord and Miller\u2019s firing broke. Howard isn\u2019t the most inspired choice, but he\u2019s a pro who knows how to get a film done on time. The director told EW he was slightly hesitant about taking the gig, not wanting to step on Lord and Miller\u2019s toes:\n\n\u201cI know Chris and Phil. They\u2019re incredibly talented guys\u2026But when I learned that this change was happening, it just came in a moment where I was working on lots of new projects for Imagine, and I had not planned to direct anything last year. So then this came my way\u2026I was reluctant, but I also began to feel that I could help.\u201d\n\nHoward is a big Star Wars fan, and ultimately the job was too good to pass up. So how much of the final film is Howard\u2019s, and how much belongs to Lord and Miller? Opinions differ. Co-star Thandie Newton said, \u201c[Lord and Miller\u2019s work is] work is everywhere in it. Ninety percent of my stuff is with them. And it certainly wasn\u2019t about, \u2018Oh we have to start again and do it all over.\u201d Meanwhile, Newton\u2019s co-star Paul Bettany claims that Howard \u201creshot a lot more than was originally intended.\u201d\n\nWe may never know the true answer. Howard deliberately dances around the issue in the EW piece:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to explain it. I don\u2019t really want to be specific about that because, again, I don\u2019t even want that to matter to fans. I could understand why you\u2019d ask, and some might even be curious, but look, everybody who has been involved in this has done nothing but love what this movie could be, and that\u2019s been the vibe around it. I think audiences are gonna feel that love and excitement.\u201d\n\nHoward does add:\u201dPhil and Chris\u2019s fingerprints are all over the movie, given how much they put into it and the time they put into it. I hope fans won\u2019t even think about how the movie was made. They should just lose themselves in it.\u201d\n\nGeorge Lucas\n\nEven if most of the final footage in Solo was shot by Howard, he had a little help from a very familiar Star Wars face: George Lucas. Per EW, Lucas visited Howard\u2019s set and offered advice on a scene. \u201c[George Lucas] had intended to just kind of stop by and say hi, and he stayed five hours,\u201d Kennedy tells EW. \u201cThere\u2019s even one little moment in a scene that \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you what, sorry \u2014 but in the scene on the Millennium Falcon where George said, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Han just do this.\u2019\u2026Ron happened to be by the monitor and not inside the Falcon and he goes, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a great idea,\u2019 and ran in and said, \u2018George wants us to do this.\u2019\u201d\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story opens on May 25, 2018.", "images": ["https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/Solo-firing-700x300.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/siteimages/pm-comments.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/authors/49.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/young-han-solo-cast.jpg", "https://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?1648144&101", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/young-han-solo-cast-700x393.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/ron-howard-1-700x394.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/geroge-lucas-solo-700x300.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/young-han-solo-cast.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Evangelista"], "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/solo-firing/", "title": "\u2018Solo\u2019 Firing Explained: Why Lucasfilm Replaced Lord and Miller With Ron Howard", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 254451208349115}, "description": "New details have emerged about the controversial Solo firing.
