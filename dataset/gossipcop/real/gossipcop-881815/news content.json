He reminded viewers that when Republicans tried to pass a health care bill earlier this summer, it was called a \u201clast-ditch\u201d effort \u2014 and that the same language is being used now.\n\n\u201cO.K., no, no. You can\u2019t have another last-ditch effort, O.K.? No. It says \u2018last\u2019 right in the name. Jesus didn\u2019t have the Last Supper and then go, \u2018You know what, I could actually eat again. Let\u2019s do it, bang bang, I\u2019ll meet you at Chili\u2019s in 20 minutes.\u2019\u201d \u2014 TREVOR NOAH\n\nStephen Colbert suggested some more metaphorical language.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are trying to repeal and replace Obamacare, again. This is beyond beating a dead horse. This is getting damn close to bestiality, O.K.? I hope that horse has a safe word.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\nChronicles of Nambia\n\nPresident Trump misspoke at the United Nations on Wednesday when addressing a conference of African leaders. The hosts were ready to roast.\n\n\u201cDuring a speech today, Trump mispronounced the African nation of Namibia, and instead called it Nambia. Then Trump corrected himself and said, \u2018Sorry, I meant Narnia.\u2019\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON \u201cNow, there is no such country as Nambia. Despite that, they will soon have a better health care system than we do. I might move to Nambia.\u201d \u2014 STEPHEN COLBERT\n\nThe Punchiest Punchlines (Pumpkin Edition)\n\n\u201cPresident Trump tweeted this morning, quote, \u2018Big meetings today at the United Nations, so many interesting leaders.\u2019 While the United Nations tweeted, \u2018Day 2 of this guy, buckle up everyone.\u2019\u201d \u2014 SETH MEYERS \u201cI read that farmers in Europe are close to growing a 3,000-pound pumpkin. Then Americans said, \u2018Eh, let us know when you elect one.\u2019\u201d \u2014 JIMMY FALLON\n\nThe Bits Worth Watching\n\nTwo of Samantha Bee\u2019s \u201cFull Frontal\u201d correspondents went to Netroots Nation to take the pulse of a Democratic Party in need of some healing.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-articleLarge.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-facebookJumbo.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-facebookJumbo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/television/kimmel-cassidy-health-care.html", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Doubles Down on Criticism of Health Care Bill", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-09-21T09:10:09.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-21T10:45:51.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/giovanni-russonello", "tag": "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah (TV Program)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005448268, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/a367f880-58cb-5169-83bc-193f0a58b805", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/64fa53efa88e4817879b27f0ee00d1e3", "description": "Mr. Kimmel excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy and his legislation for a second night, though he said he hoped to avoid \u201ca Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation.\u201d", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-facebookJumbo.png", "byl": "By Giovanni Russonello", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-thumbStandard.png", "news_keywords": "Jimmy Kimmel,Bill Cassidy,Lindsey Graham,Jimmy Fallon,Samantha Bee,Stephen Colbert,Trevor Noah,Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,,Late Night with Seth Meyers,Late Show with Stephen Colbert,The Daily Show with Trevor Noah", "pdate": 20170921, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/television/kimmel-cassidy-health-care.html", "type": "article", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Doubles Down on Criticism of Health Care Bill", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-facebookJumbo.png", "alt": "Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy and his health care proposal for the second night in a row."}, "description": "Mr. Kimmel excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy and his legislation for a second night, though he said he hoped to avoid \u201ca Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation.\u201d"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/television/kimmel-cassidy-health-care.html", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Doubles Down on Criticism of Health Care Bill", "description": "Mr. Kimmel excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy and his legislation for a second night, though he said he hoped to avoid \u201ca Kanye-and-Taylor-Swift-type situation.\u201d", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/arts/21latenight1/21latenight1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png", "alt": "Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday excoriated Senator Bill Cassidy and his health care proposal for the second night in a row."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/a367f880-58cb-5169-83bc-193f0a58b805"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "television", "CN": "best-of-late-night", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/television/kimmel-cassidy-health-care.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/a367f880-58cb-5169-83bc-193f0a58b805", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/television/kimmel-cassidy-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/television/kimmel-cassidy-health-care.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505923200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
