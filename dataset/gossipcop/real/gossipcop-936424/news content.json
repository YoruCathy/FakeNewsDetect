Usually, the fascinator is worn during the ceremony and the reception, but will often be taken off in the evening or during dinner.\n\nA fascinator may seem ostentatious to those who aren't used to the style, but they are staples in a Brit's wardrobe.\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge attends the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews at St Mark's Church on May 20, 2017 in Englefield Green, England.

I definitely think they\u2019ve evolved from being a small, pretty thing like a little piece of netting with a flower to being these very over-the-top fashion statements.\"\n\nFascinators can come in all shapes and sizes, but they do have certain parameters.\n\nA fascinator is a decorative hat that is typically large and attached to a headband, small combs or an elastic back.\n\n\"They\u2019re attached to headbands, they\u2019re easy to wear, and they still allow you to make a bold fashion statement,\" Cotton said.\n\nHow did the fascinator get its name?\n\nThe word \u201cfascinator\u201d may trace its roots back to the Latin word \"fascinatus,\" which means to bewitch, according to Cotton.\n\n\"And I think fascinators can certainly do that,\" Cotton said. \"They give people a chance to make a bold fashion statement.\"\n\nWhen did fascinators come onto the fashion scene?\n\nFascinators have been used for hundreds of years, according to fashion experts, but Cotton contends they've been through quite an evolution since their advent.\n\n\"In the 19th and 20th centuries, fascinators were light knitted headpieces, but the modern fascinator ... really became popular in the 1980s and \u201990s,\" Cotton said.\n\nPrincess Beatrice departs the Royal Wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London. UK Press via Getty Images\n\nSandra Walcott, an adjunct assistant professor for the Fashion Institute of Technology's Accessories Design Department, told \"GMA\" the fascinator became popular after milliners Stephen Jones and Philip Treacy created some creative pieces for London celebrities.\n\nJones had Diana, Princess of Wales, as a consistent client due to his avant-garde designs in the early 1980s.\n\nTreacy is a favorite of many international celebrities, such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Of the various transfixing fascinators worn to Prince William and Kate Middleton's 2011 wedding, 36 of them were Treacy's.\n\nMost notably, Princess Beatrice's oddly shaped fascinator she wore to William and Kate's ceremony was designed by Treacy.\n\nPrincess Eugenie of York arrives to the Royal Wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London.

Right by her side, was Princess Eugenie of York.\n\n\"The most famous fascinator that I remember is the one worn by Princess Eugenie,\" Walcott said. \"The fascinator is said to be 'outlandish' due to its large size, odd shape, and awkward placement at the front of the head.\"\n\nWhy do British women wear them?\n\nFascinators became prevalent because there's a feeling in Britain that one is not fully dressed without something on your head, according to Walcott.\n\n\"Think of the expression 'dressed from head to toe,'\" she added.\n\nThe accessory also helps bring the eyes upward, Walcott noted, towards a person's face, and can enhance a woman's overall look.\n\nBut Cotton has a practical theory on why they are so widely worn.\n\n\"I think fascinators became popular because they don\u2019t mess with your hair,\" she said.\n\nZara Phillips and Chanelle McCoy attend day 2 'Ladies Day' of the Cheltenham Festival at Cheltenham Racecourse on March 14, 2018 in Cheltenham, England.
