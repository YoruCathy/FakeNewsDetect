A source close to the star told HL EXCLUSIVELY her plans to relax and kick it with her friends and family.\n\nTaylor Swift\u2018s plans for her upcoming yuletide festivities are some serious holiday goals. A source close to the pop singer told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY her low-key approach to the season of greetings this year. \u201cTaylor wants to lie low and hang out with family and friends and just hopes everyone is happy and healthy,\u201d our source told us. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need much more than that right now in her life. Things are pretty good.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite not wanting any presents herself, Taylor is all about treating her feline besties Olivia and Meredith to all of the best gifts. \u201cAs for gifts for the holidays she really wants to and will spoil Olivia and Meredith, her cats,\u201d our source went on to say. \u201cThey always live the best life but they are definitely going to be very much spoiled this year and their holiday season is going to be awesome because Taylor loves them so much.\u201d\n\nWe reported earlier how Zayn Malik may have seemingly confirmed a wild theory about Taylor. Way back in 2017, there was a lot of speculation that Taylor had been transported outside of her apartment in a suitcase. In a new interview for the December issue of Vogue U.K Zayn admitted, \u201cShe was traveling around in a suitcase,\u201d in order to avoid the paparazzi while she was recording Reputation. Who knows? Maybe she\u2019ll receive a new suitcase for the holidays! We\u2019ll keep you posted on all of the latest news about Taylor. In the meantime, check out all of her latest pics in our gallery above.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/taylor_cats-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tim_mcgovern.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/taylor_cats-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F11%2F15%2Ftaylor-swift-holiday-plans-spoil-cats%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3406064", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/taylor_cats-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Mcgovern", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Weekend Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/11/15/taylor-swift-holiday-plans-spoil-cats/", "title": "Taylor Swift: Why She\u2019s Planning To \u2018Lie Low\u2019 For The Holidays \u2014 She Wants To Just Spoil Her Cats", "meta_data": {"description": "According to a source, Taylor Swift's holiday plans include spoiling her cats.", "news_keywords": "Taylor Swift", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift: Why She\u2019s Planning To \u2018Lie Low\u2019 For The Holidays \u2014 She Wants To Just Spoil Her Cats", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/11/15/taylor-swift-holiday-plans-spoil-cats/", "description": "How is Talyor Swift going to ring in the holidays this year?
