{"url": "https://welcometotwinpeaks.com/theories/the-four-seasons-of-twin-peaks/", "text": "What if I told you we\u2019ve been watching Twin Peaks the wrong way all these years? What if I told you that David Lynch and Mark Frost\u2019s seminal early-90s TV series didn\u2019t have two seasons\u2014but four? Let me explain:\n\nFor all these years, we\u2019ve been engaging with Lynch and Frost\u2019s series as two wildly uneven seasons\u2014the first a perfect nine hours of suspense, surrealism, and shocking reveals, followed by a front-loaded and sprawling second season where the wheels come off. By contrast, the show can be organized into four shorter seasons,each around eight hours, each with a beginning, middle, and end, and each with their own thematic fixations and arcs.\n\nA quote from Mark Frost spurred me to contemplate this new arrangement. In October 2014, BuzzFeed asked Frost why Showtime only ordered nine episodes. (If you recall, the new season was originally slated for nine installments. It\u2019s since expanded to eighteen, a disparity I\u2019ll discuss later.)\n\nAbout the nine-episode length, Frost said:\n\n\u201cWell, if you think back about the first season, if you put the pilot together with the seven that we did, you get nine hours. It just felt like the right number. I\u2019ve always felt the story should take as long as the story takes to tell. That\u2019s what felt right to us.\u201d\n\nAfter reading Frost\u2019s quote, I fixated on that nine-hour length, pondering the various ways different networks approach the concept of a \u201cseason\u201d of television. The classic American network season runs more than twenty episodes and unspools over the course of several months, usually from September until the start of summer.\n\nBut as all of us TV nerds have learned in this, the Golden Era of Television, that\u2019s not the only game in town. (Note: Spoilers for Mad Men and Breaking Bad appear in this graf.) Basic cable introduced us to shorter seasons\u2014the first five seasons of HBO\u2019s The Sopranos each ran for thirteen episodes, while its supersized sixth season ran for a more network-style twenty-one. (Though if you ask me, The Sopranos really ran for seven seasons, twelve episodes for season \u201csix\u201d and nine for season \u201cseven.\u201d As you can tell, I like reorganizing classic shows.) Other great basic-cable shows followed the \u201cbaker\u2019s dozen\u201d format. Mad Men\u2019s first six seasons each ran for thirteen episodes, while its final season ran for fourteen. (I also prefer to think of Mad Men\u2019s final season as two smaller seasons.) Breaking Bad\u2019s first season ran a very Twin Peaks-y seven episodes, while its following four installments each ran thirteen. It\u2019s fifth and final season ran sixteen episodes, split into two eight-episode legs across two years.\n\n(Side note: There\u2019s a related conversation to be had about the \u201cBBC\u201d model, where shows run for precisely as long as they need\u2014The Office\u2019s fourteen episodes and Sherlock\u2019s twelve (so far). Both models have their virtues, but for now, I\u2019m going to focus on the AMC model as it relates to Twin Peaks.)\n\nLooking across these shows, we see the rise of a new phenomenon\u2014the \u201cmidseason finale.\u201d The midseason finale bears all the hallmarks of a standard finale\u2014the protagonists usually find themselves in a bind or the narrative otherwise comes to a head. Mad Men and Breaking Bad both had their share of memorable midseason finales. \u201cWaterloo\u201d ended the first leg of Mad Men\u2019s seventh season with such shocking twists as Bert Cooper\u2019s death and the sale of SCD&P to McCann-Erickson. And of course, Breaking Bad\u2019s now-legendary fifth midseason finale saw Hank Schraeder finally figure out the identity of Heisenberg.\n\nWhy am I talking about this? To soften you up to accept my thesis: that like all of the classic shows it sired, Twin Peaks followed a similar format over its twenty-nine-episode run, delivering about eight hours of television at a time, each with their own premieres and finales.\n\nColoquially, I refer to 12-13 episodes as the \u201cAMC\u201d model for season length. (And by \u201ccoloquially,\u201d I mean \u201cI\u2019m the only person who uses that term because it\u2019s a made-up thing.\u201d) But for the sake of this essay, let me introduce a new made-up thing: the \u201cFrost and Lynch\u201d\u2014or F&L\u2014model for season length. The F&L model runs for seven to nine hours. Shorter and leaner than the AMC model, the F&L model skews more toward the BBC format, which favors the unity and symmetry of films and only calls on its TV seasons to run for precisely as long as they need to tell their stories.\n\nSo finally, let\u2019s talk about The Four Seasons of Twin Peaks. I\u2019ll specify how and where each season begins and ends, why I made the choices I did, all while discussing the strengths and weakness of each season\u2014because believe me, some seasons are better than others.\n\nNeedless to say, MAJOR SPOILERS LIE AHEAD!\n\nSeason One: \u201cMurder In A Small Town\u201d\n\nPilot and episodes 1.1 through 1.7\n\nThe one unit of F&L-style seasonal storytelling you can spot with the naked eye is the first season of Twin Peaks, which also happens to be the actual, literal first season of the show. Starting with the now legendary pilot, the first season introduces us to the bizarre and byzantine world of Twin Peaks, with its interlocking network of rivalries, grudges, financial dealings, secret loves, and old hatreds\u2014to say nothing of all the Norwegians, Brie sandwiches, black coffee, and delicious cherry pie.\n\nTwin Peaks is many things\u2014it\u2019s a meditation on how evil can infest even the most good-hearted people; it\u2019s a TV version of Blue Velvet; it\u2019s a portrait of a small town in mourning. It\u2019s also a cannily self-aware goof on TV itself, using the tropes and traditions of classic TV\u2014including and especially barn-burning night-time soaps and the cornpone sitcoms of the 60s and 70s. Frost, an alum of such meat \u2019n\u2019 potatoes dramas as Hill Street Blues, helped Lynch build a reliably engrossing cast of regulars, some of whom could\u2019ve been lifted out of Dynasty or Dallas (Josie Packard, Catherine Martell, the Hornes); while others hailed more from Mayberry or Green Acres (Sheriff Truman, Andy, Lucy, Hawk). That unusual division makes for a pleasing \u201ccourt and mechanicals\u201d rift among the series regulars\u2014a rift spanned by the show\u2019s lead, the boundlessly kind and intuitive Agent Dale Cooper. Cooper (a stand-in of sorts for Lynch) serves many functions in the narrative\u2014he drives the investigation into Laura Palmer\u2019s murder, he provides key exposition\u2014but more than anything else, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s decent and kind and empathetic, and in a show that\u2019s largely about a battle between kindness and cruelty, he\u2019s our greatest, clearest, most shining avatar for the former.\n\nBut anyway, let\u2019s get back to season one, which unfolds over the course of nine of the most perfect hours ever seen on television. I get goosebumps when I recall some of its best moments\u2014when the gang discovers the mysterious cabin where Laura and Ronette spent some of their harrowing final moments; when Coop asks Hawk if he believes in souls (\u201cSeveral,\u201d comes Hawk\u2019s prescient answer).\n\nThe first season also includes some of the finest examples of what makes Twin Peaks so influential: its willingness to smuggle arthouse imagery onto mainstream television. Sometimes that imagery is a simple combination of the daft and the terrifying, such as when Waldo the parrot gets it: Perched above an exquisite arrangement of doughnuts, Waldo chillingly recites Laura\u2019s sorry pleas before an unseen gunman silences him, spattering the bird\u2019s blood across the table.\n\nOther times that imagery is\u2026 well, this:\n\nAmong its many virtues, Twin Peaks acted as a Trojan horse for arthouse imagery, techniques, impulses, and methods. It gave David Lynch a nationwide showcase for his mastery of dream-logic\u2014and that daring has echoed across the following decades. I\u2019d argue with confidence that not only did Twin Peaks sire the current golden age of television, but also that it specifically paved the way for shows like The Sopranos and Mad Men, both of which traffic in dream-logic storytelling.\n\nSeason One at a Glance\n\nStrengths: Narrative tightness, dreamy imagery, perfect introductions\u2014and every episode is a classic.\n\nWeaknesses: I\u2019ve never liked how Major Briggs strikes Bobby in the pilot. It\u2019s always felt like an early-development misstep\u2014a flashy choice they made before they really got to know the character.\n\nBest episode: This was a tough choice between the pilot and episode three, \u201cZen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer,\u201d but episode three scores a narrow victory. From beginning to end, it\u2019s a perfect episode, packed with unforgettable scenes\u2014from the opening introduction of a baguette-bearing Jerry Horne to Coop\u2019s rock-toss to the now-immortal first visit to the Black Lodge, it introduced the imagery and perfected the particular off-kilter tone and humor that made Twin Peaks a hit.\n\nSecond-best episode: I\u2019m a huge fan of the season-one finale. It\u2019s the only episode written and directed entirely by Mark Frost, and it shows. One of Twin Peaks\u2019 myriad delights is the ongoing storytelling tension between its two eminent showrunners\u2014Lynch is withholding and abstract, Frost generous and straightforward. Well, that straightforwardness makes for a rousing, headlong finale. I mean, it\u2019s simply packed with stuff happening: the mill gets blown up, Andy shoots Jacques Renault, and of course, Coop gets shot.\n\nSeason Two: \u201cThe Investigation\u201d\n\nEpisodes 2.1 through 2.7\n\nMy toughest choice for this essay was where to place the \u201csecond\u201d season finale. Given that the first 15-16 episodes all bear on the revelation (and death) of Laura\u2019s murderer, I had a few options. Does the \u201cseason\u201d end right after her killer is revealed, in episode seven, \u201cLonely Souls\u201d? Or does it end when her killer dies in episode nine, \u201cArbitrary Law\u201d?\n\nI eventually decided to make episode seven, \u201cLonely Souls,\u201d the finale. Here\u2019s why: If you were to plot the episodes of Twin Peaks on a graph where the Y-axis represented an amalgam of quality and thematic payload, you\u2019d see several spikes, usually when Lynch and Frost dropped in to write and direct an episode. They dropped in less and less often as the series went on, turning over the major writing duties to a team that came to be dominated by Harley Peyton and Robert Engels (who was a major contributor to both the series finale and the movie, Fire Walk With Me), and an eclectic crew of directors that included television journeymen (or journeywomen) like Lesli Linka Glatter, Todd Holland, and Tim Hunter, as well as some oddballs like Diane Keaton (whose episode ain\u2019t bad) and Uli Edel.\n\nBut the Lynch episodes carry an especial level of importance, and if we also factor the series finale into this equation, we further find that the series\u2019 major events revolve around the activity of the BOB entity.\n\nAnd on that note, let commence an aria about the Twin Peaks that could\u2019ve been:\n\nBy now, it\u2019s conventional wisdom that ABC screwed up the show by forcing Lynch and Frost to reveal the identity of Laura\u2019s killer. It robbed the narrative of its momentum and revealed the execs\u2019 fundamental misunderstanding of what Twin Peaks was\u2014it was never a murder mystery. It was a demented and dreamy portrait of a small town. Laura Palmer\u2019s murder was simply an initial, delicious hook to reel in the audience. In a better world, the showrunners would\u2019ve been able to delay the revelation of Laura\u2019s murderer until the series had run its course, saving its most dramatically satisfying reveal for the series\u2019 final movements, much in the same manner as The Fugitive, which saved the capture of the one-armed murderer (himself referenced in Twin Peaks\u2019 own one-armed man) for its series finale.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: not even ABC could completely screw up a show this good. Happily, the revelation of Laura\u2019s killer only raised a larger, more inscrutable question: What exactly is happening in Twin Peaks? That structure\u2014answering one question while raising others\u2014was forced upon Lynch and Frost, but they handled it gamely, establishing a modus operandi later imitated by shows like LOST. (Side note\u2014LOST ain\u2019t perfect, but damn if it isn\u2019t the closest thing we\u2019ve had over the years to the kind of week-to-week weirdness that Twin Peaks delivered. I rewatched it recently, and it remains one of the all-time great shows.) In any event, here\u2019s the point of my aria: Lynch and Frost are master showrunners. When forced to solve their story\u2019s central mystery, they deftly redirected the show\u2019s energies into a new and larger mystery: what is BOB?\n\nSo endeth my aria. Let\u2019s try to focus on taking about what actually happens in my proposed season two: we meet some intriguing new characters (Lenny von Dohlen\u2019s Harold Smith, among others) and delve deeper into to the investigation of Laura\u2019s murder. We also learn that while Laura\u2019s murderer was technically her father, Leland (the incomparable Ray Wise), we also learn that he was under the possession of the malevolent entity BOB.\n\nThis season also sets up the following two seasons in my arrangement: Coop gets word that his old nemesis, Windom Earle, may be at large again, while Major Briggs hints that something paranormal may be afoot in the woods surrounding Twin Peaks.\n\nSeason Two at a Glance\n\nStrengths: Momentum established in season one carries through the end of this season. We find out who killed Laura. We learn more about the entity BOB. Premiere and finale are both top-notch episodes.\n\nWeaknesses: That \u201cseason one\u201d magic starts to fade, but otherwise, I\u2019d argue this season is as strong as season one.\n\nBest episode: \u201cLonely Souls.\u201d\n\nSeason Three: \u201cAftermath\u201d\n\nEpisodes 2.8 through 2.14\n\nWell, it was nice while it lasted.\n\nMy \u201cthird\u201d season of Twin Peaks compartmentalizes all of the series\u2019 weakest elements. Its worst storylines and worst episodes can all be found in this seven-episode stretch, which sees James ditch town for a pointless fling, Nadine succumb to retrograde amnesia, and Ben Horne become a Confederate war general. Hoo boy.\n\nOn the plus side, there are some great episodes in here. The Tim Hunter-directed ninth episode, \u201cArbitrary Law\u201d\u2014which unmasks Laura\u2019s killer\u2014features one of the series\u2019 most powerful scenes\u2014Coop cradling a dying Leland after he confesses to the crime. As the jail\u2019s malfunctioning sprinklers rain upon them, Coop recites from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, providing Leland absolution before he dies. On the writing side, Harley Peyton and Robert Engels start to take the reigns. I have no idea if either of them emerged as defacto showrunner, but I generally dig their episodes.\n\nAs for the \u201cthird\u201d season finale, I decided on \u201cDouble Play.\u201d Windom Earle\u2019s first appearance onscreen remains a strong moment, and it kicks off the action for my proposed \u201cfourth\u201d season.\n\nStrengths: Although the show jumps the proverbial shark in its \u201cthird\u201d season, it\u2019s still got that Twin Peaks magic, which lends it incredible charm even through its weakest stretch. Gary Hershberger\u2019s Mike, basically unseen since the pilot, gets to shine. Windom Earle\u2019s impending entry to the fray is legitimately menacing.\n\nWeaknesses: Too many to count.\n\nBest episode: \u201cArbitrary Law.\u201d\n\nSeason Four: \u201cProject Blue Book\u201d\n\nEpisodes 2.15 through 2.22\n\nTwin Peaks was the first show I binged.\n\nThis was years before Netflix streaming, years even before Netflix\u2019s DVD-by-mail service. I was just out of college, and although I\u2019d seen the show\u2019s first season (as well as the movie\u2014don\u2019t judge me), I\u2019d never watched the show in its entirety. Luckily, my mom\u2019d given me the complete series on VHS (!) for my birthday. Over the course of a week, I watched the whole series in grainy, pan-and-scan, LP glory.\n\nEver since that first viewing, the awesomeness of the final eight episodes has lingered with me. When I first encountered the Black Lodge, I felt sure that it\u2019d be impossible for the showrunners to explain what it was without robbing it of its power.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nOver the course of eight episodes, Twin Peaks imports themes and devices from shows like The Night-Stalker and The X-Files, pitching the Black Lodge as a sort of interdimensional nexus. You can only access it from certain places, and while it\u2019s well-nigh impossible to escape, if you do, you\u2019re liable to pop out at any place\u2014or any time\u2014in the world.\n\nShows like Twin Peaks often straddle the line between science-fiction and fantasy until they\u2019re forced to commit to one. LOST began as a crunchy sci-fi epic in the mode of MYST but eventually committed to contemporary fantasy in its final seasons, much to its detriment, I\u2019d argue. But Twin Peaks gets to have its cake and eat it by treating the Black Lodge as neither magic or science, but paranormal and preternatural. Twin Peaks draws on a great many American folk myths, including an old favorite of mine, the Mothman. As the story goes, the Mothman is an extradimensional entity that supposedly menaced the town of Point Pleasnt, W.Va., in the late sixties, wreaking all manner of mind-bending havoc\u2014delivering confusing reports about the future, teleporting people great distances, and inducing selective amnesia (or time-loss) among its victims. If you ask me, encountering the Mothman sounds a lot like a visit to the Black Lodge. (Side note, Mark Pellington\u2019s 2002 movie The Mothman Prophecies is worth a look. It\u2019s based on John Keel\u2019s (supposedly) nonfiction book of the same name.)\n\nAnyway, in its \u201cfourth\u201d season, Twin Peaks deepens its mythology, placing the eccentric hamlet at the center of an interdimensional superhighway. Incidentally, more of this deeper mythmaking bubbles up in the prequel movie, Fire Walk With Me, as well as its companion work, The Missing Pieces\u2014basically ninety minutes of deleted scenes from the movie. In FWWM and The Missing Pieces, we glimpse new realms (and new citizens) of the Black Lodge, while also bearing witness to some of its temperospatial aftereffects\u2014David Bowie\u2019s Phillip Jeffries teleports across the world in the manner of the X-Men\u2019s Nightcrawler, while Heather Graham\u2019s Annie Blackburn appears to Laura Palmer to warn her of future calamity.\n\nStrengths: An alluringly creepy, paranormal tone. The finale is one of the greatest episodes in TV history.\n\nWeaknesses: The sharp turn into X-Files territory may not be to everyone\u2019s liking, but it\u2019s certainly to mine.\n\nBest episode: \u201cBeyond Life and Death.\u201d\n\nSo those are my proposed four seasons of Twin Peaks. What do you think? How might you rearrange the episodes, if at all? Should someone assemble a new prequel miniseries built from FWWM and The Missing Pieces?\n\nAlso, what does the eighteen-episode revival herald in terms of storytelling? Will Lynch and Frost adhere to the F&L model, delivering two nine-episode \u201cseasons\u201d to us? Or have they essentially written an eighteen-hour movie that\u2019ll unspool in a way none of us can predict?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer. All I do know is I can\u2019t wait.", "images": ["https://welcometotwinpeaks.com/wp-content/plugins/wordpress-social-login/assets/img/32x32/wpzoom/instagram.png",
