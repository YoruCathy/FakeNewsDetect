This year the honor of walking the sparkly runway in the very expensive bejeweled creation will go to Lais Ribeiro, the 27-year-old Brazilian model who got her Angel wings in 2015, but has been in the Victoria's Secret family since 2010. And though they're usually made aware of the appointment months before the show, Ribeiro admits that Victoria's Secret cut it a little close this year: She didn't find out until her fitting, which took place in August. (The show tapes in Shanghai on November 21.) So how did the lingerie giant pull off the surprise?\n\n\"[Victoria's Secret] sent the new collection to me\u2014I tried [the bra], and I had to take pictures and polaroids,\" Ribeiro explains to Glamour. \"They said, \u2018Oh no, it\u2019s just for a segment on the show.\u2019 I was like, 'Sure!'\" Imagine her surprise when she's trying on looks for the show, and someone wheels in the Fantasy Bra for her to see. Luckily, we don't have to get too creative with the details, because Victoria's Secret got it all on tape.\n\n\"It was a mix of emotions inside of me,\" the model says of what was going through her head when she realized what was going on. \"I was so happy, thankful, honored to be chosen. Hard work pays off\u2014that\u2019s all I thought about. Like, wow, I\u2019ve been working with the brand for seven years, but we never know.\" As soon as she wrapped filming for the televised program (you already have a calendar alert set up for the 28th, when it airs on CBS, right?), Ribeiro got into the car to share the news with her family back in Brazil. Over FaceTime, she says, \"I put everybody in the room and I was like, \u2018I have something to tell you guys\u2019\u2014they thought I was pregnant, but I was like, \u2018No\u2026\u2019 and then they started to scream and cry. My sister dropped the phone.\u201d\n\nThough she notes that her family was number one on the list of people she wanted to share the news with, she was just as psyched to show her fellow Angels. Adriana Lima was a particularly emotional one, because she's acted as a sort of role model for Ribeiro within Victoria's Secret. \"I remember that I was just crying so much [at the fitting], and we [went] back to the room to change, and Adriana was [there]\u2014she said, \u2018Hey,\u2019 and saw [the Fantasy Bra] and was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, so well-deserved.\u2019\" For people who look up to the Angels, \"Adriana Lima is, like, the strongest because she\u2019s a mother, she\u2019s a sexy girl, she has such a strong personality\u2014but at the same time, she\u2019s so open to teach us and welcome us to where she\u2019s been living for so long,\" Ribeiro says. \"That\u2019s what\u2019s amazing about her.\"", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb993c792a0912a1c29798/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lais-ribeiro-fantasy-bra-social.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1509483033/glamour_staring-contest-with-gigi-hadid.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb97cff5bac7353480e39e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-869040110.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb8b3f010a3629e7ba8eb4/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-869029552.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb993c792a0912a1c29798/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lais-ribeiro-fantasy-bra-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ana Col\u00f3n", "Ana Col\u00f3"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/lais-ribeiro-fantasy-bra-victorias-secret-fashion-show-2017-interview", "title": "Lais Ribeiro On What a $2 Million Bra Feels Like", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Ana Col\u00f3n", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Lais Ribeiro tells 'Glamour' about how Victoria's Secret surprised her with the 2017 Fantasy Bra\u2014and what a $2 million undergarment feels like.", "id": "59fb8aca8cd9565b8c41dae5", "keywords": "style,fantasy bra,victoria's secret,vsfs,victoria's secret fashion show,lais ribeiro,victoria's secret angel,victorias secret,victorias secret fashion show,victorias secret angel", "news_keywords": "style,fantasy bra,victoria's secret,vsfs,victoria's secret fashion show,lais ribeiro,victoria's secret angel,victorias secret,victorias secret fashion show,victorias secret angel", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59fb8aca8cd9565b8c41dae5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Lais Ribeiro tells 'Glamour' about how Victoria's Secret surprised her with the 2017 Fantasy Bra\u2014and what a $2 million undergarment feels like.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb8b3613a97d0f27f4031d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-869029566.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb8b3613a97d0f27f4031d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-869029566.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Model Lais Ribeiro explains.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb993c792a0912a1c29798/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lais-ribeiro-fantasy-bra-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "What Does a $2 Million Bra Really Feel Like?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/lais-ribeiro-fantasy-bra-victorias-secret-fashion-show-2017-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Model Lais Ribeiro explains.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fb993c792a0912a1c29798/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/lais-ribeiro-fantasy-bra-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "What Does a $2 Million Bra Really Feel Like?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcBCOPa3ttQ"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
