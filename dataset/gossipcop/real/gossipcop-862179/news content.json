She tells Vanity Fair that she could have easily walked away, but instead she tapped him on the shoulder and the rest is history.\n\n\"It was last winter as she was having lunch in Beverly Hills that she saw Rodriguez walk by. 'I almost yelled out \u2018Alex,\u2019 but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,'\" says the mag. \"When she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her. 'I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say 'Hey.' I had just come from a promo for my show, Shades of Blue [in which she plays N.Y.P.D. detective Harlee Santos], so I\u2019m dressed like my character, like a boy \u2014 Timberlands, jeans, curly short hair. He looks at me. I say, 'It\u2019s Jennifer.' He says, 'You look so beautiful.'\"\n\nA-Rod texted her (or Harlee, whoever he thought she was) late that afternoon and a few nights later, the two went to dinner, neither knowing if it was a date.\n\n\"We talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the Hotel Bel Air. 'He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative! I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I\u2019m not. I just listen. So he\u2019s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\u2019t normally talk about on a first date. I don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, 'No, I don\u2019t drink,' and he asked if I minded if he had one. He was nervous, and it was really cute.'\"\n\nA-Rod, calling her \"one of the smartest, greatest women in the world,\" says that \"she told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single.\"\n\n\"I didn\u2019t know if it was a date,\" he says. \"Maybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation \u2026 I had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\"\n\n\"So I\u2019m sitting there and he\u2019s walking back, and I get a text,\" Jennifer adds. \"It says . . .\" 'You can tell her!' he says.' 'You look sexy AF.'\n\nThey both laugh. 'And then it took a turn. The fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.' I laugh, thinking she\u2019s being metaphorical. 'No, really. The fire alarm went off!'\"\n\nThe two say now that they are in their 40\u2019s and have both seen public scandals and breakups, they were ready for each other.\n\n\"I understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever,\" Jennifer says. \"In his 20s, he came into big success with the biggest baseball contract [at the time]. I had a No. 1 movie and a No. 1 album and made history. We both had ups and downs and challenges in our 30s, and by our 40s we\u2019d both been through so much. And more importantly than anything, we had both done a lot of work on ourselves.\"\n\nThey both believe that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked. \"We had to grow and discover ourselves first,\" J.Lo says.\n\nAnd you know what? These two just may last.\n\n\"J.Lo and A-Rod, by the way they come from very similar backgrounds, they started with nothing,\" says Fran Greene, relationship expert and author of Dating Again with Courage & Confidence. \"They\u2019re both Hispanic, have been married, both have children, have both been very famous.\"\n\nGreene says that one of the variables that will either make or break them is how they deal with each other\u2019s fame and fortune. \"She\u2019s working like crazy, he\u2019s reinventing himself, he's on Shark Tank, they both work a lot,\" she says. \"If they are not competitive with the fame and can negotiate how to share the spotlight, they are young enough to have a long life together.\"\n\nTheir children getting along is an added bonus, \"there are a lot of things going for them,\" says Greene. \"The anger and the resentment at the exes have been dealt with. If someone, especially with the fame and the power, has gotten out of their system what they think they\u2019re entitled to and put it in perspective, it\u2019s another reason it may work.\"\n\nThe hallmark of a good relationship for two people who have fame and fortune is respecting each\u2019s individuality. \"It\u2019s recognizing some of the challenges and some of the difficulties. How you maintain some of the privacy and that\u2019s incredibly important,\" Greene says, adding that you can \"absolutely conquer your past demons ... and timing is 50 percent of any relationship. People recently divorced or separated often meet someone within six months and then it evaporates because they cannot manage their life alone. What J.Lo is saying is she can manage her life alone now, but it\u2019s so much better to have someone with you. As for his steroid scandal, we all do things we\u2019re ashamed of and that we wish we didn\u2019t. One option is to beat yourself up continuously, one is to blame everyone else, and the third is accepting your piece.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/personal-space-jlo-arod-text.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2016/03/dish-030116-jlo.jpg?itok=7a_Q4mN4&timestamp=1456847329", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/field_blog_image/2017/11/personal-space-jlo-arod-text.jpg?itok=aNSq1xhX&timestamp=1509565063", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/all/modules/custom/common_site/images/transp-bg-60-black.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/microsite-logo--mobile-1_5x/public/2017/04/verticals-white-personalspace.png?itok=Yvysn4kX&timestamp=1492116909", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/scale--1800/public/2017/01/refresh_personalspace_3000x800.png?itok=p_hT2JOp&timestamp=1485473711", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2017/03/personal-space-arod-jlo.jpg?itok=lAI0R1-h&timestamp=1490986867"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/personal-space-jlo-arod-text.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marianne Garvey"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836/http://www.bravotv.com/blogs/jlo-hit-on-a-rod-dressed-as-her-shades-of-blue-character", "title": "One Love Expert Weighs in on Why J.Lo and A-Rod Just May Last", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "vertical_name": "Personal Space", "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "title": "One Love Expert Weighs in on Why J.Lo and A-Rod Just May Last", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836/http://www.bravotv.com/blogs/jlo-hit-on-a-rod-dressed-as-her-shades-of-blue-character", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez had met only once before \u2014 12 years earlier at a Mets-Yankees subway series game after her ex-husband Marc Anthony threw out the first pitch.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/personal-space-jlo-arod-text.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/blogs/jlo-hit-on-a-rod-dressed-as-her-shades-of-blue-character", "title": "One Love Expert Weighs in on Why J.Lo and A-Rod Just May Last", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez had met only once before \u2014 12 years earlier at a Mets-Yankees subway series game after her ex-husband Marc Anthony threw out the first pitch.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171107233836im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/personal-space-jlo-arod-text.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-02T09:32:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-02T10:16:28-04:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509629520.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
