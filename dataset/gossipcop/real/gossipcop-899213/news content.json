I don\u2019t want I\u2019m sorry or sympathy. I just don\u2019t want to feel alone. And I know I\u2019m not.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha\n\nThe former \"One Tree Hill\" actress explained that while this isn't her first miscarriage, it's the first time she's chosen to share her experience publicly. \"When I first found out I was pregnant I wanted to shout it from the rooftop but I know for reasons like this we have to wait,\" she wrote. \"So because we don\u2019t tell many, we have to suffer silently...and suffering silently was my thing in the past, but it\u2019s not now.\"\n\nShe hopes to give other women who have miscarried \"support and a place to grieve their little one lost,\" and women who are currently grieving a safe space to care for one another.\n\n\"You don\u2019t need to feel alone,\" she wrote, \"and maybe that\u2019s me talking to myself but if you need a place to share, I\u2019m here for you...and all of us are (and guys too. We sometimes silence your voice because you feel bad to express how it\u2019s made u feel so let this be a safe place for you too).\"\n\nKramer finished by linking to a post by Kristen Brust on the A Little Bit Fancy blog, writing, \"I don\u2019t have all the words to say because I\u2019m knee deep in crying and trying to listen to God, (so) my girlfriend @alittlebitfancy says them for me ... It\u2019s powerful and strong and those who have suffered a loss I truly feel u can heal reading her blog.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Kramer, who has a 22-month-old daughter, Jolie Rae, with husband Mike Caussin, has spoken out on behalf of mothers. In June 2016, Kramer fought back against trolls who shamed her for buying pre-made baby food.\n\nThanks to Kramer for using her voice and offering support to others. We're wishing her healing during this difficult time.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201708/TOV-miscarriage-today-tease-170810.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302966/jana-kramer-today-171210-tease-01_a5bb0b5ad14304a085e3b951b1dfc87f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302966/jana-kramer-today-171210-tease-01_a5bb0b5ad14304a085e3b951b1dfc87f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/parents/jana-kramer-reveals-miscarriage-emotional-instagram-post-t119854", "title": "Jana Kramer reveals she had a miscarriage: 'I just don't want to feel alone'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/parents/jana-kramer-reveals-miscarriage-emotional-instagram-post-t119854", "title": "Jana Kramer reveals she had a miscarriage: 'I just don't want to feel alone'", "description": "The country singer and actress opened up about her miscarriage on Saturday, offering fans a \"safe place\" to heal and share.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302966/jana-kramer-today-171210-tease-01_a5bb0b5ad14304a085e3b951b1dfc87f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302966/jana-kramer-today-171210-tease-01_a5bb0b5ad14304a085e3b951b1dfc87f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302966/jana-kramer-today-171210-tease-01_a5bb0b5ad14304a085e3b951b1dfc87f.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Jana Kramer reveals she had a miscarriage: 'I just don't want to feel alone'", "description": "The country singer and actress opened up about her miscarriage on Saturday, offering fans a \"safe place\" to heal and share.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jana Kramer opened up about her miscarriage on Saturday, offering fans a \"safe place\" to heal and share.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302966/jana-kramer-today-171210-tease-01_a5bb0b5ad14304a085e3b951b1dfc87f.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512947899.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
