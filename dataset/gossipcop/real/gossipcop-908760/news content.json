Taylor, an activist and sexual assault survivor, passed away in December. In 1944, she was raped and assaulted by six white men, sparking nationwide outrage. The incident inspired her to speak out about sexual assault and civil rights.\n\nIn her caption on Instagram, Winfrey wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences, but if I did this would be a powerful one. On assignment for @60minutes I end up in the town of Abbeville where #RecyTaylor suffered injustice, endured and recently died.\u201d\n\nThe media mogul paid tribute to Taylor in her Golden Globes speech earlier this month, highlighting the #TimesUp movement and the strength of sexual assault survivors.\n\n\u201cFor too long, women have not been heard or believed if they dared to speak their truth to the power to those men, but their time is up. Their time is up!\u201d Winfrey said in her speech. \u201cI just hope that Recy Taylor died knowing\u2026 her truth, even now, goes marching on.\u201d\n\nReflecting on her time visiting Taylor\u2019s grave, Winfrey added, \u201cTo be able to visit her grave so soon after \u2018speaking her name \u2018sharing her story, a woman I never knew.
