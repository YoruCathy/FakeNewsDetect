It was the latest setback for the organization, which has struggled to reinvent itself after a string of scandals.\n\nIn a missive that ran over 3,000 words long, Ms. Mund said that the pageant\u2019s leadership had \u201creduced me, marginalized me, and essentially erased me in my role as Miss America in subtle and not-so-subtle ways on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that members of the organization had prevented her from posting in her official capacity on social media and had criticized her appearance on multiple occasions.
