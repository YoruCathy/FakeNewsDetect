But it\u2019s just that he hasn\u2019t read anything recently that is so good it makes him want to get back on screen again.\n\n\u201c..'[I]t\u2019s not all that often you get Michael Clayton kind of scripts,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re not going to get those, there\u2019s no real point at this point in my career.\u201d\n\nInstead, Clooney has been focusing on directing lately, and he has a new movie coming out this October called Suburbicon. Starring Matt Damon, the film takes place in a peaceful suburban town in the 1950s that has a dark, violent underbelly. Clooney has a writing credit on the film, as do Joel and Ethan Coen. Clooney has previously directed The Monuments Men, The Ides of March, Leatherheads, Good Night, and Good Luck, and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. But Suburbicon will be the first movie that Clooney directs that he does not also act in.\n\nGeorge Clooney. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images George Clooney. | Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThe last film that George Clooney acted in was Money Monster, released in May 2016 to mixed reviews from critics. He is not currently attached to star in any upcoming movies, meaning his break from acting will likely wind up lasting at least two years. Until his on-screen return, he will continue to serve as director and producer, and next summer, the Ocean\u2019s Eleven spinoff he produced, Ocean\u2019s Eight, will hit theaters.", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clooney-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clooney-1024x683.jpg?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-487879836-1024x662.jpg?x62514", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clooney-1024x683.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brendan Morrow"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/george-clooney-not-acting-anymore-break.html/", "title": "George Clooney Explains Why He Isn\u2019t Acting Much Anymore", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/george-clooney-not-acting-anymore-break.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "George Clooney isn't currently attached to star in any upcoming movies, and in a new interview with ABC News, he explained why.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "George Clooney Explains Why He Isn't Acting Much Anymore", "description": "George Clooney isn't currently attached to star in any upcoming movies, and in a new interview with ABC News, he explained why.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/george-clooney-not-acting-anymore-break.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clooney-1024x683.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clooney-1024x683.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "News", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-08-30T13:37:06-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "George Clooney isn't currently attached to star in any upcoming movies, and in a new interview with ABC News, he explained why.", "title": "George Clooney Explains Why He Isn't Acting Much Anymore", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/clooney-1024x683.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504114626.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
