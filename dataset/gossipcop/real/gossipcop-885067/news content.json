We've collected some available videos of these interviews for your viewing pleasure!\n\n2013\n\n(26/04/12) Tony Goldwyn - Collider\n\nHow did you originally come to be a part of this show? Was it something that Shonda Rhimes approached you about because of your previous working relationship?\n\n\"Yeah, I think so. I just got a call that she was interested in me doing this. I love Shonda and have so much respect for her, and really love the creative process of working for her, as a director. Then, when I heard Kerry Washington was involved \u2013 and I\u2019ve just been so impressed with her work, in everything she\u2019s done, and know her socially and admire her a lot \u2013 the combination of Shonda and Kerry was overwhelming. And then, when she said she wanted me to play the President of the United States, I thought, \u201cWith Shonda Rhimes writing, that\u2019s going to be an interesting president.\u201d It sounded like a good bet to say yes to.\"\n\nWhen you got a chance to read the pilot, what was your first reaction to the story and character and the way that it was written?\n\n\"Well, I really loved the final scene in the Oval Office between Fitz and Olivia because I knew that there was going to be so much more to this than what it appeared to be. I\u2019m always perversely attracted to characters that seem one thing, but are ultimately revealed as another, and I knew, the way Shonda writes, that that\u2019s how it would turn out. In a different writer\u2019s hands, it actually would have made me nervous because I would have thought, \u201cOh, god, I\u2019m going to be the philandering president, and that\u2019s the role,\u201d which is fine, but not necessarily something you want to be doing forever, in a television series. But, with Shonda, I knew that all of her characters are always full of contrasts and surprises, and she described to me what her intentions were for Fitz, as the show went on. I just found putting a character in a moral quandary like that really great. When you see the rest of the first season, Fitz is just full of surprises, which makes it really exciting, as an actor.\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n2014\n\n(09/18/14) Tony Goldwyn - Vulture\n\nWhat are the top three rides on the Olivia and Fitz emotional roller coaster? Their relationship is interesting, but obviously complicated.\n\n\"Did you say the top three rides on the Olivia and Fitz emotional roller coaster? [Laughs.] I guess I feel like Liv and Fitz are the victims of circumstance. Their situation is impossible. I think from Fitz\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s absolutely a sustainable relationship if Olivia would just accept that and commit, but for various reasons, she runs for the hills every time that comes to pass.\"\n\nDo you think their relationship is sustainable?\n\n\"This is one of those relationships that seems like an addiction to chaos. But I can\u2019t play this character and think that, because every time Fitz and Olivia are in each other\u2019s orbit there\u2019s this unavoidable magnetic pull between them, and that\u2019s just the way it is. I put a lot of stock in their attraction being way beyond a sexual attraction, and it\u2019s a pretty rare thing.\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(11/21/14) Tony Goldwyn - TV Guide\n\nShe's gone again! Where in the world is Olivia Pope?\n\n\"Your guess is as good as mine. I don't think she's on an island. That's the good and bad news, but I don't know. ... It's definitely all hands on deck to find her [when the show returns], but I can't tell you where we leave here. That's a really great surprise.\"\n\nWhat are Andrew's terms? Declare war on West Angola and he'll return Olivia? It can't be that black and white.\n\nGoldwyn: That's what he says: \"If we go to war...\" There's obviously some right-wing Republican plot to take down Fitz and support Andrew. And he's accomplished what he did with some major power players. I have no idea who's behind Andrew. I'm speaking as an audience member here because I honestly don't know. A man who is vice president couldn't do this on his own. The whole scene was kind of a shock to me. I was kind of shocked actually at how dark Andrew went. I did not see that coming. Obviously I have my issues with Andrew, but I was very surprised that he turned out to be part of something so Machiavellian.\n\nWould Fitz really declare war just to get Olivia back? She really would be Helen of Troy then.\n\nGoldwyn: That's a really tough call. Fitz was already considering going to war. He doesn't know yet that Quinn and Huck discovered that the whole bombing was faked. As far as he knows, we were still attacked on our own soil. He might. I think it would go against everything in his being to declare war. If it is an unnecessary war, that's a real Sophie's Choice. If what Andrew says it's true and he'd get Olivia back, that's a tough one. ... It depends on how much danger Olivia is in. I honestly don't know how far he'd go. Olivia's life is at stake. But do you sacrifice the person you love for the benefit of the greater good? That's the territory we're headed into in the second half of the season. It's this very big, impossible choice. It's going to get even messier as if it's not messy now.\n\nAdd an image\n\n2015\n\n(01/28/15) Scott Foley - TV Guide\n\nScott Foley has the same question you do: Why the hell did it take Jake so long to get that blanket?\n\n\"So long! Man, he went back, I think he had to take his clothes off. He got the stuff. I think it took him 20 seconds, maybe 30. That's a long time. You'd think he'd hurry it up.\"\n\nWhen Scandal returns Thursday (10/9c, ABC), viewers will see exactly how the ninja-like kidnapping went down from Olivia's perspective and, as previously reported, we'll also find out who took her -- someone we haven't yet met. Though Andrew and Liz are behind Liv's abduction, the conspiracy will expand beyond their West Angola war scheme.\n\n\"This gets much more complicated. Without telling you what happens, it takes a turn that even Andrew could never have expected, I've been in this business a long time, I've read a bunch of scripts ... and these writers have a way of putting my jaw on the floor. I'm constantly amazed, not just by how much story they're able to cram into every episode, but by the way in which they do it -- the boundaries that they push and everything. I did not see this coming. It's not necessarily shocking, but it's a very smart play. I think that's what makes the show legitimate. There's a lot of things we do where you're like, 'Oh, that's just ridiculous.' But then you realize, 'Oh, my God, that makes sense!'\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(01/29/15) Lyn Paolo - ET Online\n\n\u2192 Read the full interview at ET Online Interview with Lyn Paolo January 29, 2015\n\nWho or what is your inspiration for dressing Olivia Pope?\n\n\"Gosh there were so many variables early on in the process of creating the image of OP, but honestly the words that Shonda Rhimes put on the page ARE the real inspiration for Olivia.\"\n\nDo you base any of Olivia's wardrobe on her mood or what's happening on the show?\n\nAbsolutely. The challenge now is not to foreshadow events too soon within the story as our Gladiators have become so good at spotting what the costumes are reflecting ... If Mellie is in green they instantly assume there is going to be a scene with Fitz and Olivia, or if Olivia is in something dark our fans start tweeting with a lot of OMG's.\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(02/13/15) Portia de Rossi - The Wall Street Journal\n\nYou\u2019ve said before that you were a huge fan of the show before being cast. What\u2019s the experience like being on the show as a fan?\n\n\"I have to remember sometimes to not be a fan and be a supportive and present cast member, or guest cast, I should say. I really do kind of wake myself up out of this TV stupor that we all get when we watch our favorite shows. And then I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, God! I\u2019m working!\u201d So it\u2019s pretty surreal and pretty exciting and I\u2019ve been a part of the show for the entire season and it still hasn\u2019t worn off. It\u2019s just as exciting as the first episode for me. I feel pretty lucky.\"\n\nHer nickname is Lizzie Bear. Do you have a personal back story for how that name came about?\n\nI think it was to suggest familiarity between her and Cyrus. They had a past and a history. In my first episode he explains that RNC chair people come and go so quickly, he can\u2019t remember their names so he made a nickname for me, which of course annoys me to no end. I think it made their relationship a lot more colorful, his nickname for me. I don\u2019t know if that comes through, but I just love that character [of Cyrus] so much. Jeff Perry, I love him so much that I like to think he and Lizzie actually really admire each other and truly like each other deep down. I just can\u2019t help but enjoy every scene that I\u2019m in with him. I find that I can revel in it. I\u2019m sure that comes across. I hope that translates that we have a lot of mutual respect and a lot of history.\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(02/19/15) Portia de Rossi - Elle Magazine\n\nIt must be fun to do press where you just get to talk about Scandal\n\n\"It really is! And I'm so glad to talk about it because I don't get to talk to Ellen or my friends about it as I'm shooting it. At least it's nice to talk in a general sense now. That's the worst part of this job, actually\u2014you want to tell your spouse and your friends what's going on at work and when they're fans of the shows and they'd love to know, it's hard to not say anything.\"\n\nThat image of your back after your character got tortured was so horrifying\n\n\"It really was, wasn't it? We've seen Huck torture people in the past, but just seeing the result of the torture was somehow just as squeamish as seeing him actually do it. It was horrible even reading it on the page because the stage direction said it was a wound made by a cheese grater. That's a level of sick we haven't really seen from Huck in the past. But it was sure fun though. That whole storyline has been really fun to play.\n\nIs everything fun to say to Olivia Pope?\n\nIt is! Because Kerry [Washington] is such an amazing actress and she's so fun to work with. I love doing scenes with her.\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(03/04/15) Bellamy Young - TV Guide\n\nFive months ago, Scandal's Mellie was Smelly Mellie -- inconsolably grieving her son, living in robes and Uggs, subsiding on fried chicken and vodka, and serving some 1970s realness. Now? She might be the next president of the United States.\n\n\n\n\"I never could've imagined when the season started that we would go down this path, that's the glory of Shonda Rhimes and our wonderful writers. But I think we needed her [grieving]. It was honest in a way she's never been. She usually put protocol above everything. I think that was a real breakthrough moment for her. She was just honest. I think that allowed her to go on the balcony and tell Fitz, 'I wanna be president of the United States. I wanna run the world.' That sort of honesty couldn't have happened without being forged in that horrible pain and fire\"\n\nNow that he's started his second term, Young says it's time for Mellie to plot her future -- not the least of which because her part-time evil lover, VP Andrew Nichols, told her two weeks ago that if he can't be POTUS, he'll see to it that she can't either. But that only spurred Mellie to recruit Elizabeth North to recruit Huck to drug Andrew, inducing a stroke.\n\n\"The thing with Andrew just shows what she's capable of,\" Young says. \"She sees the next move on her chess board and embraces it. She feels she's paid her dues, is able and is certainly willing and definitely ready in her own mind. She has always been doing the right thing, being the partner to the person in charge and waiting for her moment to come after his term, and she can have her political life. She's trying to get Fitz to be the partner to her as she's always been to him, which in her mind is a fair request. I think that's definitely a very familiar thought to women. It's a visceral truth to millions of women out there. I've tacitly put in my time by your side and I thought the agreement was now it would be my turn. It doesn't always turn out that way, but sometimes it does. I think Mellie is hoping it does.\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(05/13/15) Bellamy Young - Hollywood Reporter\n\nBut what does Rowan want with the first lady, who was revealed to be Operation Foxtail?\n\n\"He wants her to be a pawn in his enormous and ever-growing army because Rowan's currency is power and once he has Mellie in his pocket, he has both access and ability in ways he hasn't had before, which you wouldn't think,\" Young tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"You'd think he has all he needs, but he's a 'more is more' kind of guy.\"\n\nThe actress \u2014 whose character was originally only supposed to be in a handful of episodes in season one before Shonda Rhimes fully developed her \u2014 sees Mellie's story as apropos of politics.\n\n\"Mellie's a little lamb wandering into the slaughterhouse, like skipping merrily and chatting on the phone,\" Young says with a laugh. \"She has no idea what she's getting herself into. This is such an apt metaphor because politics is so often like that. You really don't know who you are getting in bed with and you're just happy to have the currency to move forward with your political life \u2014 but all at what cost?\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(05/14/15) Portia de Rossi - Hollywood Reporter\n\nWorth noting: The actress, whose credits include ABC's Better Off Ted and Netflix's Arrested Development revival, was a Scandal super-fan with wife Ellen DeGeneres before joining the series.\n\n\"I think Elizabeth's end game is that she wants what is best for her country, she is a patriot. She is careful. She really cares about her party, keeping her party together and she believes that she's doing the right thing. That's what makes her such a complex character \u2014 she genuinely believes that even if she has to play a little dirty, it's worth it for the end goal, for the overall betterment of the country.\"\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(05/14/15) Portia de Rossi - TV Line\n\nIn an exclusive interview with TVLine, the actress justifies her character\u2019s brazen power play, reveals the surprising way she found out about the season-ending twist and shares how she went about breaking the news to real-life wife (and self-proclaimed Scandal spoilerphobe) Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nTVLINE | Congrats on the promotion, on screen and off.\n\nNew.

Not long. We got the [first] draft [of the finale script] and it wasn\u2019t in there. I think it was in the second or third [batch] of revisions. So it was only three days before I shot it that I knew what was going to happen. And it\u2019s funny because when the rest of the cast read it they came up to me one-by-one and were like, \u201cOh my God, this is so incredible for you!\u201d I was in the makeup [room] with Darby [Stanchfield] and she turned my chair around and said, \u201cI have to look you in the eyes to talk about this with you.

How did that come about?\n\n\"I was in [Los Angeles] for pilot season, and I had not yet seen Scandal. I knew about Kerry Washington and knew about the show but hadn\u2019t seen it. Sat down with my computer and was watching it on Netflix. Loved it. Loved everything about it. Loved the writing, the directing, the way it\u2019s shot, loved the dialogue. I loved Jeff Perry [Cyrus Beene] because he had all these wonderful monologues, and I literally thought, \u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a way that I can find my way onto this show. But before I had an opportunity to even talk to my agents or my manager about it, I got a call from my agents actually saying we just got a call from ABC: \u201cThey\u2019re interested in you coming on in a recurring role on Scandal.\u201d One of the producers called me and said, \u201cYes, we would love for you to come on, but if you do, there is a secret that you have to keep, and you can\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d And he went on to explain that the secret was that at the end of the second season, the very last script, the very last two lines of the script, would reveal me as Olivia\u2019s father. And I said I\u2019d do it, and so the secret was that I was going to be revealed, and no one else knew. Kerry did not know.

Finding out that her mother was alive didn\u2019t do it, being kidnapped didn\u2019t do it, her PTSD, everything she\u2019s struggling with \u2014 and it was great because Shonda [Rhimes] reached out to me towards the end of the season and said to me, \u201cSo, something is going to happen here [and] the audience is probably not going to be madly in love with us for a while. But it\u2019s going to be big, and how should we reflect that?\u201d And I brought her a bunch of images of these bright, vibrant oranges and reds and I did another board that was mid-colors and another one that was what we do now, sort of like, these are where we could go, and she said, \u201cI want you to go for it.\u201d\n\nAdd an image\n\n\n\n\n\n(05/12/16) Variety - Lyn Paolo\n\nSo, I\u2019m a huge fan of Scandal. But before we get to that, would you be able to explain the difference between a costume designer and a wardrobe stylist?\n\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Scandal too! So, I\u2019ve done both\u2014and I still do both. When you\u2019re a stylist and you\u2019re styling a still shoot or a client, you\u2019re interpreting what would look best on them and helping them to find their way forward to present an exterior of that person. To present an image. And I love that because you\u2019re often dealing with really high fashion people.\n\nSince working on Scandal, what\u2019s been your most favorite costume design moment?\n\nOh boy, that\u2019s almost impossible to answer! Well I love the first episode of this season because it was so challenging. We had a royal family in that and the princess and there were so many layers to that story\u2014there always is with Shonda. Being English, it was fun to do all the research on all the royal families around the world\n\nI noticed\u2014and I could be wrong\u2014but it seems like Olivia is wearing more red this season?\n\nYeah well we made the transition in the mid-season break this year. Because Olivia is basically suffering from PTSD and is walking away from the man she loves\u2014is leaving Fitz\u2014and is just becoming stronger, Shonda and Kerry and I were talking for a long time about making a change in the Olivia Pope palette. But we all felt strongly that there had to be a reason for the change, and the Christmas episode, where she walks out of the West Wing and decides to be her own person, [was a pivotal moment].\n\nAdd an image\n\n2017\n\n(04/13/17) Tony Goldwyn Reveals 3 Reasons Why 'Scandal' Cast Is So Damn Great\n\nDuring an interview with TooFab for the series' 100th episode, the actor revealed the secret to the cast's success -- attributing a big part to the leadership of their captain, Kerry Washington.\n\nReason No. 1 \"No. 1 it's the culture that Shonda and Betsy have created with our show. I think in Shondaland in general, it is a family environment. There\u2019s an understanding culturally that with a healthy familial environment where there's interpersonal relationships and respect for all, it creates a better creative and working environment.

I do think that audiences, especially fans and Gladiators, who are as loyal to Scandal as they have been, are going to want the story to end in the way that Shonda intended to, that was a decision she felt really good about, and we support wholeheartedly.\"\n\nShonda Rhimes on Scandal's final season\n\n\"Deciding how to end a show is easy, deciding when to finish is quite simple when the end date is years away. But actually going through with it? Actually standing up to say: 'This is it?' Not so much. So, next year we are going all out. Leaving nothing on the table. Creating this world in celebration.

I don\u2019t take for granted that I\u2019ll be president when we come back for next season! In Shondaland, you just never know. What I do know, and what we all do know, is that we\u2019re grateful for that. Surprise is possibly the greatest gift of the job. And we trust our writers, so whatever they think up is always so brilliant and shocking and relevant and galvanizing.\"\n\nHow did you react to the news that Season 7 is Scandal\u2018s last season?\n\nOh, you know, we\u2019re gutted, because we really are a family. Even in our time apart on hiatuses, we\u2019re bereft. To think of not going on an adventure that\u2019s deeply wonderful all the time every day \u2014 it\u2019s just gutting. But we\u2019ve always known that Shonda [Rhimes] knows where it ends. We could feel it was getting to be that time. I don\u2019t think anyone was shocked, just sad. But we know how lucky we are to have one more year. We\u2019re going to find out where it all ends. Season 7 is going to be epic and unimaginably crazy.
