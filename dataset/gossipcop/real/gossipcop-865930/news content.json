Who wouldn\u2019t be upset at being written off one of the most popular shows on TV? Back in Season 5, actor Ian McElhinney was vocally annoyed when his character, Ser Barristan Selmy, was killed off long before the book version kicked the bucket. Now it\u2019s a Dornishman\u2019s turn. Actor Alexander Siddig\u2014beloved by many for his years on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\u2014abruptly met his end at the start of Season 6. But, according to Sidding, that wasn\u2019t always the plan.\n\nSpeaking with StarTrek.com, Siddig admitted that originally being cast on the show as Prince Doran Martell was a thrill to him. \u201cIt was such a huge thing, and there was so much publicity money,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s what I remember, everything was so huge. And actors praying they weren\u2019t going to be killed.\u201d\n\nBut no amount of praying could save Siddig from Season 6, Episode 1, in which his character took a dagger to the chest and bled out on the exquisite flagstones of Dorne. The abrupt murder\u2014accompanied by the even swifter deaths of Areoh Hotah and Prince Trystane\u2014came as a shock to viewers but, perhaps, not an unpleasant one. That triple homicide essentially cut Dorne out of the Season 6 plot, and, given how unpopular that location was the year before, that may have been the point.\n\nShow-runners Weiss and Benioff called the actor during the off-season and, as Siddig recalls, said, \u201cSo we were going to kill you off at the end of last season [5], but we decided that we\u2019re going to have to kill you off at the beginning of next season [6].\u201d Siddig calls that explanation \u201cwrong\u201d: the actor says he had been contracted for four episodes of Season 6, not one. \u201cIf they were going to kill me off at the end of the last season, why would they contract me for those four episodes? Because it costs them money whether I do them or not, so it\u2019s not great business sense to do it just in case.\u201d\n\nWere Dorne and its prince originally meant to play a much bigger role in the narrative going forward? That\u2019s certainly the case in the books, where Doran is still alive and well and plotting against the Lannisters. If Game of Thrones were looking to get rid of the least popular elements of its Dorne plot, though, Doran, Trystane, and Hotah weren\u2019t exactly the first candidates that come to mind. Siddig, for his part, has no end of suggestions about what might have motivated his earlier exit:", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57608f310904a5835f0daec7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/got-cameo-steve-love.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/576093af3a8e2de646942162/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/got-cameo-d-and-d.gif", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/579ce4be82b926ca1e5937ff/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/0c53b3f0-ea9f-0132-aad8-0acd8dfea39d.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57d977e10a8ec0db67d1fcb7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/game-of-thrones-ned-jory.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57e46d377dd0d7d276c7cc25/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/doran-angry.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/571d7601e1a62e181e91889a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/got-dorne-dead.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57608f3544f7e758217b397e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/got-cameo-mastodon.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57db09e77dd0d7d276c7cacc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/battle-season-7-game-of-thrones.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/game-of-thrones-alexander-siddig-interview-leaked-game-of-thrones-screeners", "title": "Game of Thrones Actor Gives Scorching Exit Interview", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Alexander Siddig accuses HBO of \u201cplaying games\u201d with fans and cutting his role short.", "id": "57e459b50a8ec0db67d1fe2a", "keywords": "television,alexander siddig,hbo,season 6,game of thrones", "news_keywords": "television,alexander siddig,hbo,season 6,game of thrones", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "57e459b50a8ec0db67d1fe2a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Alexander Siddig accuses HBO of \u201cplaying games\u201d with fans and cutting his role short.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg\"}", "og": {"description": "Alexander Siddig accuses HBO of \u201cplaying games\u201d with fans and cutting his role short.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Game of Thrones Actor Gives Scorching Exit Interview", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/09/game-of-thrones-alexander-siddig-interview-leaked-game-of-thrones-screeners"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Alexander Siddig accuses HBO of \u201cplaying games\u201d with fans and cutting his role short.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Game of Thrones Actor Gives Scorching Exit Interview"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
