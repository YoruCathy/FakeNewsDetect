I\u2019m very excited to hear what you do with the track to celebrate the occasion.\u201d\n\nBaby Spice herself, Emma Bunton, has also urged Harris to keep his promise. \u201cLet\u2019s spice up Calvin Harris! It would be fab for Calvin to remix \u20192 Become 1,\u2019\u201d she told The Sun.\n\n\u201cCalvin Harris, just do it!\u201d Odzak added in an interview with Australia\u2019s Power Rack radio show. \u201cYou\u2019re very rich, you can have anything you want. I\u2019ve got nothing, just do this for me.\u201d\n\nStay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:257027?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=150&height=110", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:259704?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:259704?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2B1-1512840884-1512840886.gif"], "top_img": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:259704?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Voss"], "canonical_link": "http://www.newnownext.com/calvin-harris-spice-girls-2-become-1-australia-gay-marriage/12/2017/", "title": "Calvin Harris Vowed To Remix A Spice Girls Song If Australia Legalized Same-Sex Marriage", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "newnownext"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:554575"}, "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "title": "Calvin Harris Vowed To Remix A Spice Girls Song If Australia Legalized Same-Sex Marriage", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/calvin-harris-spice-girls-2-become-1-australia-gay-marriage/12/2017/", "image": {"identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:259704?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "\"A deal is a deal!\""}, "sm4": {"author": "Brandon Voss", "type": "Post"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1774721959458948}, "twitter": {"description": "\"A deal is a deal!\"", "title": "Calvin Harris Vowed To Remix A Spice Girls Song If Australia Legalized Same-Sex Marriage", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:259704?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/calvin-harris-spice-girls-2-become-1-australia-gay-marriage/12/2017/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A deal is a deal!", "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/GettyImages-840111480-1512836330-1512836333-188x300.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/FA5jsa1lR9c?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newnownext.com", "summary": ""}
