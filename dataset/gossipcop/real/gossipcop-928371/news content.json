My heart is hurting for he and my sister. #Truth.\u201d\n\nJOHN CENA, NIKKI BELLA CLASHED OVER HAVING KIDS\n\nThe WWE stars called off their engagement on Sunday, saying in a joint statement that it was a \u201cdifficult\u201d decision.\n\n\"While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another,\" the couple said via Instagram. \"We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.\"\n\nThe couple, who have been dating for six years, got engaged last year at Wrestlemania 33 and were scheduled to be married on May 5. A source, however, told E! that problems between Bella and Cena were \u201cbrewing for a while.\u201d\n\nJOHN CENA MADE NIKKI BELLA SIGN A 75-PAGE CONTRACT BEFORE SHE MOVED IN WITH HIM\n\nFans also pointed to several incidents when the former couple clashed. Cena had made Bella sign a 75-page contract before she moved into his house. Cena likened it to a prenuptial agreement and said it was done to protect his finances.\n\nCena and Bella constantly bickered over Bella's desire to get married and have kids -- while Cena repeatedly made it clear he did not want those things.\n\n\"I do want to be a mom,\" Bella told her then-boyfriend Cena in a 2013 episode of \"Total Divas.\" \"I feel like I\u2019d be missing out.\"", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/rtr3j55l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ronnie-wood-mick-jagger-keith-richards-rolling-stones.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20110019543582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/17/694940094001_5771924652001_5771923878001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/17/931/524/694940094001_5771924652001_5771923878001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/17/694940094001_5771924652001_5771923878001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
