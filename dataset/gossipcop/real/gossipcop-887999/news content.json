The guy we all know and love. Gavin!\n\nStill confused? Biles\u2019s teammate Laurie Hernandez replied with a reaction meme featuring Gavin.\n\nwhen you win a gold medal at the Olympics: pic.twitter.com/tyhs9gD0ya \u2014 Laurie Hernandez (@LaurieHernandez) August 10, 2016\n\nThere he is! Gavin.\n\nAt a time when the eyes of the world are upon Biles and Hernandez performing miraculous athletic feats, the eyes of Biles and Hernandez are on some kid named Gavin.\n\nWell, \u201csome kid\u201d is underselling it: Gavin is the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, a 30-year-old from Minnesota who was one of Vine\u2019s earliest stars thanks to his videos combining Disney movies with Top 40 hits. In November of 2013, he made the viral \u201cSuck a Dick\u201d vine (22 million loops and counting) with his friend Dustin Hatzenbuhler.\n\n\u201cNot the most family-friendly thing we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Mastodon admitted when I spoke to him on the phone, \u201cbut most people seem to enjoy it. And throughout that time in 2013, I started putting my nephew Gavin, who was 2 at the time \u2014 he would appear in my videos. And people thought he was cute, but they didn\u2019t really take notice of him a whole lot.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 2014, Mastodon posted an innocuous video of Gavin with a crested gecko on his forehead. He wasn\u2019t expecting much of a response, but it blew up.\n\n\u201cPeople started to comment about his reaction and how great it was,\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, Let\u2019s find other ways to capture him in funny situations and see if he can make that face some more. He just made a whole lot of different faces; it\u2019s just something he seems to be good at without even trying.\u201d\n\nGavin kept appearing on Nick\u2019s Vine account over the next two years, and then, all of a sudden, Gavin started blowing up. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t up until, like, this past June that he really blew up, and I think it was because more and more big meme accounts were posting pictures of him.\u201d Meme accounts like @chanelpuke and @tinatbh and the like, which trade and copy memes from each other like playing cards. (Know Your Meme credits the account @wedecideit with blowing up Gavin\u2019s spot.) Once they had drawn attention to Gavin, he was everywhere.\n\nWith dozens of Vines to choose from, it was easy to find a Gavin reaction face for any situation. I went from not knowing who Gavin was to seeing 20 different pictures of him in the span of a few days. On Instagram, his mom, Katie, has roughly ten times more followers than she did two months ago.\n\nIn addition to the Team USA shout-out, Gavin has drawn the attention of stars like Katy Perry and Skai Jackson. Shawn Mendes invited Gavin to his show when he was in town.\n\nThe attention of celebrities in tweets like Biles\u2019s are a good indication of just how megaviral Gavin is. \u201cThose types of things are just fun,\u201d Mastodon says, \u201cbecause they were just talking about him and just addressing him, referring to him on a first-name basis. And I think that that\u2019s really powerful, to show how popular he is or how recognizable his name is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the word phenomenon is a good word for it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was definitely a buildup to it, but the fact that all of a sudden so many people are using his pictures and his videos, and there\u2019s Twitter feeds or streams of our old Vines and some of the newer stuff, and just the rate at which this stuff is getting shared is pretty incredible.\u201d\n\nWhen you send a risky text and 5 mins later you open up messages and see the three little dots pic.twitter.com/5tgXnVDlIu \u2014 Gavin Reactions (@GavinReacts) August 1, 2016\n\nExactly how aware Gavin is of his internet fame is up for debate. Fans ask to take pictures with him, and he knows that they know him from Vine, but the sheer scale is lost on him. \u201cThe only thing I worry about, really, is that he would ever resent any of us for making these videos and posting these pictures,\u201d Mastodon admitted. Some of the money Mastodon makes from doing sponsored Vines goes toward Gavin\u2019s college fund. \u201cI think that it will definitely come down to how we explain what\u2019s happening or how it happens. I\u2019m hoping that he thinks it\u2019s cool. I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s not something that he gets teased about. I think his parents feel the same way.\u201d\n\nFor the foreseeable future, though, Gavin will continue to grace our screens with his presence.
