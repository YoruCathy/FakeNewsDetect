I knew the accident occurred and knew it resulted in an injury to another person,\u201d wrote Soules. \u201cThough I immediately stopped, called 911 and identified myself, and rendered reasonable aid to the injured person \u2014 including requesting an ambulance and administering CPR while the ambulance was en route \u2014 I acknowledge I did not provide the registration number of the vehicle I was driving to 911 dispatch or law enforcement as required by Iowa Code 321.263.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nRELATED: Chris Soules\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Felony Charge Denied by Iowa Supreme Court After Fatal Car Crash\n\nIowa State Patrol alleged that he fled the scene, violating the Iowa code that states: \u201cIf the accident causes the death of a person, all surviving drivers shall remain at the scene of the accident except to seek necessary aid or to report the accident to law enforcement authorities.\u201d\n\nAfter entering a not guilty plea in May 2017 to the charge, Soules\u2019 legal team filed a motion to dismiss the \u201cfailure to remain\u201d charge on constitutional grounds, refuting the last sentence of the Iowa state code.\n\nThe attorneys said in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that \u201cbecause Mr. Soules indisputably stopped his vehicle, returned to the injured driver, contacted law enforcement, provided aid to the injured driver, arranged for medical treatment for the injured driver, remained until emergency personnel responded to the injured party, and provided identification data, the State\u2019s charge must be dismissed.\u201d\n\nTheir request to dismiss was denied in January before being brought to the Iowa Supreme Court.
