The good news is that Netflix will always be there for you with a mountain of new content that you can distract yourself with.\n\nIt\u2019s becoming redundant, but November is once again a jam-packed month for new movies and shows, including originals like Narcos: Mexico, F is for Family: Season 3, and the sixth and final season of House of Cards. Netflix will also debut a new Coen brothers movie called The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, which is joining third-party blockbusters like Cape Fear, Cloverfield, Doctor Strange, and Animal House as the month goes on.\n\nYou can see the full list of additions to the Netflix streaming service for the month of November below:\n\nStreaming November 1st\n\nAngela\u2019s Christmas \u2014 NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nBram Stoker\u2019s Dracula\n\n\n\nBring It On: In It to Win It\n\n\n\nCape Fear\n\n\n\nChildren of Men\n\n\n\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind\n\n\n\nCloverfield\n\n\n\nDeuce Bigalow: European Gigolo\n\n\n\nDoctor Strange\n\nFair Game \u2013 Director\u2019s Cut\n\nFollow This: Part 3 \u2014 NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\n\n\nFrom Dusk Till Dawn\n\n\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\n\n\nJet Li\u2019s Fearless\n\n\n\nJulie & Julia\n\n\n\nKatt Williams: The Pimp Chronicles: Pt. 1\n\n\n\nNational Lampoon\u2019s Animal House\n\n\n\nNext Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow\n\n\n\nPlanet Hulk\n\n\n\nScary Movie 2\n\n\n\nScary Movie 3\n\n\n\nSex and the City: The Movie\n\n\n\nSixteen Candles\n\n\n\nStink!\n\n\n\nThe English Patient\n\n\n\nThe Judgement \u2014 NETFLIX ORIGINAL\n\nThe Untold Tales of Armistead Maupin\n\n\n\nThe Water Horse: Legend of the Deep\n\n\n\nTranscendence\n\nVaya\n\nStreaming November 2nd\n\nStreaming November 3rd\n\nHoodwinked Too!
