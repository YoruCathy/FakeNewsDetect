He was put on life support, but after it was determined that he had no brain activity, the decision was made on Monday to pull life support, according to TMZ.\n\nPetty\u2019s music career began more than 40 years ago with a local Gainesville, Fla. band named Mudcrutch. The group fell apart, but two of its members, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench, would soon rejoin their friend for a new (and much longer-lasting) venture: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1987, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released seven albums, organically becoming one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Their third album, Damn the Torpedoes (1979), went platinum almost immediately, featuring breakthrough singles like \u201cDon\u2019t Do Me Like That\u201d and \u201cRefugee.\u201d\n\n34 PHOTOS Tom Petty through the years See Gallery Tom Petty through the years UNSPECIFIED - JANUARY 01: Photo of Tom PETTY (Photo by Richard E.

He was four years old when his father first beat him: \u201cI remember it so well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe beat me so bad that I was covered in raised welts, from my head to my toes. I mean, you can't imagine someone hitting a child like that.\u201d His father died in 1999; they had never reconciled.\n\nThe turmoil led to longtime depression, which Petty attempted to numb with heroin in the 1990s, he said. \u201cThe only thing that stopped the pain was drugs,\u201d he explained, adding that using making the decision to use heroin was \u201cstupid.\u201d In discussing his past drug use, Petty worried, his biographer told the Washington Post, that he would be setting a bad example for others.\n\n30 PHOTOS Stars react to Tom Petty's falsely reported death See Gallery Stars react to Tom Petty's falsely reported death This is unbearable.
