But don't forget about everyone's favorite royal sister: Pippa Middleton, who is expecting her first child with husband James Matthews.\n\nPhotographed on a shopping trip in London, Middleton may have been wearing designer sneakers (Jimmy Choo Miami Sneakers, to be exact), but her look is easy to re-create with white sneakers you already own. Her flowy, bump-friendly Claudie Pierlot Paisley Print Chiffon Dress ($285) is the perfect transitional dress that can easily be worn with tights when winter hits. Finally, a neutral-color tote bag is all you need to copy Middleton's easy, breezy look.
