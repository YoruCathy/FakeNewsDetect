So even as she emerged as one of country\u2019s top-selling and most influential female artists, McEntire resolved not to remain dependent on the mood swings of Nashville\u2019s Music Row. Instead, she seized opportunity everywhere: movies, Broadway, a television series (two, actually), Carnegie Hall, a clothing line, a gig as the first female Colonel Sanders. She Reba-fied our world.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people, a lot of girl singers, who are 10,000 times better than me,\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the drive. They don\u2019t have the work ethic. They don\u2019t have the want-to, and they don\u2019t love it as much as I do. And they\u2019re not willing to sacrifice what it takes to do this.\u201d\n\nThe want-to. McEntire, 63, is only the third female country artist (after Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton) and seventh artist from the genre overall to receive the Kennedy Center Honors in the awards\u2019 four decades. Was she surprised? Heck, no. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting it for a long time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcEntire is dubbed the Queen of Country, though there isn\u2019t anything regal about her. She would never cop an attitude, and her fans wouldn\u2019t have it. The last name is superfluous. The hair, forever red, has whipped through so many permutations: big, bigger and Hello, Dolly! After four decades and 60 million albums sold, McEntire\u2019s success remains rooted in her down-home, playful accessibility \u2014 and powered by innate business savvy and drive to succeed.\n\nShe has little talent for mystery. \u201cAn open book\u201d declares her son Shelby, a race car driver. Her manager agrees. As does her producer. Actually, pretty much everybody.\n\nUnbidden, she shares that the longest break from touring occurred in 2002: \u201cI had a hysterectomy, and I took the summer off.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDiscussing her first husband, steer wrestler Charlie Battles, \u201ca piece of work\u201d a decade her senior, whom she married at age 21, she divulges, \u201cI think I married my daddy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn her 2015 divorce from Narvel Blackstock, her husband of 26 years (and also her manager): \u201cWell, there\u2019s not much you can do about it when you\u2019re not the one that walks away. You get on your big girl panties, put your big boots on, and set an example for the children.\u201d (The children \u2014 Shelby and her three stepkids \u2014 were all adults. She\u2019s now in a relationship with Skeeter Lasuzzo, a photographer and retired geologist.) For a while, after the separation, McEntire managed herself.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the epitome of getting back on the horse,\u201d says Kix Brooks of Brooks & Dunn, who share the Vegas stage with McEntire.\n\nAD\n\nMcEntire has prevailed by packing houses with what she calls her \u201ctear-jerker, eat-your-heart-out songs,\u201d delivered with her robust contralto and dexterous vibrato. \u201cReba is the bridge between Loretta Lynn and Shania Twain,\u201d says critic Ann Powers.\n\n\u201cShe loves the gusto of it all,\u201d says Vince Gill. \u201cShe loves songs that are emotional, that tell stories. Like Merle Haggard or Johnny Cash \u2014 one note, and you know it\u2019s her. That\u2019s what separates an amazing artist from an okay one.\u201d\n\nBeing a woman in country was never going to be a night at the Opry.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI saw it quick,\u201d McEntire says. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t complain. You don\u2019t bitch. You don\u2019t cry. You work twice as hard and try to find a better way to do things. And that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn turn, she supported female artists who followed. \u201cAsk Faith Hill. Ask Martina [McBride]. We\u2019ll all say the same story: We\u2019re part of her team. Reba was one of the first women to pave the way and support us,\u201d says Trisha Yearwood. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a role model for women to own your own stuff, good and bad, and be your own boss, it\u2019s Reba. She was way ahead of her time.\u201d\n\nMcEntire was particularly prescient when it came to embracing music videos, starring in sophisticated mini-films that helped broaden her brand, including a six-minute sudser for her 1991 tour-de-force cover of Bobbie Gentry\u2019s \u201cFancy.\u201d One of her first videos \u2014 for her 1986 earworm, \u201cWhoever\u2019s in New England\u201d \u2014 was more Lifetime than \u201cHee Haw,\u201d a white-collar wife\u2019s lament, featuring snow, Boston and not a single Stetson.\n\nAD\n\nShe understood early the power of fans not only hearing her songs but also seeing her perform the songs. Which, in turn, became a portal to her movie and television career. \u201cNow they could put the voice, the face and acting the story all together,\u201d she says. \u201cThey got five times more for their buck.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMcEntire, too. \u201cWhoever\u2019s in New England\u201d became her first platinum album.\n\n\u201cShe hears songs and makes movies in her head,\u201d says Gill, whom McEntire corralled into a four-day shoot for their 1993 duet \u201cThe Heart Won\u2019t Lie,\u201d starring Navy officer Reba pining for Marine drill sergeant Vince. (He jokes that he rues it to this day and salutes her whenever they meet.) The song soared to No. 1.\n\nScott Borchetta, now CEO and founder of her label, Big Machine, recalls when they were both attached to MCA in the 1990s, that \u201cher show was as big or bigger as any rock show on the road.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nAD\n\nShe asked: \u201cHow do I get my own TV Show?\u201d\n\nShe got one. Six seasons of \u201cReba,\u201d from 2001 to 2007, playing a salty, non-famous version of herself. The show thrives in syndication, airing on some station at some hour on most days.\n\nIn an industry that adores shiny and new, she\u2019s hosted the ACM Awards 15 times \u2014 \u201ca very relevant place to be in the middle of all the young acts coming up,\u201d says Brooks \u2014 and toured with Kelly Clarkson, who became her stepdaughter-in-law.\n\nA few years ago, she lamented to Borchetta that \u201cradio doesn\u2019t want to play me anymore.\u201d It\u2019s a common complaint among older country artists and a major grievance for female singers in the genre. \u201cThis \u2018bro\u2019 thing has lasted a lot longer than I thought it would,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m ready for it to change.\u201d\n\nSo in 2014, Borchetta launched Nash Icon on Cumulus Media\u2019s Nash FM stations. \u201cShe was the artist I had in mind. More airtime for her music, and she had two more No. 1 albums. We created a new lane for her that she completely owned.\u201d McEntire also recorded her first gospel album in 2017 and picked up a Grammy this year, her third.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd then there was Broadway \u2014 how did that happen? In 2001, producers asked her to take over the lead in a revival of \u201cAnnie Get Your Gun,\u201d though she had no musical theater experience and had never seen the show. On a whim, after a flight out of New York was canceled, she decided to take in a performance. \u201cWell, that fixed it. Wanted to do it. Had to do it. Couldn\u2019t wait. They had to shoo me off the side of the stage because I wasn\u2019t in it for the first 17 minutes. The thrill of my life. Six months, eight performances a week.\u201d And raves. The New York Times: \u201cThe most disarmingly unaffected Annie in years.\u201d\n\nMcEntire comes from rodeo and ranching, and the tiny town of Chockie in southern Oklahoma. \"Oklahoma,\" she says, \"is everything.\" She visits five or six times a year.\n\nHer family tales and memoir are steeped in Okie lore and shined into myth like a rodeo belt buckle, sounding more Dust Bowl than Baby Boom. There were tar paper-lined coffins, two-dollar cemetery plots, sock-stealing rats, a grandmother who spoke in tongues. She competed at the rodeo in barrel racing, where riders trace a cloverleaf pattern around barrels. She grew up castrating bull calves: \u201cI was literally raised on mountain oysters.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt age 5, she realized she could sing. \u201cBest attention I ever got,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the third of four kids. I wasn\u2019t a boy. I wasn\u2019t the youngest or the oldest. I was in the middle.\u201d It\u2019s something she mentions a lot. \u201cI had to fight for attention.\u201d\n\nAnd she craved it, especially from her father, who died in 2014. Clark McEntire was a three-time world champion steer roper, tough as dirt, who never told his children he loved them. \u201cHe liked being known as a champion cowboy,\u201d says McEntire\u2019s older sister, Alice Foran, who lives in Oklahoma along with most of the family, including their 92-year-old mother, Jackie. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to worry about what was on his mind. He would tell you in a heartbeat. By our standards, they would say he was cruel.\u201d\n\nReba recalls him asking, more as a statement of fact than a question, \u201cReba, why do you always want to do something you\u2019re not good at?\u201d He meant, \u201cbarrel racing, playing basketball, all that other stuff except singing.\u201d In fact, she was quite good at all those things, collecting ribbons and championships \u2014 just not as good as she was at singing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine saying that to Shelby,\u201d she says. But \u201cthat\u2019s where I get my bluntness. All my friends know exactly where they stand.\u201d\n\nFor fun and support, the McEntire kids turned to their mother, who encouraged them to sing. She once told Reba: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go to Nashville, we don\u2019t have to do this. But I\u2019m living all my dreams through you.\u201d\n\nShe was discovered as a college sophomore, in 1974, singing the national anthem in a white cowboy hat at the national rodeo finals in Oklahoma City. Signed to Mercury Records, she watched her singles stall in the chart\u2019s cellar. Her first No. 1 hit, \u201cCan\u2019t Even Get the Blues\u201d (1982), she will tell you, came from \u201cthe fifth single off my sixth record,\u201d seven years after she was first signed. In today\u2019s Nashville, she says, executives would exhibit less patience.\n\n\u201cBut I was very blessed, very lucky and very thankful\u201d that success took time, McEntire says. Those hard years \u201cmolded me, they taught me,\u201d she says. \u201cSlowly, the foundation grew. If I had a first number one hit after my first single, I wouldn\u2019t have known anything.\u201d\n\nIn 1991, her tour manager and seven band members were killed in a plane crash outside San Diego. (McEntire, recovering from bronchitis, had booked a later flight.) Less than four weeks later, she was back on the road.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop working when something like that happens.\u201d She pauses, corrects herself. \u201cI can\u2019t stop working when something like that happens. I needed it. We all needed it, to keep going, or I would have wallowed in sorrow.\u201d Her sister calls her \u201cGo,\u201d for the way she\u2019s always on the move, always keeping a full itinerary. \u201cA tough bird,\u201d says her manager Clarence Spalding. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t do well sitting around lounging.\u201d\n\nFaith has always been present, especially in performing. Talking about this, McEntire stops for a second, speechless, and plucks a tissue. Before taking the massive stage in Vegas, she talks to God. \u201cI ask if there\u2019s anybody in the audience that needs something. Use me. I\u2019ll be the vessel. I\u2019ll be the water hose,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen they come in, they\u2019ve got burdens, and I want them to leave them at the door. Come in. Let us entertain you. Recharge your batteries. Lift that burden.\u201d Afterward, \u201cyou can face your problems, your world with a smile on your face, a skip in your step.\u201d\n\nA favorite of drag queens (just plop on a scarlet wig), McEntire says she has \u201ctons of gay friends,\u201d and is a supporter of same-sex marriage but maintains that her stance is more about being \u201chuman\u201d than political. She\u2019s good friends with George H.W. Bush \u2014 as she was with his late wife, Barbara \u2014 but says it isn\u2019t her place to spout opinions. \u201cIf God told me, \u2018I want you to say this,\u2019 and I felt strongly that\u2019s where it\u2019s coming from, I would do it. But I\u2019ve never been led to that. I\u2019ve always kept my feelings separate.\u201d The job, she says, \u201cis to entertain.\u201d\n\nSo this is what she does. Last year, she helped develop a small-town detective drama with producer Marc Cherry of \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d fame. The network passed. \u201cI was so sad. I was mad,\u201d she says. \u201cI was curious: What do you have to do to get a good show on television?\u201d\n\nNaturally, she\u2019s pitching another series with a different team. And she is working on a traditional country roots album with producer Buddy Cannon, scheduled for release next spring.\n\n\u201cShe changed things up to keep herself relevant. She could stop all this and live a comfortable life,\u201d says \u201cReba\u201d co-star Melissa Peterman, \u201cand she wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yz3J6KGbHIjUfWMjbAiIvpfZVUI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EKSBPOXRXAI6RGOCZ7FG7T3BBQ.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/7f7b5f76-3696-413e-9ae6-1eb690c7c020.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EKSBPOXRXAI6RGOCZ7FG7T3BBQ.jpg&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yz3J6KGbHIjUfWMjbAiIvpfZVUI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EKSBPOXRXAI6RGOCZ7FG7T3BBQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Heller", "National General Features Writer For Style"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/reba-mcentire-never-needed-to-be-the-best-she-simply-had-to-want-it-most/2018/11/27/8887bd18-e112-11e8-b759-3d88a5ce9e19_story.html", "title": "Reba McEntire never needed to be the best.
