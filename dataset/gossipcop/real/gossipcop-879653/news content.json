That's soon going to change, though, as the 33-year-old was just signed on as the new face of Garnier.\n\nMoore broke the news on Instagram on Tuesday, sharing a duo of photos documenting her various hair hues throughout the years, along with a sneak peek of her first campaign image for the brand's Nutrisse hair color line.\n\nIn the ad, Moore has a center-parted, wavy lob dyed a gorgeous auburn hue (it's Garnier Nutrisse's Medium Golden Brown shade, FYI). Her makeup is minimal (brushed-up brows and a swipe of rosy balm), allowing her hair to take center stage.\n\nCaptioning the photo set, Moore wrote: \"I've always LOVED changing my hair (as you can see from the photos\u2026and trust me there are so many more examples) \u2014 but a few years ago, I decided to change my life. From my work, to my friends, to my relationship with myself\u2026it wasn't easy, but it paid off,\" she said. \"So when Garnier asked me to be the new #GarnierGirl, and open up the conversation about transformation in a fearless way, I jumped at the opportunity. I'm really excited to share this with you. And there's a lot more to come.\"\n\nThe actress also spoke at length about her new role as Garnier's ambassador in a behind-the-scenes interview video titled \"73 Questions.\" She explained,\"Garnier encourages women to be their best \u2014 whatever that means for you. For me, it's always been important that no matter how I change my look, I want the real me to shine through,\" said Moore.\n\n\"I love to change my hair because, in a world where so much is out of my control, it makes me feel like I'm doing something to shake things up. But it's deeper than blonde or brunette. It's about figuring out how to make my outsides reflect my insides, and that takes a little soul searching. I'm thrilled, even a little nervous, to go down that exciting if imperfect path together with Garnier.\"\n\nWe're pretty thrilled, too. Check out a sneak peek of Moore's Nutrisse campaign, which launches September 15, below.\n\nCourtesy of Garnier\n\nMore on Mandy Moore:\n\nNow, watch 100 years of hair color:", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Mandy%2525201_LO.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a36175200f6d11fd972c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Garnier_MM_BTS_381.jpg.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Mandy%25201_LO.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5e84c19041364700089bfefe/master/h_180%2Cc_limit/laura-mercier-translucent-loose-setting-powder-gwp.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Mandy%25201_LO.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gillian Fuller", "Gillian Fulle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/mandy-moore-garnier-brand-ambassador", "title": "Mandy Moore Is the New Face of Garnier", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Gillian Fuller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Mandy Moore was just named the new face of Garnier, and will represent the brand's various hair and beauty lines.", "id": "59b99dcb75200f6d11fd9672", "keywords": "color,mandy moore,garnier,garnier nutrisse,hair color,brand ambassador", "news_keywords": "color,mandy moore,garnier,garnier nutrisse,hair color,brand ambassador", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59b99dcb75200f6d11fd9672", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Mandy Moore was just named the new face of Garnier, and will represent the brand's various hair and beauty lines.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Mandy%201_LO.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Mandy%201_LO.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Get ready to see this lob everywhere.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Mandy%25201_LO.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Mandy Moore's Hair Just Landed a HUGE Beauty Campaign", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/mandy-moore-garnier-brand-ambassador"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Get ready to see this lob everywhere.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59b9a24b0d395a6f7f6bb1ca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Mandy%25201_LO.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Mandy Moore's Hair Just Landed a HUGE Beauty Campaign"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
