This isn't fan laziness, though; it's clear that at one point, Disick did have his own page, but it's since been deleted. Perhaps the man values his privacy or this is another example of Kris Jenner trying to control the family's branding. Whatever the reason, we did a little digging, some actual reporting, and a lot of gathering to bring you the Wikipedia entry LD deserves:\n\nScott Disick\n\n[edit]\n\nScott \"Lord\" Disick (born May 26, 1983[1]) is an American television personality and entrepreneur. He is best known for being the boyfriend of Kourtney Kardashian and father to their three children: Mason Dash, Penelope Scotland and Reign Aston.[2]\n\nDisick has played himself on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney & Kim Take New York, Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord, Punk'd[3], Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, and Kourtney & Khlo\u00e9 Take the Hamptons.[4]\n\nEarly Life\n\nScott Disick grew up in Eastport, NY. He was an only child to parents Jeffrey and Bonnie Disick.[5] Disick was arrested twice by the time he was 18, once for speeding and once for driving under the influence.[6]\n\nDisick attended The Ross School, a private school in East Hampton.[7] He did not, however, graduate from Ross. [Source: Kristen Hyland, Director of Public Relations].\n\nThere were plenty of rumors about Disick in high school, and he was supposedly a hard partier. His nickname at the time was STD.[8] As a teen, Disick modeled and appeared on the cover of young adult books.[9]\n\nParents\n\nThere are conflicting stories about Disick's parents and their wealth. According to one source, the family lost its fortune.[10] Other sources say they were wealthy real estate developers and that Disick inherited his money from them.[11] Disick's grandfather, David M. Disick, was an attorney who became a successful fractional real estate developer, and has developed multiple luxury properties.[12]\n\nDisick's father was arrested in December 2001 for allegedly stealing $3,000 from a bank in the North Fork and was sentenced to 140 hours of community service.[13] At the time, Jeffrey and Bonnie Disick were reportedly in the hole more than $391,000 thanks to liens and judgements filed by a number of sources, including the federal government.[14]\n\nAt the age of 63, Disick's mother Bonnie died October 2013 after a \"long illness.\"[15] Three months later, his father Jeffrey passed away.[16] Both causes of death are unclear; Scott has said that his father suffered from cancer. According to a source, he was living in a Los Angeles nursing home when he died.[17]\n\nCareer\n\nDisick has tried his hand at many entrepreneurial ventures. He has released a tanning product for men called Monte Carlo (tag line: \"It's like liquid sunshine.\")[18] and has also worked on a line of menopause supplements for men called Amidren by Scott Disick.[19][20] He has said that he has, \"done a lot of private label manufacturing in the nutrition biz\" and \"raised money for startup companies.\"[21] He also opened a Japanese restaurant in New York, Ryu, but soon cut ties with it.[22] It has since closed.[23]\n\nThough Disick has said he works for GNC[24][25], a company rep denies that claim, saying, \"Scott Disick does not work for GNC and the company has no business relationship with him.\" [Source: Laura Brophy, Director of Client Services and New Business Development]\n\nKardashian and Disick at the opening of Ryu.

Kardashian family friend and Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis has said he introduced them at a party at his home.[31]\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians debuted in 2007, and the drama of the couple's relationship became a popular subplot. After finding text messages on Disick's phone addressed to \"my wife,\"[32] Kardashian broke up in Disick 2009 before realizing she was pregnant. Son Mason was born December of that year and the couple reconciled. In 2010, Disick proposed but Kardashian turned him down.[33] The couple's daughter, Penelope, was born on July 8, 2012 and their third child and second son, Reign, was born on Mason's fifth birthday, December 14, 2014.[34]\n\nAfter paparazzi photographs of Scott canoodling with former flame Chloe Bartoli in Monte Carlo surfaced last week, sources confirm to E! News that Kourtney has ended her relationship with Scott.[35][36] Said the source, \"Kourtney has always taken Scott back and been by his side, but now with three kids it has gotten old. Kourtney has to do what's best for the kids.\"\n\nFun Facts\n\nDisick bought a knighting ceremony for himself over the internet, after which he urged family members and friends to refer to him as \"Lord Disick,\" \"The Lord,\" or \"LD.\"[37] He doesn't like coasters because he doesn't \"respect surfaces.\"[38] Disick loves snowboarding,[39] and enjoys unwinding at night to reruns of Seinfeld.[40]", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673215/GettyImages_1210313196.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66651909/1201158477.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673258/GettyImages_1219080127.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jzl244AlPR76ZfdzWF7KiLh_M10=/0x187:3000x1875/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/45660186/158574425.0.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672824/GettyImages_491031770.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672963/GettyImages_1208286960.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13060547/Racked_on_Vox_Logo__1_.0.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66673052/GettyImages_1210354251.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HBXyDTMLixxJZTx5Q-KPKiM19V4=/352x0:2988x1977/1200x800/filters:focal(352x0:2988x1977)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/45660186/158574425.0.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jzl244AlPR76ZfdzWF7KiLh_M10=/0x187:3000x1875/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/45660186/158574425.0.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leslie Price", "Zeeshan Aleem", "Riley Beggin", "Dylan Matthews", "Li Zhou", "Ella Nilsen", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2015/1/2/7562751/scott-disick-wikipedia", "title": "The Wikipedia Entry Scott Disick Deserves", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2015-01-02T11:22:29-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T14:27:00-04:00"}, "author": "Leslie Price", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Scott Disick is arguably the greatest reality TV character to grace the screens of the E! network, so it's an outright tragedy that the man doesn't have his own Wikipedia entry.
