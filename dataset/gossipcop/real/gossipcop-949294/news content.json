What did I miss?\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Erin has poked fun at David and McPhee\u2019s coupling.\n\nBack in September, as rumors of their romance popped up, Erin shared a photo of the two to her Instagram Stories alongside the captions, \u201cExcited about my new step mom,\u201d and \u201cMy parents.\u201d\n\nAt the time, a source close to David was denying his romance with McPhee \u2014 and another insider explained that \u201cErin\u2019s quite obviously tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic Instagram comments were pointed at those who can\u2019t seem to grasp that her dad and Kat can be colleagues, collaborators and longtime friends without it being some big romance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t even perform together without people saying they\u2019re headed down the aisle,\u201d the source said. \u201cErin was messing with people who jump to conclusions.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\nImage zoom\n\nBut Erin herself wasn\u2019t denying it. A month later, in October, she opened up about her dad\u2019s then-girlfriend on the red carpet of the BLEUSALT Launch Celebration in Malibu.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Erin told PEOPLE of McPhee. \u201cI really like her. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cMy dad is kind of a hopeless romantic, and Katharine\u2019s awesome. We really, really like her, and we\u2019ve known her for a really long time. And if he\u2019s happy, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Katharine McPhee and Erin Foster Charley Gallay/Getty\n\nRELATED: Katharine McPhee Confirms She Is Dating David Foster as They Step Out Together at the Met Gala\n\nDavid and McPhee first sparked romance rumors in May 2017 when the two were spotted enjoying a PDA-filled dinner date at Nobu in Malibu.
