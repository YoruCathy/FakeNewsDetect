While the attack may have prevented other musicians from performing live for a good amount of time \u2014 and understandably so \u2014 Ariana came back as resilient as ever, ultimately headlining a benefit concert for those affected by the attack and continuing the entirety of her tour with limited interruption. And she did it with continuing grace, no less.\n\nWhile Ari has spoken sparingly about her Manchester experience in the past \u2014 mostly at that aforementioned benefit concert \u2014 she opened up in a new interview with Coveteur on how abandoning her \"Dangerous Woman\" tour was never, ever an option in the midst of everything going on.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been through anything as traumatic as [what] we\u2019ve been through. So . . . [the tour] can be a lot,\" she explained. \"Calling it off and going home was not an option. The message of the show was too important. For the crew and everyone involved, it\u2019s become more than just a show for us. We are really grateful to be here and really grateful for this show.\"\n\nWhile Ari acknowledges she's now going to take much-deserved time off to \"check in\" on her health, her unifying message of love is what powered her through the most trying of times this year. \u201cI think the most important thing is to have each other\u2019s backs. When you see something or hear something that\u2019s upsetting, or someone says something that\u2019s upsetting, even if it\u2019s not to you, just say something and be there and support each other,\" she explained. \"Misogyny is ever-present, and we have to be there to support one another. That\u2019s really it. It\u2019s about the sisterhood. There\u2019s no competing in that. We have to lift each other up, not try and claw each other down.\"\n\nSpoken like a true honorary citizen of Manchester.\n\nRelated: Ariana Grande Wants People to Call the Las Vegas Shooting \"Terrorism\"", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d691df550a8e283960e071/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-692512126.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d6a56a5e487859127c30a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d6a56a5e487859127c30a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Elizabeth", "Devon Elizabet"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ariana-grande-touring-after-manchester-bombing-too-important-to-cancel", "title": "Ariana Grande Explains How Touring After the Manchester Bombing Was \"Too Important\" to Cancel", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Devon Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Ariana Grande explained in a new interview with Coveteur that she felt it was her duty to keep touring after the events in Manchester, England.", "id": "59d691125e487859127c3095", "keywords": "music,snd, ariana grande,manchester bombing,ariana grande", "news_keywords": "music,snd, ariana grande,manchester bombing,ariana grande", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59d691125e487859127c3095", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Ariana Grande explained in a new interview with Coveteur that she felt it was her duty to keep touring after the events in Manchester, England.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d691df550a8e283960e071/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-692512126.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d691df550a8e283960e071/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-692512126.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"Calling it off and going home was not an option.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d6a56a5e487859127c30a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Ariana Grande Explained Why She Kept Touring After the Manchester Attack", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ariana-grande-touring-after-manchester-bombing-too-important-to-cancel"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "\"Calling it off and going home was not an option.\"", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59d6a56a5e487859127c30a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Ariana Grande Explained Why She Kept Touring After the Manchester Attack"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
