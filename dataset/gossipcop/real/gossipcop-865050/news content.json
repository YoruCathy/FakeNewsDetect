And though it all seems innocuous enough, there's one little detail that has some fans making a lot of assumptions...and that little detail is who she's with.\n\nChloe seems to be on vacation with YouTuber Logan Paul. E! reports that the two are set to star in a 2018 remake of Valley Girl together, and perhaps that is where they became friends. According to her Instagram, they wrapped filming last week. And in celebration, it looks like she and Logan are enjoying the island life with some other friends.\n\nHowever, just a few days ago, news surfaced that Chloe had reportedly separated from her beau of four years, Austin Nichols. As E! notes, a source told Just Jared, \"They have tremendous love and respect for each other, but after almost four years, they just drifted apart. There are no hard feelings.\"\n\nAnd while neither Chloe nor Austin have commented on the split yet, the fact that she and Logan were spotted kissing on the beach seems to indicate that the buzz is true. (Side note: Logan is holding what appears to be a selfie stick, proving there is never an inopportune time to strike a pose.)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Internet personality Logan and Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D actress Chloe will star together in the musical remake \"Valley Girl\" - and it looks like their professional relationship has blossomed into a real-life romance.<P>Pictured: Logan Paul and Chloe Bennet<B>Ref: SPL1532154 050717 EXCLUSIVE</B><BR/>Picture by: Splash News<BR/></P><P><B>Splash News and Pictures</B><BR/>Los Angeles:310-821-2666<BR/>New York:212-619-2666<BR/>London:870-934-2666<BR/>photodesk@splashnews.com<BR/></P> Splash News\n\nAs such, we now have a bunch of \"Chlogan\" shippers spamming the two's Instagram.\n\nIt should be noted that everyone involved is an adult, and it's nice to see that things can move on in an amicable, mature way. Hope the two are having as much fun as it looks like they are!\n\nRelated: Why Some People Are Upset Over the New Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Trailer\n\nCheck this out:", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e531a495f4f436efefd80/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-07-06%252520at%25252010.47.30%252520AM.png", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e52c30c31d97e71555da5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/spl1532154_012.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a3b2049f01b6d6b153e9a84/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/bri%252520headshot%2525202.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e5570495f4f436efefd82/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520Three.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e53116b006a696fa497a7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-07-06%252520at%25252010.46.42%252520AM.png", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e53246b006a696fa497a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%252520Shot%2525202017-07-06%252520at%25252010.47.45%252520AM.png", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e56d875b2fa037d03990f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/facebook.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e5570495f4f436efefd82/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520Three.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianna Wiest", "Brianna Wies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chloe-bennet-kissing-logan-paul", "title": "Chloe Bennet Spotted Kissing Logan Paul Following Split From Austin Nichols", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Brianna Wiest", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Chloe Bennet is currently in Hawaii with costar Logan Paul, sparking rumors that the two could be dating.", "id": "595e3f1575b2fa037d039906", "keywords": "culture,chloe bennet,logan paul,austin nichols", "news_keywords": "culture,chloe bennet,logan paul,austin nichols", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "595e3f1575b2fa037d039906", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Chloe Bennet is currently in Hawaii with costar Logan Paul, sparking rumors that the two could be dating.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e56aa6b006a696fa497ab/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e56aa6b006a696fa497ab/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Fans are already shipping #Chlogan.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e5570495f4f436efefd82/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520Three.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Chloe Bennet and Logan Paul Were Spotted Kissing After Her Split From Austin Nichols", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chloe-bennet-kissing-logan-paul"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Fans are already shipping #Chlogan.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/595e5570495f4f436efefd82/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB%2520Three.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Chloe Bennet and Logan Paul Were Spotted Kissing After Her Split From Austin Nichols"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
