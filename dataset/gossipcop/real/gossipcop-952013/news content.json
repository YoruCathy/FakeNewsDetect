Her captions on most of her pictures tell how amazingly she has moulded herself into becoming a strong woman. More so, her dad once made a post on his Instagram page about how he believed women are as strong as hell.\n\nDwyane Johnson is not the only wrestler in Simone\u2019s lineage, her grandpa and great-grandfather are wrestlers and they have all derived their stage names from adding the \u2018Rock\u2019 to it.\n\nSimone welcomed a baby sister Jasmine Johnson with her stepmom Lauren Hashiann, Jasmine was born in the month of December 16, 2015\n\nSee Also: Dany Garcia Wiki, Bio, Relationship With Dwayne Johnson, Age, Net Worth\n\nSimone Alexandra Johnson\u2019s Height and Body Stats\n\nAs a typical American, Simone has golden brown eyes and dark hair; she is 5\u201910 ft tall and she models for IMG models. On November 15, 2017, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Simone Alexandra Johnson the Golden Globe Ambassador for the 75th Golden Globe Awards. The newly renamed Ambassador position was previously called the \u201cMiss Golden Globe\u201d where basically her function is to present awards and escort presenters on and off the stage as well as presents some awards herself.\n\nDwyane Johnson once publicly announced how he has not approved of Simone dating just yet, in his own words, he boldly said he would choke anyone who comes around her with that intention. However, on Simone\u2019s part, she has put full concentration on her career and studies not having time for side attractions despite her many followers on social media platforms.\n\nSimone noted in an interview that she intends to pursue a business degree in college and embark on a career in sports entertainment after which she would then like to transit to talent management just like her parents, obviously indicating how much she looks up to her parents as role models.\n\nSimone Alexandra\u2019s Relationship with Dwayne Johnson\n\nMost people thought Dwayne Johnson\u2019s bond with his daughter Simone would be shaky when his divorce from her mother was finalised, however, the bond only got stronger and she is often seen as her father\u2019s alibi. It has also been said that Simone can be hilarious because she even uses father\u2019s lines on him \u2018can you smell what the rock is cooking\u2019.\n\nThe random statement of girls being closer to their fathers rather than their mothers is expressively displayed in Simone\u2019s life. Dwyane Johnson has severally displayed affection for his daughter Simone not only in the private aspect of her life also in public.\n\nHe has been his daughter\u2019s inspiration and role model as she really wants to follow his footsteps when she gets older. She has also picked interest in being a WWE superstar in the nearest future. If she finally accomplishes this dream, she would be the fourth generation in her lineage that belong to the wrestling world.\n\nSee Also: Dwayne Johnson\u2019s Height, Weight And Body Measurements\n\nDwayne Johnson Daddy Duties\n\nDwyane Johnson has proven in many ways that he is a great and super dad to his daughters and he never fails to show how proud he is of them. He let Simone follow him to all his super duper occasions and events. At the age of 15, Simone has amazingly walked down a lot of red carpet occasions while her father proudly showed her off. One of the trendy news Hollywood gave about Simone in 2017 was derived at the People\u2019s Choice Award 2017 where Simone turned heads at the red carpet in an elegant black dress and her father Johnson gave her a gentle amazing kiss on the cheek before he accepted his award.\n\nIt is quite beautiful how Simone has not wasted the opportunities rendered by her parents into modelling her to be an amazing young woman.
