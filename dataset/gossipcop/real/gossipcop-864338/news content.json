Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live? In the shadows people see you as happy and free, because that\u2019s what you want them to see. Living two lifes, happy but not free. You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or someone you love,\u201d Jay-Z\u2019s mother said on \u201cSmile.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is changing and they say it\u2019s time to be free,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut you live with the fear of just being me. Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be. No harm for them, no harm for me. But life is short, and it\u2019s time to be free.

That\u2019s their business. [It] is no different than discriminating against blacks.
