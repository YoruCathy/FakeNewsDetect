But does that mean late doctor George O\u2019Malley will follow in Denny\u2019s footsteps for the upcoming Grey\u2019s Anatomy 300th episode? Not exactly.\n\nAs the 14th season of the Grey\u2019s Anatomy embarks on a major milestone for the show, producers will bring back three dearly departed docs for the ABC medical drama\u2019s 300th episode\u2014but not by bringing back the original actors. As part of a tribute to Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s long history, the 300th episode will pay tribute to past doctors George O\u2019Malley, Izzie Stevens, and Cristina Yang (played by T.R. Knight, Katherine Heigl, and Sandra Oh, respectively).\n\nBut the original actors have not been announced as special guest stars for the episode. Instead, hospital patients involved in a roller coaster accident who look like the original cast members will be introduced to viewers, and this will conjure up a ton of memories for the Seattle doctors left in their wake. You can see two of the lookalike patients in the Grey\u2019s Anatomy sneak peek video below.\n\nAccording to Grey\u2019s Anatomy star Sarah Drew ( Dr. April Kepner on the show), the 300th Grey\u2019s Anatomy episode, titled \u201cWho Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story,\u201d will feature a pseudo-reunion of the original \u201cFab Five\u201d interns, which also included Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers).\n\n\u201cCristina, George, and Izzie we\u2019re thinking about a lot during this episode because our three guest actors on the show actually really look like them and remind the rest of the doctors of those characters,\u201d Sarah Drew told Entertainment Weekly, \u201cThat causes the original group to really remember those people well and want to fight for these ones to live.\u201d\n\n[Image by Mitch Haaseth/ABC]\n\nWhen Grey\u2019s Anatomy debuted in 2005, Meredith Grey and her fellow four interns were just starting their careers at Seattle Grace Hospital. But 12 years later, amid death, divorce, and a whole lot of drama, only Alex and Meredith are left from the original friend group. Of the three \u201creturning\u201d doctors, only George O\u2019Malley was killed off of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. So does that leave any room for Katherine Heigl or Sandra Oh to make a cameo? Unfortunately, Heigl left the show on reportedly bad terms with showrunner Shonda Rhimes. As for Oh, her exit after 10 seasons was far more amicable, and her former TV flame, Kevin McKidd, (Dr. Owen Hunt on the show), isn\u2019t ruling out a real-life reunion at some point.\n\n\u201cEven though I was part of it, Cristina and Owen [were my favorite couple on the show],\u201d McKidd told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nThe actor revealed that when his character got married to Amelia, Sandra Oh got kind of jealous. McKidd revealed he told his former co-star that she needs to come back to Grey\u2019s Anatomy if she wants to change things\u2014and Oh didn\u2019t rule it out.\n\n\u201cI hope she will,\u201d McKidd added. \u201d I think it would be so much fun. It would open up so much again in the story and mix everything up.\u201d\n\n[Image by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Images]\n\nAs for that 300th episode, while Sandra Oh and the other former stars won\u2019t actually appear in it, the landmark episode will be a \u201cpoem\u201d to loyal fans of the show.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting episode,\u201d McKidd told ET. \u201cPeople come into the hospital that kind of trigger memories for a lot of our doctors. It\u2019s really cool the way the stories have been woven together to do that \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of surprises and nuggets hidden within the episode.\u201d\n\nThe 300th episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy airs Thursday, November 9 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\n[Featured Image by Todd Williamson /Invision/AP Images]", "images": ["https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kevin-McKidd-Sandra-Oh.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Greys-Anatomy-Stars.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8881934fec783f32aef96d94ac2f65be?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Greys-Anatomy-300th-Episode.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4607176/greys-anatomy-300th-episode-to-bring-back-original-docs-izzie-george-and-cristina-but-not-how-you-think/", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 300th Episode To Bring Back Original Docs Izzie, George, And Cristina\u2014But Not How You Think", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/eU88JQmi5AE?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
