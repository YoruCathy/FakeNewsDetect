This other time they were slapping me. I felt like a piece of meat,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso Read: Chloe Grace Moretz Is 'Appalled and Angry' Over Her Movie's Body-Shaming Poster\n\nThe actor, who will next appear in \u201cMy Cousin Rachel\u201d opposite Rachel Weisz, said he continues to stay \u201cinsecure\u201d about his body and sometimes won\u2019t eat for weeks to get the body producers are looking for.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s anywhere near as bad as what women go through but I, as an actor approaching each job, am insecure \u2014 especially when I have to take my top off in it \u2014 and so nervous,\u201d he added. \u201cI get really worked up to the point where I spend hours and hours in the gym and not eating for weeks to achieve what I think they\u2019re going for.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old said actors are held to different standards these days.\n\n\u201cIn the \u201950s and \u201960s, it was never an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cJames Bond never had a six pack. He had a hairy chest. Marlon Brando\u200b in \u2018A Streetcar Named Desire\u2019 had an incredible body but he was by no means ripped to within an inch of his life. There\u2019s a filter on society that this is normal but actually it\u2019s anything but normal.\u201d\n\nSee Video: Emma Thompson Recalls Defending Hayley Atwell From Body-Shaming Movie Producer\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Claflin has spoken out about his body. In December, the actor clarified that in a particular photograph, his face was photoshopped onto a male\u2019s body.\n\nCelebrities that have spoken out about body shaming include Chrissy Metz, Amy Schumer, Daisy Ridley, Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato and Emma Stone. Even Vin Diesel fell victim to the shaming: After photos surfaced of Diesel with a \u201csofter\u201d physique than fans are used to, the actor said, \u201cI do think it\u2019s wrong to body shame. Trolls on the Internet \u2014 there are all kinds of atrocities they commit on the Internet.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bodyshaming.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ChrissyMetz-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-19-at-10.37.55-AM-2-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SamClaflin.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/body-shaming-160x105.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SamClaflin.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Tim Kenneally", "Wrap Staff", "Ross A.
