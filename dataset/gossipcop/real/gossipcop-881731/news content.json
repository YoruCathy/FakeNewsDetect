At just 16, the daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford went from taking her driver\u2019s test to making her runway debut at Calvin Klein a few days later\u2014and that was just the beginning of her adventure. Instantly becoming the model of the moment, Gerber spent her very first New York Fashion Week walking for Alexander Wang, Marc Jacobs, and even Rihanna. Not bad for a newbie, though Gerber isn\u2019t your ordinary rising star.\n\nAs seen behind the scenes of her big week, Gerber didn\u2019t just conquer the runways, she took all of New York by storm, and everywhere she went, she brought a little fashion magic with her. Chilling in a suite at the Plaza with fellow teen stars Cara Taylor and Faretta, she turned room service into a mini editorial; later dancing in Times Square, she gave tourists an eyeful of the latest runway looks. Playing on set in sparkling Gucci, Gerber found the humor in that infamous crystal-covered bodysuit, and posing in a downtown alleyway, she even pulled onlookers into the shoot.\n\nHandling the chaos of the spotlight with wit and charm, Gerber brought a smile to the face of everyone she encountered and an upbeat sense of joy to the hard work of Fashion Week. How do you become a supermodel in training on your first go-round? Turns out it\u2019s not about looks, clicks, or even a famous last name\u2014it\u2019s about delivering charisma and grace, something Gerber managed with ease. A trip through her whirlwind week is all about fun, family, and the force of personality.\n\nKaia in: A-Morir sunglasses; Alexander Wang jacket and boots; Alexandre Vauthier; Balenciaga sunglasses; Calvin Klein; Chanel choker and gloves; Chrome Hearts; Gucci tank, top, shorts, leggings, mask, and heels; Miu Miu coat; Oscar de la Renta earrings; Prada top; Prada skirt; Raf Simons sweater; Marco De Vincenzo shoes; Saint Laurent shoes\n\nCara in: Balenciaga necklace; Jennifer Fisher earrings; Paco Rabanne; Tom Ford shoes; Andy Wolf eyewear\n\nFaretta in: Paco Rabanne dress; Andy Wolf eyewear\n\nFeaturing: Kaia Gerber Director: Bardia Zeinali DP: Mika Altskan and Matvey Fiks Stylist: Andrew Mukamal Hair: Hiro Mari Makeup: Ingerborg Manicure: Arlene Hinckson Edited by Dylan Edwards Sound: Max Mellman, Tim Race Music: \"Attitude\" & \"Money\" by Leikeli47 Filmed at MetroMotion\u2019s Daylight Studio and the Plaza Hotel", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu", "Janelle Okwod"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kaia-gerber-supermodel-first-new-york-fashion-week-spring-2018", "title": "Relive Kaia Gerber\u2019s First New York Fashion Week\u2014A Total Teenage Dream", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Janelle Okwodu", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.", "id": "59b9aeb32d209a0e601aff4b", "keywords": "models,runway,enlargeinriver,spring 2018 ready-to-wear,new york fashion week,supermodels!", "news_keywords": "models,runway,enlargeinriver,spring 2018 ready-to-wear,new york fashion week,supermodels!", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59b9aeb32d209a0e601aff4b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Relive Kaia Gerber\u2019s First New York Fashion Week\u2014A Total Teenage Dream", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kaia-gerber-supermodel-first-new-york-fashion-week-spring-2018"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Bringing charm and personality to her first Fashion Week, Kaia Gerber takes the runway to the street.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59c1a195f298de1d75c9f736/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Kaia-1-H.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Relive Kaia Gerber\u2019s First New York Fashion Week\u2014A Total Teenage Dream"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
