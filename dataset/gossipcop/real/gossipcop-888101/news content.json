Jordan Strauss / AP\n\nRobbie appeared starstruck after chatting and posing for photos with Harding, 47, who was famously implicated in a plot led by ex-husband Jeff Gillooly to injure rival skater Nancy Kerrigan so that she would not be able to compete in the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Harding went on to win the U.S. championship, but finished eighth at the Olympics in Lillehammer, while Kerrigan recovered from a bruised knee to win the silver medal behind Oksana Baiul.\n\nHarding wore several memorable costumes during her career in the 1990s, which came to an end after an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan. Alamy Stock\n\nGillooly, Stant and Eckhardt all served prison time for the attack, while Harding was given three years probation. She also was banned for life by the U.S. Figure Skating Association.\n\nThose troubles appeared to be in the distant past on Tuesday, when she received a loud ovation from the audience at the premiere at the Egyptian Theatre.\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201701/2017-01-17T13-15-43-9Z--1280x720.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tonya-harding-walks-red-carpet-margot-robbie-i-tonya-premiere-t119749", "title": "Tonya Harding walks the red carpet with Margot Robbie at 'I, Tonya' premiere", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tonya-harding-walks-red-carpet-margot-robbie-i-tonya-premiere-t119749", "title": "Tonya Harding walks the red carpet at 'I, Tonya' premiere", "description": "The former U.S. Olympic figure skater mingled with Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and the rest of the cast of \"I, Tonya,'' a movie about her life.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Tonya Harding walks the red carpet at 'I, Tonya' premiere", "description": "The former U.S. Olympic figure skater mingled with Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and the rest of the cast of \"I, Tonya,'' a movie about her life.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former U.S. Olympic figure skater mingled with Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and the rest of the cast of \"I, Tonya,'' a movie about her life.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_49/1302187/tonya-harding-red-carpet-today-tease-001-171207_22749f3d538d20e892e20bd5b829f09c.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512651894.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
