The proceeds from the charity auction will benefit the charity Bright Pink, the only national non-profit focused on the prevention and early detection of breast and ovarian cancer in young women. As \u2018Challenge\u2019 fans know, Diem passed away from ovarian cancer in 2014.\n\nBefore her death, Diem was extremely dedicated to helping women learn the importance of early cancer detection. Diem made her \u2018Challenge\u2019 debut in 2006 on \u201cFresh Meat, and went on to compete in \u201cThe Duel,\u201d \u201cThe Gauntlet,\u201d \u201cThe Duel II,\u201d \u201cThe Ruins,\u201d \u201cBattle of the Exes,\u201d \u201cRivals II\u201d and \u201cBattle of the Exes II.\u201d She passed away two months after filming ended for \u201cBattle of the Exes II,\u201d having received her third cancer diagnosis since her 2006 debut.\n\nAccording to a press release for the charity auction, items being offered include signed game jerseys from the \u201cChamps vs. Stars\u201d and \u201cDirty 30\u201d seasons. Challengers who donated to the auction include Johnny Bananas, Emily Schromm, Wes Bergmann, Terrell Owens, Justina Valentine, Tori Deal, and Diem\u2019s ex-boyfriend CT Tamburello (to name just a few!)\n\nThe charity auction will also include Diem\u2019s own jersey from 2008\u2019s \u201cThe Gauntlet III.\u201d (At press time Diem\u2019s shirt had the highest bid at over $250!)\n\nThis is the second year in a row that a Challenge Charity Auction has been held. While promoting 2017\u2019s auction, Johnny Bananas revealed why he continues to donate to the auctions.\n\n\u201cEvery so often this banana takes a break from stirring the pot to use his powers for good,\u201d he wrote on his website. \u201cAs you know, a while back we lost a true angel among us when Diem passed away. There\u2019s not a day that I don\u2019t think of her and what a loss that was. Grief is a tricky emotion and you never know when it\u2019s going to rear its ugly head and drag you down. But instead of my grief becoming a void, I choose to use it as a ladder and pull myself up. The best way for me to lift my spirits is through work with charitable causes, and I can\u2019t think of a more worthwhile cause than early detection of breast and ovarian cancer.\u201d\n\nIn addition to signed shirts, The Challenge Charity Auction also includes a golden hand trophy given out during \u201cThe Challenge: Invasion of the Champions\u201d Reunion special. Other fun items include several wooden signs that have been autographed by multiple \u2018Challenge\u2019 stars, and a banner from the \u201cDirty XXX\u201d season that\u2019s been autographed by the season\u2019s whole cast\n\nTo check out The Challenge Charity Auction, click here!\n\n(Photo: MTV)", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e615c2d6ca13b6946da652a4e0bdaa9a?s=56&d=monsterid&r=r", "https://s17077.pcdn.co/wp-content/themes/thevoux-wp-2/assets/img/logo.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2101450818b32f42c021b993e4eaabab?s=164&d=monsterid&r=r", "https://s17077.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/challenge-charity-auction.jpg", "https://s17077.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/diem-brown.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7ea9c4beaa607bce34ec8eaea560eef4?s=56&d=monsterid&r=r", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c44b1de47fa0ce712bc92cad1f78227b?s=56&d=monsterid&r=r"], "top_img": "https://s17077.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/diem-brown.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Ashley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2018/01/16/memorabilia-from-the-challenge-to-be-auctioned-off-in-honor-of-diem-brown/", "title": "Memorabilia From \u2018The Challenge\u2019 to be Auctioned Off In Honor of Diem Brown", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s17077.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cropped-NEW-LOGO-April-2017-270x270.jpg", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Memorabilia From \u2018The Challenge\u2019 to be Auctioned Off In Honor of Diem Brown", "url": "https://www.theashleysrealityroundup.com/2018/01/16/memorabilia-from-the-challenge-to-be-auctioned-off-in-honor-of-diem-brown/", "description": "On January 16, The Challenge Charity Auction will kick off on eBay, giving fans of the show a chance to bid on memorabilia from the show\u2019s long history.
