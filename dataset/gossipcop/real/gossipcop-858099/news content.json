We don\u2019t even have a TV in our bedroom; we\u2019re that couple. And no computers in the bed.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nShe added that she and her country crooner hubby are particularly strict about what projects they choose, now that they\u2019re parents to daughters Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith, 7. \u201cThe thing you really learn when you have children and a career \u2014 and particularly when you\u2019re an older mother \u2014 is the preciousness of time, and therefore trying to balance everything and be willing to say no to things,\u201d she told the publication, before adding that she\u2019s \u201cnot willing\u201d to miss bedtime.\n\nIn a new interview, Keith admitted that he\u2019s so head-over-heels for his wife that watching her character, Celeste Wright, be abused on the hit show Big Little Lies was difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s hard because she really tells her story,\u201d Keith admitted to The London Evening Standard. \u201cI love how committed she is, though, in telling her stories. She had the bruises to prove it.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nDespite the agony he felt watching his wife, he\u2019s very supportive of her craft. In fact, he even creates his schedule based around where she\u2019s filming. \u201cWe have a tutor that travels with us, so if Nic\u2019s shooting a film for any long period of time, even if I\u2019m touring, we can almost always relocate to wherever she is. And I\u2019ll go to and from there. We just make the rhythm work so we can be together.\u201d boundaries\n\nBack in 2016, Keith gushed about the life he\u2019s built with his adorable family. \u201cMeeting her and getting married wasn\u2019t life-changing, it was life-beginning,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cIt was literally, like, \u2018OK, life starts.\u2019\u201d", "images":
