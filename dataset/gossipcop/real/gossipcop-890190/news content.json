Praise for Steve\u2019s character development blew up seemingly overnight as fans binged and decided that his accomplishments in the area of being a human being were as beautiful to behold as his illustrious hair.\n\nPerhaps Steve summed up his role best: \u201cI may be a pretty sh-tty boyfriend, but turns out I\u2019m actually a pretty damn good babysitter,\u201d he says to Nancy in the finale. But let\u2019s go back to the beginning of season 2 before diving in. When we first meet Steve again in season 2, we get out of touch boyfriend Steve. He\u2019s less concerned about Nancy\u2019s grief over Barb than he is about whether or not she loves him. Not a great look.\n\nBut when it came to how competent he was with the kids, by season\u2019s end, he had won many fans over. How\u2019d we get here?\n\nIt all started when he showed up at the Wheelers house to try to win Nancy back. She wasn\u2019t there. His soon-to-be buddy was though. Once Dustin took Steve under his wing, from that moment on, every move Steve made was responsibility central. He had several shining moments including but not limited to the following:\n\n1. Schooling Dustin on the art of seduction while walking along the railroad tracks.\n\n2. Coughing up the secrets to his perfect hair in episode five.\n\n3. Proving his mettle when the Demodogs came growling to the junkyard where he was ready to fight them back with his bat in episode six.\n\n4. Taking his babysitter role seriously, trying (unsuccessfully) to halt Operation Demodog Distraction during the finale.\n\n5. He may have wanted to stay on the bench, but nevertheless, he persisted by insisting on leading the kids through the treacherous tunnel.\n\n6. Giving Dustin a pre-Snow Ball pep talk in the finale\u2019s coda.\n\nSure, he showed us glimmers of hope back in season 1 when he helped Jonathan and Nancy in the finale, but 1983 crisis Steve is a joke compared to 1984 Steve\u2019s leadership skill levels.\n\nAs for how he handled it when Nancy chose Jonathan instead of him, he accepted it. That\u2019s no real prize-winning feat. But if you knew the old King Steve \u2014 who was involved in Nancy\u2019s public shaming after she spent a platonic night with Jonathan \u2014 then if nothing else, it was surprising he bowed out.\n\nDid the way he gazed longingly at Nancy at the Snow Ball make you forget all about the way he dramatically broke Jonathan\u2019s very expensive camera equipment? Some fans did. What a turnaround for this kid.\n\nSee some of the funniest reactions to Steve\u2019s new and improved season 2 side below.\n\nThe dramatic difference between \u201983 Steve and \u201984 Steve was a major talking point.\n\nHe was so great at babysitting that one redditor shared, \u201cSteve\u2019s basically a franchise now.\u201d\n\nOne Steve fan used Gigi Hadid\u2019s buzzy sneaker commercial to compare Nancy\u2019s love interests.\n\nAnother shared his shiny new resume.\n\nAnother felt a Meryl Streep shoutout and caps lock was necessary.\n\nAnother praised his mom moves.\n\nGet The Brief.
