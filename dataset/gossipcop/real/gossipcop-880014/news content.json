I don\u2019t care about, oh, \u2018You\u2019re going to be the most famous person ever if you do this.\u2019 That\u2019s not what holds weight in my life.\u201d\n\nClarkson clarified that while Dr. Luke did indeed pen the track, she made substantial changes to the song, and rightfully should have been given co-writing credit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times in my career where you don\u2019t see my name on the song and that\u2019s because sometimes I don\u2019t write them,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of times I do change the song in a way that probably you should ask for credit, but I don\u2019t because the song was already great \u2013 I just made it more me. I think a lot of artists steal credit a lot from writers, which I think is super crappy because that\u2019s their livelihood.\u201d\n\nBut, \u201cif I deserve it, I usually ask,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I did deserve it on [\u2018My Life Would Suck Without You\u2019] just because I changed it a bit.\u201d Clarkson also recalled how the topic was first broached, and how she vehemently refused to be associated with him.\n\n\u201cThey brought up writing credit at the end,\u201d she went on. \u201cThey were like, \u2018Well, you changed the song.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want my name near his. I want to pretend this didn\u2019t happen in my life and I want to forget it.'\u201d\n\nLast year, Clarkson spoke out against Dr. Luke and in defense of Kesha, offering up her own take on the embattled music producer.\n\n\u201cA lot of artists that have worked with him don\u2019t work with him anymore for pretty good, solid reasons,\u201d she said during an interview with Australia\u2019s KIIS FM The Kyle & Jackie O Show. \u201cHe\u2019s not a good person to me.
