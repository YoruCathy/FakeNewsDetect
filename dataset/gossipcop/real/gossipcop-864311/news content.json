{"url": "https://usefullyuselessinfo.wordpress.com/tag/amy-poehler/", "text": "And now on to Season 27; living proof of the old saying \u201cComedy Equals Tragedy Plus Time\u201d\u2026in this case, FAR TOO LITERALLY . Between 9/11 happening before that season\u2019s premiere, an anthrax attack at 30 Rock in the middle of a show week, overall chaos in both the City and the Country, and Ryan Adams as a musical guest; this was one of the more mentally tough years for the cast to get through\u2014but get through it they did, and they were able to make the most out of some dark situations and rally on both New York and America at the same time\u2026.or at least that seemed to be the case in the first half of the season. By the time 2002 rolled around, the show was all but back to some version of \u201cNormal\u201d (and BTW, I\u2019m going to be throwing that word around a LOT today, So get comfy, Kids!); everybody hit the high marks, and even the weakest episodes of that year had strong points that made us forget just how weak the episodes were\u2026\u2026\u2026And THEN Will Ferrell up and quit\u2013rightfully so, he was becoming a big fish in a small pond by that time. So looking back on the season, maybe that\u2019s why everybody fired on all cylinders; knowing that their Alpha Star was about to exit, they had to get the most mileage they could before they ventured into uncharted territory. That said, back when I was a soon-to-be-graduating High School Senior, I thought this was the apex of comedy (keeping in mind, I wouldn\u2019t get cable for Another 7 years\u2026I lived in the sticks, so sue me!). Let\u2019s see how right and how Wrong I was in some places.\n\nLooking at how this was formatted, this is gonna be similar to the Season 26 recap; a number of mini-lists and mini-critiques to go with them. However, since these thoughts were posted at the end of the season, this does have the benefit of speaking on behalf of the ENTIRE Season 27, not just the first half. Also, this was the year\u2014as an episode reviewer\u2014where I started to get a little \u201cGimmicky\u201d with what I wrote\u2026still didn\u2019t quite reach maturity as of yet, but at least it\u2019s not as vague as the previous two \u201cSNLenium\u201d pieces. So with that\u2026\n\nANNOUNCER: From Television city in Hollywood, it\u2019s the \u201cGolden Lorne Awards\u201d And now, ladies and gentlemen\u2026 \u201cTHE DOC!\u201d Thank you, welcome to the \u201cGolden Lorne Awards\u201d! Where we cheer for the favorites, and piss on the rest. Our first award is\u2026 Performer (Cast member) of the year: Bronze Doumanian: Daryll Hammond\n\nSilver Ebersol: Jimmy Fallon\n\nGolden Lorne: WILL FERRELL\n\nDARRELL HAMMOND: Now HERE\u2019S Somebody I should\u2019ve spoken about at great lengths by now. Up until Kenan Thompson, he was the longest serving cast member ever\u2014you can\u2019t deny that wherever there was a hole that needed to be filled on the show, especially that of the \u201cMiddle-aged\u201d variety, Hammond was there to plug it up\u2026\u2026\u2026and yes, I realize I could be phrasing this better. But the point is that among those who can be considered \u201cGlue\u201d or \u201cUtility\u201d or \u201cSwiss Army\u201d type cast members, Hammond probably deserves a little more recognition for his efforts these days\u2026or at least, more recognition for his first 7 years on the show; anything he did after that reached overkill by the time he eventually left in 2009, save for a few sporadic cameos here and there over the years, and then ultimately permanently filling in for Don Pardo in 2014 (because remember, Pardo can never truly be \u201cReplaced\u201d). As far as this season goes; this was Hammond at his peak\u2014from a memorable (albeit questionable) commentary as Jesse Jackson in the season premiere, to his reliable stable of impressions; Clinton, Koppel, Chris Matthews, Dan Rather, 90% of Bush Jr\u2019s Cabinet (including a much improved Dick Cheney); even adding a few new ones this year like George Lucas and Geraldo Rivera. Say what you will about how dull he wound up being later on, the guy was (and in the case of him announcing the show, Still Is) a team player.\n\nJIMMY FALLON: I don\u2019t really have too much to add here; Like I said in the last piece, he & Will Ferrell probably should\u2019ve been neck & neck in terms of popularity; Ferrell being the established star, Fallon being the rising star thanks to \u201cUpdate\u201d. Season 27 saw a slight fade in the halo effect; Fallon was still popular, and he also took a chance at some non-Update roles; but by now, the audience started to catch on a little that MAYBE Fallon was a little too immature in some places\u2026ESPECIALLY whenever he teamed up with Horatio Sanz. Then again, he remained someone the 18 to 49 demographic was looking for; young, energetic, (mostly) funny, and (if you\u2019re among the female audience) easy on the eyes. Regardless, this was the point when Fallon Plateaued\u2014or at least started to. On the flipside, \u201cJarrett\u2019s Room\u201d started to gain a significant following thanks to the young crowd watching.\n\nWILL FERRELL: Considering this was his last year as a cast member, him being at the top of the list was pretty much a foregone conclusion\u2026but looking back on it now, did Ferrell truly \u201cEarn\u201d it, or was he just going through Senioritis by the time the season ended? Save for his last show where he pulled off the rare task of appearing in 95% the episode\u2013even bit parts with only one or two lines\u2014I\u2019m gonna say (*CONTROVERSIAL OPINION ALERT*) that he probably stayed on a year longer than he should\u2019ve in hindsight; but to his credit, at least he still left just in time\u2026unlike Hammond who practically took up residency there into the decade. Still, Ferrell treated the year just like any other; turning in performances that bordered on the absurd, while at the same time maintaining an aura of professionalism. You\u2019ll see a number of sketches further down that showcase just how fearless and willing Ferrell was to play even the most minor of roles, and we\u2019ll talk a little more about his years on the show altogether a little later; as for this season alone, he was one of the very few cast members to leave on top\u2014all the while, he still remained just one piece of an already strong ensemble\u2026Of course, by the time the next season came around, the cast would realize just how important that missing piece would be. Now I\u2019d like to speak a little about Ferrell over his 7 years altogether that (hopefully) other people haven\u2019t said already. I don\u2019t think it goes beyond the realms of hyperbole to say that Will Ferrell did to the show in the mid-90s what Eddie Murphy did for the show in the Early 80s. He not only helped save the show; but more importantly, he made it worth talking about again\u2014of course, the biggest difference between Ferrell and Murphy is that Murphy practically did it single-handedly give or take a Piscopo assist, Ferrell was just one really talented member of a larger team of talent. You know that old saying about \u201cThe Company you Keep\u201d? Ferrell was very fortunate to be surrounded by a lot of good company during his run as a cast member; and because everybody played so well off of each other, that could explain why Ferrell excelled so much\u2014everybody else was giving off the energy, Ferrell was practically feasting off of it so that he could produce his own.\n\nBest New Guy: SETH MEYERS\n\nTo all of the fans of Amy Poehler All over the World, my sincerest apologies. I clearly didn\u2019t know better back then\u2026Not that Seth didn\u2019t at least try to make an impact in his first year at bat (I still think \u201cLil Sleuths\u201d should\u2019ve been a bigger thing than it wound up being), but he was not and will never be the same caliber of talent that longtime partner in crime Amy was when she started (Hell, she got promoted mid-way through the season); though to be fair, he eventually forged his own path, and whether you love him or hate him, at least he was durable for most of his run on the show. Quite honestly, back then I thought he was gonna be Fallon 2.0 when he first started\u2014sure enough, he would be in at least One way much later on\u2014he seemed likable, had a lot of energy, HE DIDN\u2019T GIGGLE, I thought he had all the earmarks of a decent future utility player\u2026then again, what do they say about books by their cover? For the most part, Seth at least put in more effort than fellow newbie Dean Edwards (though not as much as Jeff Richards did); he just didn\u2019t realize that his talents were best left behind the scenes yet.\n\nThe \u201cTarnished Lorne\u201d for worst cast member: CHRIS KATTAN\n\nYeah, sorry to do this again, but you can take the Guy out of the Spaz, but you can\u2019t take the Spaz out of the guy\u2026To make matters worse, thanks to Amy Poehler joining the cast, this meant the beginning of the \u201cWhite Trash Couple\u201d sketches as well as the beginning of him wearing even shorter shorts than Mango\u2026Speaking of which; on the plus side, after that season\u2019s finale, we would Never See Mango Again\u2026until Kattan\u2019s last episode the next season when he briefly popped up in Update. I already made my thoughts clear all over the place, let\u2019s not overstay our welcome\u2026\n\n\n\nHost of the year: Bronze Doumanian: Jon Stewart\n\nSilver Ebersol: Ellen Degeneres\n\nGolden Lorne: IAN McKELLEN\n\nJON STEWART: During a year like this, it only seems fitting for one of the Tri-State area\u2019s elder statesmen to show up; and especially after his own post 9/11 Daily Show monologue where he transformed the show from simple comedy show to cold splash of water in our faces (sometimes), perhaps it was time for Stewart to regain his own sense of \u201cNormal\u201d\u2026\u2026That being said, maybe the inclusion here was more because it was the sight of a comforting figure among the young demographic being on the show, and less for anything he actually did on the episode\u2014The monologue here was Stewart in his natural element\u2014almost a pre-requisite; but for the rest of the episode, he either played versions of \u201cHimself\u201d, or he attempted to act\u2014and considering Stewart had his own qualms about acting in the past, maybe he just wanted to get whatever was left out of his system while at the same time helping to rally New York. Still though, it was nice to see him outside of a cable subscription for one night.\n\nELLEN DEGENERES: If SNL can do something consistent most of the time, it\u2019s put on a good Christmas show\u2014Ellen hosted this season\u2019s show, fresh off of hosting an Emmy Awards that was pre-empted not once, but twice by varying atrocities in the world, and she handled the task like a champ\u2026the same can not only be said for her appearance here, but she is also one of a seemingly endless amount of people that I wish hosted a 2nd time\u2014Hell, about half of the hosts this year I wish made a 2nd appearance\u2026note to self, a list on THAT subject in the future. In this season\u2019s quest for stability, Ellen fit in deftly\u2014From an appearance with The Culps (unavailable because, Screw You, BMI/ASCAP!), to riffing on \u201cAlias\u201d (Sort Of), even trying to be the put-upon father\u2019s girlfriend to Seth & Amy; she tops her appearance by throwing shade at those who criticized her (then) recent coming out, but doing so in a way that was classic Ellen\u2014kindhearted, but with a dash of needling. Of course, even if she didn\u2019t do well in the eyes of others, at least this was the show with the legendary \u201cNarrator that Ruined Christmas\u201d short.\n\nIAN MCKELLEN: Full disclosure; even though McKellen is one of the Gods of acting, the idea of him winning (or even being nominated for) the Oscar for ANY of his appearances in the LOTR/Hobbit movies would\u2019ve made as much sense as Alec Guinness winning as Obi-Wan Kenobi; Cool for the fan boys, but baffling for everybody else in the real world. One award McKellen SHOULD\u2019VE won though was an Emmy for his hosting gig; exceeding not just the expectation that he could do comedy, but the fact that a show that\u2019s notorious for having \u201cYoung and Hip\u201d hosts took a rather sizable chance here\u2014Sure, they COULD\u2019VE got Elijah Wood to host at this time (though that wouldn\u2019t happen until Xmas \u201903), or Sean Astin, or Orlando Bloom, or Liv Tyler, or Viggo Mortensen or anybody else not carrying an AARP card (though Christopher Lee COULD count retroactively). Nevertheless, Gandalf the Grey poured on the charm big time here; particularly in Two gems I\u2019ve long forgotten about until now; First, \u201cHot Air Balloon Theater\u201d; it\u2019s about as ridiculous as it sounds, but McKellen\u2019s gravitas makes it work. Second; \u201cOne Man Show\u201d\u2014if not for how chameleon-esque McKellen slips into every role, but also for the fact that there\u2019s a stark difference between Live Theater and Live TV, and all the quick changes may be handled with all the grace of a Rhino, but McKellen at least tries to upgrade it to a gazelle. Still another in a long line of people who should\u2019ve hosted more than once.\n\nThe \u201cTarnished Lorne\u201d for worst host: JONNY MOSLEY\n\nAs is the case with 99.9999999999999999999999% of the Celebrities I tend to snipe at around here, I\u2019m certain that they are perfectly good people in real life and do not deserve such scorn. Such is the case with Olympic hopeful Jonny Mosely; who certainly had the energy to host, but he also had neither the charisma nor the acting chops to pull off the job 100%\u2026That, and I have a feeling he was asked to host the show at the very last minute, so perhaps his ill-preparedness wasn\u2019t entirely his fault. IIRC, we had no idea who would be hosting this show until Well after the Winter Olympics that year; and in an era where Googling someone was still primitive, there was a lot of \u201cUh\u2026.\u201d And \u201cWho\u2026?\u201d among the crowd. I mean, if you\u2019re gonna get a Winter Olympian to host, at least go for someone who had a little more popularity back then\u2026like Michelle Kwan or Apollo Anton Ohno\u2026or those Canadian skaters that got screwed by the judges\u2014unfortunately, I think the show was still trying to learn its lesson about athlete hosts after Nancy Kerrigan & George Foreman c1994. SNL clearly wanted to cater to the \u201cBrahs\u201d\u2026probably a little too hard that week. Again, I\u2019m sure Mosely is a good guy, but with few exceptions, there\u2019s a good reason why athletes should stay away from hosting the show. One MAJOR plus side, at least this episode welcomed back Chris Parnell with open arms.\n\nSketch of the year: Bronze Doumanian: \u201cChristmas Kangaroo\u201d (Hugh Jackman)\n\nSilver Ebersol: \u201cHappy Birthday Rock Opera\u201d (Jack Black)\n\nGolden Lorne: The \u201cUpdate\u201d where Ian McKellen Kisses Jimmy (IAN McKELLEN)\n\nCHRISTMAS KANGAROO: I mentioned this one a long time ago (See: Late July 2016), but it stands to reason that in a season tinged with a National Tragedy, the audience was hungry for some sort of catharsis that would help them forget about it (at least for a little while) and that everything is gonna be OK\u2026though watching Will Ferrell getting raped by a Kangaroo would actually be far from the radar, at this point in life, just about anything considered \u201coutrageous\u201d could also be considered a welcome relief from the doom & gloom.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY ROCK OPERA: From the moment Ferrell stepped out on stage with a ridiculous bowl-head haircut, I had a feeling we were in for something insane\u2026and Ferrell isn\u2019t even the main focus of the sketch. No, this moment belongs lock, stock and barrel to Jack Black; who takes the common and dull \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d song and transforms it into a medieval mini-rock opera/showstopping number. So amazing was this performance to me that To this day, I send the video of the sketch to Facebook Friends\u2026if that doesn\u2019t explain the sketch\u2019s lasting impact, I don\u2019t know what will.\n\nUPDATE (3/23/2002): And once again, we use \u201cUpdate\u201d as a way to cheat our way out of a list; but to give credit where credit is due, I don\u2019t think the ENTIRE Update was worthy of being included, just this moment when McKellen (dressed as Dame Maggie Smith) planted one on Jimmy, which back then was more of a Shock and a Surprise, unlike later years in the show where such a thing becomes a crutch. The kiss leads to one of the show\u2019s best quips afterward from Fallon, and it still turned out to be a very \u201cSpur of the moment\u201d thing that a lot of the viewers enjoyed\u2026\u2026\u2026But let\u2019s be honest, we can all agree that an Update commentary should not count as a sketch; and that the REAL Choice for sketch of the year should be obvious\u2026\n\nI mentioned this one on the 15th anniversary of 9/11, so forgive me for plucking a few talking points from that\u2014In short, the wound was still fresh in the people\u2019s minds; and by this point in the proceedings, we were all looking for something to truly laugh about. And while the previous week\u2019s show with Witherspoon felt like a comforting sort of \u201cEverything\u2019s gonna be OK\u201d moment, This sketch the week after was more like a sub-zero splash of water back to normal\u2026at least for a little while. The ironic part of the whole thing is that the short shorts are not 100% what makes this a classic, but rather the matter-of-fact way Ferrell plays it off as though it was an average Monday, followed by a Pseudo-patriotic rhetoric where the crowd is on his side for just a nanosecond\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Only for Ferrell\u2019s character to piss it away with yet another inappropriate bend. If EVER there was a case of making the most of a Dark situation, Will Ferrell in a Star-Spangled thong should be the wood carved drawing in an Encyclopedia somewhere.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cTarnished Lorne\u201d for Worst Sketch: THE GIRL WITH NO GAYDAR\n\nThis is now the THIRD Time I\u2019ve had to say FUCK THIS SKETCH! On the flipside, This is also the umpteenth time that I have to remind you that I\u2019m \u201cNot Gay, but Supportive\u201d, and this is also the eleventy-billionth time I have to push the JERRY BUTTON. But as a reminder, I don\u2019t hate the sketches because of the homosexual themes; I hate them because not only is there exactly one joke to be seen in each of these pieces, but the fact that they saw it fit to repeat that same joke over and over, over a span of 4 Sketches. This was a sketch that was, at best, supposed to have been done just one time; yet for whatever reason, it just stuck around. Bad sketch, bad concept, run into the ground worse than a tapped out oil derrick. Moving On\u2026\n\n\n\nShow of the year: Bronze Doumanian: Gwenith Paltrow/Ryan Adams\n\nSilver Ebersol: Reese Witherspoon/Alicia Keys\n\nGolden Lorne: JACK BLACK/THE STROKES\n\nThis section is gonna be a little tricky since I\u2019m talking about FULL Episodes in small doses, but I\u2019m gonna try my best.\n\nPALTROW/ADAMS: Skeevy MG aside (Even if he is singing a rally cry for New York City), this episode was a formative step in the show feeling \u201cNormal\u201d again\u2014then again, a lot of the people who hosted this year were hosting veterans; so naturally, having familiar faces on was a plus. In this case, It had a friend of the show in Ms. Goop, and it also had the usual stable of good moments and recurring characters; including the Boston Teens, a sequel to the legendary \u201cI DRIVE A DODGE STRATUS!\u201d sketch, Horatio Sanz\u2019s Not!Dirty cartoonist Jasper Hahn, a TV Funhouse that used Pat Robertson as a Punching bag; hell, even Mango\u2026Frickin\u2019 MANGO for God\u2019s sake (unavailable due to rampant use of a song from \u201cGrease\u201d), was a welcome relief to watch after wondering how many gas masks we have to wear on alternate days of the week\u2026Of course, that was nearly 20 years ago\u2014and looking back at some of the sketches, time hasn\u2019t exactly been friendly to a number of them\u2026Especially that TV Funhouse bit that not only focuses on Stem Cells, but was also co-written by Louis CK\u2026make up your own interpretation there. In other words, were this show to air in any other year before or since, this would actually be par for the course\u2014but NOT the top 3.\n\nWITHERSPOON/KEYS: Whereas Paltrow was a step in feeling \u201cNormal\u201d again, The Season Premiere\u201318 days after the events of 9/11\u2014proved to be one of the show\u2019s ultimate tests; namely \u201cCan the show be Funny?\u201d To quote one of my favorite Simpsons quotes \u201cShort answer; yes with an if, Long answer No, with a But\u201d. As a long standing New York based Television institution, having the show make a response of some kind was a foregone conclusion\u2014especially since all the other ones; Dave, Conan, Jon Stewart et. al. already did so\u2026Given the circumstances, SNL HAD To do it, and they did it with equal parts dignity, civility and jokes about fish genitals. Yeah, if things were dour for 100% of the episode, then there would be a problem\u2014the country had to laugh again, and dammit they tried (even if it meant resorting to using a farting baby to do so)! Of course, no matter how much humor they tried to spoon feed us, all of the sketches paled in comparison to the somber opening, where a Then Sane Rudy Giuliani and various members of the NYPD & FDNY stand solemnly while the indispensable Paul Simon performs one of the city\u2019s unofficial anthems in the form of \u201cThe Boxer\u201d\u2026which, now that I think of it is KINDA Questionable. Yes, the song is very much about the grit and the guts of New York and its residents (especially back then), but does a disaster of 9/11\u2019s magnitude really warrant a mention of the \u201ccome-ons from the whores of 7th Avenue\u201d? That, and those close ups of the Mayor seems a little creepy in hindsight. Nevertheless, despite how weak the actual comedy was in hindsight, this was still an important episode for the show to do\u2014and given the gravity/nature of everything, this show should probably be #1 by default\u2026This is despite discussing the Inter-species ramifications of \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d and the joys of raising a farting baby. But at least Hammond\u2019s Jesse Jackson was there to talk about the Taliban Banana.\n\nBLACK/STROKES: In hindsight, this is probably NOT the show of the year even by the lightest of standards (Like I said; Witherspoon\u2019s show is a given for this spot, but This show should take Paltrow\u2019s spot and Ian McKellen\u2019s show should take 2nd); to me, a high school senior looking for some relief after hearing about some friends of friends and family losing their lives in a major attack, this show was the moment where things felt \u201cNormal\u201d once again. Yes, there was still a lot of post 9/11 tension in the air; but after 4 months into the season it was time to put 2001 behind us and direct our attention to 2002. With that said, there were a lot of good things going for this episode. First, Fallon gives us his first LFNY\u2014don\u2019t know why, but I just felt very happy for him when he did that, especially after being on for 4 years by this point. Second, the majestic energy of Black himself pretty much carrying even the dumbest of sketches. Third, and most importantly, this appearance helped us both remember AND forget his awkward 1998 \u201cSpecial Guest\u201d shot alongside partner Kyle Gass as Tenacious D; \u201cRemember\u201d because when I saw this episode and subsequent Update commentary, my immediate reaction was OH SHIT, HE\u2019S THAT GUY?! (In all seriousness, I probably didn\u2019t even realize who JB was in \u201998). But then \u201cForget\u201d, because by that point in the episode we saw a completely different Jack Black than the one we saw 4 years earlier; A more confident Jack, a more captivating one, one that could command attention the way hair metal bands did in the 80s. Realizing this was the same person as the one who disappointed us in \u201998 almost felt akin to finding out that Clark Kent is Superman to the average passer-by. I gained a newfound respect for Black after this show, and He too is one that I wish hosted more frequently (though unlike others I\u2019ve mentioned so far, he at least hosted 3 times). Altogether, this was simply a \u201cFeel Good\u201d show, so much so that when we come back from our Next break, this will be the next Retro Review that I will do, there\u2019s simply too much to talk about in just one paragraph.\n\nSo concludes the SNLenium series\u2026mostly because I didn\u2019t write a year in review at any point during Season 28 (my last \u201cOriginal\u201d year as an episode reviewer), but also because it\u2019s probably best that this was a Trilogy anyway, you know how movies with four parts have turned out historically.\n\nNEXT TIME: We go into the 80s for the next chapter in our \u201cSaturday Night Soundtrack\u201d series.", "images": ["https://usefullyuselessinfo.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/season27_mosley.png?w=620",
