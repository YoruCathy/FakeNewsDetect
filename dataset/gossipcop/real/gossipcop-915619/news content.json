Though their feuding has come to a head in the past couple of months, the controversy between the two Sex and the City stars has been playing out in the tabloids for more than a decade, from early rumors of salary disputes to allegations of on-set cliquishness. Looking back on it all, I can\u2019t help but wonder: Was Cattrall the \u201cdifficult\u201d one, constantly torpedoing plans for future SATC outings with her salary demands? Or was SJP simply playing the part of the \u201cnice girl\u201d while fostering a toxic culture that excluded Cattrall and painted her as a diva in the press? Or are we, the media, at fault for stoking the flames of this drama in the first place?\n\nHave a look at the historical record and decide for yourself:\n\n2004: The show ends.\n\nSoon after season six ends, there\u2019s a production delay on the first Sex and the City movie, and salary negotiations are rumored to be a factor. At the 2004 Emmys, Cattrall is conspicuously seated far away from her co-stars.\n\nIn an interview with Jonathan Ross that same year, Cattrall opens up about some of the long-running money tensions on the show. \u201cI felt after six years it was time for all of us to participate in the financial windfall of Sex and the City,\u201d Cattrall said. \u201cWhen they didn\u2019t seem keen on that, I thought it was time to move on.\u201d\n\n2008: The first movie comes out.\n\nThe Sex and the City movie finally makes it onto our screens. A Telegraph article goes into more detail about the rumored salary tensions that had long dogged the show, explaining that Cattrall had tried to negotiate a raise for herself after Sarah Jessica Parker became an EP after season two, which created distance between her and the other cast members. As for the film, she had reportedly \u201copenly refused to participate unless she was paid more.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we the best of friends? No. We\u2019re professional actresses. We have our own separate lives,\u201d said Cattrall. (She also told Marie Claire that she had been going through a rough time back in 2004 when they were negotiating the movie, and it \u201cwasn\u2019t all about the money.\u201d)\n\nSJP, ever the peacekeeper, demurred: \u201cHonestly, we are all friends and I wish I saw more of Kim \u2026 She mentioned money and no one should vilify her for it. People made a decision that we had vilified her. No one bothered to say [to the rest of us], Are you disappointed by not making the movie? Yes. Do you respect and support her choice to not do it? Absolutely.\u201d\n\n2009 and 2010, doing promo for SATC 2: We\u2019re fine! Everything\u2019s fine!\n\nAn era of d\u00e9tente. Parker tells Elle: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to believe that I love Kim. I adore her. I wouldn\u2019t have done the movie without her. Didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nCattrall tells the Daily Mail: \u201cIt makes for juicy gossip. The truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is nowhere near as newsworthy. I think Sarah is fantastic. She is a born leader and she guides the crew and the cast in such a strong but gentle way. She and I are sick of this. It\u2019s exhausting talking about it, and a real bore. Next?\u201d\n\nIn a Marie Claire piece, both SJP and Cattrall echo the party line. Says SJP: \u201cWhen you\u2019re on set, you\u2019re working 90-hour weeks, you\u2019re never home, you\u2019re exhausted. There are times when all of us have been sensitive, and sometimes feelings get hurt. But I don\u2019t have any regrets about how I\u2019ve treated people.\u201d Cattrall adds that the cast\u2019s chemistry remains strong, and \u201cthings just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people\u2019s imaginations.\u201d\n\nYet, in 2009, an nymag.com article claimed that \u201cSarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall are no longer speaking, which is making everyone on the set of the new Sex and the City movie uncomfortable,\u201d with a source offering that \u201cyou could cut the tension with a knife.\u201d\n\n2016: We\u2019re still fine!!!!\n\nDespite rumors that a third SATC move is on the way, Kim Cattrall says she doesn\u2019t want to play Samantha again, saying it would be a \u201cchallenge.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in countless press appearances, SJP quashes rumors of a beef. \u201cIt was always so heartbreaking to me that there was this narrative about Kim and myself because it just didn\u2019t reflect anything that happened on that set,\u201d she tells Time. \u201cNobody asked those questions of shows with men. Isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d\n\n\u201cThese were my sisters, these were people that I grew to love and admire,\u201d SJP told Howard Stern. \u201cWas every day perfect? Were people always desperately, hopefully in love with each other? No, but this is a family of people who needed each other, relied upon each other, and loved each other. This sort of narrative, this ongoing catfight, it really used to upset.\u201d\n\nAlso, SJP posted this Instagram:\n\n2017: SATC 3 falls apart.\n\nSJP confirms a third movie isn\u2019t happening, even though they had the script ready to go. \u201cWe had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just disappointing that we don\u2019t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\u201d\n\nThat same day, the Daily Mail claims that it\u2019s because Cattrall \u201ctorpedoed\u201d the project by demanding that Warner Bros. produce her other projects in exchange for her participation; Cattrall shoots back:\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \ud83d\udca9storm! The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \u2014 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nOther cast members, including Willie Garson (Stanford) and Kristin Davis, turn to social media to express their frustration about the film not going forward.\n\nDisappointed for all crew holding on for negotiations to conclude for their jobs, and of course, for the fans. Leave it at that. #Truth \u2014 Willie Garson (@WillieGarson) September 29, 2017\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan, Cattrall clarified her stance:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about more money, this is not about more scenes, it\u2019s not about any of those things. This is about a clear decision, an empowered decision in my life to end one chapter and start another \u2026 it\u2019s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\u2019ve been saying for almost a year of \u2018no\u2019 that I\u2019m demanding or a diva \u2026 I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects, to be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBut in that same interview with Morgan, she also threw some shade at SJP. \u201cThis is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City and specifically Sarah Jessica Parker in that I think she could have been nicer. I really think she could have been nicer. I don\u2019t know what her issue is, I never have.\u201d\n\nPer Cattrall, nobody else bothered to reach out to her when reports were leaking to the press about her allegedly quashing the film:\n\n\u201cAnother thing that\u2019s really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, \u2018How you doing?\u2019 That would have been the way to handle it\u2026 And usually what happens in a healthy relationship is that someone, or a transaction for a job in my business, is that someone says, \u2018Are you available?\u2019 and you say \u2018Yes\u2019 and here\u2019s the job and you say \u2018Yes, but thank you very much but I\u2019m sort of over here right now but thank you very much,\u2019 and that person turns to you, and they say \u2018That\u2019s great, good luck to you, I wish you the best.\u2019 That\u2019s not what happened here, this is, it feels like a toxic relationship.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Willie Garson seems to think there\u2019s more to it:\n\nDear fans, because I'm \"toxic\", I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \u2014 Willie Garson (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\n2018: Everything falls apart.\n\nIn the wake of the Piers Morgan interview, SJP begins speaking out. In January, she tells the Daily Beast that the #MeToo movement \u201cemboldened\u201d her to speak out about the Sex and the City beef. (I mean, sure.) \u201cI\u2019m stunned by how deeply it still cuts,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen all that stuff was happening with Sex and the City, which I know is meaningless in the world, but when it\u2019s happening and you\u2019re caught up in any of the muscle of that stuff, it\u2019s so painful because all you want to do is respond. All you want to do is say, \u2018Are you kidding me!?\u2019\u201d\n\nShe went on:\n\nWhat happened, that was enormously painful for me. I just kept saying, \u201cThis was an experience I loved. I love those women. We shared this experience. It was a privilege. If that\u2019s what we\u2019re left with, those memories, there are only four of us who \u2026\u201d You know? But then all of a sudden the world shifted, right? I was like, oh this is ridiculous. I was afraid to talk about these allegations, and now there are real allegations [relating to abuse and sexual misconduct] in the world that are real? And all of a sudden I was like, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to answer the question about the Sex and the City movie.\u201d For so long I was told to be quiet about all of that stuff. And all of a sudden I\u2019m like, \u201cIf people are being encouraged to come forward and talk about really difficult, painful, potentially criminal things that they were part of or witnessed, I think I can talk about the Sex and the City 3 movie.\u201d [Laughs] I think it\u2019s OK! I\u2019m a grown freaking woman.\n\nAlso, in an appearence on Ellen, SJP joked that she should play Samantha in the third movie \u2013 which Cattrall appeared to be down with:\n\nShe\u2019d be fabulous! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d \u2014 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) January 17, 2018\n\nTalking to Andy Cohen in February, Parker added that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over what happened with Cattrall. \u201c I found it very upsetting because that\u2019s not the way I recall our experience,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. But I always think that what ties us together was this singular experience. It was a professional experience but it became personal, because it was years and years of our lives. So I\u2019m hoping that that eclipses anything that\u2019s been recently spoken. That many years spent doing something so special that people had a connection with is such a privilege.\u201d\n\nAnd then, shit really hit the fan. Last month, Cattrall\u2019s brother passed away, and Parker sent her condolences, both in statements to the press and in a comment on Cattrall\u2019s Instagram. \u201cIf somebody in your life, whether you\u2019re in touch with them or not, [is] suffering for any reason, it\u2019s involuntary that you want to convey condolences or sadness or just let someone know you\u2019re thinking about them,\u201d she told ET.\n\nThis did not go over well with Cattrall, who responded with a scathing Instagram post:\n\nHer Instagram links to a pro-Cattrall New York Post story about the \u201cmean girls\u201d culture on the SATC set, which claims \u201ca clique began to form, leaving Cattrall out in the cold.\u201d Apparently, SJP once rented a house for her and Nixon and Davis and excluded Cattrall, and by the end of the show, no one would talk to her.\n\nPeople were surprised by the extent of Cattrall\u2019s vitriol. An Us Weekly article claimed that though the two had reportedly disliked each other since season two, \u201ctheir co-stars can\u2019t understand why Kim lashed out\u201d because \u201cit wasn\u2019t this bad during filming.\u201d\n\nMost recently in a People cover story, Parker attempted once again to stake out the moral high ground. \u201cWe had this experience and it was amazing, and nothing will ever be like it. We had a connection with an audience, and we had a connection with the city and with this crew, and we got to tell these crazy stories with each other,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to mess with that. I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else playing that part. So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded. And I won\u2019t, because she needed to say what she needed to say, and that is her privilege.\u201d\n\nSo, SATC fans: Whose side are you on?", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a8/1ea/267f655dffdac28b6ab5797263c67cfe7a-22-SJP-kim-cattrall.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2018/02/22/22-SJP-kim-cattrall.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a8/1ea/267f655dffdac28b6ab5797263c67cfe7a-22-SJP-kim-cattrall.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Silman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/a-guide-to-the-kim-cattrall-sarah-jessica-parker-sex-and-the-city-beef-drama.html", "title": "Your Comprehensive Guide to the Kim Cattrall\u2013Sarah Jessica Parker Beef", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Your Comprehensive Guide to the Kim Cattrall\u2013Sarah Jessica Parker Beef", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/a-guide-to-the-kim-cattrall-sarah-jessica-parker-sex-and-the-city-beef-drama.html", "description": "Controversy between the two Sex and the City stars has been playing out in the tabloids for over a decade.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a8/1ea/267f655dffdac28b6ab5797263c67cfe7a-22-SJP-kim-cattrall.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "A Guide to the Kim Cattrall\u2013Sarah Jessica Parker Beef", "description": "Controversy between the two Sex and the City stars has been playing out in the tabloids for over a decade.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a8/1ea/267f655dffdac28b6ab5797263c67cfe7a-22-SJP-kim-cattrall.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-23T09:55:59.038-05:00", "tag": "kim cattrall, sarah jessica parker, sex and the city, drama, tv, television, culture", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "\u2019Sex and the City\u2019 stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Kim Cattrall\u2019s longtime feud \u2014 involving allegations of on-set cliquishness and salary disputes \u2013 recently came to a head when Cattrall slammed SJP on Instagram.", "sailthru.tags": "kim cattrall, sarah jessica parker, sex and the city, drama, tv, television, culture", "author": "Anna Silman", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519397759.038, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
