If I bring a woman home, [or] a man, we don\u2019t even have to have the discussion.\u201d\n\nRumors over Thompson's sexuality were sparked following her involvement in Monae's new album \"Dirty Computer,\" which came out in April. Monae recently came out as pansexual.\n\nDuring the interview, she also spoke up about the difficulty of finding a balance between privacy and visibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tricky, because Janelle and I are just really private people and we\u2019re both trying to navigate how you reconcile wanting to have that privacy and space, and also wanting to use your platform and influence,\u201d she explained.\n\nAlthough Thompson did not confirm a romantic relationship with Monae, she did say she loved her \"deeply.\"\n\n\u201cWe love each other deeply. We\u2019re so close, we vibrate on the same frequency. If people want to speculate about what we are, that\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t bother me,\" she said.\n\nMore:Would you wear vagina pants?
