What we do for a living is not normal, and therefore the process is not normal sometimes, and to expect it to be normal is to not understand what happens on set. Again, not to excuse it, Alia, but to be surprised by people having a wobbly route to their goal, their process \u2014 it\u2019s very rarely predictable. All I can say, personally, is I have never learned more from an actor that I\u2019ve worked with than Jeffrey Tambor. And I consider him one of my favorite, most valued people in my life.\n\nCROSS I agree with everybody. And I think it\u2019s important to note \u2014 and it hasn\u2019t been noted \u2014 that this kind of behavior that\u2019s being described, it didn\u2019t just come out of the blue. It wasn\u2019t zero to 60. There is a cumulative effect sometimes.\n\nBATEMAN You have different people\u2019s processes that converge and collide at times. So Jeffrey is not just popping off, coming out of his car and some unhinged guy.\n\nCROSS That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say.\n\nBATEMAN Not to say that you know, you [Walter] had it coming. But this is not in a vacuum \u2014 families come together and certain dynamics collide and clash every once in a while. And there\u2019s all kinds of things that go into the stew so it\u2019s a little narrow to single that one particular thing that is getting attention from our show.\n\nWALTER Only because you brought it up, Jeffrey, in that article! I never would have brought it up.\n\nBATEMAN I didn\u2019t mean to speak for you. That was part of his process of being as contrite and as transparent as he felt like he could and should be, and wanted to at the time.\n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that I have no idea what it\u2019s like to be on a set. I\u2019ve never been on one. But it seems like Jason is saying that this is part of the process. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019re saying, Jessica.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/28/arts/28arresteddevelopment2/merlin_138560169_80d9ee13-06e4-4ffb-a9da-cf0b4767e8c6-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/28/arts/28arresteddevelopment2/28arresteddevelopment2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/26/arts/28arresteddevelopment1/merlin_138560328_ba085b44-4848-41e3-965e-d36c3ad42f8e-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/28/arts/28arresteddevelopment2/28arresteddevelopment2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sopan Deb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/arts/television/arrested-development-netflix-interview-jeffrey-tambor.html", "title": "\u2018Arrested Development\u2019: We Sat Down With the Cast.
