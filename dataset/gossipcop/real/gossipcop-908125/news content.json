But while many were thrilled to see an affordable dress at a major Hollywood awards show, one person wasn\u2019t as happy about it: the Orange Is the New Black star herself.\n\nAsked by TMZ about the choice to wear the Adrianna Papell gown, Manning criticized her stylist Chaunielle Brown for the choice. \u201cIt\u2019s wack that my stylist didn\u2019t tell me that,\u201d she said. \u201cNow everyone else can afford it, that\u2019s what\u2019s cool about it, but it still sucks for me. I want to be in like a superstar gown \u2026 So the designer got a lot of press. She should pay me a lot of money.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nImage zoom John Salangsang/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOn Wednesday, the brand responded to Manning\u2019s diss in a statement given to PeopleStyle, saying \u201cClothing plays a key role in fostering confidence, allowing inner beauty and personality to shine through. We believe all women\u2014regardless of shape, size, ethnicity, or income\u2014deserve access to beautiful gowns and dresses. Our price points, brand mission, and activities within the community reflect this belief. We are still proud to count Taryn Manning among the women who have chosen to celebrate life\u2019s milestones in our gowns. We\u2019ve found that the tide has truly turned when it comes to wearing affordable fashion on the red carpet thanks to the likes of Michelle Obama and Kate Middleton. Along with Manning, we\u2019ve been lucky enough to dress her costar Jolene Purdy, Rebel Wilson, Shawn Johnson East, Jodie Sweetin, Kaela Settle, Kathie Lee Gifford and many others.\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: The Night\u2019s Standout Outfits at the SAG Awards\n\nAfter her comments picked up steam on the internet last week, Manning clarified her position on Instagram, writing \u201cI was completely caught off guard when all of the press about my dress was about the cost, which I knew nothing about, and I felt used for someone else\u2019s gain.\u201d She added that she loved the dress and is friends with Brown, and concluded \u201cI am happy to be the proof that there is more to feeling confident, beauty and happy on the inside than just a price tag.\u201d\n\nIf you want your own red carpet moment (with or without accompanying controversy), the dress is still available for $199 at Macy\u2019s and Bloomingdales.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftaryn-manning-3-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F07%2Ftaryn-manning-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Ftaryn-manning-3-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Apatoff"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/taryn-manning-complains-about-affordable-sag-awards-dress/", "title": "Taryn Manning Slams $200 SAG Awards Dress As 'Wack'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Red Carpet,SAG Awards,Screen Actors Guild Awards,Style,Style News,Taryn Manning", "news_keywords": "Red Carpet,SAG Awards,Screen Actors Guild Awards,Style,Style News,Taryn Manning", "description": "Orange Is the New Black actress Taryn Manning says she wanted a \"superstar\" dress for the Screen Actors Guild Awards", "og": {"title": "Taryn Manning Slams $200 SAG Awards Dress As 'Wack'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/style/taryn-manning-complains-about-affordable-sag-awards-dress/", "description": "Taryn Manning made headlines Sunday for donning a SAG Awards dress that was only $200 \u2013 and available at your favorite department store.
