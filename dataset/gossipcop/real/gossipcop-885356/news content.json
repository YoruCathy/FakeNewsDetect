We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].\n\nPALTROW: Wow. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time. We\u2019ve been through so much together.\n\nCRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don\u2019t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it\u2019s like it was only yesterday.\n\nPALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become \u00e2\u0080\u00a8a ballerina?\n\nCRUZ: That\u2019s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn\u2019t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That\u2019s when I stopped dancing.\n\nPALTROW: Do you miss it?\n\nCRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.\n\nPALTROW: It\u2019s totally like that. How did you get your first job?\n\nCRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jam\u00f3n Jam\u00f3n [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.\n\nPALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?\n\nCRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can\u2019t be sure.\n\nPALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.\n\nCRUZ: I\u2019ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, \u201cAre you afraid of aging?\u201d That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.\n\nPALTROW: It\u2019s amazing, Hollywood\u2019s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.\n\nCRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I\u2019ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m proud of the values I have, because I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re up to me\u2014they just come from the way I was raised. I\u2019m rooted by the things I\u2019ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, \u201cWhat the fuck? I\u2019m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, \u201cCome on, it\u2019s 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this? It\u2019s crazy.\u201d That sense only got bigger when I had children.", "images": ["https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/P4-1.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/most-read.gif", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Interview_Star-Map_08-29-2019-1-391x308.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Interview_DIGITAL_WEB_2019_SEP_AntonioBanderas-1-e1566315382720-391x308.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/penelope-cover-5.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PenelopeCruz1.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-1.02.38-PM-391x308.png", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-30-at-2.59.45-PM-391x308.png", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/P2-1.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Interview_New_Logo_AW_216x93_White.png?x=1", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/P3-1.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/starmap2-391x308.png", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PenelopeCruzThumb.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/credit_@myles_standish_javier_bardem__W1A9308-Edit-Edit-391x308.jpg", "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logo.png"], "top_img": "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/PenelopeCruzThumb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gwyneth Paltrow"], "canonical_link": "https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/penelope-cruz-gwyneth-paltrow", "title": "Interview Magazine", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#d4c18d", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#d4c18d", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Penelope Cruz - Interview Magazine", "description": "In 2009, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz became the first Spanish actress to win an Academy Award\u2014a sky-high career peak if ever there was one.
