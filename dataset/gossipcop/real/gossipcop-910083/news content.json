They got a huge opportunity, and I would implore everybody to be a little bit kinder.\u201d\n\nDoherty went on to speak about the reboot\u2019s \u201cpositive, good influence,\u201d adding that \u201cthis is a show about three strong women again\u2026 I know that it may not be your Charmed, but you should all really pat yourselves on the back and congratulate yourselves, because you\u2019re the most loyal, amazing fans in the world. And because of you, you made it a show that a younger generation wants to see.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cYou have to think about what Charmed did for you when it was on and think about what that\u2019s going to do for a new generation. Embrace it, you guys. It\u2019s doing well, ratings-wise, and it\u2019s employing over 200 people.\u201d (Having dipped both weeks since its launch, Charmed is thus far averaging 1.33 million total viewers and a 0.42 demo rating, ranking fifth and fourth among all CW shows.)\n\nDoherty has had kind words for the Charmed reboot since it was first announced. She came to the project\u2019s defense back in January, saying that she was \u201cintrigued by the idea that a new generation might be comforted.\u201d\n\nOriginal Charmed star Holly Marie Combs, meanwhile, has been critical of the new version from the start. After The CW placed a pilot order for the reboot, she tweeted that Charmed \u201cbelongs to the four of us, our vast amount of writers, crews and predominantly the fans. You will not fool them by owning a title/stamp. So bye.\u201d\n\nUpdate: Similarly, fellow original cast member Alyssa Milano has called the reboot a \u201churtful situation,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to see something that we loved so dearly then be taken from us in a way that had absolutely nothing to do with anything that we had done and created\u2026. [T]he only reason why the show is able to have a reboot is because of the relationships we created.\u201d\n\nNew episodes of Charmed air Sundays at 9/8c on The CW.", "images": ["https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/swat-season-3-finale-schedule.jpg?w=620", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-performs-at-global-citizens-concert.png?resize=180%2C101", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-tvline-2014/library/images/follow_us_on_facebook_graphic.png", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/dw-2.jpg?w=280", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/lucifer-season-4-episode-4.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/one-chicago-cast-exits-2.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/too-hot-to-handle-finale.jpg?w=620", "https://i0.wp.com/www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/top-chef-season-15-contestants-hosts-Tom-Colicchio.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/alia-shawkat-leaves-brad-pitts-house-backgrid-ftr.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/best-hangboards.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-203220h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-60R-umvc0T-Cw&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/brooklyn-nine-nine-season-7-episode-13-finale-nbc-1.jpg?w=620", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=tvline.com&path=%2F2018%2F10%2F30%2Fcharmed-reboot-shannen-doherty-response-reaction-the-cw%2F&ct=article&lob=tvline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=996341&comment_count=47", "https://boygeniusreport.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/webp.net-resizeimage-1-10.jpg?quality=98&strip=all&resize=180%2C101", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/tv-reboots-charmed-alyssa-milano.jpg?w=620&h=420", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/charmed-reboot.jpg?w=620&h=420&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/charmed-reboot.jpg?w=620"], "top_img": "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/charmed-reboot.jpg?w=620", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Iannucci"], "canonical_link": "https://tvline.com/2018/10/30/charmed-reboot-shannen-doherty-response-reaction-the-cw/", "title": "Shannen Doherty Defends Charmed Reboot: 'I Would Implore Everybody to Be a Little Bit Kinder' to CW Series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "9ad238c78ee34da2d6d96a41981790d2"}, "description": "Original 'Charmed' star Shannen Doherty has come to the defense of The CW's new reboot \u2014 read her comments.", "news_keywords": "Charmed, Shannen Doherty, The CW", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1377345661", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Shannen Doherty Defends Charmed Reboot: 'I Would Implore Everybody to Be a Little Bit Kinder' to CW Series", "url": "https://tvline.com/2018/10/30/charmed-reboot-shannen-doherty-response-reaction-the-cw/", "description": "The CW\u2019s new Charmed reboot has its fair share of critics \u2014 but Shannen Doherty is not among them.
