(Kardashians, they're just like us.)\n\n\"It gets rid of cellulite, you rub it on your body, it's literally the most painful [thing],\" Khloe said. \"You rub this on your body really hard, but you gotta be naked. You should see me naked in my bed doing this. It looks like a very weird sexual thing.\"\n\nUp Next: Khloe Kardashian Swears by This Vibrating Tool Before and After Her Workouts\n\n\"You take your jeans off and I'll do this to you,\" Khloe instructed Kourtney.\n\n\"Got a thong just for you, Khlo,\" Kourtney replied as she willingly stripped down to show off her booty for KUWTK cameras.\n\nKhloe and Cheban lathered Kourtney's bare assets with lotion, then started rolling away on her butt with the massage tool.\n\n(Photo: E!)\n\n\"It does not hurt whatsoever,\" Kourtney said, taking a cheeky dig at Khloe. But her butt massagers (and fans) noticed that the eldest Kardashian didn't have any cellulite to rub out in the first place.\n\n\"You really have no dimples!\" Khloe told her sister. \"No cellulite at all!\" Cheban added.\n\nAnd Kardashian fans agreed, praising Kourtney's full, round butt as the best part of the juicy episode \u2014 and some have even awarded Kourt with the coveted \"best butt\" title of all the Kardashian clan.\n\nKourtney kardashian has the nicest booty for those who didn't watch keeping up tonight ??? \u2014 StevesSon?

The KUWTK sister sticks to a strict diet of whole, organic foods, cutting gluten, dairy and sugar completely, and she's been stepping up her booty day routine at the gym.\n\nIt's clearly paying off.\n\nPhoto credit: E!", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian-butt-massage-20015318.gif", "https://media.popculture.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian-butt-massage-cellulite-kuwtk-20015319-640x320.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian-butt-massage-cellulite-kuwtk-20015319-640x320.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2017/10/16/kuwtk-kourtney-kardashian-butt-cellulite-massage/", "title": "Watching Khloe Kardashian Massage Kourtney's Bare Butt Is Too Weird to Handle", "meta_data": {"description": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s bare butt made a flashy cameo in Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardahians, and fans were loving it.While drama consumed the episode, Kourtney, Khloe and friend Jonathan Cheban brought some bizarre comedic relief with the help of an 'as seen on TV' tool Khloe [...]", "keywords": "Keeping Up With the Kardashians,Kourtney Kardashian,Khloe Kardashian", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up With the Kardashians,Kourtney Kardashian,Khloe Kardashian", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@PopCulture", "creator": "@PopCulture", "title": "Watching Khloe Kardashian Massage Kourtney's Bare Butt Is Too Weird to Handle", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s bare butt made a flashy cameo in Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the [...]", "image": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian-butt-massage-cellulite-kuwtk-20015319-640x320.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Watching Khloe Kardashian Massage Kourtney's Bare Butt Is Too Weird to Handle", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2017/10/16/kuwtk-kourtney-kardashian-butt-cellulite-massage/", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/10/kourtney-kardashian-butt-massage-cellulite-kuwtk-20015319-640x320.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Reality TV", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s bare butt made a flashy cameo in Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508083200.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
