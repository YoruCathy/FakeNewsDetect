Entertainers and other celebs are also chipping in to help with the effort.\n\nIn addition to TIDAL\u2019s efforts in Puerto Rico, Jay Z has pledged that all net proceeds from his annual TIDAL X concert will go to aid victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as the recent earthquakes in Mexico. This year\u2019s concert, titled TIDAL X BROOKLYN, is taking place on October 17th at the Barclay\u2019s Center in Brooklyn. Angie Martinez will host the star-studded affair, which will feature a star-studded line up of performers including DJ Khaled, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Brown, Remy Ma, Vic Mensa, Cardi B and Jay Z himself, among many others. Angie Martinez will host the event, with special guest appearances by Rosie Perez and Lin Manuel Miranda, both of whom boast Puerto Rican roots.\n\nSee below for NYC-based donation drop-off locations. Sites will be opened from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. All items must be unopened and in their original packaging.
