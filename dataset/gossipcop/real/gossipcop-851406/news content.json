It sounds like a Noel Coward play.\u201d\n\nSnaps Kimmy in reply: \u201cIf Noel Coward was really a coward who rapes everybody.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of the series, creators Tina Fey and Robert Carlock have hinted at some of the darker elements of Kimmy\u2019s abduction and imprisonment, most notably with this line in the pilot: \u201cYes, there was weird sex stuff in the bunker.\u201d Otherwise, the show has shown a preference for show over tell, specifically in how Kimmy\u2019s trauma interferes with her attempts to pursue any sort of romantic relationship.\n\nKimmy\u2019s love interests have included several nice gentlemen over the past three seasons, such as tutor Charles (Andrew Ridings), rich guy Logan (Adam Campbell), Vietnamese immigrant Dong (Ki Hong Lee), PTSD-afflicted veteran Keith (Sam Page), and this season, the lovely Daveed Diggs as philosophy student Perry. All of them have initially seemed like a potential fit for Kimmy, and all of them haven\u2019t worked out \u2013 much of the time because when she finds herself in an intimate situation, Kimmy\u2019s instinctual reaction is to lash out with violence in order to protect herself.\n\nAt times, Kimmy\u2019s over-the-top physical reaction to these moments is played for comedy, to a degree where it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable to watch her constantly slamming telephones on Dong\u2019s head as he attempts to kiss her.\n\nAnd of all her love interests, Dong is the one she\u2019s gone furthest with. While they struggle to connect in Season 2 Episode 8, \u201cKimmy Goes To A Hotel,\u201d the final scene indicates that as they\u2019re trapped in the back of a police car, Kimmy finally feels capable of pursuing more with him. \u201cYou\u2019re in handcuffs, which is making my brain feel calm for more totally normal reasons\u2026\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be perfect.\u201d\n\nThat last comment feels like a nice overall statement for what life is like as a survivor of trauma, and \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d has always been sure to keep an element of humanity in its exploration of what Kimmy\u2019s time in the bunker did to her as a person. It\u2019s also one of the trickiest hurdles the show has had to navigate, because the established tone of a light, bubbly comedy about a woman who now fully admits to over a decade of rape and abuse is at times a real brain-teaser.\n\nOne interesting twist came in Season 3, Episode 11, \u201cKimmy Googles the Internet!\u201d \u2014 in which Kimmy learned that many of the people in her life are more than aware of her mole woman past, thanks to Google. It\u2019s a harsh moment of awareness for the character, as her relative na\u00efvet\u00e9 when it comes to technology has kept her shielded from the fact that so much of our lives can be hunted down with some strategic search engine terms.\n\nBut it also led to a character arc that honestly felt a little formless, but still intriguing. Season 1 was about Kimmy confronting what, exactly, happened to her. Season 2 was about acknowledging she needed help and getting it. But Season 3 was about her working to own that experience, rather than hide it.\n\nAnd a big part of that? Finally using the \u201cR-word.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d will ever push past a PG-13 rating, despite its subject matter and Netflix\u2019s loose content restrictions \u2014 Tina Fey has said that she likes that families can still watch the show together. But now that the show is slightly more comfortable with being honest about what happened to Kimmy, maybe she, and the show, can actually move on in a real, healthy way.\n\n\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d has done a lovely job over the past three seasons of creating its own little world. There\u2019s plenty to explore still as Kimmy fills her Google results with what she does now \u2014 not so much burying what was done to her, but proving that as a female who\u2019s \u201cstrong as hell,\u201d she\u2019s far more than that one experience.\n\n\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d Season 3 is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nStay on top of the latest film and TV news!
