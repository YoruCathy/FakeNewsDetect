(We\u2019ve never wanted to be someone\u2019s ex more in our lives.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had no bad breakups in my life,\u201d said Evans, who\u2019s dated Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel, and, most recently, his \u201cGifted\u201d co-star Jenny Slate.\n\n\u201cTypically, if I see an ex, I give a big hug, and it\u2019s wonderful to catch up,\u201d the 35-year-old told the magazine. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever fortunate enough to love someone and have them love you back, it\u2019s worth protecting that. It\u2019s rare that someone can truly know you. And if you\u2019ve broken through that kind of wall, I think it\u2019s important to value that.\u201d\n\nIt sure seems like he does. The actor has spoken of Slate in only glowing terms while promoting \u201cGifted\u201d the last few months. In a March interview with People, Evans called the 35-year-old actress and comedian his \u201cfavorite human.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best,\u201d he said, before gushing even more. \u201cI\u2019ve never, ever, ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does. She\u2019ll give you one sentence and there\u2019s no fat to it. You\u2019re like, \u2018You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe pair, who dated for nine months before breaking up in February, shared a laugh earlier this month at the Los Angeles premiere of \u201cGifted:\u201d\n\nTodd Williamson via Getty Images Such friendly exes.\n\nThey looked super cute, too:\n\nEmma McIntyre via Getty Images\n\nLuckily, the \u201cno ill feelings here\u201d approach to the breakup seems to be mutual. In a deeply revealing interview with \u201cVulture\u201d last month, Slate, who\u2019s best known for her roles in \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and the indie film \u201cObvious Child,\u201d opened up about what initially drew her to Evans.\n\n\u201cChris is truly one of the kindest people I\u2019ve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s really vulnerable, and he\u2019s really straightforward. He\u2019s like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he\u2019s really sure of them. It\u2019s just wonderful to be around. His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e98f248220000c10282725e.jpeg?cache=MuNi2gWi5E&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e98d1b82500005706eafc71.jpeg?cache=MGsDZdC5np&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99e37c3000001e0715468a.jpeg?cache=42FQ7WUvfH&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efb5b51b0000330016b64a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efac7e1b0000320016b61e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e94891c2500006b04eaf6f5.jpeg?cache=TMDJNYqUyA&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efa8651600002000658440.jpeg?cache=WKEV2pHIAV&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99d26625000079216b80e0.jpeg?cache=P70sLg8yyh&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e975a192200003200826f92.jpeg?ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99b90a2500004f236b80ba.jpeg?cache=1RvTwokf1y&ops=424_244", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e99e83825000079216b8107.jpeg?cache=CjONT1GR4A&ops=424_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5971228015000026008b2d8d.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568ec9cb1a00002c00594183.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efa8651600002000658440.jpeg?cache=WKEV2pHIAV&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Lifestyle Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chris-evans-is-a-great-ex-boyfriend_n_58efa232e4b0b9e9848a1918", "title": "Your Pretend Boyfriend Chris Evans Is Also The Best Ex-Boyfriend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "description": "The \"Captain America\" actor has never had a bad breakup.", "keywords": "Dating celebrity relationships breakups chris evans jenny slate", "og": {"title": "Your Pretend Boyfriend Chris Evans Is Also The Best Ex-Boyfriend", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efa8651600002000658440.jpeg?cache=WKEV2pHIAV&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efa8651600002000658440.jpeg?cache=WKEV2pHIAV&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chris-evans-is-a-great-ex-boyfriend_n_58efa232e4b0b9e9848a1918", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The \"Captain America\" actor has never had a bad breakup."}, "article": {"tag": "Dating celebrity relationships breakups chris evans jenny slate", "section": "Divorce", "published_time": "2017-04-13T18:28:59Z", "modified_time": "2017-04-13T18:28:59Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HPLifestyle", "title": "Your Pretend Boyfriend Chris Evans Is Also The Best Ex-Boyfriend", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58efa8651600002000658440.jpeg?cache=WKEV2pHIAV&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The \"Captain America\" actor has never had a bad breakup."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_58efa232e4b0b9e9848a1918", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "taboola.category": "divorce"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492108139.0, "source": "https://www.huffpost.com", "summary": ""}
