My sister is very Catholic, and I\u2019m not. So I liked the dynamic of Scully being very Catholic and Mulder not; I related to that.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat Nielsen didn\u2019t know at the time was that her episode would shift back one to become the penultimate episode of the season and potentially the series as a whole. Wednesday's episode revolved around a cult led by a former actress (Fiona Vroom) who was obsessed with maintaining their youth and the woman (Carlena Britch) trying to save her sister from them. The installment also could be the last \u201cmonster of the week\u201d episode the iconic series does with its core team intact as star Gillian Anderson has said this will be her final year playing Scully.\n\n\u201cThe pressure that society puts on women to be perfect, to be beautiful is intense, because we\u2019re such a consumerism society that we have to prey off of women\u2019s insecurity to sell, sell, sell,\u201d Nielsen says. The writer, who doubles as the show's script coordinator, also made sure the female characters were well-rounded and the episode also featured an inclusive cast. \u201cEspecially in Hollywood, you\u2019re a write-off after 30. That pressure is quadrupled as an actress. That was a horrible and wonderful rabbit hole to go down [in writing]: having an actress try to hold on to her youth and obtaining that.\u201d\n\nNielsen credits longtime X-Files writers James Wong (who directed the hour) and Glen Morgan with being the genesis of Scully\u2019s (Gillian Anderson) religious origin story in the episode. When Scully was younger, her brother was sick, and her mother asked the family to pray for him. The first few days, a young Scully asked for a puppy \u2026 which she got shortly after her brother recovered. \u201cIt was the architecture of Jim and Glen knowing this character for so long, and seeing the things that she should be coming from,\u201d she says, calling the duo her \u201cdream team\u201d collaborators. Morgan was also the one to suggest they have a visual callback to the mysterious coin Scully\u2019s mother had on her when she died last season.\n\n\n\nThe hour ended up being pivotal for Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully, whose relationship has grown increasingly murky. The dynamic duo\u2019s partnership was always complicated during the original run of the series: after years of closeness, they slept together in season seven \u2014 a move that appeared to be responsible for the conception of Scully\u2019s son, William \u2014 but due to outside forces (and Duchovny\u2019s increased absence from the franchise) they were never properly a couple. The second feature film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, found the two living together, away from the FBI life, but there was obvious tension in the relationship as they worked the movie\u2019s case; they were broken up by the 2016 television revival.\n\n\n\nHowever, they appeared to potentially reconcile early in season 11, when they slept together and arranged a couple of dates. But in true Mulder and Scully fashion, they simply seemed to be existing together (they still reside in separate homes, for instance) versus actively engaging the shift in their relationship and what it could mean. But Scully took a step forward to break them out of their standstill in the final scene of the episode: when Mulder mentioned they were good together, she simply asked, \u201cAre we together?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me it was about having a honest moment,\u201d Nielsen says, acknowledging the open conversation between the two was part of why the episode moved directly pre-finale. \u201cWe need to be real, we need to be honest, we need to start saying something. They\u2019ve gone through so many emotional things with their son, coming back to the X-Files and things not going so smoothly. And [also] coming back to the relationship, because they were away from it for so long; to see where that relationship sits now. It\u2019s exhausting not being honest when you get to that stage. To be true to these characters, you had to have a true moment. It\u2019s what those characters needed.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut what was it that Scully needs? \"I don\u2019t know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here,\u201d Mulder told his partner. \u201cAnd I am listening. Right besides you, all ears. That\u2019s my choice.\u201d She paused, looked around at the empty church, before whispering her hope for her future in his ear. \u201cThat\u2019s not my 4-year-old self looking for a miracle,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s my leap of faith forward. And I\u2019d like to do it together.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe audience is in the dark about Scully\u2019s request during the hour, intentionally. \u201cThat\u2019s between Mulder and Scully,\u201d Nielsen notes. \u201cHaving those private moments, it\u2019s important for any couple.\u201d And it won\u2019t be revealed going forward, either: \u201cIt\u2019ll always be between Mulder and Scully,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not for anyone else. That was their moment.\u201d (Chalk it up to another unsolved mystery, a la the duo\u2019s Christmas gifts to each other.)\n\nWith that exact sentiment remaining unspoken, it was essential the tone be handled correctly while filming the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s just [them] being honest with each other,\u201d Nielsen notes. \u201cWhen you\u2019re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they\u2019re suddenly honest, it takes you aback. It\u2019s, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re actually going to have a real conversation about this.\u2019 Sometimes those things can be scary. It was something from the heart, which can be terrifying for her to do, especially given how much she\u2019s been through and how much her heart has been broken, especially this season. That\u2019s where I wanted it to come from: her vulnerability.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd, yes, in Nielsen\u2019s mind, Mulder and Scully are meant to be together. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re each other\u2019s soulmates and they know it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey get in each other\u2019s way, they\u2019re complicated, they both have reasons why they hold back. They both have reasons they need each other. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve had such an up and down relationship: it\u2019s not as easy as saying, \u2018I like you, let\u2019s make this work.\u2019 The world they live in just doesn\u2019t allow for that. Their love for each other, mind and body, makes them go, \u2018There\u2019s nobody else.\u2019 There are so many moments you see them, they look at each other, and just from a look, [it\u2019s] no one will get me like you do. That\u2019s my personal take on it: they\u2019re soulmates.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat do you think Scully whispered to Mulder?", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/03/the_x-files_s02e08_still.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/01/greg_berlanti_sharon_horgan_alex_kurtzman_and_dwayne_johnson_-_getty_-_h_2020.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2018/03/the_x-files_s02e08_still.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/03/mrs._america_-_publicity_still_1-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/03/the_x-files_s02e08_still.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marisa Roffman", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/x-files-what-did-scully-whisper-mulder-1094323", "title": "'The X-Files': What Did Scully Whisper to Mulder?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"When you\u2019re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they\u2019re suddenly honest, it takes you aback,\" says episode writer Karen Nielsen. \"It\u2019s, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re actually going to have a real conversation about this.\u2019 Sometimes those things can be scary.\"", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/x-files-what-did-scully-whisper-mulder-1094323", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'The X-Files': What Did Scully Whisper to Mulder?", "description": "\"When you\u2019re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they\u2019re suddenly honest, it takes you aback,\" says episode writer Karen Nielsen. \"It\u2019s, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re actually going to have a real conversation about this.\u2019 Sometimes those things can be scary.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/03/the_x-files_s02e08_still.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'The X-Files': What Did Scully Whisper to Mulder?", "description": "\"When you\u2019re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they\u2019re suddenly honest, it takes you aback,\" says episode writer Karen Nielsen. \"It\u2019s, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re actually going to have a real conversation about this.\u2019 Sometimes those things can be scary.\"", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/x-files-what-did-scully-whisper-mulder-1094323", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/03/the_x-files_s02e08_still.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'The X-Files': What Did Scully Whisper to Mulder?", "sailthru.description": "\"When you\u2019re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they\u2019re suddenly honest, it takes you aback,\" says episode writer Karen Nielsen. \"It\u2019s, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re actually going to have a real conversation about this.\u2019 Sometimes those things can be scary.\"", "sailthru.author": "Marisa Roffman", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-14 18:00:00", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, The X-Files"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521021600.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
