The 39-year-old reality star is known for her organic, mostly natural diet, and just because summer is approaching, doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s slacking off. This week, the \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d star took to her website and app to reveal the healthy-yet-delicious meals she\u2019s eating on her summer meal plan.\n\nThough she hasn\u2019t revealed her full week of meals, we have the scoop on what she eats on the first two days, and if you\u2019re a fan of keeping cool this summer, Kourt\u2019s meals might be for you.

Combine the teriyaki sauce ingredients and mix until well combined. Set aside.\n\n3. Set the oven to 390\u00b0F and line a baking tray with parchment paper. Coat tofu in teriyaki sauce.
