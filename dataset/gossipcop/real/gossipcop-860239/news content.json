Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk\u2014refreshing facial mists are about to become your skin\u2019s new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It\u2019s time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they\u2019re meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you\u2019re looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!\n\nNow you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren\u2019t sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We\u2019re breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.\n\nADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF\u2026\n\nA facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn\u2019t sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.\n\nEven if you\u2019re feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry.

Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn\u2019t interfere with your makeup).

Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.\n\nHOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY\n\nOnce you\u2019re done applying all of your makeup\u2014foundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it\u2014lightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup and keep your look lasting even longer.\n\nADD A PRIMER SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF\u2026\n\nPrimer sprays are another type of facial spray worthy of adding to your beauty regimen\u2014and they\u2019ve been getting more attention as of late.
