The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark\u2019s natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.\n\nPhelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than C\u00e9sar Cielo\u2019s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.\n\nRegardless of Phelps\u2019 abilities, Discovery\u2019s perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers\u2019 sentiments.
