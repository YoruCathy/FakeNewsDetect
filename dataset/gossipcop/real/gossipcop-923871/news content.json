Driving the DeLorean from \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d Wade/Parzival learns the secret to winning the dizzying championship auto race. From there it\u2019s on to the next world, the next race for the next key. The forces of corporate evil conspire against Wade and, eventually, his OASIS posse. Ben Mendelsohn portrays the sniveling face of adversity, and he makes for a surprisingly ineffectual antagonist. Or maybe I\u2019m at the point in my life where I want Rylance to play every available supporting role, not just one or two.", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/mliqac2_XgUFzCbax08MuHzLlZ0=/1200x0/top/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/pb/resources/images/tinygif.gif", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/pb/resources/images/ct_icons/app-bar-logo.svg?v=223", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/tcEEYxMaK4JvpzHCvCWw-YeV8cc=/90x90/top/www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/Pwy8DW0VgRYF1ISx_xsVWP40MCM=/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W2VLQHGZTZF2TE6TSDGW4FIPMQ"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/mliqac2_XgUFzCbax08MuHzLlZ0=/1200x0/top/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Phillips"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364-story.html", "title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1, initial-scale=1", "language": "English (United States), en-US", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2020, Chicago Tribune", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "date": "2018-03-26T17:40:00Z", "description": "Even with banal material, a master's visual assurance transcends the cliches in this science-fiction adventure starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Mark Rylance", "googlebot-news": "index", "twitter": {"title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/mliqac2_XgUFzCbax08MuHzLlZ0=/1200x0/top/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "description": "Even with banal material, a master's visual assurance transcends the cliches in this science-fiction adventure starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Mark Rylance", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@chicagotribune", "creator": "@chicagotribune"}, "fb_title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "og": {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364-story.html", "title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/mliqac2_XgUFzCbax08MuHzLlZ0=/1200x0/top/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "description": "Even with banal material, a master's visual assurance transcends the cliches in this science-fiction adventure starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Mark Rylance", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "type": "article"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered", "tag": "Steven Spielberg, Mark Rylance", "section": ", Entertainment, Movies"}, "fb": {"app_id": 306836229411287, "page_id": "5953023255,104061989632161,330360537007411,264870045299,73734231949,53310156364,40762490776,60569705796,121922684499844,182379588445160,62915602634,1987930441432108,119608021389933,745745225518281", "pages": "5953023255,104061989632161,330360537007411,264870045299,73734231949,53310156364,40762490776,60569705796,121922684499844,182379588445160,62915602634,1987930441432108,119608021389933,745745225518281", "admins": 100000786395051}, "author": "Michael Phillips", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid4OTFJYKKOBBRRHD7QYDPVYZIGY", "suppressFeatureAmp": "ticket-html-widget,ticket-html-widget-mobile", "suppressFeatureTablet": "ticket-html-widget", "ptype": "s", "suppressFeatureDesktop": "ticket-html-widget-mobile", "suppressFeatureMobile": "ticket-html-widget"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.chicagotribune.com", "summary": ""}
