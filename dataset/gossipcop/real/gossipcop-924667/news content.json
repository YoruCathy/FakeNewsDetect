Family friends say the Suits actress \u201csaw her as a role model.\"\n\n\"She was always fascinated by the royal family,\" the star's childhood friend Ninaki Priddy is quoted as saying in the book, according to an excerpt printed on The Times. \"She wants to be Princess Diana 2.0.\"\n\nGetty\n\nThe 36-year-old, who studied a double major in theater and international relations at Northwestern University, followed her interest in politics by landing an internship at the US embassy in Buenos Aires.\n\n\"It was their economic devaluation and our Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Paul O'Neill, was there, so I'm 20 years old, in Buenos Aires, in a motorcade, doing that whole thing,\u201d she previously told Marie Claire US. \"I thought for sure I would still have a career in politics.\"\n\nWhile Meghan ended up in Hollywood rather than Washington, she did continue her interest in humanitarianism, working as a Global Ambassador for World Vision, working with the United Nations, she was a One Young World Counsellor and has long been an outspoken advocate for gender equality, all prior to meeting her future husband.\n\n\"What\u2019s been really exciting, as we talk about this as the transition out of my career... is that the causes that have been very important to me, I can focus even more energy on,\" Meghan said in her engagement interview with the BBC.\n\nAnd so while comparisons are a waste of time and energy, if she was inspired by the incredible work Diana did, and can continue to fight for causes that need a voice and a platform like hers, then power to her we say!", "images": ["https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/Branding/MarieClaire/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/Branding/MarieClaire/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BR2_akxg9yM/media/?size=l", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/Branding/MarieClaire/images/enhanced-header-logo-alt.svg", "http://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/33981/meghan_markle_princess_diana.jpg", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/69283/ps-xxx-bws-dropdown-mag-sub-image-mc.jpg?height=158"], "top_img": "http://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/33981/meghan_markle_princess_diana.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Georgia Pitt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/meghan-markle-always-saw-princess-diana-as-a-role-model-according-to-new-book", "title": "Meghan Markle 'Wants to be Princess Diana 2.0', Says Book", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "A new tell-all book from infamous royal biographer Andrew Morton sheds new light on Meghan Markle's past", "news_keywords": "meghan markle, princess diana, royals", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/meghan-markle-always-saw-princess-diana-as-a-role-model-according-to-new-book", "title": "Meghan Markle 'Wants to be Princess Diana 2.0', Says Book", "description": "A new tell-all book from infamous royal biographer Andrew Morton sheds new light on Meghan Markle's past", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/33981/meghan_markle_princess_diana.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1000}}, "twitter": {"title": "Meghan Markle 'Wants to be Princess Diana 2.0', Says Book", "description": "A new tell-all book from infamous royal biographer Andrew Morton sheds new light on Meghan Markle's past", "image": "http://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/33981/meghan_markle_princess_diana.jpg", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/meghan-markle-always-saw-princess-diana-as-a-role-model-according-to-new-book"}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 18812418320}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522722567.343, "source": "https://www.marieclaire.com.au", "summary": ""}
