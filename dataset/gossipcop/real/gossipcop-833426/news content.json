Born in Tehran, Iran in 1973, Reza Farahan moved to the United States as a child and grew up in Beverly Hills. Reza Farahan works in the real estate industry and is known to work hard and party hard. He is a good friend of Mercedes \"MJ\" Javid. Not only do Reza and MJ frequently party together, they are also co-workers at the Kelly Williams real estate agency. Reza is a very unique individual. Not only is he half Jewish, half Muslim, he is also openly gay. This is an incredibly unique combination within the Persian community. Consequently, Reza has endured a great deal of prejudice throughout his life. After initially turning down the opportunity to appear on Shahs of Sunset, Reza eventually decided to join the cast after hearing too man stories of bullied gay teenagers committing suicide. He serves as a voice for the Persian gay community, and hopes to inspire gay teenagers, especially those of Middle Eastern backgrounds. MJ's family is one of the few Iranian families that has always treated him with openness and acceptance. Like anyone, his goal is to live out the American dream, and have a family and a happy home life. The reality TV series Shahs of Sunset debuted on Bravo in 2012 and Reza Farahan has appeared on all five seasons.
