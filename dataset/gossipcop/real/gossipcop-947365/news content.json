Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon are considering exchanging vows in a televised ceremony, but they have one condition.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re both down for it, but our caveat is that we want as many guests as we want and we don\u2019t want to have to be limited to that,\u201d Iaconetti, 30, explained on the Monday, June 25, episode of her and Ben Higgins\u2019 Almost Famous podcast. \u201cSo if we couldn\u2019t have it the way we imagined, that\u2019s the only reason we wouldn\u2019t do it \u2026 We want it, we want it.\u201d\n\nIaconetti also revealed details about the day Haibon, 29, proposed to her, and admitted that her fianc\u00e9 \u201cdidn\u2019t seem nervous at all\u201d when getting down on one knee.\n\n\u201cI had an inkling, I was, like, 50-50. I thought it was going to happen for a couple weeks leading up to it, and then the week of, everyone was throwing me off,\u201d the Bachelor Winter Games alum recalled. \u201cSo I knew that Jared would ask my dad, he always said he would ask my dad. But I talked to my parents and they\u2019re like, \u2018Ashley, he did not call.\u2019 Total straight faces. [But] he did call. My parents are apparently really good actors, so is my sister, so are Jade [Roper] and Tanner [Tolbert], it\u2019s like all very crazy. It was off and on. I was like, \u2018It\u2019s gonna happen; no it\u2019s not gonna happen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdding to the confusion was Haibon\u2019s calm state of mind in Mexico during the days leading up to the proposal. \u201cThat\u2019s the other crazy part is that he didn\u2019t seem nervous at all,\u201d Iaconetti noted. \u201cI know he\u2019s a good actor, though. I know Jared, I always knew he was a good actor, not the rest of my family and friends.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the reality star couple, who met on Bachelor in Paradise season 2 and dated on and off before getting engaged, are soaking up the honeymoon phase of their relationship. \u201cI\u2019m, like, the happiest ever. I\u2019m just so concerned, like, when is life gonna turn around?\u201d she joked. \u201cLike, it\u2019s been so good \u2026 Jared\u2019s always like, \u2018You know, it\u2019s not ever this good.\u2019 Like, this is crazy good. Since we\u2019ve been dating in March, we haven\u2019t had any sort of fight yet.\u201d\n\nIaconetti, who plans on moving in soon with The Bachelorette alum, also raved about her Neil Lane sparkler. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect! It\u2019s exactly what I always imagined on my finger,\u201d she gushed. \u201cJared and my sister [Lauren Iaconetti] kind of worked together on putting it together.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-want-a-tv-wedding/", "title": "Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon Want a TV Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Ashley Iaconetti opened up about her engagement to Jared Haibon on the Monday, June 25, episode of her \u2018Almost Famous\u2019 podcast and revealed that she\u2019s open to tying the knot on TV \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ashley I. and Jared Will Have a TV Wedding Under This Condition", "description": "Ashley Iaconetti opened up about her engagement to Jared Haibon on the Monday, June 25, episode of her \u2018Almost Famous\u2019 podcast and revealed that she\u2019s open to tying the knot on TV \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ashley-iaconetti-and-jared-haibon-want-a-tv-wedding/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-12-13T17:16:49+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-26T18:13:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-13T17:16:49+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ashley Iaconetti opened up about her engagement to Jared Haibon on the Monday, June 25, episode of her \u2018Almost Famous\u2019 podcast and revealed that she\u2019s open to tying the knot on TV \u2014 get the details", "title": "Ashley I. and Jared Will Have a TV Wedding Under This Condition", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ashley-Iaconetti-Jared-Haibon-engagement.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530036784.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
