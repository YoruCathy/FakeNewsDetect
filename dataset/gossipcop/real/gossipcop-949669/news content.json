It followed the personal and professional lives of her and friends Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port.

During its production, she also attended the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising and worked for Teen Vogue and Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. Conrad left The Hills after five seasons, and was replaced by former Laguna Beach co-star Kristin Cavallari in May 2009.

It was difficult to be taken seriously, but I think the fact that I went to school to study fashion and worked in the industry helped me. I think it's a good thing to feel like you have to prove something, because you're always going to have to work a little bit harder. \u2013 Conrad discussing her efforts in attaining credibility within the fashion industry.[50]\n\nSince appearing on Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, Conrad has been recognized as being among the first individuals to benefit from the popularity of reality television in the early to mid-2000s. In 2009, Thomas Rogers from Salon described her as \"one of the dullest major characters in reality television history\", but opined that her normalcy compared to her co-stars on The Hills made her \"vaguely likable\".[70] An editor from People stated that Conrad \"became a full-blown TV phenom\" during its third season, which notably introduced the conflict with Montag and Pratt, in addition to controversy regarding scripting allegations.[7]\n\nIn 2013, Misty White Sidell from The Daily Beast noted that Conrad established a following based on her respectability instead of \"bitch-slaps and drunken sex-capades\", further commenting that her more relatable image made her an \"anomaly\" among television personalities.[71] Conrad herself commented that The Hills was intended to be an \"aspirational\" program despite being \"laced with scandal and catfights\", stating that the storyline differed from the \"shock value\" emphasized in recent programming.[72] Conrad has additionally been recognized for originating several now-famous quotes on The Hills, including \"He's a sucky person!\" when criticizing Spencer Pratt during the second season, and \"You know what you did!\" when arguing with Heidi Montag over her alleged involvement with sex tape rumors involving herself in the third season.[73]\n\nConrad has been featured on the covers of several magazine's best-selling issues, including those of People StyleWatch and Cosmopolitan.[74] She appeared on the May 2012 issue of Glamour, which sold approximately 500,000 copies and became the magazine's strongest-selling issue of the year,[75] and was featured on the covers of the second highest-selling issues of Lucky and Marie Claire in 2013.[76] Lauren Sherman from Fashionista credited Conrad's success to \"her knack for entrepreneurship, her easy style, and her friendliness\".[74] Jim Higgins from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel complimented her pursuit of several different career endeavors, and compared her to a \"young Martha Stewart\".[77] However, in August 2012, Conrad was criticized for destroying a collection of A Series of Unfortunate Events novels for a crafting tutorial posted to YouTube.[78]\n\nDuring its production, Conrad was the highest-paid cast member on The Hills, earning an annual salary of $2.5 million.[79] In 2008, her endeavors earned her an additional $1.5 million.[80] In 2010, Conrad was named the second highest-paid reality television personality, ranking behind Kim Kardashian.[81] Conrad is a registered member of the Republican Party.[82] She has stated that she has \"done several things to ... encourage people to vote\", but respects the private ballot and \"[doesn't] want to ever influence someone's vote or have [her] vote change someone's opinion of [her]\".[83][84] Conrad collaborated with Seventeen magazine to film a public service announcement for Declare Yourself, a campaign which encouraged young adults to register themselves to vote during the 2008 presidential election.[85] She has additionally expressed her support for same-sex marriage, and on one occasion left a Mexican restaurant after learning of its disapproval of marriage equality.[86]\n\nIn 2019, MTV will screen a revival of The Hills, calling it The Hills: New Beginnings and Conrad's old co-stars Heidi Montag, Spencer Pratt, Stephanie Pratt, Audrina Partridge, Justin Bobby Brescia, Brody Jenner, Jason Wahler and Whitney Port are set to return to the revival series.
