The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman\u2019s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.\n\nFor his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The chorus? \u201cEverything is better on TV\u201d\u2014including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, \u201ctreason.\u201d Once he finally took the stage\u2014along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids\u2014Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn\u2019t take long to get to the Trump jokes: \u201cIf he had won an Emmy,\u201d Colbert quipped, \u201cI bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he\u2019s just Walter, much whiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike the presidency,\u201d Colbert added, \u201cEmmys go to the winner of the popular vote.\u201d\n\nStill, Colbert couldn\u2019t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.\n\nAlthough he stayed mostly on message during his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live and avoided dinging the president, Spicer did appear on stage Sunday night behind a lectern to comment on the TV Academy gala\u2019s crowd size: \u201cThis is the biggest audience to witness an Emmys, period,\u201d Spicer said with a straight face. \u201cBoth in person and around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cthat really soothes my fragile ego. Give it up for Melissa McCarthy, everybody.\u201d\n\nIn the room, there was an abundance of shock and a bit of confusion, as some celebrities tried to figure out if the man on stage was the real Spicer. Some seemed unsure if they should laugh.\n\nWill the president respond? We\u2019ll keep our eyes on his Twitter account while we\u2019re not frantically analyzing tonight\u2019s wins and snubs\u2014although we have a feeling whatever response Trump has, it likely won\u2019t come before two in the morning.\n\nAdditional reporting by Josh Duboff and Rebecca Keegan.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf15374dfb6d07561c428c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/giphy%252520(18).gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf1ae73b566a35afc25796/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/emmys-2017-all-the-looks-ss30.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf124cffcf3b03e5e9ee36/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sean-spicer-emmys.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf011a061bf115cb16dfaa/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Jane-Fonda-Emmys-2017.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf0c986e41e838c77e5ad5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Nicole-Kidman-Emmys-2017.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59baadcbf8f007097119cf00/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Glenn-Weiss-Ricky-Kirshner-Interview.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59beaf05a782477884dc697f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/32_SUSAN-SARANDON_0016_B.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf09f63b566a35afc2578b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-Rita-Moreno-RuPaul.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf124cffcf3b03e5e9ee36/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sean-spicer-emmys.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle", "Rebecca Keega", "Julie Mille", "Josh Dubof", "Hilary Weave"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-stephen-colbert-monologue", "title": "Colbert Found a Secret Weapon to Irk Trump at the Emmys: Sean Spicer", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The late-night comedian welcomed the erstwhile White House press secretary to the stage to comment on the crowd size.", "id": "59bc3db0be61ae21c04dc2cb", "keywords": "emmys,emmys 2017,stephen colbert,monologue,sean spicer", "news_keywords": "emmys,emmys 2017,stephen colbert,monologue,sean spicer", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59bc3db0be61ae21c04dc2cb", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The late-night comedian welcomed the erstwhile White House press secretary to the stage to comment on the crowd size.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf124cffcf3b03e5e9ee36/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/sean-spicer-emmys.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf124cffcf3b03e5e9ee36/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/sean-spicer-emmys.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The late-night comedian welcomed the erstwhile White House press secretary to the stage to comment on the crowd size.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf124cffcf3b03e5e9ee36/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sean-spicer-emmys.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Colbert Found a Secret Weapon to Irk Trump at the Emmys: Sean Spicer", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-stephen-colbert-monologue"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The late-night comedian welcomed the erstwhile White House press secretary to the stage to comment on the crowd size.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf124cffcf3b03e5e9ee36/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sean-spicer-emmys.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Colbert Found a Secret Weapon to Irk Trump at the Emmys: Sean Spicer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
