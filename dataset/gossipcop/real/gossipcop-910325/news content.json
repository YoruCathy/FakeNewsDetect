Mr. Walk, who worked with artists including Lorde, the Weeknd and Ariana Grande, and who also appeared as a judge on Fox\u2019s singing competition show \u201cThe Four,\u201d did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccused in January of persistent harassment and inappropriate touching by at least six women who had worked with him, Mr. Walk denied the charges at the time. \u201cI did not do these things and this is not who I am,\u201d he told Rolling Stone last month. \u201cI support the national discussion taking place right now because I believe fully in the importance in treating everyone with respect and dignity at all times.\u201d He retained the lawyer Patricia Glaser, who is also representing Harvey Weinstein, to address the claims.\n\nMr. Walk had been known as one of music\u2019s most effective promotion executives. He represents perhaps the highest-profile employee in the industry to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement, which has been met by large swaths of silence on the part of both artists and music\u2019s rank-and-file.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/charlie-walk-sexual-harassment-republic-records.html", "title": "Charlie Walk, Record Executive Accused of Harassment, Is Out at Republic", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-03-29T16:03:57.000Z", "modified": "2018-03-30T12:48:02.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-coscarelli", "tag": "Walk, Charlie", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005824797, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/0fd1d22d-4f73-5d3c-b0e7-34fdf276ab3a", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/17e3b44a288c4baebe659a7a605a8fc0", "description": "Mr. Walk, who has worked with Ariana Grande and Lorde, represents perhaps the most high-profile music industry employee to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Joe Coscarelli", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Sexual harassment,MeToo Movement,Appointments and Executive Changes,Pop Rock Music,Universal Music Group,Charlie Walk", "pdate": 20180329, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/charlie-walk-sexual-harassment-republic-records.html", "type": "article", "title": "Charlie Walk, Record Executive Accused of Harassment, Is Out at Republic", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Charlie Walk, the president of the Republic Group, and the company \u201chave mutually agreed to part ways\u201d following an investigation into allegations of harassment."}, "description": "Mr. Walk, who has worked with Ariana Grande and Lorde, represents perhaps the most high-profile music industry employee to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/charlie-walk-sexual-harassment-republic-records.html", "title": "Charlie Walk, Record Executive Accused of Harassment, Is Out at Republic", "description": "Mr. Walk, who has worked with Ariana Grande and Lorde, represents perhaps the most high-profile music industry employee to lose his job amid the #MeToo movement.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/30/arts/30walk/30walk-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Charlie Walk, the president of the Republic Group, and the company \u201chave mutually agreed to part ways\u201d following an investigation into allegations of harassment."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/0fd1d22d-4f73-5d3c-b0e7-34fdf276ab3a"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "music", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/charlie-walk-sexual-harassment-republic-records.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/0fd1d22d-4f73-5d3c-b0e7-34fdf276ab3a", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/charlie-walk-sexual-harassment-republic-records.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/charlie-walk-sexual-harassment-republic-records.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522252800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
