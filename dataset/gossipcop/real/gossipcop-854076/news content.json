He spearheaded the project because of his personal connection to Sister Catherine Cesnik, a nun who was found murdered in January of 1970 and who serves as the centerpiece of the true crime series.\n\n\u201cMy access point was a personal connection: My aunt went to Archbishop Keough High School and was Sister Cathy\u2019s student,\u201d White told TheWrap. His aunt was also friends with Jean Wehner, one of multiple people in the documentary who say they were sexually abused by Father Joseph Maskell in the Baltimore, Maryland area.\n\nThe series delves deeply into sexual abuse allegations and a lawsuit against Father Maskell brought by \u201cJane Doe,\u201d now identified as Wehner, and \u201cJane Roe,\u201d since identified as Teresa Lancaster. Throughout the series, the devastation experienced by survivors is laid bare, as is their strength in confronting unthinkable childhood horrors.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Keepers' Filmmaker: Father Maskell Abused 40 Victims, Not Just the 6 in Netflix's Doc\n\n\u201cI hope this documentary can be a tool of healing, but it\u2019s about to be very triggering for the survivors,\u201d said White.\n\nIn the end, \u201cThe Keepers\u201d doesn\u2019t solve its biggest question: Who killed Sister Cathy? And although the seven-episode series explores \u2014 through its lead investigators Gemma Hoskins and Abbie Schaub \u2014 three main suspects, including Father Maskell, who died in 2001, White does have his own theory on who abducted and murdered the nun. But he\u2019s only willing to share a slice of it.\n\nFind out what it is in TheWrap\u2019s Q&A with White below.\n\nTheWrap: What was the process of getting this documentary together?\n\nWhite: My access point was personal connection: My aunt went to Archbishop Keough High School and was Sister Cathy\u2019s student, so she always had a personal connection. I never grew up knowing her teacher had been murdered. A few years ago my aunt connected me to Jean, her friend. She didn\u2019t know Jean had gone through that abuse. Jean is the reason I made \u201cThe Keepers\u201d \u2014 I had a five-hour conversation with Jean and I left saying, \u201cI need to do something with this woman\u2019s story.\u201d She, to me, was one of the most compelling people I\u2019ve ever met.\n\nWhen she decided that this would be a healthy step, we went ahead with it.\n\nWe did it slowly \u2014 it took three years. She was comfortable with that \u2014 the long length of production actually helped her comfort level. Obviously, the story grew and grew and one of our first access points was Gemma. We met Gemma in a Home Depot parking lot, a few blocks from where Sister Cathy\u2019s car was found. I was so drawn to Gemma\u2026 right when I met her, she had such a unique way. She\u2019s so driven to find out what happened to her teacher. Gemma connected us with so many people in \u2018The Keepers.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'The Keepers': What's Behind the Name of the Netflix Documentary Series?\n\nIf you were part of the Facebook group, people got to know us very well. We would go to Baltimore every two months for the last three years, so people started to feel comfortable around us \u2026 Survivors would reach out to us on Facebook.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the title?\n\nIn one scene, Jean told her friends, \u201cwe are the keepers of the secrets,\u201d and I knew that had to be the title. Obviously, it has other meanings \u2014 one other meaning was the idea of gatekeepers. The theory that people in position of authority and power are able to decide what we as the populous know or don\u2019t know or whether survivors of abuse are validated or not\u2026 I also liked the institutional meaning of \u201cThe Keepers.\u201d\n\nWhen you say survivors, how many are there?\n\nThere are six survivors showcased in the documentary but we had many conversations with other survivors who weren\u2019t featured in the documentary.\n\nOur focus was definitely on the survivors of Keough, but many Maskell victims came after Keough, and it\u2019s horrifying. We weren\u2019t actively looking at what he was doing after Keough but obviously, Charles [another abuse victim] played a narrative in the abuse.\n\nI would say there were at least 40 survivors\u2026 That\u2019s just 40 from who Gemma and Abbie found, and most of them are no longer alive. But through Gemma and Abbie, we talked to about 25 for the documentary.\n\nDid you face any hurdles? Were you scared of taking on the Catholic Church?\n\nWell, it\u2019s funny how you asked that because I never saw it as taking on the Catholic Church. I was raised Catholic and I had a very positive experience. I had fond memories of the church, but for this, they were so non-participatory with it.\n\nJust Friday, the Archdiocese of Baltimore retweeted something in regards to documentary, and I was appalled that the Archdiocese was retweeting something like that and how insulting that must be for our survivors. And they just paid settlements to the survivors \u2014 it\u2019s not that they deny it happened. At this point, I\u2019m so disenchanted with my church \u2014 it\u2019s really disappointing. I thought they would have been more participatory.\n\nThe biggest hurdle was that the case was so old, that it was 45 years old. So much of the investigation of the murder disappeared and we ran into that time and time again. We were trying to reconstruct the truth when it had been deliberately hidden or kept secret. The only way to do that was to find people who were involved. I have deep gratitude for the detectives who sat down with me and had complete transparency in opening their crime scene photos and investigation. They made the right decision in participating \u2014 it wasn\u2019t always easy to persuade someone to take part.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Keepers': Sister Cathy's Medical Examiner Also Worked on JFK, JonBenet Ramsey Cases\n\nWhat do you think happened to Sister Cathy?\n\nEveryone has a different theory. Mine is different than Gemma\u2019s theory, but we were all looking at the various versions of the \u201ctruth\u201d and deciding what we believed was true. What we tried to do in the editing was present all various narratives. I won\u2019t tell you my theory, but I will say: I believe Jean, and I have corroborated Jean, that this is a woman who was telling the truth from the beginning. That means Father Maskell was somehow involved. I have very little doubt at the finish line.\n\nSome are calling it \u201cThe Next \u2018Making a Murderer'\u201d \u2014 what is your response to that?\n\n\u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d was such a phenomenon and if we have a fraction the popularity of \u201cMaking a Murderer,\u201d I will be a happy filmmaker. But it\u2019s not about popularity, it\u2019s about the impact \u2026 My hope is that we can have a fraction of that popularity that leads to justice. The more people watch it, the more information will come out of the woodwork.\n\nWere you impressed with Gemma\u2019s investigative skills given that she has no police or journalism experience?\n\nWhat\u2019s really funny about Gemma, she\u2019s taking criminology classes right now which I find hilarious. She always wanted to become a Personal Investigator. I told her, \u201ceveryone is going to recognize you and you\u2019re going to be the worst PI in the world!\u201d Look, my mom and my aunt are women in Baltimore, so Gemma in a way is my mom and my aunt \u2014 she\u2019s so much like them, and I hope \u201cThe Keepers\u201d doesn\u2019t get relegated to another crime story in Baltimore. I\u2019m also not a journalist or a detective but I borrowed a lot of skills from Gemma\u2019s skillset over the years.\n\nHow did the women keep their faith and how were they able to move on and have kids after what they went through?\n\nI mean, it\u2019s a survivor story at its core. Jean is the most incredible survivor that I\u2019ve ever witnessed. She doesn\u2019t recognize that of course \u2014 she lives small. But people from the outside that intercept with her realize the power of the survivor story in her. I don\u2019t know how they do it \u2014 I don\u2019t think she knows. I think the really special part of \u201cThe Keepers\u201d is that people are speaking up for a lot of people who didn\u2019t survive it. People walked to suicide, people are still hiding and keeping their secrets, and I think all of the survivors recognize the power in numbers.", "images":
