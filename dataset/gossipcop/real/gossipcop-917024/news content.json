Nobody really did.\u201d\n\nScott and Sofia Getty Images\n\nThe source added that he \u201ccan't deal with someone else having Kourtney. He can't control his emotions about it and lets it all out.\n\n\u201cKourtney never knows when he is going to fly off the handle or go nuts about something.\u201d\n\nBut sadly for Scott, Kourtney and Younes\u2019 relationship appears to be going from strength to strength. A source previously told People magazine: \u201cIt's definitely serious. No one thought their relationship would last this long, but Kourtney is very happy.\n\n\u201cYounes has met her kids. Kourtney\u2019s family really likes him. He is the opposite of Scott. He doesn\u2019t party, isn\u2019t flashy and really treats Kourtney with a lot of respect. It\u2019s obvious that he really cares about Kourtney.\u201d\n\nKourtney and Scott were together for nine years and have three children together: sons Mason, eight, Reign, three, and daughter Penelope, five.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0174xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sites/cosmopolitan/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0174xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Lewis", "News Editor", "Anna Lewis Is The News Editor At Delish Uk", "Which Means She S Always Either Writing About Food", "Cooking Food Or Eating Food."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a18936988/scott-disick-kourtney-kardashian-boyfriend-younes-bendjima-insanely-jealous/", "title": "Scott Disick is still \u201cinsanely jealous\u201d of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend Younes Bendjima", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Scott Disick is still \u201cinsanely jealous\" of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend Younes Bendjima", "description": "Even though he\u2019s happy with his girlfriend Sofia Richie", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a18936988/scott-disick-kourtney-kardashian-boyfriend-younes-bendjima-insanely-jealous/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0174xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 211620818858710}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/cosmopolitanuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-01 12:13:35", "published_time": "2018-03-01 12:13:00", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CosmopolitanUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0174xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Scott Disick is still \u201cinsanely jealous\u201d of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend Younes Bendjima", "description": "Despite being \u201chappy\u201d in his new relationship with Sofia, Scott is still jealous of Younes, who has been with Kourtney for over a year", "keywords": "scott disick, kourtney kardashian, sofia richie, younes bendjima, scott disick kourtney kardashian, scott disick sofia richie kourtney kardashian younes bendjima, scott disick kourtney kardashian, sofia richie younes bendjima", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-01T12:13:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.334xh;0,0.0174xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/scott-disick-1519905960.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Scott Disick is still \u201cinsanely jealous\" of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend Younes Bendjima", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519877580.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
