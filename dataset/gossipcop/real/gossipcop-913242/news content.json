Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama shows her sitting with one hand under her chin and the other draped across her lap, while wearing a long flowing dress decorated with geometric shapes.\n\nObama, the first African-American U.S. president, complimented Sherald for her portrait of Michelle.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace and beauty and intelligence and charm and hotness of the woman that I love,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHe quipped that Wiley, who painted his portrait, was at a disadvantage because his subject was \u201cless becoming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to negotiate less gray hair and Kehinde\u2019s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what I asked,\u201d Obama said in tongue-in-cheek fashion. \u201cI tried to negotiate smaller ears - struck out on that as well.\u201d\n\nNew York Times art critic Holland Cotter said while he was impressed by Barack Obama\u2019s unusual depiction, he was disappointed that the focus of Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait appeared to be her dress.\n\n\u201cI was anticipating \u2014 hoping for \u2014 a bolder, more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be,\u201d Cotter said in his review.\n\nMost Twitter posts described the portraits as stunning, although a few criticized them as poorly executed.\n\n\u201cBehold the beauty of Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s official portrait,\u201d tweeted @newyorknewart.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nMichelle Obama said she hoped the portrait would have an impact on young girls of color in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cThey will look up and they will see an image of someone who looks like them, hanging on the wall of this great American institution,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the kind of impact that will have on their lives, because I was one of those girls.\u201d\n\nThe Portrait Gallery\u2019s tradition of commissioning presidential portraits began with President George H.W. Bush. Other portraits were acquired as gifts, bought at auctions or through other means.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources_v2/react/CKB-22938-b44/3aae9fd5da3557fba61d6444cb943643.png", "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180212&t=2&i=1230793284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE1B1KK", "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180212&t=2&i=1230793284&r=LYNXMPEE1B1KK"], "top_img": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180212&t=2&i=1230793284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE1B1KK", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-portrait-idUSKBN1FW250", "title": "Obama unveils official portraits, jokes about wife's 'hotness'", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "DCSext.ChannelList": "everythingNews;domesticNews;USWire_EL", "description": "Former U.S. President Barack Obama joked about his ears and gray hair and praised his wife Michelle Obama's \"hotness\" at the unveiling of the couple's official portraits at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery on Monday.", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "keywords": "US,USA,OBAMA,PORTRAIT,Art,Living / Lifestyle,Picture available,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Government / Politics,Video,General News,US Government News,Pictures,United States", "news_keywords": "US;USA;OBAMA;PORTRAIT;Art;Living / Lifestyle;Picture available;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;Government / Politics;Video;General News;US Government News;Pictures;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "Mon Feb 12 21:03:38 UTC 2018", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2018-02-12T21:03:38+0000", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Editorial", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-portrait-idUSKBN1FW250", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Obama unveils official portraits, jokes about wife's 'hotness'", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "U.S.", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,USA,OBAMA,PORTRAIT,Art,Living / Lifestyle,Picture available,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Government / Politics,Video,General News,US Government News,Pictures,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-USA-OBAMA-PORTRAIT", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Slideshow-Video", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Obama unveils official portraits, jokes about wife's 'hotness'", "sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-12T21:03:38+0000", "sailthru.title": "Obama unveils official portraits, jokes about wife's 'hotness'", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "U.S.", "title": "Obama unveils official portraits, jokes about wife's 'hotness'", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obama-portrait-idUSKBN1FW250", "type": "article", "description": "Former U.S. President Barack Obama joked about his ears and gray hair and praised his wife Michelle Obama's \"hotness\" at the unveiling of the couple's official portraits at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery on Monday.", "image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180212&t=2&i=1230793284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE1B1KK", "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-12T21:03:38+0000", "modified_time": "2018-02-12T21:03:38+0000", "section": "World", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "tag": "US,USA,OBAMA,PORTRAIT,Art,Living / Lifestyle,Picture available,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Government / Politics,Video,General News,US Government News,Pictures,United States"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama unveils official portraits, jokes about wife's 'hotness'", "description": "Former U.S. President Barack Obama joked about his ears and gray hair and praised his wife Michelle Obama's \"hotness\" at the unveiling of the couple's official portraits at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery on Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180212&t=2&i=1230793284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE1B1KK", "src": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180212&t=2&i=1230793284&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEE1B1KK"}}, "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "World -
