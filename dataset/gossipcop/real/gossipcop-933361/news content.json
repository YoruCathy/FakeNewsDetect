And, it truly was a bit of a meeting of the Bravolebs when The Real Housewives of New Jersey pal came face to face with former Househusbands Terry and Dr. Paul Nassif.\n\n\"Well, I knew a little bit about her and I knew that she just had that really terrible thing happen to her. That's not necessarily a good place to be in when you're gonna have difficult, revisional, high-risk plastic surgery,\" Terry told The Daily Dish, referring to a tragic incident involving her car that left two people dead last year. \"So, I was really concerned.\"\n\nBut, Terry saw a different side of the Garden State boutique owner. \"You know what's funny? I know her what her reputation was on Housewives being very argumentative [but] when they need help, and they have high-risk plastic surgery \u2014 she was so normal, so cool, and just wanted to be fixed. She was funny. I liked her. She actually turned out to be a patient I really liked [and] was a lot of fun to work with.\"\n\nHowever, it wasn't all smooth sailing, Terry noted: \"Very difficult problem. We had a bit of a complication that was hard to deal with, but she was very cool.\"\n\nCheck out an exclusive preview of her appearance, below.", "images":
