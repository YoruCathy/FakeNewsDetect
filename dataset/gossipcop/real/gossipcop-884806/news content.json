Portia Scott Griffith DECLARES SQUAD FEUD WITH MMN BOARDROOM BITCH.\"\n\nNews anchor Portia Scott-Griffith (Richie) is then shown in the all-leather black ensemble that Swift sported in the original music video. \"You better wash dish, bish,\" she sings. \"I've had enough of your ish, bish / I'm a famous and rich bish / So you better watch dish, bish.\"\n\nShe then literally washes a dish while joined by other members of her news team \"squad\" rapping along. At the end of the clip, it's revealed that St. Tropez has been watching the same clip at her computer. \"Not today,\" she says.\n\nThe full episode will air Thursday, Oct. 5, on NBC beginning at 9:30 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWatch the clip below.\n\nThis story first appeared on Billboard.com.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/10/great_news_-_next_wash_dish_bish_sneak_peek.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/great_news_-_next_wash_dish_bish_sneak_peek.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/great_news_-_next_wash_dish_bish_sneak_peek.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Armstrong", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7988852/nicole-richie-tina-fey-spoof-taylor-swift-bad-blood-video-great-news", "title": "Nicole Richie and Tina Fey Spoof Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" Video on 'Great News'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"You better wash dish, bish,\" Richie's character sings. \"I've had enough of your ish, bish / I'm a famous and rich bish / So you better watch dish, bish.\"", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/television/7988852/nicole-richie-tina-fey-spoof-taylor-swift-bad-blood-video-great-news", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Nicole Richie and Tina Fey Spoof Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" Video on 'Great News'", "description": "\"You better wash dish, bish,\" Richie's character sings. \"I've had enough of your ish, bish / I'm a famous and rich bish / So you better watch dish, bish.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/10/great_news_-_next_wash_dish_bish_sneak_peek.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Nicole Richie and Tina Fey Spoof Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" Video on 'Great News'", "description": "\"You better wash dish, bish,\" Richie's character sings. \"I've had enough of your ish, bish / I'm a famous and rich bish / So you better watch dish, bish.\"", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/nicole-richie-tina-fey-spoof-taylor-swifts-bad-blood-video-great-news-1045620", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/10/great_news_-_next_wash_dish_bish_sneak_peek.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Nicole Richie and Tina Fey Spoof Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" Video on 'Great News'", "sailthru.description": "\"You better wash dish, bish,\" Richie's character sings. \"I've had enough of your ish, bish / I'm a famous and rich bish / So you better watch dish, bish.\"", "sailthru.author": "Megan Armstrong, Billboard", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-04 08:17:38", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Music,Nicole Richie,Taylor Swift,Tina Fey,Great News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507076258.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
