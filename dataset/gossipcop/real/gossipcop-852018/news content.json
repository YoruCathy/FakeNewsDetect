That series, of course, is American Idol, which will move from Fox to ABC for the 2017-18 season.\n\nRather than suggest that she was comfortable with the network switch, however, Walden was refreshingly candid about how challenging it is to see a show that was so meaningful to Fox for 15 years move to a rival. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a tough one for us,\u201d she began. \u201cIt feels bad knowing it\u2019s coming back on another network.\u201d\n\nWalden was similarly open about her frustration with Idol producers Fremantle, with whom Fox had been having conversations since the music competition wrapped in spring 2016. At issue: Fox had invested a tremendous amount of equity and resources promoting and celebrating the show\u2019s final season. \"We spent $25 million sending the message that it was the farewell season and fans responded,\" she said. And though it did see a ratings uptick, Walden and her team felt it would be deceitful, even, as she put it, \u201cextremely fraudulent,\u201d to turn around and immediately go back into production with the show. Fremantle felt differently.\n\nIn Walden\u2019s mind, waiting until 2020 would be a more respectful amount of time to have Idol sit on the bench. \u201cWe did not see the fan excitement and enthusiasm for the show to come back [sooner],\u201d she added, suggesting Fremantle had a different set of facts. The latter, for whom Idol is a significant revenue generator, was driven from the day it wrapped to see it return as soon as possible.\n\nBut timing was not the only point of contention between Fox and the show\u2019s producers. Among the others: the series\u2019 price tag, which had ballooned in later seasons thanks to judge and host salaries in the eight-figure range. Those coupled with declining ratings \u2014 the show was down nearly 70 percent in its last half-decade on the air \u2014 prompted Fox to ask Fremantle to make cuts before the series had wrapped on Fox.\n\n\u201cThe network was losing an enormous amount of money and we asked them to make trims,\u201d explained Walden, adding that Fremantle had little interest in such trims, which would entail tweaking the show or the panel of star wattage that took years to get just right. \u201cFremantle doesn\u2019t want to change that show and perhaps they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she added, lingering frustration apparent in her voice. Despite it all, Fox continued to make offers for the show, if for no other reason than Walden and her team didn\u2019t want to see a show so closely connected with their brand land elsewhere.\n\nEarlier on in what she called a \u201cchallenging process,\u201d Walden believed it was NBC that Fox would be competing against, and she acknowledged that at least that made sense to her. NBC has both Simon Cowell, whom she believed the franchise missed in its later iterations, and Jennifer Lopez based at its network, which would be helpful in a reboot. Alas, conversations with NBC broke down and Fremantle had little interest in Fox\u2019s offer, so the show that famously catapulted Walden's network to No. 1 will now air on ABC.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2016/03/gettyimages-514707602.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/01/greg_berlanti_sharon_horgan_alex_kurtzman_and_dwayne_johnson_-_getty_-_h_2020.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/03/mrs._america_-_publicity_still_1-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/gettyimages-514707602.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/gettyimages-514707602.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lacey Rose", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-tv-heads-losing-american-idol-abc-s-a-tough-one-1003652", "title": "Fox TV Heads on Losing 'American Idol' to ABC: \"It\u2019s Obviously a Tough One\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Dana Walden and Gary Newman also addressed the fates of \"Scream Queens,\" \"24\" and \"Prison Break\".", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-tv-heads-losing-american-idol-abc-s-a-tough-one-1003652", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Fox TV Heads on Losing 'American Idol' to ABC: \"It\u2019s Obviously a Tough One\"", "description": "Dana Walden and Gary Newman also addressed the fates of \"Scream Queens,\" \"24\" and \"Prison Break\".", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2016/03/gettyimages-514707602.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Fox TV Heads on Losing 'American Idol' to ABC: \"It\u2019s Obviously a Tough One\"", "description": "Dana Walden and Gary Newman also addressed the fates of \"Scream Queens,\" \"24\" and \"Prison Break\".", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/fox-tv-heads-losing-american-idol-abc-s-a-tough-one-1003652", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/gettyimages-514707602.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Fox TV Heads on Losing 'American Idol' to ABC: \"It\u2019s Obviously a Tough One\"", "sailthru.description": "Dana Walden and Gary Newman also addressed the fates of \"Scream Queens,\" \"24\" and \"Prison Break\".", "sailthru.author": "Lacey Rose", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-15 06:50:45", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, Dana Walden, Gary Newman, Upfronts, American Idol"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494802245.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
