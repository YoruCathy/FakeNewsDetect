My kidneys were shutting down. My mentality was just to keep going,\u201d she told TODAY\u2019s Savannah Guthrie in an exclusive NBC News interview.\n\nWeeks away from dialysis, Gomez shared the news with Ra\u00edsa, her dear friend and roommate.\n\n\"One day she came home, and she was emotional. I hadn't asked anything. I knew that she hadn't been feeling well,\u201d Ra\u00edsa told Guthrie. \"She couldn't open a water bottle one day and she chucked it and just started crying.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Gomez revealed she needed a transplant, but that the potential wait to find a donor was extensive.\n\n\u201cAnd she goes, \u2018I don't know what to do. The list is seven-to-10-years long,\u2019\u201d said Ra\u00edsa, an actress on the upcoming Freeform show, \u201cGrown-ish.\u201d \u201cAnd it just vomited out of me. I was like, \u2018Of course I'll get tested.'\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

A process that normally takes months was expedited and completed within a day.\n\nGomez couldn\u2019t believe that her friend would not only volunteer one of her kidneys, but that she turned out to be a match.\n\n\u201cShe lived with me in this interesting time where my kidneys were just done. That was it and I didn't want to ask a single person in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thought of asking somebody to do that was really difficult for me. And she volunteered and did it\u2026 The fact that she was a match, I mean, that's unbelievable.\u201d\n\nRa\u00edsa admitted she did fear how the transplant would affect her own health. She was required to write a will in case she didn't pull through the procedure. And her mother also questioned the decision although \u201cshe loves Selena and so she was torn.\"\n\nRa\u00edsa had her surgery first, followed by Gomez, who remembers waking up from the procedure to see her mom and stepdad. She then asked for Ra\u00edsa.\n\nFrancia Ra\u00edsa and Selena Gomez are still feeling grateful for each other, months after the kidney transplant.\n\n\"I got to see you and tell you I love you,\" Gomez said. \"And then I went back to my room, and I started to attempt to fall asleep.\"\n\nBut complications soon arose. Gomez was quickly returned to the operating room after her new kidney started turning around inside her body.\n\n\u201cI was freaking out. It was a six-hour surgery that they had to do on me, and the normal kidney process is actually two hours,\u201d she said. \u201cApparently one of the arteries had flipped. I'm very thankful that there are people who know what to do in that situation.\"\n\nBoth Gomez and Ra\u00edsa said their faith guided them through their emotional journey, which they kept private until months later when Gomez shared news about her transplant through an Instagram post in September to her 128 million followers.\n\nGomez credits Ra\u00edsa for saving her life.\n\n\"Because she did. That's it. I guess I got to the point where it was really kind of life or death,\u201d she said.\n\nGomez said the surgery has transformed her life.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I got the kidney transplant, my arthritis went away,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cMy lupus \u2014there\u2019s about a 3-5 percent chance it'll ever come back. My blood pressure is better. My energy, my life has been better.\"\n\nThe pair now hope their process will help others experiencing similar journeys.\n\n\u201cI just hope that this inspires people to feel good. To know that there is really good people in the world,\" Gomez said.\n\nOn Tuesday, during the second part of TODAY\u2019s exclusive interview with the two friends, Gomez opens up about her experience with lupus and the faith that she shares with Ra\u00edsa.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_44/1292232/tdy_gomez_pics_4_171030_80b60719f47212d75763b0bacf6e0b5f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/tdy_health_guth_selena_gomez_171030_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_44/1292232/tdy_gomez_pics_4_171030_80b60719f47212d75763b0bacf6e0b5f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/health/selena-gomez-francia-ra-sa-share-story-behind-dramatic-kidney-t118147", "title": "Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa share story behind dramatic kidney transplant", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/health/selena-gomez-francia-ra-sa-share-story-behind-dramatic-kidney-t118147", "title": "Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa share story behind dramatic kidney transplant", "description": "Gomez and her best friend, Francia Raisa, describe how the kidney transplant saved the singer's life in exclusive interview with NBC News.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_44/1292232/tdy_gomez_pics_4_171030_80b60719f47212d75763b0bacf6e0b5f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_44/1292232/tdy_gomez_pics_4_171030_80b60719f47212d75763b0bacf6e0b5f.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_44/1292232/tdy_gomez_pics_4_171030_80b60719f47212d75763b0bacf6e0b5f.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Selena Gomez and Francia Ra\u00edsa share story behind dramatic kidney transplant", "description": "Gomez and her best friend, Francia Raisa, describe how the kidney transplant saved the singer's life in exclusive interview with NBC News.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Gomez and her best friend, Francia Raisa, describe how the kidney transplant saved the singer's life in exclusive interview with NBC News.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_44/1292232/tdy_gomez_pics_4_171030_80b60719f47212d75763b0bacf6e0b5f.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509366240.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
