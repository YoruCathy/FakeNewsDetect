Jackson surprised Elliott by flying out to New York while touring in the UK to be the one to present her with the award.\n\nThe singer noted that Missy has raised the bar for artists in the music industry by being an artist who can do more than just rap. \u201cSome act, some choreograph, some write hit songs, some create whole new sounds, some women are able to make their mark in one of these fields, but there\u2019s only one woman who has made her mark in all these fields.\u201d\n\nIn other words\u2026\n\n\n\nJackson continued on to say that not only has Elliott made her mark on music, \u201cbut she\u2019s done so with boldness and courage.\u201d\n\nShe thanks the rapper for many things. Her legacy, her character, and her friendship included. \u201cI am so grateful for Missy\u2019s beautiful soul. I am grateful for her creativity, her energy, grateful for her soaring inspiration. I\u2019m grateful for how she stood toe-to-toe with the guys, showing them that a woman can do it all, take charge, lead the way, innovate and create without fear. Grateful for how she\u2019s cleared the way, the path, for new generations of young talent to follow. And I am so very grateful for her loyal friendship that has meant more to me than she could ever know.\u201d\n\nThe entire thing had Missy in tears. Get a tissue because her touching tribute will bring a tear to your eye, too.\n\nElliott posted this video on Instagram with the caption: \u201c#IMGRATEFUL @janetjackson that u would fly over from the UK while on tour to present me with the #BlackWomenInMusic @essence Award last night of course I\u2019M A BIG BABY & i COULD\u2019NT STOP CRYING TEARS of HAPPINESS??? our SISTERSHIP has lasted over 17 years!??Your the definition of REALNESS/HUMILITY/CARING/INSPIRING/UPLIFTING/FIERCE/BOLD/RISKTAKING/BLACK STRONG& BEAUTIFUL oh & RICH?Girl u know I had to throw a joke in it??\u200d\u2640\ufe0f?but I LOVE you sis for always being there for me from Day 1??thank u @essence for the love u showed me I am Humbly Grateful??\u201d\n\nAfter Janet gave her speech, Missy Elliott explained that their friendship is more than just music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Janet over a decade\u2014and this is not just someone I do music with,\u201d Elliot said. \u201cI can call Janet any time of night and she will listen. The times that I may have felt like giving up, she\u2019s always given me an encouraging word.\u201d\n\nShe also told the women in the crowd to believe in themselves and in their beauty, \u201cYou gotta believe in yourself. Because there are going to be times that people tell you you can\u2019t do it or you don\u2019t look the part, but I am a walking testimony.\u201d\n\nPreach, Missy.\n\nMissy Elliott talks about how she influenced hip hop as an artist, as well as her personal rise to where she is today.\n\n", "images": ["http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:248168?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=150&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:664088?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:669230?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:669222?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:264450?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:668067?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:264450?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270", "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:668071?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=110&height=110"], "top_img": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:264450?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Wurzburger"], "canonical_link": "http://www.vh1.com/news/345872/janet-jackson-award-missy-elliott/", "title": "Janet Jackson Made Missy Elliott Cry When She Surprised Her With an Award", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "vh1.com"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.vh1.com:345872"}, "og": {"site_name": "VH1 News", "title": "Janet Jackson Made Missy Elliott Cry When She Surprised Her at Essence's Black Women in Music Event", "url": "http://www.vh1.com/news/345872/janet-jackson-award-missy-elliott/", "image": {"identifier": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:264450?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "Janet Jackson surprised her friend Missy Elliott when she showed up to give her Essence's Visionary Award at their Black Women in Music Event."}, "fb": {"app_id": 709094809266522}, "twitter": {"description": "Janet Jackson surprised her friend Missy Elliott when she showed up to give her Essence's Visionary Award at their Black Women in Music Event.", "title": "Janet Jackson Made Missy Elliott Cry When She Surprised Her at Essence's Black Women in Music Event", "image": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv:264450?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "url": "http://www.vh1.com/news/345872/janet-jackson-award-missy-elliott/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Janet Jackson surprised her friend Missy Elliott when she showed up to give her Essence's Visionary Award at their Black Women in Music Event.", "thumbnail": "http://vh1.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:vh1.com/news/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/missyjanet-1516981815-300x278.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.vh1.com", "summary": ""}
