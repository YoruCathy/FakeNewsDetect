Brown has to take his shirt off.\n\nBrown, along with his This Is Us co-stars Mandy Moore and Milo Ventimiglia, stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show ahead of Tuesday\u2019s season premiere. Given that it was the recent Emmy winner\u2019s first time on the show, he got a little hazed.\n\nSince Moore was forced to ride a toy car during her first Ellen appearance and Ventimiglia was forced to take his shirt off during his, why not combine the two for Brown?\n\nPhoto: @TheEllenShow via YouTube More\n\nDeGeneres had the 41-year-old actor, who won an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series earlier this month, ride around set shirtless on a tiny tractor. All we have to say is hubba-hubba.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Sterling K. Brown\u2019s first shirtless moment.\n\nAhead of the 2016 Emmys, the actor showed off a joke award he was given (before his first real Emmy for The People v. O.J. Simpson) for \u201cBest Courtroom Abs.\u201d\n\nPhoto: @sterlingkbrown via Instagram More\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until a few months ago when he really set the internet ablaze, showing off his fit physique with a full-on mirror selfie.\n\nPhoto: @sterlingkbrown via Instagram More\n\nThe actor told People that his impressive six-pack doesn\u2019t come without hard work. \u201cI try to get something in five days a week,\u201d he admitted. \u201cMy work schedule doesn\u2019t always accommodate my workout schedule, but I make do with what time I\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nBrown rotates a few different types of workouts to maintain his toned figure.\n\n\u201cI love basketball because it\u2019s social, and you\u2019re not even thinking about working out \u2014 you\u2019re just playing a game and getting great exercise at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cI also run, swim, bike, lift, do yoga. I just try to do something to sweat at least an hour a day.\u201d\n\nHe also sticks to a healthy diet, most of the time. \u201cI try to drink a lot of water \u2014 it hydrates, curbs appetite, etc.,\u201d he said. \u201c[I eat] carbs at the top of the day, more vegetables than anything else, lean protein, and good fat, like avocado, olive oil, and DHA. However, Sunday brunch, anything goes!\u201d\n\nClearly it\u2019s paying off because he flashed his hot bod \u2014 and Emmy \u2014 recently in the This is Us makeup trailer.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping for more shirtless moments on and off screen as Season 2 of This Is Us premieres on Tuesday on NBC.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/A04lxjTVwV8vUlnFuWbiFg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO2ZpPWZpbGw7dz04NDtoPTg0O2lsPXBsYW5l/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-19/0f61e620-b4f9-11e7-a288-0181d82e80f8_Pic-1-.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1K0O8Wgp4CT4lK1XzaVjHA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ee3244adea6d90abcd22990598888b81", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/i1TwcVVVuJ6D2EEFXvJ4xw--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a7ab478f4b7b353a018855d38fb217f9", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/t_zF7ty1FuOdjNfw2UUFYA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ee3244adea6d90abcd22990598888b81", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ieCvVUV4swAc_CTE5L0_9A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/afaeb7e5eebbe0a1968b0d545c2f64d6"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1K0O8Wgp4CT4lK1XzaVjHA--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ee3244adea6d90abcd22990598888b81", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taryn Ryder", "Writer", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sterling-k-brown-blesses-us-another-shirtless-moment-003116782.html", "title": "Sterling K.
