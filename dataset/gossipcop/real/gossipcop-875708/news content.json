After being majorly on trend for some time, they just stuck around and became a classic staple to own. But every now and then, we want to challenge you to step outside your comfort zone a little bit and try something new. For those looking to do so, or for anyone who avoids skinny jeans in the first place, Bella Hadid's latest look is for you.\n\nThe model was spotted this week in a light-wash Misbhv jacket and similarly washed wide-leg jeans with just a hint of a flare. Opting for a Canadian tuxedo in the first place is stylish in and of itself, but adding in a more fashion-forward denim shape pushes the limits in the best way possible. Plus, Hadid chose to pair her double-denim look with a crop top and Givenchy heeled booties, ensuring her figure didn't get lost in the oversize silhouettes. All in all, she made some very smart choices to help her pull off both trends at once.\n\nScroll on to see and shop the look for yourself!", "images": ["https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/skinny-jean-haters-will-love-this-bella-hadid-look-1982465-1479453443.700x0c.jpg", "https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/skinny-jean-haters-will-love-this-bella-hadid-look-1982464-1479453443.700x0c.jpg", "https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/skinny-jean-haters-will-love-this-bella-hadid-look-1982467-1479453443.700x0c.jpg", "https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/bella-hadid-canadian-tuxedo-wide-leg-jeans-2016-208856-1479453089-fb.700x0c.jpg", "https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/skinny-jean-haters-will-love-this-bella-hadid-look-1982466-1479453443.700x0c.jpg", "https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/-1982463-1479453156.700x0c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/208856/bella-hadid-canadian-tuxedo-wide-leg-jeans-2016-208856-1479453089-fb.700x0c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Renee Swanberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.whowhatwear.com/bella-hadid-canadian-tuxedo-wide-leg-jeans-2016", "title": "Skinny-Jean Haters Will Love This Bella Hadid Look", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "5AIDNkYwmV1uPz4sU2uxiymOziyDCzknNWbWtFnPdr4", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Skinny-Jean Haters Will Love This Bella Hadid Look", "description": "Bella Hadid definitely has a sense of style totally different than her sister's.
