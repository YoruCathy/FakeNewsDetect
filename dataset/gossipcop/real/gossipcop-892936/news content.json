Upon seeing the cover photo, Nyong'o spoke out against the publication in a lengthy caption.\n\n\"As I have made clear so often in the past with every fiber of my being, I embrace my natural heritage and despite having grown up thinking light skin and straight, silky hair were the standards of beauty, I now know that my dark skin and kinky, coily hair are beautiful too,\" she began. \"Being featured on the cover of a magazine fulfills me as it is an opportunity to show other dark, kinky-haired people, and particularly our children, that they are beautiful just the way they are.\"\n\nWATCH: Lupita Nyong'o Breaks Down in Tears During Intense Promo for JAY-Z's '4:44' Album\n\nThe 34-year-old actress goes on to slam Grazia for photoshopping the image without asking her permission. \"I am disappointed that @graziauk invited me to be on their cover and then edited out and smoothed my hair to fit their notion of what beautiful hair looks like,\" she continued. \"Had I been consulted, I would have explained that I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"\n\nNyong'o concluded her post by noting that there is \"still a very long way to go to combat the unconscious prejudice against black women's complexion, hair style and texture.\"\n\nMORE: Lupita Nyong'o Says Harvey Weinstein Threatened Her Career After She Refused His Advances\n\nThe Star Wars: The Force Awakens star has made it her mission to change how the world views beauty.\n\n\"European standards of beauty are something that plague the entire world -- the idea that darker skin is not beautiful, that light skin is the key to success and love,\" she told Glamour magazine in 2014. \"I remember seeing a commercial where a woman goes for an interview and doesn't get the job. Then she puts a cream on her face to lighten her skin, and she gets the job! This is the message: that dark skin is unacceptable.\"\n\nShe added, \"Beautiful people have many advantages, but so do friendly people. I think beauty is an expression of love.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Lupita Nyong'o Says She's 'Secretly a Rapper' This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
