It\u2019s where they can let their hair down and join in the vigorous Scottish dancing, the perfect setting for the newest member of the family, dance-mad Diana, settling into her role of Princess of Wales. It was a night no one who was there has ever forgotten.\n\nFor Darren McGrady, then a young sous chef in the royal kitchen, it was his first Ghillies Ball and he recalls, \u2018Everyone was doing eightsome reels and the royals formed a circle \u2013 the Queen, Andrew, Edward, Diana and Charles.\n\nCharles and Diana liked this picture of five-year-old William and Harry, almost three, so much they used it for their 1987 Christmas card\n\nDiana was screaming as she and Charles were spinning around as fast as they could go. He was red-faced with a big grin and she was spinning him and everyone stopped to watch. There was a magic between them that night, a chemistry.\u2019\n\nDiana was in her element. At one stage McGrady, who went on to become the Queen\u2019s pastry chef before working for the princess, found himself being dragged by her onto the dance floor despite his objections.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t dance, Your Royal Highness,\u2019 protested McGrady, who was a year younger than Diana. \u2018I know,\u2019 she shot back, \u2018but this will be fun.\u2019 And with a grinning Charles looking on, away they charged.\n\nNo one witnessing Diana\u2019s carefree joy that Balmoral night in 1982, and the sheer electricity that fizzed between her and Prince Charles, could possibly have known the anxieties that gnawed inside the princess, nor could they have foreseen the troubled future unfolding before this apparently blissful couple.\n\nDiana\u2019s first encounter with Prince Charles. He was dating her older sister Lady Sarah and was a guest for a shoot at Althorp, the Spencer family home, in the winter of 1977\n\nCertainly, as staff and royals dispersed after that intoxicating ball, all the talk was of happy days ahead.\n\nWhat that memorable night reveals is that there were periods of great joy and fulfilment for Diana and Charles, whose picture, cut from a magazine when she was a teenage schoolgirl, she pinned on the wall of her dormitory.\n\nIt begs the question that has been asked a million times in homes throughout Britain: what might have been for Charles and Diana had Camilla Parker Bowles, the older woman who first beguiled the prince when he was 23, been selfless and strong enough to walk away?\n\nCertainly, no one could have realised that they were witnessing the opening scenes of a unique drama when the 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer burst excitedly into her bachelor-girl apartment in Coleherne Court, on the border of Chelsea and Earl\u2019s Court, on a Sunday evening and announced to her three flatmates that she\u2019d met a chap\u2026\n\nOne of the three, Virginia Pitman, vividly recalls that moment 37 years ago. \u2018Just as I would be saying, \u201cOh my God, I met this guy last night\u201d, Diana was going, \u201cOh my God I met this guy at the weekend but I have to call him Your Highness.\u201d\n\nIt was actually true,\u2019 says Virginia, now Mrs Clarke, and living near Andover in Hampshire with husband Henry and two children and two stepchildren. \u2018She did have to call him that because that was what everybody was calling him. That was how you talked to him.\u2019\n\nOnly then did the penny drop, and the girls realised that Diana, who was nannying and house cleaning to earn money, was talking about her romance with the future king.\n\nAs for the weekend meeting to which Diana was referring, this was the country house summer barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex, where Diana and Charles famously sat side by side on a bale of hay, talking. By the evening she was sitting on his knee.\n\nA demure Diana, age 20, is pictured just two months before the royal wedding to Charles in 1981\n\nAugust 1980 and Charles, captivated by Earl Spencer\u2019s youngest daughter, has invited Diana to join him for Cowes Week on the Isle of Wight\n\nThey were guests at the home of the late Commander Robert de Pass, a polo-playing friend of Prince Philip, and his wife Philippa, who was, and still is, a lady-in-waiting to the Queen.\n\nTheir son Philip had invited Diana for the weekend \u2013 though he admits now he \u2018didn\u2019t really know her terribly well\u2019 \u2013 offering the tempting titbit that the Prince of Wales would also be coming.\n\nAs the daughter of Earl Spencer, a former equerry to both the Queen and King George VI, and having been brought up in a house on the Sandringham estate, Diana was familiar with the Queen\u2019s younger children, especially Andrew, 18 months her senior, on whom she\u2019d had an early teenage crush. Da\n\nBut she had only consciously met Charles once before, when she was 16. That was the weekend three years earlier when he and his pet labrador Harvey arrived at Althorp, in Northamptonshire, the Spencer family seat where they had been living since her father succeeded to the earldom in 1975, for a pheasant shoot.\n\nShe was deputed by her father to show the prince round Althorp\u2019s picture gallery. At that time Charles, then 29, was courting her elder sister Lady Sarah \u2013 a romance which never caught fire and was soon to fizzle out. (Lady Sarah, now 62, has been happily married to farmer and landowner Neil McCorquodale since 1980 and has three children.)\n\nThat shoot at Althorp remains indelibly inscribed in the mind of Penny Walker, Diana\u2019s former schoolteacher at West Heath, her boarding school at Sevenoaks in Kent, because Diana returned after the weekend proclaiming, \u2018I\u2019ve met him! At last I\u2019ve met him.\u2019\n\nDiana spent time with her flatmate Virginia Pitman three weeks before the engagement\n\nHer days as a single girl are coming to an end and Diana carries her record player away from her flat at Coleherne Court just weeks before the marriag\n\nMrs Walker was not altogether surprised at the excitement as she had noticed that Diana had pictures of the Prince of Wales pinned up in her cubicle and had often talked of meeting him. \u2018I\u2019m not sure there was any talk about marrying, but she just seemed completely besotted,\u2019 Mrs Walker says.\n\nFor her teachers it was all rather amusing. From a very young age it had been Prince Andrew with whom Diana had played in the school holidays. She referred to him as \u2018my friend\u2019.\n\nAnd it was photographs of the Queen\u2019s second son which could usually be seen spread out in front of her on her school desk. \u2018When I grow up,\u2019 Diana one day announced to the Rev Reginald Sweet, chaplain at her previous boarding school, Riddlesworth Hall near Thetford, Norfolk, where she went at the age of nine, \u2018I\u2019m going to marry Prince Andrew.\u2019\n\nWho knows how different so many things might have been had she done so. But with the advance of Diana\u2019s teenage years, Andrew had been replaced by Charles in her romantic daydreams.\n\nAnd now, having just had her 19th birthday, she found herself actually sitting next to him at the de Pass family barbecue, talking. No wonder she could hardly contain her excitement when she got back to her flat at Coleherne Court and was telling the girls all about it.\n\nFor his part, the heir to the throne, four months short of his 32nd birthday, found himself very impressed by her. He was deeply touched by the unusual sensitivity and compassion of one so young as she talked about how sad he had appeared at the funeral of Earl Mountbatten, his beloved great-uncle murdered by a remote-controlled IRA bomb the previous August on his fishing boat in Ireland. In particular, Charles was moved at how she had sensed his loneliness and his need for someone to care for him.\n\nDiana was pictured with boyfriend Adam Russell a year before she met Charles. It was said that \u2018The girl he marries must have no former lovers who may kiss and tell\u2019\n\nBefore long Diana\u2019s flatmates were hearing all about the blossoming relationship between her and the Prince of Wales. The three-bedroom flat on the corner of Old Brompton Road and The Little Boltons became the nerve centre of the secret romance. But outwardly, life went on as normal.\n\nDiana, who was bought the flat by her mother, Frances, and charged the girls \u00a318 a week rent, continued to work at a kindergarten three days a week plus two days nannying Patrick, infant son of American Mary Robertson, who lived in Belgravia. She also earned \u00a31 an hour in her spare time cleaning her sister Lady Sarah\u2019s flat round the corner.\n\nThis was the unlikely setting for one of the great tragic stories of our time.\n\nLady Diana could hardly contain herself with the thrill of the romance. She shared it all, step by step, with the girls. In addition to Virginia, there was old school friend Carolyn Pride, now the wife of party organiser William Bartholomew and a mother of two as well as being Prince Harry\u2019s godmother.\n\nThe third flatmate was Annie Bolton, who married Noel Hill, son of Prince Charles\u2019s former polo coach, and lives with their two children on a 40,000-acre cattle station in Queensland, Australia, where Harry spent part of his gap year working in 2003.\n\nGallant schoolboy Nicholas Hardy asked the princess-to-be, \u2018May I kiss the hand of my future Queen?\u2019 as Diana arrived in Cheltenham with Charles while getting to know Gloucestershire ahead of her wedding in March 1981. \u2018I don\u2019t know about that,\u2019 Diana replied, by which time he\u2019d already done it \u2013 to the sniggering of his fellow pupils\n\n\u2018No amount of arranging in the world could have induced Diana to marry Charles if she had not loved him,\u2019 declares Mrs Clarke. Charles and Diana (pictured) at their engagement announcment\n\nDisplaying that shy-Di look as she poses with Charles on a pre-wedding visit to Balmoral\n\nVirginia and Carolyn shared a bedroom, while Diana and Annie each had their own. So, alongside the commonplace problem of having one bathroom, the four girls found themselves sharing the secrets of an evolving 20th-century fairy tale. \u2018Diana was very keen on the prince,\u2019 recalls Virginia, now 57.\n\n\u2018She thought he was marvellous. He was obviously wiser and older, and she was young and enthusiastic, very vivacious and chatty. I remember it as a happy time. From what I could see and from what she told me, she went in there [into Prince Charles\u2019s life] a little bit like a tornado.\u2019\n\nBut, clearly, this could never be an everyday romance. As Virginia recalls, \u2018I think it was hard for them because it wasn\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. They couldn\u2019t just pop out to the cinema, whereas if you take William and Kate, they had the opportunity to lead a proper life and therefore have a proper romance.\n\nThey also had a deep and knowledgeable friendship before it went any further whereas Diana and Charles, I felt, didn\u2019t have that opportunity at all.\u2019\n\nDiana is about to embark on her honeymoon cruise aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia from Gibraltar. But when she and Charles were next seen in Egypt they\u2019d already had their first post-wedding row over his cufflinks from Camilla\n\nVirginia has, in fact, put her finger on a key flaw in the romance of Lady Diana Spencer and the Prince of Wales \u2013 they were to make their marriage vows without ever having had the time to get to know each other properly.\n\nDiana was acutely aware of this on her wedding day, and bitterly regretted it always. Indeed, we can reveal that she confided in her friend, Argentine-born fashion consultant Roberto Devorik, that when she explained her fears to her father, the late 8th Earl Spencer, he consoled her, saying, \u2018Things will change. He [Charles] will get to know you.\u2019\n\nToday it\u2019s largely forgotten, but Charles was far from being Diana\u2019s first boyfriend. There was Adam Russell \u2013 a great-grandson of Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and now a deer farmer in Dorset, Guards officer Rory Scott, now married with children, whose shirts she chastely washed at the flat, and George Plumptre, now chief executive of the National Gardens Scheme, who used to take her to the theatre.\n\nBut none of them was \u2018serious\u2019, a factor crucially important to Charles. His mentor Lord Mountbatten\u2019s advice had been that the girl he married should have no \u2018past\u2019, in other words, no former lovers who may be tempted to \u2018kiss and tell\u2019. Diana fitted the bill perfectly.\n\nShe had not been in love before. She had, as she put it to a friend, \u2018kept herself tidy\u2019. As Devorik bluntly puts it, \u2018She was a virgin when she married. So young and totally inexperienced.\u2019 What pleased Charles most of all was the thought that he would not only be her first love but her last.\n\nBarely two weeks after the barbecue, at Cowes Week, he told a close friend that he had met the girl he intended to marry. In fact she was there \u2013 he\u2019d invited Diana to join his house party aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia.\n\nWhile he windsurfed, she water-skied. The friend\u2019s advice was for him to keep the matter to himself until he was sure. What he was saying dovetailed with the assurances given to Diana by her father, that all they needed was time. But was this true? Certainly, Charles was under pressure, as he saw it, from Prince Philip to make up his mind.\n\nBack in the flat, excitement was rising as the world\u2019s media, entranced by the idea of the nursery school assistant marrying the heir to the throne, camped outside. In fact, as Virginia recalls, the romance was a fairly standard progression from \u2018I kissed him\u2019 to \u2018Wa-hey, we are going out for dinner\u2019.\n\nUnlike other boyfriends, the prince never came round to the flat. But Diana kept nothing secret from them, and they loyally kept what they knew to themselves. These were exciting, jolly times at Flat 60, filling Virginia with nostalgia. \u2018When I think of her today,\u2019 she says emotionally, \u2018I think of her laugh \u2013 it was a naughty laugh, a booming, wonderful laugh.\u2019\n\nIn February 1981, seven months after their hay-bale encounter, the prince invited her to Windsor Castle and proposed. In accepting, Diana told him she was \u2018in love\u2019 with him. He bumblingly replied with a curious phrase that rather shook her and shocked millions later when he repeated it during their first television engagement interview \u2013 \u2018whatever \u201cin love\u201d means\u2019.\n\n\u2018Diana was undoubtedly in love with him,\u2019 says her old nanny Mary Clarke. \u2018He was the man she had been waiting for all her life, someone she could marry knowing that divorce was impossible.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t forget that Charles had told her she was chubby\n\nShe had made a vow never to be divorced as a child after going through all the tumult of her parents\u2019 separation and divorce when she was six.\u2019 What especially attracted her about Charles was something he had said years earlier in an interview about marriage: \u2018In my position obviously the last thing I could entertain is getting divorced.\u2019 Indeed, almost the first thing Diana, aged nine, told nanny Clarke when she arrived to look after the four Spencer children was, \u2018I shall only get married when I am sure I\u2019m in love so that we will never be divorced.\u2019\n\nNow that little girl was slipping into her perfect future. There were murmurings of an \u2018arranged marriage\u2019 \u2013 not least from the late Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie who married them at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral \u2013 but Mrs Clarke, these days living quietly in Canada, dismisses them.\n\n\u2018No amount of arranging in the world could have induced Diana to marry Charles if she had not loved him,\u2019 declares Mrs Clarke, who was still in touch with Diana until shortly before her death. \u2018That remains at the heart of the sadness of her life. All Diana ever wanted was to make a picture-book home with a loving husband and children \u2013 a \u2018nest\u2019, she called it.\n\nI know how proud and thrilled Diana would have been at William\u2019s choice of wife. His marriage is wonderful. The way they are so together and secure is everything Diana wanted. And how she would have loved those grandchildren.\u2019\n\nCharles slips an arm round Diana\u2019s waist during a visit to Tetbury in 1981. Earlier in the engagement he had done just that and remarked on her weight\n\nDiana is led down the aisle of St Paul\u2019s Cathedral by her father Earl Spencer on the day of her wedding to Prince Charles, 29 July 1981. Elizabeth Emanuel, who made her wedding dress, said that Diana lost six inches around her waist between her first and last fittings, shrinking to a slender 23 inche\n\nFor the moment everything was perfect in Diana\u2019s world. She raced back to Coleherne Court and declared, \u2018Guess what?\u2019 They cried out, \u2018He asked you?!\u2019 Diana replied, \u2018He did. And I said, \u201cYes please!\u201d\u2019 The girls hugged her with kisses, and some tears, and someone opened a bottle of champagne. But the engagement was still a secret, and all of them maintained omerta until the official announcement three weeks later. \u2018We were all very excited,\u2019 Virginia recalls. \u2018It was quite other-worldly.\u2019\n\nReality cut in, however, the night before the announcement when Diana packed her things and was collected by a police bodyguard who drove her to her new temporary home, Clarence House, where the Queen Mother lived. Charles wasn\u2019t there to greet her.\n\nIn fact there was no welcoming member of the Royal Family. A servant showed her to her bedroom on the first floor. There, a letter was lying on the bed. A curiously warm and welcoming letter from someone she hardly knew, Camilla Parker Bowles.\n\nThe friendly note, which had been written several days before the engagement, invited her to lunch. For the moment Diana was absorbed in all the excitement of becoming engaged. She stayed briefly with the Queen Mother before moving across the road into Buckingham Palace, where she was given her own suite of rooms. But she was missing her flatmates.\n\n\u2018The sweetest thing I can remember is when she moved into Buckingham Palace,\u2019 says Virginia. \u2018She liked to invite us round there sometimes. We were there when her wedding veil arrived. I think it was Carolyn and me and Diana and we were taking it in turns trying it on and imagining what was coming. It was surreal, wandering around her bedroom in the palace wearing the veil.\u2019\n\nThe giggling girls demanded of Diana, \u2018How are you going to curtsy?... Are you going to go low?... How low can you go?\u2019 Diana had to curtsy to the Queen at the top of the aisle in St Paul\u2019s. On the day her curtsy was textbook. Textbook also was Prince Charles\u2019s gesture to the girls in the flat. \u2018He sent us a huge bouquet of flowers to thank us for our support,\u2019 says Virginia. \u2018That was really sweet.\u2019\n\nA VERY IMPORTANT WAITER o one encapsulated the wedding euphoria more than Molimea \u2018Ilolahia. He was a waiter for the King of Tonga and had met the Queen on her visits. Hearing of the royal wedding, he wrote to her private secretary Sir William Heseltine explaining that his greatest ambition was to serve at Buckingham Palace, if only for a day, and could he fix it. Sir William did, with the Queen herself. So on the eve of the wedding, when the Queen held a reception at the palace, Moli was there on duty, with a tray of drinks to hand out. \u2018There were three reigning sovereigns present, as well as maharajahs, several de-throned monarchs and all of the Commonwealth governors-general,\u2019 chuckles Sir William. \u2018One of the VIPs was the president of Gambia [President Dawda Jawara] who was deposed while he was at the party. \u2018But when the Queen came in, the first person her eye lit on was Moli and he was the first person she walked across the room to greet. All the assembled VIPs thought he must be some even higher VIP. But he was just a waiter.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, there was the matter of the dress itself. Diana chose the little-known designer couple David and Elizabeth Emanuel. She did not tell them at that first consultation in their Brook Street, Mayfair, salon that whatever waist measurement they took would be too big because she was going to lose weight, and lose weight she did.\n\nMost brides do slim down before their wedding, but with Diana there was a worrying sense of urgency. She could not get out of her mind that Charles had put his arm round her waist and humorously told her she was \u2018chubby\u2019. Actually, her waist was 29in, hardly big for a young woman almost 5ft 11in tall.\n\nBut by her wedding day it had shrunk to a slender 23in. \u2018We did notice she was losing a lot of weight,\u2019 says Elizabeth. \u2018We weren\u2019t concerned in any way because that was the norm. We put it down to bridal nerves. It didn\u2019t even cross our minds that she could be anorexic.\u2019\n\nThis was a worrying precursor to the eating disorder, bulimia, that was to plague her through much of her marriage. Flatmate Carolyn Pride put it down to her terror of the life she was stepping into.\n\nShe worried as she saw her friend getting \u2018so thin\u2019. Diana was nervous, but doesn\u2019t this apply to all brides? But as was soon to emerge, Diana was already troubled by the shadow of Camilla. She had seen the signs that Mrs Parker Bowles, ostensibly an older woman trying to be helpful, meant more to Charles than she had thought.\n\nMeanwhile, the nation was gripped by royal wedding fever. Around this time there were also inner city riots in Brixton, Liverpool and Manchester. Sir William Heseltine, the Queen\u2019s former private secretary, recalls motoring through Brixton in the aftermath of the riots.\n\nScores of buildings were burned and cars had been set ablaze. \u2018Bizarrely, the fronts of shops were adorned with pictures of Charles and Di and bunting and flags \u2013 big posters of them in front of burned-out buildings,\u2019 Sir William recalls. \u2018It was amazing. This was 24 July and the wedding was on the 29th. I can\u2019t remember if I told Charles and Diana but I certainly told the Queen.\u2019\n\nIt was a beautiful wedding, no doubt about that, even though the estimated 750 million watching on television around the world had no idea that Diana didn\u2019t really like the dress. Too voluminous \u2013 she felt \u2018swamped\u2019 in it \u2013 and it creased. Still, from a respectful distance, no one guessed. They looked so happy. She was radiant.\n\nEverything that Princess Margaret had told her had gone to plan. The Queen\u2019s sister had taken her under her wing on the way to the wedding rehearsal and told her how to greet the clergymen she would meet, whose hands to shake and how to move on slowly down a receiving line. David Griffin, Margaret\u2019s chauffeur for some 26 years, heard it all in the car as he drove them to St Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\n\u2018Princess Margaret was very thorough,\u2019 he remembers, \u2018telling her how things would be, step by step. Diana took it all in. We had also taken Diana for some of her wedding dress fittings. Margaret was very helpful and her daughter Lady Sarah, just three years younger than the bride, was very excited about being a bridesmaid.\u2019\n\nAnd so to the Queen\u2019s post-wedding supper party at Claridge\u2019s, where an extraordinary gathering was crowded around a flickering television screen put there so they could watch a video recording of the day\u2019s events.\n\nThere is no better description than the words of Nicky Haslam, the waspish interior designer and man-about-town: \u2018Besides the entire Royal Family and every king and queen regnant or exiled, there were Nancy Reagan, Princess Grace of Monaco, the Empress of Iran, the Crown Prince of Japan, archbishops, archimandrakes, princelings and potentates.\n\nThis extraordinary melange, these remnants of foreclosed kingdoms and endless lineage, sat cheek-by-jowl with the few who had survived, watching that film of a real-live fairy tale. It was the greatest party I\u2019ve ever been to in my life.\u2019\n\nWith the glowing Queen, the exalted group watched the newlyweds kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Then the Queen stood up, beaming. \u2018Supper,\u2019 she called and led them all into the ballroom.\n\nCharles and Diana were long gone on the start of their lives together. They had arrived at Broadlands, home of the late Lord Mountbatten, to spend their wedding night in the Portico Room, with its views across the lawns to the River Test and its canopied four-poster bed whose previous honeymoon occupants had included the Queen and Prince Philip.\n\nCharles took with him a gift from Camilla, a pair of cufflinks monogrammed with their entwined initials \u2018CC\u2019. It would not be long before it emerged that all was not quite as it seemed.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/misc/logo_cookie_reg.png",
