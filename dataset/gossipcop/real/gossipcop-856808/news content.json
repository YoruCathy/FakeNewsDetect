Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra is in London and is ready to watch her friend walk down the aisle.\n\nThe actor reached London ahead of the royal wedding wearing a plaid pantsuit. Priyanka had earlier confessed that she was \u201cstressed out about [wearing] a small hat\u201d but a visit to iconic British fascinator designer Philip Treacy put her mind to rest. Ohhhh, now I get it !!\u201d the 35-year-old actor shared a photo as she is surrounded by fascinator designs. Her makeup artist Patrick Ta also reached London and shared an Instagram photo, giving us a broad hint that he will be creating Priyanka\u2019s makeup look for Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding.\n\nWelcomed by the UK sun... #nomakeupnofilter A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on May 18, 2018 at 11:58am PDT\n\nPriyanka will be one of the very few Indian faces present at the wedding and those who don\u2019t know about her friendship with the to-be princess might be wondering about the connection. To clear all doubt, here\u2019s a quick revision for you on how they met, what they have said about each other and more.\n\nThe Bollywood star and the American actor first met in January 2016 at Elle\u2019s 6th Annual Women in TV Celebration. They met at the party which was also attended by Viola Davis, Olivia Wilde and more. The two hit it off instantly. \u201cWe bonded as actors. We just became friends, like two girls would,\u201d Priyanka told People magazine in 2017.\n\nMeghan then interviewed Priyanka for her now-defunct lifestyle blog, The Tig. Soon, they became good friends and started hanging out regularly. They watched Hamilton together, enjoyed drinks by swimming pools in Malibu and clicked a lot of selfies. While a few pictures from this phase can still be found online on Priyanka\u2019s Instagram, others were lost when Meghan\u2019s Instagram profile was deactivated after she got engaged to Prince Harry in November 2017.\n\nBefore the engagement was announced and when Harry and Meghan were being spotted together by the paparazzi, even Priyanka started getting bombarded by curious questions about her friend and her prince. In May 2017, she was asked by Wendy Williams on her show about \u2018Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend,\u2019 Priyanka didn\u2019t hesitate in correcting her: \u201cAlso, Meghan Markle: actress, Suits, her achievements,\u201d a gesture appreciated by both the actors\u2019 fans.\n\nThe love, however, has not been one-sided. Meghan also talked about Priyanka with PTI in an interview. \u201cI would love to work with her on a film one day! I told her specifically that my dream is to work with her on a Bollywood film, because I think it would be so much fun \u2014 she said I should do it,\u201d she had said.\n\nPriyanka also recently wrote a piece on Meghan for Time magazine as she featured in their list of 100 Most Influential and called her a \u2018princess for the people.\u2019 Here\u2019s the full text:\n\nSomewhere among biryani, poutine and endless conversations, I realized just how deeply Meghan Markle cares for the world. With her, what you see is real, and what you get is a relatable young woman with her heart and mind in the right place. Her compassion, evident in the causes she supports, and her drive to break down stereotypes\u2014obvious in her actions\u2014will connect her to a generation in much need of kindness.\n\nThis ever-smiling, strong free spirit found her prince, fell in love and in turn made a cynical world believe in fairy tales again. But more than anything else, Meghan is an important influencer in a world that needs strong public figures to respect and look up to. People the world can be inspired by. Meghan, standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry, will be a princess for the people.\n\nLove always, my friend. Live happily ever after.\n\nPriyanka was again asked about Meghan on The View, Good Morning America and What Happens Live With Andy Cohen earlier this month as she promoted her show, Quantico. She was asked about what she would wear, the gift she had chosen, if she had met Prince Harry or if she knows with Meghan cried when she saw her wedding dress. Priyanka, like a true friend gave nothing away.\n\nGuess, we will have to wait just a few more hours to find that out with the world.", "images":
