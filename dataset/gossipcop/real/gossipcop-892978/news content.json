Taylor Swift has officially confirmed that, yes, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\u2018 eldest daughter, James, is on her new Reputation track \u201cGorgeous.\u201d\n\nLast month, Swifties speculated that the 2-year-old was the adorable voice featured in the beginning of the song. In her album booklet, she wrote: \u201cBaby intro voice by James Reynolds.\u201d (The couple are also parents of daughter Ines, 13 months.)\n\nSwift, 27, dropped \u201cGorgeous,\u201d which is the third single off her sixth album, on October 20. The love tune, of course, is about the singer\u2019s boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.\n\nSwift and Lively, 30, first became fast friends in 2015. Lively and Reynolds, 41, celebrated the Fourth of July with Swift and her then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston at her Rhode Island home last year and the pair are even mentioned in her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d music video. In one scene, she recreated the \u201cJunior Jewels\u201d top she wore in her 2008 \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video. Look close enough and you\u2019ll see \u201cBlake & Ryan\u201d written in marker on her shoulder.\n\nOther stars who are still in her squad? Selena Gomez, Lena Dunham, Gigi Hadid, Ed Sheeran and her childhood BFF Abigail Anderson.\n\nTell Us: What do you think about Reputation?", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-blake-ryan-daughter-gorgeous-promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1708px%2C898px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-blake-ryan-daughter-gorgeous-2.jpg?w=300", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-blake-ryan-daughter-gorgeous.jpg?crop=0px%2C26px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/taylor-swift-blake-ryan-daughter-gorgeous-promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C1708px%2C898px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/taylor-swift-confirms-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-daughter-is-on-gorgeous/", "title": "Taylor Swift Confirms Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Daughter Is on \u2018Gorgeous\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Taylor Swift confirmed that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' daughter, James, is featured on her new track 'Gorgeous' \u2014 find out more!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Yep!
