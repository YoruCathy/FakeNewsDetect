Where the hell did that come from? This isn\u2019t a mind game: Taylor\u2019s first single off Reputation does actually contain rhythmic elements from Right Said Fred\u2019s 1991 hit parody of every guy known to take gym-mirror selfies.\n\nBut rather than give a nod to the song\u2019s origins with a sample, all three members who wrote the British Europop guilty pleasure \u2014 Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Rob Manzoli \u2014 are each credited as co-songwriters on Taylor\u2019s song. With such recognition, Swift and the song\u2019s producer, Jack Antonoff, are acknowledging that their use of \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d is more than a sample \u2014 it\u2019s a full, unexpected interpolation that, up until recently, might not have translated to any compensation for the artists who came up with the original.\n\nRight Said Fred are shocked, too. The three members weren\u2019t even aware of Taylor\u2019s interest in tinkering with \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d until two days ago, and none of them got to listen to the finished product until today, with the rest of the world. Fred Fairbrass tells Vulture that, not long ago, Swift, Antonoff, and their publishers reached out to Right Said Fred\u2019s publishing company, Spirit Music Group, and asked for permission to interpolate the song. (Meaning Swift and Antonoff incorporated an original recording of \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d into their mix, rather than use the original masters.) But it was unbeknownst to the band that the woman making the request was the Taylor Swift. \u201cWe trust our publisher to know what we agree and don\u2019t agree to,\u201d Fairbrass says, so he and his bandmates never thought to ask. Meanwhile, their publishers negotiated on the band\u2019s behalf, though Fairbrass isn\u2019t sure whose idea it was to make them co-songwriters versus clearing a sample.\n\nCall it the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d precedent. Since Robin Thicke and Pharrell lost the 2015 copyright lawsuit over their song after a jury found the two artists lifted more than just a \u201cvibe\u201d from Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cGot to Give It Up,\u201d several artists have taken the preemptive measure of handing out co-credits to avoid similar plagiarism accusations. Since then, Sam Smith, Bruno Mars, and Mark Ronson have all had to give credit to artists whose songs it appeared they borrowed too much from after being sued. But a more recent example \u2014 Ed Sheeran sharing credit with TLC\u2019s \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d songwriters on \u201cShape of You\u201d before anyone suspicious of a resemblance could file a lawsuit \u2014 better represents the new industry standard Swift and Antonoff appear to be following. However, in the same breath, the song also contains an uncredited sample of Peaches\u2019s \u201cOperate.\u201d (Vulture has reached out to Peaches for comment.)\n\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d isn\u2019t the first time Right Said Fred has been asked to consent to another artist using \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d \u2014 they say they\u2019ve also been illegally sampled on more underground club mixes than they can count \u2014 but it is one of the few times they\u2019ve been compensated so handsomely, and they wish that were the norm. \u201cSongwriters are the life blood of the industry. Artists and writers of all varying degrees of success should be treated fairly,\u201d Fairbrass says. \u201cHow Taylor and her team have treated us should be commended. Time and again we see artists go ahead with clearly stolen ideas, but we\u2019ve been treated fairly.\u201d Fairbrass won\u2019t reveal the percentage of the band\u2019s co-writing credit or how much they\u2019ve been paid, but they are expecting to see a considerable sales boost: \u201cIt will affect our royalty stream, we\u2019re very aware of that. We\u2019ve seen bumps in our royalties when the song is used in a movie or a commercial, but this is going to be of a different level,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re an independent band, we\u2019ve paid for everything since we started; we\u2019ve never had a major record deal. So, for us, this is cash flow that will fund our successes and our failures.\u201d\n\nLast year, \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d celebrated 25 years of camp glory, but Fairbrass never expected one of the most powerful figures in music to repurpose it now. \u201cLongevity for all artists is quite difficult, and to have a song last 26 years later and to get this profile is very rare. Our first gig was with Suicide; we\u2019ve been playing a very long time,\u201d he says. According to Fairbrass, the band are content knowing their song has been paired with a song as equally \u201ccynical\u201d as the original \u2014 and by an artist whose work has been treated with legitimacy: \u201cTo have a big artist like Taylor Swift now give your song the thumbs up is amazing.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fe8/e8d/b3a3a18e7193e5dfe0e3cc5d0a5d9fcc55-27-taylor-iamtoosexy.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/27/27-taylor-iamtoosexy.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fe8/e8d/b3a3a18e7193e5dfe0e3cc5d0a5d9fcc55-27-taylor-iamtoosexy.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dee Lockett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/im-too-sexy-taylor-swift-new-song-explained.html", "title": "How \u2018I\u2019m Too Sexy\u2019 Ended Up in Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "How \u2018I\u2019m Too Sexy\u2019 Ended Up in Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/im-too-sexy-taylor-swift-new-song-explained.html", "description": "Right Said Fred didn\u2019t know Taylor Swift wanted to use their song until two days ago.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fe8/e8d/b3a3a18e7193e5dfe0e3cc5d0a5d9fcc55-27-taylor-iamtoosexy.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "How \u2018I\u2019m Too Sexy\u2019 Ended Up in Taylor Swift\u2019s New Song", "description": "Right Said Fred didn\u2019t know Taylor Swift wanted to use their song until two days ago.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fe8/e8d/b3a3a18e7193e5dfe0e3cc5d0a5d9fcc55-27-taylor-iamtoosexy.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-25T18:45:45.242-04:00", "tag": "taylor swift, i'm too sexy, right said fred, look what you made me do, music, music copyrights", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Right Said Fred explain how \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d ended up in Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d", "sailthru.tags": "taylor swift, i'm too sexy, right said fred, look what you made me do, music, music copyrights", "author": "Dee Lockett", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503701145.242, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
