(Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for The Critics' Choice Awards ) A rare miss for one of Hollywood's best dressed women.\n\nBEST: Diane Kruger Actors Diane Kruger (L) and Norman Reedus arrive for the 23rd annual Critics' Choice Awards at the Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018, in Santa Monica, California. / AFP PHOTO / JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIXJEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP/Getty Images Diane went for a low-key Vera Wang gown so as not to distract from her big reveal of the night - making her red carpet debut as a couple with boyfriend Norman Reedus. WORST: Emma Roberts Actress Emma Roberts arrives for the 23rd annual Critics' Choice Awards at the Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018, in Santa Monica, California. / AFP PHOTO / JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIXJEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP/Getty Images This Giorgio Armani is structure perfection, but not on her tiny frame.
