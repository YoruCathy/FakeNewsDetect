Offset popped the question back in October, during Power 99 radio\u2019s Powerhouse concert in Philadelphia. Cardi B was surprised, excited and overwhelmed.\n\nAnd she was also already married to Offset.\n\nIt turns out the rappers secretly tied the knot back in September. On Monday, Cardi confessed that the couple had said their vows before she started wearing a giant diamond engagement ring and revealed they were pregnant.\n\n\"There are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep to myself! Getting married was one of those moments!\" Cardi B wrote in a memo shared on Twitter. \"Our relationship was so new ... but we was so in love we didn't want to lose each other (so) one morning in September we woke up and decided to get married.\"\n\nThe \"Invasion of Privacy\" singer writes that she said \"I do\" without a dress, a ring, any makeup or guests, save for one cousin.\n\nShe wrote, \"I appreciate and love my husband so much for still wanting me to have the moment every girl dreams of when he got down on his knee and put a ring on my finger and he did that for me!!\" And, Cardi added, \"at least ya can stop saying i had a baby out of wedlock.\"\n\nThough the musicians' marriage has long been official, the two are still planning a wedding reception, which is \"Sooo overwhelming,\" as Cardi B recently lamented on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5629249739001_5629244648001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b7ffb79ef8cf980be39b770d2532c00ab0a81bf/c=0-83-2628-1568/local/-/media/2018/06/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636655484719855610-AP-2018-Maxim-Super-Bowl-Party---Arrivals.jpg?width=2628&height=1485&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b7ffb79ef8cf980be39b770d2532c00ab0a81bf/c=0-83-2628-1568/local/-/media/2018/06/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636655484719855610-AP-2018-Maxim-Super-Bowl-Party---Arrivals.jpg?width=2628&height=1485&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/06/25/cardi-b-offset-secret-marriage/732891002/", "title": "Cardi B confirms she secretly married Offset in September, before they were 'engaged'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Cardi B confirms she secretly married Offset in September, before they were 'engaged'", "description": "Though Cardi B and Offset are expecting a baby and still planning a wedding, they officially wed in September, Cardi revealed on Twitter Monday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/06/25/cardi-b-offset-secret-marriage/732891002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b7ffb79ef8cf980be39b770d2532c00ab0a81bf/c=0-83-2628-1568/local/-/media/2018/06/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636655484719855610-AP-2018-Maxim-Super-Bowl-Party---Arrivals.jpg?width=2628&height=1485&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 2628, "height": 1485}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Carly Mallenbaum", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Though Cardi B and Offset are expecting a baby and still planning a wedding, they officially wed in September, Cardi revealed on Twitter Monday.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b7ffb79ef8cf980be39b770d2532c00ab0a81bf/c=0-83-2628-1568/local/-/media/2018/06/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/636655484719855610-AP-2018-Maxim-Super-Bowl-Party---Arrivals.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Cardi B confirms she secretly married Offset in September, before they were 'engaged'", "description": "Though Cardi B and Offset are expecting a baby and still planning a wedding, they officially wed in September, Cardi revealed on Twitter Monday."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529856000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
