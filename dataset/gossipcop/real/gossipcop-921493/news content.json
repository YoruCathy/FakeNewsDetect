Though he initially said the ink was temporary way back in 2016, the new shots prove it's the real deal.\n\nBen was photographed sans shirt while filming a new movie, \"Triple Frontier,\" alongside Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac and Garrett Hedlund. Though all the photos are kind of amazing, it's Affleck's ink that generated most of the talk online.\n\n\"[It's] fake for a movie,\" Affleck said of the piece in 2016. \"I actually do have a number of tattoos but I try to have them in places where you don't have to do a lot of cover up they get sort of addictive, tattoos, after awhile.\"\n\nDespite his outright lie at the time, exes Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez both chimed in with some serious shade about the tattoo as well. \"You know what we would say in my hometown about that? 'Bless his heart,'\" Garner told Vanity Fair. \"A phoenix rising from the ashes. Am I the ashes in this scenario? I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.\"\n\nOn \"Watch What Happens Live,\" J.Lo added, \"It's awful! What are you doing? His tattoos always have too many colors, they shouldn\u2019t be so colorful. They should be cooler.\"\n\nWith the new photos confirming the tatt's authenticity, Twitter piled on the haterade -- see the most savage reactions below:\n\nDon\u2019t mock Ben Affleck\u2019s phoenix tattoo. It symbolises how he has risen from the ashes, reborn as a guy with a tattoo that sucks \u2014 pixelated boat [ASMR] binaural ~4 hours~ (@pixelatedboat) March 18, 2018\n\nWow, did you guys see Ben Affleck's tattoo!? pic.twitter.com/D5MwPwz0mX \u2014 Jesse McLaren (@McJesse) March 19, 2018\n\nBen Affleck and Jared Leto's Joker have the same tattoo on their backs?! \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/4CGXsEfncv \u2014 Batman-News.com (@BatmanNewsCom) March 16, 2018\n\nI\u2019ve been following the Ben Affleck back tattoo drama more closely than the Mueller investigation. \u2014 Sophia Benoit (@1followernodad) March 18, 2018\n\nyou ever see ben affleck in a movie and forget for a second that he has a giant tattoo of a psychedelic phoenix rising from the ashes that covers his entire back because I DON'Thttps://t.co/thMBiyHr0r pic.twitter.com/YZxV8grUh0 \u2014 Brian Grubb (@briancgrubb) March 16, 2018\n\nNext time you're feeling sad, remember that you're not Ben Affleck so you (probably) don't have a tattoo so big and so ugly and so universally ridiculed that you had to lie and say it was only temporary and just for a movie when it is so clearly not.
