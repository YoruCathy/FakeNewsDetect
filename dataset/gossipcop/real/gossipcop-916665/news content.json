The cast of Vanderpump Rules gathered together to relive the Bravo series\u2019 pre-wedding drama for the first part of the season 5 reunion special on Monday, April 3.\n\nThe Bubbas\u2019 Wedding Bliss\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that this season was bigger and better than ever before \u2014 so big, in fact, that host Andy Cohen was forced to hold the reunion at a studio in downtown Los Angeles instead of at Sur. \u201cWe normally do this at Sur, but we had to move out!\u201d Andy laughed, gesturing to the visibly tense cast mates.\n\nAndy wasted no time jumping into wedding talk. He prompted Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz to give an update on their married life, and Schwartz immediately responded with a cringeworthy dad joke: \u201cThey say there\u2019s three rings,\u201d he began. \u201cThere\u2019s the engagement ring. There\u2019s the wedding ring. And then there\u2019s suffering.\u201d Ha ha?\n\nStassi Schroeder revealed that actually she crashed the Bubbas\u2019 honeymoon \u2014 but Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright somehow one-upped Stassi by moving into the same apartment complex as Tom and Katie. \u201cI was not happy about it,\u201d the newly married Katie stated flatly. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be like a dorm situation!\u201d\n\nJax Stands by Sex Rumor\n\nSeason 5 opened with a steamy sex rumor involving Brittany and Kristen Doute, and it was started by none other than Jax himself. Nearly a year later, Jax continued to stand by his story.\n\n\u201cI was in shock,\u201d he insisted. But Brittany and Kristen adamantly denied the rumored hookup. \u201cI did not go down on Brittany,\u201d Kristen swore as Brittany shook her head in agreement. \u201cDidn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBrittany told Andy that she and Kristen had just shared a \u201cstupid kiss,\u201d but Jax demanded to know why the girls were fully naked if all they did was just exchange a quick peck. James Kennedy remarked that he believed Jax was telling the truth (for once). \u201cI just think Kristen likes getting with people while her boyfriend\u2019s in the other room,\u201d James sneered. \u201cThird time\u2019s a charm.\u201d\n\nScheana Denies Having \u201cPrenup Remorse\u201d\n\nShifting back to the wedding buzz, Andy asked Lisa Vanderpump if she agreed with Tom and Katie\u2019s decision to draft a prenup before tying the knot. \u201cGood business, or bad romance?\u201d he questioned the happily married Sur boss.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what they had to share,\u201d Lisa responded. \u201cThey were arguing over 50 bucks!\u201d\n\nScheana Shay made the mistake of mentioning on the show that she would never get a prenup \u2014 and now she\u2019s going through a nasty divorce from husband Mike Shay. Andy asked if she regretted foregoing a prenup, but she surprisingly did not.\n\n\u201cAt the time, it did seem like it would put a slight damper on how happy we were,\u201d Scheana said. Before their wedding, Scheana felt that she didn\u2019t have much to risk financially, and unfortunately she never thought divorce would be in her future.\n\n\u201cWell, I would\u2019ve had a prenup if I\u2019d been marrying Shay,\u201d Lisa interrupted her. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest. He didn\u2019t pull his weight in the relationship.\u201d Lisa said she knew exactly how much she would\u2019ve left him: \u201cDiddly squat.\u201d\n\nJames Slams Cheating Accusations\n\nThroughout season 5, James was confronted multiple times about cheating on his girlfriend, Raquel Leviss. The DJ continued to deny sleeping with his former Sur coworker Gigi. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from someone who was close to Gigi for a short time that she said she would fight or f\u2013k anyone to get in this group,\u201d Ariana Madix offered, suggesting that Gigi might\u2019ve purposely spread those rumors just to get herself involved in the show.\n\nWhen Andy brought up the fact that another Sur employee actually had photo proof that she had slept with James, the DJ stubbornly concluded that the photo was edited. The cast decided to elect Kristen to do a full investigation into the situation, which gave James the perfect opportunity to point out that Kristen had literally slept with every single guy on one side of the room (Jax, James and Tom Sandoval conveniently sat in a row). \u201cAm I the only guy who hasn\u2019t had sex with Kristen?\u201d Andy asked, bewildered.\n\nLala Confronts the Cast\n\nAfter being MIA for most of the season, Lala Kent made an unexpected appearance at the reunion. Andy jumped at the chance to question Lala about the digs she made toward her former castmates throughout her run on the show. She admitted that she said horrible things just to tear down the other girls, but Sandoval refused to let Lala take full responsibility for the cast\u2019s division. \u201cYou guys attacked her first!\u201d he barked at Stassi, Kristen, and Katie.\n\nLala told Andy that the way the trio treated Scheana was also an issue. Scheana finally piped up and confessed that she was hurt that Stassi called her anorexic. But per usual, Stassi brushed off Scheana\u2019s concerns and simply told her to go to Taco Bell.\n\nScheana insisted that the girls made her \u201cnervous,\u201d which prompted Stassi, Kristen and Katie to freak out on her. James noted that Stassi was clearly the ringleader of the three ladies, but Lala felt it was Katie who was the \u201cmean girl.\u201d But rather than jump down Lala\u2019s throat, Katie actually put a stop to the heated argument with a \u201csorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to sling insults,\u201d Katie told Lala in a heartfelt apology. \u201cThat was an ugly moment for me to watch. I 100 percent apologize for saying that, because I was very stubborn this summer, especially toward you.\u201d Katie explained she wasn\u2019t at a good place this summer \u2014 emotionally, physically and relationship-wise. She admitted that she wrongfully took it out on Lala.\n\nUpon hearing Katie\u2019s apology, Lala instantly burst into tears. \u201cI\u2019ve waited a long time for just one of them say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry for hurting your feelings.\u2019 You have no idea. That means the world to me,\u201d she said.\n\nVanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_177192_0357_andy-cohen-vanderpump-rules-zoom-c3800a9d-5572-40a5-a73c-e688d0f3622c.jpg?crop=1px%2C286px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_177192_0357_andy-cohen-vanderpump-rules-zoom-42caf5c6-6356-4c4b-8727-8a7f6811e805.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_177192_0357_andy-cohen-vanderpump-rules-zoom-c3800a9d-5572-40a5-a73c-e688d0f3622c.jpg?crop=1px%2C286px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Fischer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/vanderpump-rules-reunion-katie-apologizes-to-lala-w474845/", "title": "'Vanderpump Rules' Reunion: Katie Apologizes to Lala", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Katie Maloney took a step toward making amends with Lala Kent on Vanderpump Rules' Monday, April 3, season 5 reunion \u2014 read Us Weekly's recap", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Pump Rules' Reunion: Katie Apologizes to Lala, Scheana Talks Prenups", "description": "Katie Maloney took a step toward making amends with Lala Kent on Vanderpump Rules' Monday, April 3, season 5 reunion \u2014 read Us Weekly's recap", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/vanderpump-rules-reunion-katie-apologizes-to-lala-w474845/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T03:10:53+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_177192_0357_andy-cohen-vanderpump-rules-zoom-c3800a9d-5572-40a5-a73c-e688d0f3622c.jpg?crop=1px%2C286px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_177192_0357_andy-cohen-vanderpump-rules-zoom-c3800a9d-5572-40a5-a73c-e688d0f3622c.jpg?crop=1px%2C286px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-04-05T14:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T03:10:53+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Katie Maloney took a step toward making amends with Lala Kent on Vanderpump Rules' Monday, April 3, season 5 reunion \u2014 read Us Weekly's recap", "title": "'Pump Rules' Reunion: Katie Apologizes to Lala, Scheana Talks Prenups", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nup_177192_0357_andy-cohen-vanderpump-rules-zoom-c3800a9d-5572-40a5-a73c-e688d0f3622c.jpg?crop=1px%2C286px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491400860.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
