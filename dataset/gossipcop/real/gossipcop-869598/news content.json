It is loosely based on the 1985 film of the same name. The series stars Tyler Posey as Scott McCall, a teenager who is bitten by a werewolf, and Dylan O'Brien as \"Stiles\" Stilinski, Scott's best friend. The series received generally positive reviews from critics.[1][2][3][4]\n\nTeen Wolf premiered on June 5, 2011, following the 2011 MTV Movie Awards.[5] On July 21, 2016, the cast announced at Comic Con that the sixth season would be the series' final.[6] The series finale aired on September 24, 2017.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe series revolves around social outcast Scott McCall, a high school student living in the town of Beacon Hills. Scott's life drastically changes when he is bitten by a werewolf the night before sophomore year, becoming one himself. He must henceforth learn to balance his problematic new identity with his day-to-day teenage life.\n\nIn season one, Scott and his human best friend \"Stiles\" Stilinski begin to encounter other characters with a connection to the supernatural goings-on in Beacon Hills. Scott's initial love interest is Allison Argent, a classmate of his who comes from a family of werewolf hunters. Her best friend is popular girl and genius Lydia Martin, who later discovers she is a banshee. Scott and Stiles routinely clash with Lydia's aggressive boyfriend, jock Jackson Whittemore, as well as Derek Hale, a mysterious werewolf with a dark past. As the show progresses, Scott is joined by new friends: Malia Tate, a werecoyote; Kira Yukimura, a kitsune; and Liam Dunbar, a young werewolf with anger issues.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nTyler Posey as Scott McCall: Scott is turned into a werewolf in the series premiere and, alongside his friend Stiles, begins to uncover the complicated supernatural world of Beacon Hills, California.\n\nCrystal Reed as Allison Argent (seasons 1\u20133, guest season 5): Scott's love interest, Allison, descends from a long line of werewolf hunters.

On July 12, 2012, Teen Wolf was renewed for a third season, which includes 24 episodes and the production location was moved to Los Angeles, California.[10]\n\nThe third season premiered on June 3, 2013, at 10 pm,[11] giving the series a new high on ratings.[12] A fourth season premiered on June 23, 2014.[13] On July 24, 2014, MTV renewed Teen Wolf for a fifth season of 20 episodes, which was split into two parts, and premiered June 29, 2015.[15]\n\nOn July 9, 2015, Teen Wolf was renewed for a sixth season of 20 episodes. Showrunner Jeff Davis confirmed that Tyler Posey, Dylan O'Brien, Holland Roden, Shelley Hennig and Dylan Sprayberry would be reprising their roles as Scott McCall, \"Stiles\" Stilinski, Lydia Martin, Malia Tate and Liam Dunbar respectively.[16]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired Avg. viewers\n\n(millions) First aired Last aired 1 12 June 5, 2011 ( ) August 15, 2011 ( 2011-08-15 ) 1.73[17] 2 12 June 3, 2012 ( ) August 13, 2012 ( 2012-08-13 ) 1.69[17] 3 24 12 June 3, 2013 ( ) August 19, 2013 ( 2013-08-19 ) 1.97[18] 12 January 6, 2014 ( ) March 24, 2014 ( 2014-03-24 ) 4 12 June 23, 2014 ( ) September 8, 2014 ( 2014-09-08 ) 1.61[19] 5 20 10 June 29, 2015 ( ) August 24, 2015 ( 2015-08-24 ) 1.05[20] 10 January 5, 2016 ( ) March 8, 2016 ( 2016-03-08 ) 6 20 10 November 15, 2016 ( ) January 31, 2017 ( 2017-01-31 ) 0.47[21] 10 July 30, 2017 ( ) September 24, 2017 ( 2017-09-24 )\n\nDevelopment and production [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2009, MTV announced that they would be adapting the 1985 film Teen Wolf into a new television series \"with a greater emphasis on romance, horror and werewolf mythology\".[22]\n\nMTV's Teen Wolf series was a re-imagining of the earlier Michael J. Fox comedy film, which was itself a reimagining of the classic 1957 AIP film, I Was a Teenage Werewolf. The film had been previously adapted for television, as an animated series aired on CBS in 1986\u201387.\n\nFor the MTV series, creator and executive producer, Jeff Davis, aimed to develop a darker, sexier and edgier version than the 1985 film. Davis' desire was to make a thriller with comedic overtones but in a tone more similar to that of the 1987 vampire film The Lost Boys. According to Davis, it all started with an idea to do a homage to Stand by Me, where in the beginning, the kids go out and search for a body in the woods and it's not quite what they expect.[23] The look of the show was inspired in part by Guillermo del Toro's creatures in Pan's Labyrinth; the producers described the werewolves as beautiful, elegant and scary, at the same time.[23]\n\nOnce the show was a go, Davis lined up Australian director Russell Mulcahy, who added the horror to the project.[23] Mulcahy directed the pilot presentation and serves as executive producer and in-house director.[24]\n\nThe title card from season one.\n\nCasting announcements were all announced in December 2010, with the main cast being, Tyler Posey, Crystal Reed, Tyler Hoechlin, Dylan O'Brien, Holland Roden, and Colton Haynes. Posey was cast as the lead Scott McCall, a dorky high-school student who after being bitten by a werewolf, starts to notice changes in himself, Reed playing Allison Argent, a sweet new girl at school who is immediately attracted to Scott, Hoechlin playing Derek Hale, a handsome local boy who in fact is a vicious and predatory werewolf, and O'Brien playing Stiles, Scott's best friend. Roden playing Lydia Martin, Jackson Whittemore's popular and controlling girlfriend, and Haynes playing Jackson Whittemore, Scott's lacrosse teammate and rival.[25]\n\nProduction on twelve episodes began in October 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia.[26] MTV released a sneak peek of the first eight minutes of the pilot on their website, on May 31, 2011. Teen Wolf episodes are composed by music composer Dino Meneghin.[27] As of Season 2, the opening credits of the show changed dramatically to a longer format featuring the main characters appearing whilst performing an action (such as Colton Haynes performing a lacrosse throw), along with the respective names of the actors.\n\nThe new opening credits also feature the show's new theme song.[28] In June 2012, the series received conditional approval for a California film and TV tax credit.[29] At Comic-Con 2012, the cast confirmed that the show had been renewed for a longer third season, comprising twenty-four episodes.[30] In June 2013, the series was selected again for a California tax credit.[31]\n\nDifferences and similarities from films [ edit ]\n\nTeen Wolf shares no continuity with the 1985 film Teen Wolf or its sequel, Teen Wolf Too,[32][33] but does contain allusions to the film which inspired its premise. The original film is about a typical awkward basketball-playing teenager named Scott dealing with high school and life as a werewolf.[34][35] In both the film and show, Scott reaps the benefits of werewolf stardom, achieving confidence and acceptance from his peers with his newly-discovered powers, and has a close friend named Stiles. In the 1985 movie, Scott played basketball, whereas in the series, he plays lacrosse; Stiles wears retro British T-shirts in the TV series rather than the offensive T-shirts of the film; and Scott is transformed into a werewolf by bite in the series, whereas in the film he inherits the trait from his father.[34]\n\nWhile the Teen Wolf film is a comedy, the MTV series is a drama which includes dark themes, violence, and gore, as well as comedic elements; series developer Jeff Davis and other producers have referred to their indebtedness to Joss Whedon's supernatural drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Davis comments that Buffy's central metaphor was \"[h]igh school as a horror movie. And so the metaphor became the central concept behind Buffy, and that's how I sold [Teen Wolf].\"[citation needed] The writers decided early on to exclude vampires from their in-show mythology.[36]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nThe first season of the series generated a generally positive response from professional critics, with some praising it as better quality when compared to other shows by MTV. According to Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the show holds an average score of 61 out of 100, which indicates \"Generally favorable reviews\", based on fourteen reviews.[1] Metacritic also lists the show as the second-highest rated MTV series by professional critics behind Awkward.[44]\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 68% of 25 critics have given the first season a positive review. The site's consensus is: \"Thanks to a charismatic lead in Tyler Posey and some dark, biting humor, Teen Wolf is a pleasant summer surprise, even if it does tread familiar ground.\"[2] Linda Stasi, a writer from the New York Post, awarded the series' premiere a perfect score, stating, \"Not only is it really well thought out, but the good-looking kids in the show can actually act.\"[45] Verne Gay from Newsday also reserved high praise for the show, calling it a \"winner and best of all, fun\".[46] David Hinckley of New York Daily News commented favorably on the series, ending his review with \"Werewolves, pretty girls, dumb bullies and lacrosse. What more, really, could you ask of high school?\"[47] Film critic Rex Reed is a fan of the series, calling it \"the sexiest show on television today.\"\n\nSome critics had a less positive reaction toward the first episode. Troy Patterson from Slate gave it a mixed review, referring to it as \"light and passably witty supernatural drama\".[48] James Poniewozik from Time magazine also had mixed feelings towards the show, saying, \"The pilot isn't bad, exactly\u2014it's well-paced if a little dour in spots and there's some decent CW-esque banter\u2014but it's pretty much entirely what I would have expected from any supernatural teen drama\".[49] Following the first-season finale in August 2011, Ian Grey of indieWire gave the series a positive review[50] and Angel Cohn of Television Without Pity named it the third best new show of the summer.[51] BuddyTV ranked Teen Wolf #4 on its list of 2011's best new TV shows.[52]\n\nThe second season of the show received even more positive reviews than the first, with Rotten Tomatoes reporting a 90% approval rating based on 10 critical reviews.[3] The third season also received positive reviews, earning an approval rating of 88% based on 17 reviews.[4]\n\nDespite its generally positive reception, the show has struggled with representation of LGBTQ characters and issues, and been critiqued for queerbaiting.[53][54]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nThe series premiere attracted a total of 2.17 million viewers.[55] After airing its third episode, Teen Wolf was reported to be heading into its fourth week with tremendous momentum following a 23 percent increase among persons 12\u201334, with a 1.6 in the demo. With double digit percentage gains among total viewers and key demos, Teen Wolf was the #1 show in its timeslot with women 12\u201334.[56] The first-season finale attained a series high in persons 12\u201334 (1.9) and 2.1 million viewers overall, as well as being first in its timeslot among teens and females 12\u201334.[57]\n\nThe show's creator, Jeff Davis confirmed that the show benefits from a very significant online viewership, with up to eight million streams per episode on MTV's online platforms alone. Davis cited this as a significant contributing factor to MTV renewing the show for a sixth season.[58]\n\nSeason Timeslot (ET) Episodes First aired Last aired TV season Avg. viewers\n\n(millions) Date Viewers\n\n(millions) Date Viewers\n\n(millions) 1 Monday 10:00 pm 12 June 5, 2011 ( ) 2.17[59] August 15, 2011 ( 2011-08-15 ) 2.08[60] 2010\u201311 1.73[61] 2 12 June 4, 2012 ( ) 2.11[62] August 13, 2012 ( 2012-08-13 ) 1.71[63] 2011\u201312 1.69[61] 3 24 June 3, 2013 ( ) 2.36[64] March 24, 2014 ( 2014-03-24 ) 2.26[65] 2013\u201314 1.97[66] 4 12 June 23, 2014 ( ) 2.18[67] September 8, 2014 ( 2014-09-08 ) 1.54[68] 2013\u201314 1.61[69] 5 Monday 10:00 pm (Part 1)\n\nTuesday 9:00 pm (Part 2) 20 June 29, 2015 ( ) 1.53[70] March 8, 2016 ( 2016-03-08 ) 0.80[71] 2015\u201316 1.05[72] 6 Tuesday 9:00 pm (Part 1)\n\nSunday 8:00 pm (Part 2) 20 November 15, 2016 ( ) 0.57[73] September 24, 2017 ( 2017-09-24 ) 0.68[74] 2016\u201317 0.47[75]\n\nOther media [ edit ]\n\nBook [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2012, MTV Books released the book On Fire, by Nancy Holder.
