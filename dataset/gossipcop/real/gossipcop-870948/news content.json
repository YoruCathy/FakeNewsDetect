We did what consumer advocates say to do: When you are wronged, you fight back. We were unhappy with a situation, so we complained like anyone would. This court decision tells consumers not to speak up for fear of fat legal bills and painful judgments. If this is the cost of standing up for what\u2019s right, we should have given in to start with. But we hope to prevail in the end. We\u2019d love nothing more than to put this behind us and focus on raising our 5-month-old child.\n\nPolito, who hopes the jury\u2019s decision will help her rebuild a ruined career, was happy to share her version of the saga with The Washington Post.\n\nAfter more than a decade in the wedding photography business, she said, her studio was booked every weekend, months in advance, with couples from the poshest parts of Dallas and its suburbs.\n\nWhen the future Mrs. Moldovan opened an order in early 2014, she struck Polito as a friendly, fairly typical client \u2014 \u201cA 30 Something Dallas Lifestyle and Beauty Blogger,\u201d as Moldovan describes herself on her website.\n\nShe and Polito worked out a schedule for engagement, rehearsal and wedding shoots in the months ahead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfterward, Polito said, she warned her studio manager: \u201cShe\u2019s a blogger. Make sure everything looks perfect.\u201d\n\nPhotographers from the studio shot the wedding ceremony that October, and the studio sent the couple proofs the next month, according to court records.\n\n\u201cShe posted those all over social media,\u201d Polito said.\n\nAnd then Neely Moldovan began asking when she could have high-resolution versions of the photos.\n\nPolito said her studio, like many, withholds high-res images until the entire wedding package is completed, culminating in the delivery of a custom wedding album, usually months after the wedding.\n\nOtherwise, Polito said, \u201cphotographers will hand over the images and the bride disappears.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHer studio explained as much to Neely Moldovan, she said, and asked her to fill out a form with her album options.\n\nAD\n\nBut November and December went by. Then New Year\u2019s.\n\nOne week into 2015, the newlywed told her Twitter followers about the travails of choosing her photos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m finally getting around to filling this out,\u201d she wrote to the studio the same day. \u201cDo we pay extra for a cover?\u201d\n\nYes, she did. Having already paid the studio thousands, Moldovan was not happy about this.\n\n\u201cShe basically didn\u2019t read her paperwork or contract,\u201d Polito said. \u201cShe just couldn\u2019t understand why she couldn\u2019t have her high-res images. It\u2019s in bold in our contract.\u201d\n\nA string of explanatory emails between the couple and the studio unfolded over the following days.\n\nAD\n\nIn the midst of this, Polito\u2019s lawyers argued in court, Andrew and Neely Moldovan began emailing reporters across Dallas and beyond \u2014 promoting a looming news story to their friends and fans.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going apes\u2011\u2011\u2011 on our photographer,\u201d Andrew Moldovan texted a friend on Jan. 12, 2015, according to transcripts Polito\u2019s lawyer shared with The Post. \u201cWe want our f\u2011\u2011\u2011ing wedding album, which we already paid for.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that our story makes the news and completely ruins her business,\u201d Neely Moldovan wrote to someone the same day, according to court records.\n\nPolito knew nothing about this, she said, until her studio manager texted her a screenshot of Neely Moldovan\u2019s latest Instagram post: \u201cNo big deal NBC in our apt.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlthough she declined to appear on camera, Polito sent the local NBC reporter a page-long email: about albums and album covers, contracts, schedules and \u201ca-la-carte items\u201d the Moldovans had yet to pay for.\n\nAlmost none of that email appeared in the station\u2019s first January broadcast, which focused on the Moldovans, their empty picture frames and memories held \u201chostage,\u201d as the reporter put it, over a $150 album cover fee, which he said \u201cthe contract doesn\u2019t mention anything about.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThen, the station released a follow-up report a few days later, with many more details and a story not nearly so simple.\n\nThe NBC affiliate described months of conversation between the Moldovans and the studio. The minimum cost of an album cover was actually $125, and a wedding expert who had blasted Polito in the station\u2019s first segment was now defending her after learning more about the case.\n\nAD\n\nBut it didn\u2019t make much difference. \u201cThe damage had already been done,\u201d Polito told The Post.\n\nThe Moldovans\u2019 story was picked up across the United States and overseas.\n\nMeanwhile, court records show, Neely and Andrew Moldovan were busy on social media, advancing the \u201chostage\u201d narrative.\n\n\u201cBlatantly steals money from you all while holding your pictures ransom,\u201d a user named Andrew wrote in a review of the Moldovans\u2019 wedding shoot. The couple told the NBC station that people were impersonating them online, although Polito\u2019s lawyers would argue otherwise in court.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s done this to over 22 brides that have come forward,\u201d Neely Moldovan wrote, according to a screenshot shared by Polito\u2019s lawyer.\n\nAnd in another message: \u201cPretty sure her business is done.\u201d\n\nSo it was, Polito said.\n\nThe photographer had built her business \u2014 including a studio in downtown Dallas, with employees and contractors \u2014 largely on word of mouth, she told The Post.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t refer a bride when this is going on,\u201d she said.\n\nShe told the court that only two clients were willing to sign with her after news stories ran, and she had to shut her studio down and start living off savings.\n\nHer lawyers hired an analyst who estimated that she had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit by the time her 2015 lawsuit went to trial last week in Dallas County district court.\n\nThe trial had been long delayed. Accused of conspiracy, defamation and disparagement, the Moldovans tried to have the suit tossed and argued that Polito could not cite a single case of lost business, let alone prove that the couple had lied.\n\nAD\n\nA lawyer for the Moldovans declined to comment on the case.\n\nBut a judge let the case go forward. And on Friday, the jury sided with Polito, whose complaint described the couple as \u201cdead set in their pursuit of publicity and public shaming.\u201d\n\nAfter an afternoon of deliberation, a majority of jurors agreed that the Moldovans had defamed and disparaged Polito and her studio, and conspired to do so. The total price to make good was just over $1 million.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain that Polito will ever see the money. Her lawyer, Dave Wishnew, said he expects the couple to challenge the verdict before a judge orders them to pay.\n\nBut for Polito, who said she hasn\u2019t shot an event in years and has drained her savings and retirement accounts since the Moldovans took their complaints international, the verdict is vindication enough.\n\n\u201cFor two-and-a-half years I walked around my daughter\u2019s school feeling ashamed and embarrassed,\u201d she said. \u201cThey know I\u2019ve won now.\u201d\n\nThis post, originally published Aug. 1, has been updated with a statement sent by a public relations firm that says it is representing the Moldovans.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/af059975-28c8-4691-aa32-82c8154c18e0.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RcfdaZucLbyVwt_vHJPzufY6nSE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PXVCFDF4PYZI3E4WRTF3ZGVZZM.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RcfdaZucLbyVwt_vHJPzufY6nSE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PXVCFDF4PYZI3E4WRTF3ZGVZZM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Avi Selk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/08/01/they-trashed-their-wedding-photographer-over-a-125-fee-so-a-jury-told-them-to-pay-her-1-million/", "title": "They trashed their wedding photographer over a $125 fee, so a jury told them to pay her $1 million", "meta_data": {"description": "After being forced out of business, the Texas photographer convinced a jury that a professional beauty blogger and her new husband had conspired to destroy her reputation.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/true-crime/wp/2017/08/01/they-trashed-their-wedding-photographer-over-a-125-fee-so-a-jury-told-them-to-pay-her-1-million/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/RcfdaZucLbyVwt_vHJPzufY6nSE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PXVCFDF4PYZI3E4WRTF3ZGVZZM.jpg", "title": "They trashed their wedding photographer over a $125 fee, so a jury told them to pay her $1 million", "description": "After being forced out of business, the Texas photographer convinced a jury that a professional beauty blogger and her new husband had conspired to destroy her reputation."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "They trashed their wedding photographer over a $125 fee, so a jury told them to pay her $1 million", "description": "After being forced out of business, the Texas photographer convinced a jury that a professional beauty blogger and her new husband had conspired to destroy her reputation."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-01T00:20:55.876Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501516800.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
