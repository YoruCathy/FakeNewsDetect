The letter also ran as a full-page ad in The New York Times, and in La Opinion, a Spanish-language newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard and acknowledged in male-dominated workplaces must end; time\u2019s up on this impenetrable monopoly,\u201d the letter says.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cara Buckley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/movies/times-up-hollywood-women-sexual-harassment.html", "title": "Powerful Hollywood Women Unveil Anti-Harassment Action Plan", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-01-01T10:00:29.000Z", "modified": "2018-01-01T10:00:28.000Z", "section": "Movies", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/cara-buckley", "tag": "50/50by2020", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005625107, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/4f35a7ab-6adb-55ff-ade1-2e929d844d01", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/7ac120b666dd424c9313f9108d18a90e", "description": "Shonda Rhimes and Reese Witherspoon are among the 300 actresses and insiders behind Time\u2019s Up, an initiative for legal protections for workers nationwide.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Cara Buckley", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Sexual harassment,Women and Girls,MeToo Movement,Actor,TV,Movies,Time's Up,50/50by2020", "pdate": 20180101, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/movies/times-up-hollywood-women-sexual-harassment.html", "type": "article", "title": "Powerful Hollywood Women Unveil Anti-Harassment Action Plan", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/arts/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO/02WOMEN-FIGHT-BACK-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Some of the women who have established Time&rsquo;s Up, clockwise from top left: the actresses America Ferrera and Eva Longoria; the lawyer Nina L.
