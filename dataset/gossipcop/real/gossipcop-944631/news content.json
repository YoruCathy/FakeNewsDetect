Television, and it did so just in the nick of time. The cast's options were set to expire at day's end, according to Deadline.\n\nLucifer, based on the DC Comics character of the fallen angel who moves to Los Angeles, bowed to so-so ratings when it debuted at midseason in 2015. It managed to earn two renewals but saw viewership drop in its final year.\n\nIt averaged 3.3 million total viewers in live-plus-same-day-DVR-playback, according to Nielsen. Though it added another 1.7 million with seven-day DVR playback, it ranked only 109th out of 169 programs on the Big Five this past season. By contrast, the top shows drew more than 21 million.\n\nFox made a late call on the drama, opting to cancel it after the season finale ended on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe decision made sense for a network in flux. Fox has been struggling to find its identity since American Idol went off the air and Empire's ratings cooled.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fe131bd582e06c68c2548634779b238b?s=400&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F968155116%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/dam/imageserve/968155116/960x0.jpg?fit=scale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F968155116%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toni Fitzgerald"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2018/06/15/lucifer-renewed-but-not-at-fox-why-netflix-revived-the-drama/", "title": "Lucifer Renewed But Not At Fox: Why Netflix Revived The Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Lucifer Renewed But Not At Fox: Why Netflix Revived The Drama", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F968155116%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2018-06-15T22:38:33-04:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180616044833/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2018/06/15/lucifer-renewed-but-not-at-fox-why-netflix-revived-the-drama/", "description": "Fox canceled Lucifer in May.
