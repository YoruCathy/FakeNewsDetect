{"url": "https://stylecaster.com/bella-thorne-bisexual-dating-girls/", "text": "Sitting down with Bella Thorne, there\u2019s an immediate intimacy that makes an interview feel more like a long talk with a best friend rather than a celebrity. Thorne and I sat together cross-legged on the floor of a soundstage in Los Angeles earlier this year to talk about life, and though girlfriend is only 19 years old, she often comes off as older than her years, thanks to her refreshing honesty.\n\nThe event was to celebrate Thorne\u2019s partnership with SIX:02 and the launch of a video in which Thorne thanks her haters, because, as she put it in the video, \u201cI totally would be here without you, but it wouldn\u2019t be so much fun.\u201d\n\nThorne and I discussed what it\u2019s like to be cyberbullied and her best strategies to survive internet trolls. Turns out, she approaches her haters much like she approaches the rest of her life\u2014with a frankness that cuts straight to the source and doesn\u2019t try to take the easy way out by pretending it\u2019s not happening.\n\nThe \u201cFamous in Love\u201d actress, dressed head to toe in athleisure gear from SIX:02, also went on the record about why it\u2019s so hard to date women, why she\u2019s a strong proponent of the no-makeup selfie, what she does to fall asleep (hint: it may or may not involve weed), and her celebrity girl crushes. If there\u2019s anything I can say definitively about Thorne, it\u2019s that she DGAF what anyone thinks.\n\nSTYLECASTER: Do you always do your own makeup?\n\nBella Thorne: Pretty much on all my films, I do my own makeup. When I go to most events, I do my own makeup. When I did all the \u201cFamous in Love\u201d press, I did all of my shit myself, except my hair. I did my styling myself\u2014I just picked out random shit.\n\n\u201c Don\u2019t judge me by my Instagram page, because you don\u2019t know me. \u201d\n\nSC: Do you wear makeup on your days off?\n\nBT: If I can go without wearing makeup, I am not wearing makeup\u2026and I definitely do go out of my way to show people what my skin really looks like.\n\nA lot of times you see people on social and everybody just looks so perfect like, \u201cOh my god. Look at that girl. How is she even so beautiful? Why aren\u2019t I that pretty?\u201d For me, I\u2019m just like, what you see on social isn\u2019t real. Don\u2019t judge me by my Instagram page, because you don\u2019t know me.\n\nSo I do go out of my way to be like, \u201cYo, I take off my makeup\u201d and \u201cLook at what I look like in the mirror every day before I put on my makeup and after I take it off.\u201d It\u2019s not great. I struggle with it every day. I feel like most people at some point in their lives go through acne. There\u2019s really nobody that\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve never had a pimple.\u201d Shut up\u2014yes, you have.\n\nSC: What do you do when you can\u2019t sleep?\n\nBT: When I can\u2019t sleep, I smoke a J. Sometimes I do a lot of night shoots, and I\u2019m going to bed at 8 a.m. And then I\u2019m getting up and I\u2019m working from 4 p.m. until 10 a.m. It totally fucks up my schedule, so when I get back, it\u2019s lights out. Sometimes I can\u2019t fall asleep because my mind\u2019s spinning so fast, so I\u2019ll go and write about it. I\u2019m writing a blog or I\u2019ll write my series, and I\u2019ll put something new that I\u2019m thinking about into there. I just find a way to channel it into something.\n\nSC: You\u2019ve talked about wanting to date girls\u2014how is that going?\n\nBT: It\u2019s so hard. I can\u2019t tell if a girl is trying to be best friends with me or if she wants to get with me or if she just wants social media followers. I\u2019m just so confused when a girl talks to me. Girls can be very flirtatious, so I don\u2019t want to make a move, and then you be like, \u201cWhoa, girl. Not what I was thinking, I don\u2019t roll that way.\u201d\n\nThen it\u2019s so awkward. So I end up usually dating more guys, because with guys, I know if a guy\u2019s hitting me up. They\u2019re not just texting me to be my bestie. I know they want something, of some sort.\n\n\u201c I can\u2019t tell if a girl is trying to be best friends or if she wants to get with me. \u201d\n\nI have this girl that\u2019s always, like, \u201cOMG, you\u2019re so gorgeous,\u201d and she\u2019s always hitting on me, and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to make a move and then you\u2019re, like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not gay,\u2019 and then I\u2019m, like, \u2018Oh, this is so awkward. Nw you feel like I just ruined our friendship because it\u2019s just too weird.\u2019\u201d\n\nI like when girls are upfront with me. This Brazilian girl contacts me on Instagram and she\u2019s, like, \u201cYo, I wanna date you. Like, I straight up want to fuck with you. Like, I think you\u2019re so hot.\u201d And I was, like, \u201cThis is awesome. Hell yeah, this is so cool.\u201d But when a girl just hits me up and they\u2019re like, \u201cOMG, babe. Let\u2019s hang out. You\u2019re so beautiful. Let\u2019s take a Snapchat\u201d\u2014I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\nSC: If you keep putting it out there that you\u2019re open to dating men and women, maybe it\u2019ll get easier as time passes.\n\nBT: If I like somebody, they know. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a guy or a girl. I\u2019m always, like, \u201cYo, I literally would get with you. I will tell you right now. I don\u2019t want to make this awkward, but you are so hot. Please, come up on me. I want to take you on a date.\u201d\n\nOr, I\u2019ll get a lot of girls that randomly write me. I\u2019ve got this one girl that writes me and she\u2019s like, \u201cHey, I wanna fuck you. Like, hey, come to me baby. What\u2019s up?\u201d I know her through a social setting, and she\u2019s always coming at it so hard, and I\u2019m, like, \u201cYes, girl, you are just being so upfront, but can we hold up? Can I take you on a date? Because I would really like to do that.\u201d And this girl is, like, \u201cJust come to me, baby. I wanna kiss.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m like, \u201cWe can do that, but can I also open the door for you? I wanna take you out.\u201d And some girls are just, like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d because a lot of girls are not out, especially if they\u2019re in the industry, which is most of the people that I know. Then they\u2019re, like, \u201cOh, no. We can\u2019t date. We can hook up.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t hook up with people. I\u2019m not gonna just waste my time here. I want a relationship\u2014what are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201c I don\u2019t hook up with people, I\u2019m not gonna just waste my time here. I want a relationship. \u201d\n\nSC: Who are your girl crushes?\n\nBT: Demi Lovato. That\u2019s an obvious one. I love Demi. We\u2019re close. She\u2019s amazing, just such a beautiful person inside and out. Love everything she stands for. Kristen Stewart\u2014I\u2019m like, \u201cPlease.\u201d She\u2019s so hot. Oh. My. God. You put on those fucking Converse, girl. You put on that rock shirt, and you come to mommy. I literally love Kristen Stewart.\n\nWho else is super hot? Oh, Camila Cabello. I think she\u2019s so hot. I just saw her at a party the other night, but she was with a guy, so I wasn\u2019t gonna hit on her because she was with a date.\n\nSC: You can slip into her DMs later.\n\nBT: Seriously! To this person, I was like, \u201cHey, I follow you on Insta,\u201d and he was, like, \u201cOh, you want the Insta follow-back?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, I really just want the DM, if you know what I\u2019m saying, DM me, bro. Come at me.\u201d I\u2019m pretty honest.\n\nSC: Speaking of social media, what would you tell your followers to do if they\u2019re being harassed online?\n\nBT: Everybody goes through bullying. It doesn\u2019t matter what point in your life it is\u2014you will be bullied. You may be bullied throughout your whole entire life, because the world is a mean place, and people like to hate. You got to be open because anybody you talk to is going to say, \u201cYou know what, I have experienced that, and here\u2019s what I think about it.\u201d\n\n\u201c Everybody goes through bullying. It doesn\u2019t matter what point in your life it is\u2014you will be bullied. \u201d\n\nAnd the more conversation goes on about it, the more positivity you can spread with other people. If that negative experience that\u2019s happened to you can actually help somebody else, that is what is beautiful. That is taking something ugly, and that is saying, \u201cFuck you, I\u2019m gonna make this happy anyway, and I\u2019m not gonna let it affect me. I\u2019m going to help somebody else somewhere in the world.\u201d Which is what I try to do, and hopefully other people see that on my socials, and they try it too.", "images": ["https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/bibi-dietz.jpeg?resize=%2C", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/thorne2.jpg?w=477&h=670", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/chris-harrison.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bella-thorne-interview.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tiger-king-netflix-1.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/blackpink-jisoo.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/thorne5.jpg?w=477&h=670", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1130306277008218&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/thorne1.jpg?w=477&h=670", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/prince-harry.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=stylecaster.com&path=%2Fbella-thorne-bisexual-dating-girls%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=695151", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/thorne7.jpg?w=477&h=670"], "top_img": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/bella-thorne-interview.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bibi Deitz"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/bella-thorne-bisexual-dating-girls/", "title": "The Relatable Reason Bella Thorne Dates More Men Than Women", "meta_data": {"description": "In an interview with StyleCaster, Bella Thorne opens up about her biggest issue with dating girls as a bisexual, smoking weed to help her fall asleep, why she posts no-makeup selfies on Instagram, and how she overcame her cyberbullies.
