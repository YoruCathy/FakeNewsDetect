News as she walked the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere of her upcoming thriller The Beguiled.\n\nThe actress, who turns 50 on June 20, added, \u201cI\u2019ve already been to Australia and saw my mom and it\u2019s too far for her to travel but my sister is coming over with all her children. She has six kids.\u201d\n\nKidman and Urban share two daughters, Sunday, 8, and Faith, 6. She also has two adult children, Isabella, 24, and Connor, 22, from her marriage to Tom Cruise.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it for me,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t need any big parties; I just need my family around me.

I\u2019m like, \u2018low-key. Please low-key!\u2019 But definitely make me a cake.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cMy favorite is coconut cake.
