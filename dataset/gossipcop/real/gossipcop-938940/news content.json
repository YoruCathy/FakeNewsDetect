The Teen Mom 2 star revealed on Thursday, May 24, that she sees a fourth child in her future.\n\n\u201cI want one more,\u201d the 26-year-old shared on her podcast Coffee Convos With Kail Lowry and Lindsie Chrisley.\n\nKailyn is open to having No. 4 on her own, but she wants her next pregnancy to be with fellow Teen Mom 2 star Chelsea Houska, who appeared on the Thursday episode.\n\n\u201cI think we should make a pact that you and Cole [DeBoer] and I go to the sperm bank and we\u2019ll get pregnant together at the time same,\u201d the Hustle and Heart author declared. She then clarified that she will make a solo trip to the sperm bank, but wants Chelsea, 26, and husband Cole to get busy around the same time as her insemination.\n\n\u201cThat would be cute,\u201d said Kailyn. \u201cYou know how Snooki and JWoww did their little show on MTV. Ours could be about our pregnancy.\u201d\n\nThe mom of three is serious about using a donor. \u201cI already started looking at banks,\u201d she revealed on the show. The MTV personality noted that all donors must have a minimum of a bachelor\u2019s degree and that she\u2019d look for \u201ctall, dark and handsome. Maybe a PhD.\u201d\n\nWhile the reality star confirmed to Radar Online that she is thinking about \u201cmore kids, yes,\u201d she added, \u201cno more baby daddies! The sperm bank thing would be a different scenario because it wouldn\u2019t be a involved.\u201d\n\nIf Kailyn has another boy, she won\u2019t need to buy any new baby clothes. She shares Issac, 8, with former boyfriend Jo Rivera; Lincoln, 4, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin; and Lux, 9 months, with ex Chris Lopez.\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, shares daughter Aubree, 8, with ex-boyfriend Adam Lind. The licensed aesthetician and Cole are parents of 16-month-old son Watson, and will welcome a baby girl in September!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kailyn-lowry.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kailyn-lowry.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kailyn-lowry-wants-baby-no-4-and-is-looking-at-sperm-banks/", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Wants Baby No. 4 and Is Looking at Sperm Banks", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Star revealed on Thursday, May 24, that she wants baby No. 4 and is looking at sperm banks \u2014\u00a0get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Wants Baby No. 4 and Is\u00a0\u2018Already\u2019 Looking at Sperm Banks", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Star revealed on Thursday, May 24, that she wants baby No. 4 and is looking at sperm banks \u2014\u00a0get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kailyn-lowry-wants-baby-no-4-and-is-looking-at-sperm-banks/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-25T17:08:06+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kailyn-lowry.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kailyn-lowry.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "teen mom 2", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-05-25T16:47:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-25T17:08:06+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Star revealed on Thursday, May 24, that she wants baby No. 4 and is looking at sperm banks \u2014\u00a0get the details", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Wants Baby No. 4 and Is\u00a0\u2018Already\u2019 Looking at Sperm Banks", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kailyn-lowry.jpg?crop=0px%2C158px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527266874.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
