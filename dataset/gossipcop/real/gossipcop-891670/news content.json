On November 16, 2017, London\u2019s Old Vic Theatre, where Spacey served as artistic director from 2004 to 2015, announced that a hotline it set up to facilitate its investigation into Spacey had received 20 allegations of \u201ca range of inappropriate behavior,\u201d all concerning young men over the age of 18.\n\nThe allegations have brought about a flood of damage control as multiple Hollywood entities seek to distance themselves from the actor. Netflix, Spacey\u2019s agent, his publicist, and the industry at large have all backed away from him \u2014 he\u2019s been effectively fired from House of Cards and was completely recast in All the Money in the World, amid plenty of other fallout.\n\nThe revelations of his alleged behavior took a bizarre turn on Christmas Eve 2018, when Spacey released a bizarre video via his official Twitter account and what appeared to be a YouTube fan channel, in which he attempted to address the public. (Some internet onlookers have questioned the possibility that the video is a fake, an example of a creepy computer-generated simulation known as a \u201cdeepfake.\u201d) The video, called \u201cLet Me Be Frank,\u201d tacitly presented Spacey as Frank Underwood, his former character from House of Cards. The video appeared just as news broke that Spacey would be arraigned in Nantucket District Court in January 2019 on criminal charges related to the alleged 2016 assault of a then-18-year-old at a bar.\n\nIn the video, Spacey seems to simultaneously be referencing both the allegations made against him and the \u201cdeath\u201d of his fictional House of Cards character \u2014 who was promptly killed off after Netflix first suspended production on the show following the allegations against Spacey, and then promoted Robin Wright to solo lead for the show\u2019s sixth and final season.\n\nIn language that recalls several of the more disturbing allegations of nonconsensual physical assault made against Spacey, the actor seems to tell the audience that he\u2019s making a comeback, regardless of what they say they want:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done, no matter what anyone says. And besides, I know what you want. You want me back.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what we know so far about the allegations that have surfaced against Spacey, and the consequences that have ensued.\n\nAnthony Rapp accused Spacey of assaulting him when Rapp was 14. Spacey deflected by coming out as gay.\n\nRapp is a veteran Broadway actor best known for originating the role of Mark in Rent; he\u2019s currently playing Star Trek\u2019s first openly gay character on the CBS All Access series Star Trek: Discovery. He told BuzzFeed that Spacey befriended him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old and performing in the Broadway play Precious Sons. According to Rapp, Spacey made \u201ca sexual advance\u201d toward him while he was attending a party at Spacey\u2019s home.\n\nAfter his claims went public on October 29, 2017, Rapp stated on Twitter that he was coming forward in solidarity with the dozens of women who\u2019ve made allegations against Harvey Weinstein, as well as other assault survivors, \u201cstanding on the shoulders of the many courageous women and men who have been speaking out to shine a light and hopefully make a difference.\u201d\n\nSpacey responded to Rapp\u2019s allegations by issuing a statement on Twitter in which he said he owed Rapp \u201cthe sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d Spacey then added, \u201cThis story has encouraged me to address other things about my life. I know that there are stories out there about me and that some have been fueled by the fact I have been so protective of my privacy. ... I choose now to live as a gay man. I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior.\u201d\n\nThe statement marked the first time Spacey had ever officially publicly confirmed his sexuality, which is usually something to celebrate. But many people interpreted his statement and his choice to come out in response to Rapp\u2019s allegations as an attempt to distract from the seriousness of the charge that he had preyed on an underage target. Backlash was swift, as Spacey\u2019s move was widely rejected and criticized, with some observers decrying the way it helped fuel a damaging myth that conflates queer male identity with pedophilia.\n\nAnd in the days that followed, several other accusers came forward to make their own allegations against Spacey, challenging his implication that his behavior was an isolated incident of irresponsible drunkenness.\n\nMore than 30 accusers have come forward against Spacey with allegations that span decades. Here\u2019s a rundown.\n\nSince Rapp came forward, numerous other allegations against Spacey have surfaced. More than a dozen men have made specific claims against the actor. Many of Spacey\u2019s accusers describe witnessing or experiencing behavior from the actor that, like Weinstein, involved using the lure of his success and the opportunity of career mentorship to put himself in a position where he could then prey on young men. Taken together, the allegations suggest a pattern of escalating physical contact, the consistent presence of alcohol, and Spacey making a habit of cornering his victims in order to confront them.\n\nHere are the allegations we know so far.\n\n1983\u20131984: anonymous 14-year-old boy\n\nAn anonymous man told New York magazine that in 1983, when he was 14 and Spacey was 24, he began a sexual relationship with Spacey that allegedly culminated in Spacey attempting to rape him.\n\nThe anonymous actor stated that his relationship with Spacey lasted about a year, during which time he became aware that \u201c25-year-olds don\u2019t have sex with 14- and 15-year-olds, that that\u2019s wrong, that I was not the guilty party and I could leave.\u201d He told New York that the relationship ended when he was 15, after Spacey allegedly attempted to rape him.\n\n\u201cMr. Spacey absolutely denies the allegations,\u201d a representative for Spacey told the magazine.\n\n1985: anonymous 17-year-old boy\n\nThe BBC reported on November 1, 2017, that Spacey allegedly approached an anonymous 17-year-old boy in 1985, befriending the teen and then ultimately inviting him to visit his home, where Spacey progressed from being \u201ccharming and brotherly\u201d to sexually inappropriate. After rejecting Spacey\u2019s initial advances, the accuser says he woke up to find \u201cSpacey's head on his stomach and his arms wrapped around him.\u201d The anonymous source described Spacey to the BBC as \u201ceither very stupid or predatory or ... both,\u201d and noted that Spacey had not been drunk during their encounter.\n\n\"It seems he was grooming me,\" the anonymous source told the BBC.\n\n1986: Kate Edwards\n\nWhen London performing arts teacher Kate Edwards was 17, she worked as a production assistant for the 1986 Broadway revival of Long Day\u2019s Journey Into Night, in which Spacey starred alongside his longtime idol Jack Lemmon. Edwards alleged to the BBC that Spacey, then 27, invited her up to his flat for an apparently nonexistent party, where he kissed her. When it became clear he wanted sex, she made her excuses about wanting to leave, alleging that he then \u201cbecame cold\u201d and told her to \u201cfind [her] own way\u201d home.\n\nEdwards said that Spacey subsequently \u201ccut her dead\u201d after the encounter, telling the BBC that she became depressed and eventually had to quit the show because of how \u201cconfused, completely isolated, ashamed\u201d she felt over the incident.\n\n1988: Justin Dawes\n\nA man named Justin Dawes told BuzzFeed that he met a 29-year-old Spacey through a Connecticut theater when he was 16 years old and a junior in high school. Spacey allegedly invited Dawes and a friend to hang out at his apartment, where he served them cocktails and showed gay porn. According to BuzzFeed, even though nothing else happened, \u201cat the time, the 16-year-old felt like he \u2018should've realized\u2019 that Spacey wanted him to come over for reasons related to sex.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew that I was in high school,\u201d Dawes told BuzzFeed. \u201cIt was pretty clear.\u201d\n\n1995: Mark Ebenhoch\n\nMark Ebenhoch told BuzzFeed that he had been working as a military adviser on the set of Outbreak, in which Spacey played a supporting role, when one of Spacey\u2019s on-set assistants propositioned him on Spacey\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cThey asked flat out to engage in a sexual act,\u201d Ebenhoch alleged. \u201cIt was enough to stun me. It blew me away.\u201d Ebenhoch told BuzzFeed that he rejected the invitation and avoided Spacey for the duration of the production.\n\n1995: anonymous crew member on the film Albino Alligator\n\nThe BBC reported that while working on the 1995 film Albino Alligator, which marked Spacey\u2019s film debut, the actor allegedly harassed an anonymous crew member who was 22 years old at the time. According to the anonymous crew member, Spacey initially seemed friendly and took an interest in his career, but progressed to \u201ccreepy\u201d behavior such as giving him an unwanted massage.\n\n\"On one of the last days of shooting ... he sat down next to me and put his thigh against mine and put his hand on my thigh and moved it towards my inner thigh,\u201d the man alleged. \u201cI felt trapped. I felt harassed, sexually harassed.\"\n\n1995-2015: at least 20 young men, the Old Vic Theatre\n\nSpacey\u2019s involvement with the Old Vic Theatre began in the mid-\u201990s, when he was involved in several highly acclaimed productions there, spearheaded a successful fundraising campaign to keep the theater from closing, and became one of its most significant donors. He ultimately assumed the position of artistic director for the Old Vic, a role he held from 2004 to 2015.\n\nAfter the allegations against Spacey came to light, the Old Vic set up a confidential email to receive tips and reports about the actor, while claiming in a public statement that it was \u201cdeeply dismayed\u201d to hear about the allegations. Meanwhile, multiple allegations concerning Spacey\u2019s behavior while at the Old Vic began to surface.\n\nOn November 1, 2017, Mexican actor Robert Cavazos discussed past encounters at the Old Vic with Spacey in a Facebook post (written in Spanish). Cavazos alleged that Spacey touched him inappropriately numerous times, and said that Spacey would frequently grope men while hanging out at the Old Vic\u2019s bar.\n\n\u201cIt appears that all that was needed was a male under the age of 30 for Mr. Spacey to feel free to touch us,\u201d Cavazos wrote. \u201cIt was so common that it turned into a local joke (in very bad taste).\u201d\n\nOn November 3, 2017, BuzzFeed reported that an anonymous actor recently contacted the Old Vic to report that Spacey \u201crepeatedly sexually assaulted him in a public place in 2013.\u201d No further detail was reported, but the actor told BuzzFeed that Spacey treated the theater \u201clike a playground.\u201d\n\nOn November 16, 2017, the Old Vic announced that it had received 20 \u201cpersonal testimonies\u201d through its investigation into Spacey. These claims reportedly ranged \u201cfrom behaviour that made people feel uncomfortable all the way through to sexually inappropriate behaviour.\u201d The claims spanned 1995 through 2013, with most occurring before 2009. All of the claims involved young men, all of whom were over the age of 18 at the time of the alleged incidents.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the Old Vic had urged 14 of the 20 respondents to go to the police with their allegations, but couldn\u2019t confirm whether any of them had done so.\n\n2003: director Tony Montana\n\nDirector Tony Montana was the second person to publicly come forward with an allegation against Spacey. On October 31, 2017, he told the gossip website Radar Online that Spacey physically assaulted him in 2003, when Montana was in his 30s. Montana alleges that Spacey approached him in a bar, groped him, and said, \u201cthis designates ownership,\u201d as he did so. \u201cI had PTSD for six months after\u201d the incident, Montana said.\n\nDate unspecified: anonymous journalist\n\nAn anonymous journalist gave a detailed account to BuzzFeed of an incident that occurred in London during the early 2000s, when the journalist was in his early 20s. The journalist was assigned to interview Spacey at his office at the Old Vic; after the interview, Spacey allegedly invited the journalist to hang out with him and some friends at a club, where he allegedly groped the journalist \u201caggressively\u201d despite repeated attempts to get him to stop. When the journalist told Spacey he was in a committed relationship with a woman, it seemed to make no difference; when he tried to leave, Spacey implored him to stay. \u201cHe had somehow convinced himself that this was a sexual liaison that we both wanted,\u201d the journalist told BuzzFeed.\n\nFinally, the journalist said, Spacey tried to prevent him from leaving:\n\n[Spacey] was screaming in my face outside of the main bar area, red-faced, spit flying out of his mouth, screaming at me with fury because I didn't want to fuck him. He was actually saying that I did want to and I was a coward. That was his tactic. It was unbelievable.\n\nThe journalist said he reported the incident to his editor, who confirmed as much to BuzzFeed, and the story ultimately ran without a byline. The journalist told BuzzFeed that a major concern that prevented him from going public with the incident was his fear of outing Spacey as gay. \u201cBeing closeted has for him enabled him to use this privacy claim as a shield against anybody looking closely at his actual behavior,\u201d he said.\n\n2007: bartender Kris Nixon\n\nAccording to the BBC, Belfast bartender Kris Nixon met Spacey in 2007 while Nixon was working at a cocktail bar in London near the Old Vic. In a videotaped interview, Nixon told the BBC that after attending a party at Spacey\u2019s penthouse, \"Kevin Spacey sat down next to me on a sofa, then reached over and grabbed my penis,\" declaring to Nixon, \u201cI could fuck you better than [Nixon\u2019s girlfriend, who was also in attendance].\u201d\n\nNixon claimed that he left the party immediately but encountered Spacey again two weeks later while he was on shift at the bar where he\u2019d first met Spacey. Nixon alleges that Spacey followed him down to a basement storeroom and cornered him, grabbing him by the waistband and offering to \u201cmake it up to [him].\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t speak out at the time because I didn\u2019t think anyone would believe me,\u201d Nixon said, adding that he \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to risk getting fired.\u201d Nixon told the BBC that by coming forward, Rapp has made it possible for others to speak out. \u201cNow that it\u2019s become clear that this is a pattern of behavior,\u201d he said, \u201cI feel I have a responsibility to say what happened, so that other people, who maybe don\u2019t yet feel in a position to speak out, feel empowered to do so.\u201d\n\n2007: writer Ari Behn\n\nAri Behn is a Norwegian writer who was married to Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise when he attended the 14th Annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo in December 2007. The concert was hosted by Spacey and Uma Thurman.\n\nAfterward, according to an on-air interview Behn gave to the Norwegian radio network P4 on December 5, 2017, Spacey and Behn attended an afterparty at a nightclub, where they were seated next to each other.\n\n\u201cAfter five minutes, he says, 'Hey, let's go out and have a cigarette,\u2019\u201d Behn recalled, saying that Spacey then reached \u201cunder the table\u201d and groped his genitals.\n\nBehn said he responded with, \u201cEh, maybe later,\u201d and declined the invitation. He seemed to laugh off the incident.\n\n2008: actor Harry Dreyfuss\n\nIn a piece he wrote for BuzzFeed, actor Harry Dreyfuss alleged that Spacey groped him when he was 18 years old, recalling an incident that took place while he was helping his father, the actor Richard Dreyfuss, rehearse for a play at Spacey\u2019s London apartment.\n\nIn a very detailed account, Dreyfuss describes how Spacey touched him inappropriately throughout the rehearsal, and describes his failed attempts to stop Spacey from fondling him without disrupting the rehearsal or alerting his father. Thinking back to what was going through his head at the time, Dreyfuss writes:\n\nLooking into his eyes, I gave the most meager shake of my head that I could manage. I was trying to warn him without alerting my dad, who still had his eyes glued to the page. I thought I was protecting everyone. I was protecting my dad\u2019s career. I was protecting Kevin, who my dad surely would have tried to punch. I was protecting myself, because I thought one day I\u2019d want to work with this man. Kevin had no reaction and kept his hand there. My eyes went back to the script and I kept reading.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect, what disgusts me about Kevin was how safe he did feel,\u201d Dreyfuss concluded. \u201cHe knew he could fondle me in a room with my father and that I wouldn\u2019t say a word.\u201d\n\nSpacey denied Dreyfuss\u2019s allegations via his lawyer.\n\n2008: anonymous 23-year-old man\n\nAccording to Variety in 2017, Scotland Yard began an investigation into a claim that a man who is believed to be Spacey assaulted a 23-year-old bartender in London in 2008. \u201cOn 1 November, City of London police referred an allegation of sexual assault to the Metropolitan police service,\u201d a Scotland Yard spokesperson said in a press statement released November 3, 2017. \u201cIt is alleged a man assaulted another man in 2008 in Lambeth. Officers from the child abuse and sexual offences command are investigating.\u201d\n\nThough Scotland Yard has not named Spacey as the alleged perpetrator, Variety notes that the incident being investigated took place in the South London neighborhood of Lambeth, where Spacey maintains a home. The details, which were first reported by the British tabloid the Sun, allegedly involve the victim approaching Spacey to ask for help with his career, passing out after smoking weed at Spacey\u2019s apartment, and waking up to find Spacey performing oral sex on him. The man, who is now 32, is said to have reported the incident to police in early November 2017, after other allegations against Spacey became public.\n\n2010: Daniel Beal\n\nA British bartender named Daniel Beal told the Sun that Spacey flashed his genitals at him in 2010, while Beal was working at a bar in West Sussex. Beal, then 19, photographed himself at the time wearing an expensive watch, which was allegedly given to him by Spacey shortly after the incident, apparently to buy his silence.\n\n2016: the teenage son of journalist Heather Unruh\n\nHeather Unruh, a former news anchor for the Boston news outlet WVCB, was one of the first people to mention Spacey in the wake of the Weinstein allegations, when her October 13, 2017, tweet that the actor had assaulted a loved one went viral. At a press conference in Boston on November 8, 2017, Unruh provided details of the assault, alleging that Spacey came on to her then-18-year-old son at a restaurant in Nantucket.\n\nAccording to Unruh, Spacey encountered her son at Nantucket\u2019s Club Car Restaurant in July 2016. Spacey \u201cbought [her underage son] drink after drink after drink,\u201d then sexually assaulted him. \"Spacey stuck his hand inside my son's pants and grabbed his genitals,\" Unruh alleged. \"My son's efforts to shift his body to remove Spacey's hand were only momentarily successful. My son panicked, he froze. He was intoxicated.\"\n\nUnruh claims that after Spacey repeatedly pressured her son to attend a party with him, Spacey got up to go to the bathroom, at which point a woman at the bar approached her \u201cvery shaken\u201d son and told him to \u201crun.\u201d Her son left, and disclosed the incident to his sister and Unruh later that night.\n\nUnruh stated that her son had filed a police report against Spacey with the Nantucket Police Department. A spokesperson for the Cape and Islands District Attorney\u2019s Office told Boston.com that \u201can individual has provided information to the Nantucket Police regarding an allegation of an indecent assault and battery\u201d but did not provide further details. On December 24, 2018, news broke that Spacey would face arraignment on a count of sexual assault in Nantucket District Court. The hearing will occur on January 7, 2019.\n\n2012 to 2017: multiple anonymous cast and crew members on the set of Netflix\u2019s House of Cards\n\nOn November 2, 2017, CNN reported that multiple cast and crew members working on the House of Cards set allege that Spacey engaged in harassment and created a toxic environment during the production. A total of eight sources told CNN that Spacey\u2019s behavior was \u201cpredatory,\u201d or that he harassed or initiated nonconsensual physical contact with production crew or had targeted young men. One anonymous crew member said Spacey routinely touched him inappropriately throughout the six seasons he worked on set, and that he did not \"feel comfortable\" asking Spacey to stop.\n\nAdditionally, a former House of Cards production assistant who reported Spacey\u2019s behavior to a supervisor told CNN that a supervisor resolved the problem by attempting to make sure Spacey and the assistant were segregated while on set. Months after the implementation of this practice, Spacey allegedly sexually assaulted the production assistant while they were driving in a car together. The crew member did not report the assault.\n\nNetflix and the Old Vic Theatre responded to the allegations against Spacey by distancing themselves from the actor\n\nMany current and former employers and associates of Spacey\u2019s have been quick to denounce the allegations made against the actor, and to attempt to distance themselves from reports of his alleged behavior.\n\nOne day after BuzzFeed published Rapp\u2019s allegations against Spacey, the Hollywood Reporter confirmed that House of Cards would end with its sixth season, noting that \u201cofficial word on its conclusion, which has been in the works since the summer, comes at a problematic time for Spacey.\u201d\n\nNetflix, along with House of Cards\u2019 production studio Media Rights Capital, later suspended production on the show entirely. \u201cMRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on House of Cards season six until further notice,\u201d read a joint press statement, \u201cto give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew.\u201d\n\nMRC has claimed to have no knowledge of outstanding or unresolved complaints made against Spacey. In a statement to CNN, the company claimed to have handled any incidents brought to its attention:\n\n[D]uring our first year of production in 2012, someone on the crew shared a complaint about a specific remark and gesture made by Kevin Spacey. Immediate action was taken following our review of the situation and we are confident the issue was resolved promptly to the satisfaction of all involved. Mr. Spacey willingly participated in a training process and since that time MRC has not been made aware of any other complaints involving Mr. Spacey.\n\nNetflix told CNN that \u201cNetflix was just made aware of one incident, five years ago, that we were informed was resolved swiftly,\u201d but that it was \u201cnot aware of any other incidents involving Kevin Spacey on-set.\u201d Netflix stated it was committed to \u201cmaintain[ing] a safe and respectful working environment,\u201d while MRC announced that it had established \u201can anonymous complaint hotline, crisis counselors, and sexual harassment legal advisors for the crew.\u201d\n\nHowever, since the CNN report, multiple anonymous House of Cards crew members alleged to BuzzFeed that Spacey\u2019s behavior was widely known on set, with many people, including series creator Beau Willimon, knowingly turning a blind eye to a pattern of harassment. One source told BuzzFeed that the production team treated Spacey\u2019s \u201cflirtatious behavior toward crew and cast ... like a joke,\u201d adding, \u201cHe touches and feels anyone he wants to.\u201d Willimon has denied all knowledge of Spacey\u2019s behavior, including the on-set incident reported by CNN. The source BuzzFeed spoke with called Willimon\u2019s claim \u201c100% bullshit.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, since the news concerning Spacey has surfaced, the Old Vic has battled accusations that staff members of the theater knew about the actor\u2019s alleged longstanding pattern of harassment and predatory behavior but did nothing to stop it.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, multiple Old Vic employees witnessed Spacey behaving inappropriately at the theater company during his tenure as artistic director, quoting one anonymous former staffer who said, \u201cWe were all involved in keeping it quiet. I witnessed him groping men many times in all sorts of different situations.\u201d\n\nAfter the Old Vic concluded its investigation into Spacey, in which it learned of 20 allegations of inappropriate behavior, its current artistic director, Matthew Warchus, said in a public statement that \u201cThese allegations have been a shock and a disturbing surprise to many of us. It is incorrect, unfair and irresponsible to say that everybody knew.\u201d\n\nYet the theater also acknowledged in that statement that multiple staff did witness incidents at the times they occurred, noting, \u201cStaff who observed this behaviour claimed they were unclear about how to respond; in some cases they did not consider allegations of misconduct to be serious and, where they clearly did, they said they did not feel confident that The Old Vic would take those allegations seriously given who he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have learnt is how better to call out this behaviour in future,\u201d Warchus said. \u201cThese findings will help not only The Old Vic but our industry as a whole, as together we rapidly evolve an intelligent new standard of protection and support in and around the workplace.\u201d\n\nThe consequences Spacey is facing so far have been wide-ranging and immediate \u2014 but so far, he largely stands alone\n\nOn some level, Rapp\u2019s accusation against Spacey served as a litmus test to determine if the cultural shifts heralded by the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the growth of the #MeToo movement could impact the careers of A-list actors. Spacey did in fact experience a number of striking and swift career setbacks:\n\nSpacey\u2019s representatives said in a brief statement released to the Hollywood Reporter on November 1, 2017, that Spacey \u201cis taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.\u201d Later that month, he was reportedly spotted at the same elite Arizona treatment center for sex addiction that Harvey Weinstein briefly retreated to after the allegations against him broke.\n\nBut Spacey is far from the only alleged sexual predator in Hollywood, or the only one who\u2019s led a successful career despite his behavior apparently being an open secret. And while some of the most powerful men in the industry \u2014 including Weinstein and former CBS head Les Moonves \u2014 have seen their careers topple, others remain largely unscathed by allegations against them. And as Spacey\u2019s video indicates, he seems to think he deserves a comeback despite the overwhelming number of people who\u2019ve spoken out against him.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely he\u2019ll get one.
