Nick Jonas, of Jonas Brothers fame, wasn\u2019t born until 1992, just a few months before Twain released her debut album.\n\nAs the years flew by for the budding pop star, he told Billboard, he started to develop quite a crush on Twain. Starting with the first song he ever heard of hers, which was released when he was 5.\n\nTwain\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)\u201d came out in 1997, and Jonas says, \u201cI remember the country-pop feel of the song was unlike anything else out there at the time, and I became a lifelong fan in that moment.\u201d\n\nAnd while he was still practically a baby, he heard Twain\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re Still the One.\u201d And that did it for him.\n\n\u201cI got the chance to see Shania\u2019s Vegas show, and when she performed this song onstage with a white horse at her side, it really sealed the deal for me: Shania Twain, lifetime crush,\u201d Jonas admitted.\n\nThen when Jonas was at the ripe old age of 6, Twain released \u201cThat Don\u2019t Impress Me Much.\u201d\n\n\u201cShania was always so incredible at making iconic visuals for her music, as well as being cutting-edge production-wise. This video and song are, in a word, legendary,\u201d he said.\n\nThen right around the time of Jonas\u2019 10th birthday, there was \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Getcha Good!\u201d That 2002 instant hit was one that Jonas loved so much, he and his older brothers Kevin and Joe covered it when they started their own pop band. The Jonas Brothers even performed it at concerts after they became huge stars.\n\n\n\n\u201cI played drums and sang my favorite part, the pre-chorus, so the rest of the time I could rock out,\u201d he said of their early arrangement of the song.\n\nTo round out his list of his five favorite Twain tunes, Jonas chose \u201cForever and For Always,\u201d released when Jonas was still just 10.\n\n\u201cThis song has been a major source of inspiration to me melodically. Back in the day, my brothers and I would warm up to this with our band, getting our harmonies locked in before the show,\u201d he said.", "images": ["http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:391201?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:391201?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=480&height=270"], "top_img": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:391201?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alison Bonaguro"], "canonical_link": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1774498/nick-jonas-confesses-lifetime-crush-on-shania-twain/", "title": "Nick Jonas Confesses \u201cLifetime Crush\u201d on Shania Twain", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "cmt.com"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.cmt.com:1774498"}, "og": {"site_name": "CMT News", "title": "Nick Jonas Confesses \"Lifetime Crush\" on Shania Twain", "url": "http://www.cmt.com/news/1774498/nick-jonas-confesses-lifetime-crush-on-shania-twain/", "image": {"identifier": "http://cmt.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:cmt.com:391201?width=1200&height=675&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "Right around the time Shania Twain moved to Nashville and signed her first record deal, a fan was born.
