The helmer of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films has a lifetime total of approximately $6,502.7 billion, followed by Transformers\u2018 Michael Bay ($6.451 billion), Avatar\u2018s James Cameron ($6.139 billion), and Harry Potter\u2018s David Yates ($5.347 billion).\n\nRELATED: Every Steven Spielberg movie, ranked\n\nThe original Jurassic Park is still Spielberg\u2019s biggest commercial success with $983.8 million (not adjusted for inflation). Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (despite the many skeptics it garnered) comes in second with $786.6 million, and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial comes in third with $717 million.\n\nIn the past year alone, Spielberg took a quick detour from post-production on Ready Player One to direct a little Oscar contender you might know as The Post, and there\u2019s plenty more on the director\u2019s docket in the months ahead. With a West Side Story remake and another Indiana Jones in the works, might he leap over another box office hurdle?", "images":
