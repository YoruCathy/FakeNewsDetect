Confused me how her 'squad' still hung out with Demario after the things he said against Rach,\" one follower commented on Lindsay's post.\n\nOn Sunday, Jackson seemed to respond to Lindsay's tweet when he posted a photo of himself with \"Bachelorette\" co-stars Dean Unglert and Adam Gottschalk on Instagram. The two also co-starred with him on \"Bachelor in Paradise.\" In the caption, Jackson addressed Lindsay's post, making it clear that he does not agree with her.\n\n\"Someone said, 'These bachelor friendships are fickle and fleeting' and I disagree,\" Jackson wrote. \"These bachelor friendships got me through a dark time and I'm grateful for my brothers, sisters, and bachelor nation. Hopefully that someone will find real love in paradise next year and stop being petty on social networks. \"\n\nThis comes a few weeks after Jackson accused Lindsay of discrimination during an interview. On Aug. 21, Jackson said on \"The E&G\" podcast that he knew he had no chance to win Lindsay because she prefers white men. \"I was only there for the two weeks in the house,\" he said. \"From the beginning, you knew that she was attracted to white men. You knew that. No disrespect, you just knew. She had that vibe. From night one, we all set down, all the guys and I said, 'They're going to have a black representative, either myself or Eric, and they're going to have Dean, Peter, and Brian as the final four.' We all caught that.\"\n\nLindsay did not like Jackson's statement and fired back by commenting on a photo promoting Jackson's appearance on \"E&G.\" The former \"Bachelorette\" stressed that Jackson seemed to be a hypocrite when he accused her of racial bias as he also dated a white woman, Lexi Thexton.\n\nMeanwhile, this is not the first time that Jackson has had issues with a \"Bachelor\" co-star. Fortunately, he and Corinne Olympios have finally reconciled after their \"Bachelor in Paradise\" sex scandal, which had reportedly led to the suspension of the Season 4 production. The two looked amicable and even hugged and kissed when they reunited for the first time since she accused him of sexually assaulting her. A day before they met, Olympios said that she didn't blame Jackson for the incident and even apologized to him.\n\nWhat do you think of the \"Bachelor\" friendships?
