Naturally, I've been binge watching a ton of Netflix shows looking for 'the one'. And for the most part, I've been pretty seriously disappointed... well up until I came across Mindhunter that is.\n\nThe new Netflix series, produced by David Fincher, Charlize Theron and few other big names, is everything any crime junkie craves! The story takes place in 1977 and follows a FBI team studying the psychology of serial killers and murderers. They use their skills and expertise to solve impossibly difficult crimes.\n\nThe show is based the true story of an FBI team that came up with the concept of a\"serial killer\" profile. Playwright Joe Penhall adapted the series from the non-fiction book co-written by John E. Douglas, the FBI agent who helped invent modern criminal profiling.\n\nvia @entertainmentweekly\n\nThe show starts with the team on the road as they investigate the new and interesting phenomenon of killers murdering in a sequence (the term serial killer hasn't yet been coined). They work to understand the reasons why a psychopath kills the way they do and focus on the psychology behind a crime. As their research progresses faster than anticipated, they begin interviewing sociopaths who talk about murdering as easily as they would their day or the weather.\n\nFor anyone with a weak stomach or a bleeding heart, prepare yourself to hear some seriously disgusting dialogue. While there's no real violence shown, apart from the images of the victims, the sex crimes are described in vivid gory detail. Lets just say that it's not the show to watch alone at night in your room before bed. However, if you're a fan of shows like Law & Order or CSI and are fascinated by crime psychology, this is 100% the series for you.\n\nvia @melty_fr\n\nMindhunter is rated 9/10 on IMDb and has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Weirdly enough, Jonathan Groff, who plays the main character, looks like a cross between Harvey and Mike in Suits! The 32-year-old actor has only received praise for his depiction of of Holden Ford since the release of the series on Netflix.\n\nIf you aren't sold after the first episode, keep going! Some critics say that the initial episodes does not do justice to the rest of the series. It's not your ordinary police drama... we promise.\n\nTransaltion from: Narcity Quebec", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18729422&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/22427470_295317860969812_8324730776767692800_n.jpg", "https://www.narcity.com/uploads/57ddf993b15bccd02cdfc07101f857364a16d05b.jpg_facebook.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=RT5wq1rcy520uW", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s480x480/e35/22500266_1980533615558496_6381914595438624768_n.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.narcity.com/uploads/57ddf993b15bccd02cdfc07101f857364a16d05b.jpg_facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.narcity.com/entertainment/the-new-netflix-series-is-a-must-watch-for-anyone-obsessed-with-serial-killer-dramas", "title": "The New Netflix Series Is A Must Watch For Anyone Obsessed With Serial Killer Dramas", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "template": "Polemos", "fb": {"app_id": 1468563456738953, "pages": 784042488306600}, "description": "It got a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes!", "title": "The New Netflix Series Is A Must Watch For Anyone Obsessed With Serial Killer Dramas", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It got a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes!", "title": "The New Netflix Series Is A Must Watch For Anyone Obsessed With Serial Killer Dramas", "site": "@NarcityCanada", "image": "https://www.narcity.com/uploads/57ddf993b15bccd02cdfc07101f857364a16d05b.jpg_facebook.jpg"}, "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "publisher": "Narcity", "author": "https://www.narcity.com/author/brittany-rogers", "published_time": "2017-10-18T09:13:16.334Z"}, "og": {"title": "The New Netflix Series Is A Must Watch For Anyone Obsessed With Serial Killer Dramas", "description": "It got a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes!", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.narcity.com/uploads/57ddf993b15bccd02cdfc07101f857364a16d05b.jpg_facebook.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.narcity.com/entertainment/the-new-netflix-series-is-a-must-watch-for-anyone-obsessed-with-serial-killer-dramas"}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/entertainment/the-new-netflix-series-is-a-must-watch-for-anyone-obsessed-with-serial-killer-dramas", "app_store_id": 1291431733, "app_name": "Narcity"}, "android": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/entertainment/the-new-netflix-series-is-a-must-watch-for-anyone-obsessed-with-serial-killer-dramas", "package": "com.narcitymedia.narcity", "app_name": "Narcity"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.narcity.com/entertainment/the-new-netflix-series-is-a-must-watch-for-anyone-obsessed-with-serial-killer-dramas"}}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bd738d22d4fc40cea547f834666b428f"}, "ir-site-verification-token": "-1910751629"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508317996.334, "source": "https://www.narcity.com", "summary": ""}
