Photo: Tom Pennington/Getty Images\n\nFootball fans might not realize it, but plenty of Americans only attend Super Bowl parties for seven-layer dip, liberal drinking, and the nationally televised pop concert otherwise known as the Super Bowl halftime show. For decades, the show would simply feature a college marching band or two, with a performance by Andy Williams or Up With People tossed in for good measure, but that all changed in 1993. That\u2019s the year when Michael Jackson turned the Super Bowl halftime show into must-watch television.\n\nIn the decades since Jackson created the halftime show as we know it, the Super Bowl has run through remarkably different eras of performance \u2014 the MTV years, Janet Jackson\u2019s Nipplegate, and the classic-rock revival of the late aughts \u2014 but tradition and purpose unite them all. The mode has always been pastiche, combining disparate elements into a cohesive whole that celebrates American culture and Zeitgeist.\n\nAhead, Vulture ranks all of the Super Bowl halftime shows since 1993, from worst to best, including J.Lo and Shakira\u2019s show from this past Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl LIV.\n\n28. Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, and Toni Braxton (2000)\n\nThe first thing you need to understand about this halftime show: Disney owns ABC, so they decided to hijack 12 minutes of America\u2019s time for a huge commercial for some Cirque du Soleil rip-off called the \u201cDisney Millenium Performance.\u201d There were a bunch of puppets and people in crazy costumes, which was kind of cool, but they all looked like robot overlords from a machine future that was obsessed with New Age healing and wheatgrass shots. To make it even worse, each performer sang an original song, so the audience didn\u2019t recognize any of it. I would have given anything to hear \u201cSussudio\u201d \u2014 instead, we got Phil Collins in a backwards Kangol hat and the world\u2019s saddest cargo pants, singing something called \u201cTwo Worlds.\u201d Oh, and Edward James Olmos kept coming out to offer weird narration like, \u201cAs it does every thousand years, the gateway of time has opened once again to give us hope.\u201d Thanks, but no thanks.\n\n27. Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt, and the Judds (1994)\n\nThere is nothing sadder than a country spectacular, especially when the most imaginative performance available is a horde of people dressed as cowboys and cowgirls. Sure, it\u2019s a popular genre, but a huge chunk of the audience had no clue what \u201cTuckered Out\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a Little Too Late\u201d were, or why they needed to care about bland smiling girls in 10-gallon hats. To make it worse, the people on the field appeared to be moving around carrying fluorescent light bulbs. This was a halftime show to forget.\n\n26. Maroon 5, Travis Scott, Big Boi (2019)\n\nMaroon 5\u2019s halftime show was exactly like all of Maroon 5\u2019s music: so safe and antiseptic that you hardly remember it\u2019s there until you\u2019re watching a Super Bowl halftime show and you realize you know every single one of the songs and you want to crack yourself over the head with the Rock Band guitar gathering dust in your closet. There was almost no acknowledgement in this set that it was taking place on the largest annual stage in America. We got a few lame pyrotechnics, an almost entirely female audience gathered around the stage jumping and clamoring for Adam Levine like they were paid to, a SpongeBob SquarePants introduction, and performances by Travis Scott and Atlanta\u2019s own Big Boi shoehorned in between some of Levine\u2019s crooning. The whiplash between these artists was enough to give viewers a concussion disorder. In a year when no one wanted to perform at the halftime show, this was the best the NFL could do, a firework that extinguished itself mid-flight.\n\n25. The Rolling Stones (2006)\n\nThere are two notable things about this performance: 1) The Rolling Stones played on a stage shaped like the band\u2019s lips-and-tongue logo, and 2) the people of Detroit, where that year\u2019s game was played, were pissed because no Motown artist was asked to perform. Also, the Stones only did three songs. Three. And one of them was their latest single, \u201cRough Justice.\u201d A note to the Rolling Stones: No one wants to hear the new stuff, especially at the Super Bowl.\n\n24. Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman, James Belushi, ZZ Top, and James Brown (1997)\n\nSince the game was in New Orleans, I suppose the theme made sense. What didn\u2019t was letting Jim Belushi sing \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cGimme Some Lovin\u2019.\u201d Yes, they let Jim Belushi sing. It was like watching your uncle do karaoke, except there were tons of girls in tiny outfits gyrating everywhere while a marching band spelled out words on the field and pyrotechnics exploded into the abyss. Then ZZ Top played \u201cLegs\u201d while the dancers laid on their backs and, um, showed off their legs. Even with James Brown, this halftime show needed a whole lot more of something. Anything, really.\n\n23. Gloria Estefan, Stevie Wonder, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (1999)\n\nYes, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy played the Super Bowl and we will never be able to take that away from them. But while pastiche is the best way to create a great halftime show, this one was just too much. They threw a bunch of stuff at the wall, then it all stuck and stayed there for a few weeks and got moldy. Gloria Estefan killed it, of course, and Stevie Wonder was great, but the sound mix was off the whole time. Two all-time greats wasted on a spectacle that was absolutely hollow at its core.\n\n22. Justin Timberlake (2018)\n\nJustin Timberlake is a former member of NSYNC, husband to Jessica Biel, ex-boyfriend of Britney Spears, tour mate of Christina Aguilera, and co-Emmy winner (for \u201cDick in a Box\u201d) with Andy Samberg. He couldn\u2019t enlist the help of any of those people to enliven what was the most boring Super Bowl halftime show of the modern era? Instead, we got a projection of Prince on a giant sheet while Timberlake sang \u201cI Would Die 4 U.\u201d It was certainly a reminder of the Purple One\u2019s iconic halftime performance \u2014 and in his hometown, no less \u2014 but otherwise this was a boring, ill-conceived, and muddled performance. It started with Timberlake singing under the stadium in what felt like a small club show, but even when he came onto the main stage, it still had the same feeling. The Super Bowl is not the time for intimate numbers. It is a time for spectacle and Justin left it (and all of his famous friends) at home. Lady Gaga jumped off the roof! Katy Perry rode in on a giant lion! Beyonc\u00e9 shot Kelly and Michelle through the floor to sing \u201cSingle Ladies!\u201d Justin Timberlake just roamed around aimlessly and then played the piano while wearing an outfit that looked like it could double as an billboard for discount hunting store. What a horrible way to ruin #JanetJacksonAppreciationDay.\n\n21. The Who (2010)\n\nThere were lasers and some singing. There was a faithful version of \u201cBaba O\u2019Riley\u201d and other songs used by CBS procedurals. I guess the stage was kinda cool. Blah.\n\n20. Shania Twain, No Doubt, and Sting (2003)\n\nWas this a halftime show or a playlist for a very short car ride? Shania did \u201cMan! I Feel Like a Woman\u201d without even one backup dancer or costume change. Next, Gwen Stefani performed \u201cJust a Girl\u201d with her backing band. There has been no bigger whiplash between two bands in the history of the Super Bowl. Finally, Sting appeared and Stefani joined him for \u201cMessage in a Bottle.\u201d That\u2019s it. Finito. The only flourishes were the punk-rock cheerleaders jumping on trampolines, and even that came about seven minutes into the show. Yawn.\n\n19. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (2008)\n\nTom Petty is one of our country\u2019s greatest underappreciated assets. Of all the acts to get up and play the first four songs off their greatest-hits album, Petty\u2019s \u2014 \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down,\u201d \u201cFree Fallin,\u2019\u201d and \u201cRunnin\u2019 Down a Dream\u201d \u2014 are perhaps the most solid all the way through. But, man, couldn\u2019t he have at least enlisted a few dancers to liven things up?\n\n18. Paul McCartney (2005)\n\nThis was America\u2019s punishment for Janet Jackson\u2019s nipple: an old white dude standing in the middle of an LED stage, playing the guitar by himself. This show was safer than having sex in a panic room with three condoms and all of your clothes on. There\u2019s no denying McCartney\u2019s brilliance, but he just ran through \u201cDrive My Car,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cLive and Let Die,\u201d and \u201cHey Jude\u201d with no interruption or embellishment that could possibly shock or offend the very fragile American sensibility. But hey, at least there was an LED stage!\n\n17. Bruno Mars and Red Hot Chili Peppers (2014)\n\nIt started with small children holding hands in front of American flags and ended with soldiers dedicating \u201cJust the Way You Are\u201d to their families. Nine out of ten dentists say this is enough saccharine to give every American spontaneous cavities. Mars did a competent job, but a year after Beyonc\u00e9 made a political statement with her all-female performance, Mars reverted back to the usual by filling the stage with a bunch of dudes, including Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was uninspired, plus it didn\u2019t seem like Mars had achieved Super Bowl headliner status.\n\n16. U2 (2002)\n\nWhat we needed was Bruce Springsteen and what we got was an Irishman yelling \u201cAmerica!\u201d in front of a giant banner printed with the names of everyone who died in the 9/11 attacks. The U2 performance was a simple and pared-down affair, which seemed fitting for the zeitgeist, but still it was strange to hear what sounded like cheering as Bono sang \u201cWhere the Streets Have No Names\u201d and the nation mourned.\n\n15. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band (2009)\n\nDuring the sad era of aging rockers playing their greatest hits without flourish or interruption, Springsteen was the only one who seemed to have some fun. \u201cI want you to step away from the guacamole dip! I want you to put the chicken wings down and turn your television all the way up!\u201d he told the audience as his set started. Springsteen is one of the American masters \u2014 why he didn\u2019t play the post-9/11 halftime show, I\u2019ll never know \u2014 and \u201c10th Avenue Freeze Out,\u201d \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d \u201cWorking on a Dream,\u201d and \u201cGlory Days\u201d are all certifiable jams. Still, there wasn\u2019t anything you couldn\u2019t get here from one of the Boss\u2019s concerts, so he falls a few spots.\n\n14. Boys II Men, Smokey Robinson, Martha Reeves, the Temptations, and Queen Latifah (1998)\n\nThis could have been a staid look at an older genre of music, but then Latifah and Boyz II Men came in and injected some youthful energy into what otherwise looked like a very professional high-school talent show. Boyz II Men disappointed by using most of their time onstage for their new single \u201cA Song for Mama,\u201d which is soundly awful. Luckily for Martha Reeves, whose singing sounded like a squirrel was humping her larynx during \u201cHeat Wave,\u201d Twitter didn\u2019t exist back in 1998 or there would have been a whole lot of Left Sharking about the sound. Still this was wholesome family fun for all ages.\n\n13. Patti Labelle, Tony Bennett, Arturo Sandoval, Teddy Pendergrass, and Miami Sound Machine (1995)\n\nThis was less of a halftime show and more of a Stefon SNL skit. It had cobras playing drums, peasants making offerings to the gods, Indiana Jones flying on a parachute, a Satanic ritual involving the Super Bowl trophy, people on stilts, Patti LaBelle dressed as a demonic sequin goddess, throngs of shirtless dancers, a flaming ninja, a stage full of spikes, and Tony Bennett singing an old song. One of the few Disney-produced shows, this was pure camp insanity. It sure wasn\u2019t the best show, but it\u2019s still one of my favorites.\n\n12. Black Eyed Peas, Usher, and Slash (2011)\n\nI never thought I\u2019d say this, but the Black Eyed Peas were pretty good at the Super Bowl. Dressed up like the cast of a Not Tron XXX: A Porn Parody, the foursome descended from thin air, ushering in a pop-heavy era of halftime shows. This laid the groundwork for Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, and all the rest, with a field full of dancers in glowing costumes and a futuristic theme that featured Usher and Slash popping up from under the stage to play \u201cSweet Child of Mine\u201d for Fergie. Sadly, the sound sucked and the stage, meant to spell \u201cLOVE\u201d in lights when viewed from above, was missing one prong of its V. It\u2019s really too bad they had to sing all of those Black Eyed Peas songs.\n\n11. Jennifer Lopez and Shakira (2020)\n\nThe best moment of this celebration of Latin culture, and particularly hips-not-lying Latin dance, came when J.Lo was joined onstage by her daughter, Emme, to sing \u201cLet\u2019s Get Loud\u201d along with a fleet of other tween girls whose mothers were, no doubt, dance mom\u2013ing on the sidelines. There were also kids in lit-up cages scattered around the field, and Emme broke into a chorus of \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d while her mother, sporting one of her many glittering bodysuits, showed off a giant feather cape with the American flag on one side and the Puerto Rican flag on the other. It was a forceful tip of the hat to the current political situation of immigrants, particularly those from South and Central America. Things moved on from that moment with the speed of Shakira shaking her hips. The whole performance was incredibly frenetic, whipping from one stage piece to the next before the audience could even figure out what was going on. There were plenty of highlights \u2014 like J.Lo pole dancing on the spire of the Empire State Building \u2014 and the audience could not even finish asking, \u201cWhy is Shakira dancing with a random piece of rope?\u201d before she had moved on to some other bit of whimsy (including the zaghrouta heard round the world). With two superstars in top form, it\u2019s hard not to be swaddled in their beautiful glittery embrace.\n\n10. Lady Gaga (2017)\n\nThis technologically advanced performance included a literal constellation of drones, a dive off the roof of the stadium, and dancers tossing glowing spears that looked like a weapon out of Star Trek. There was even a keytar and a circular piano like the one at the Mos Eisley cantina. Lady Gaga has always been like Ziggy Stardust\u2019s bratty younger sister, and that was the theme she stuck to throughout, from her diamond phone for \u201cTelephone\u201d to the crystal orb she brandished to the audience. But we never got more than that polished public persona. Gaga did hits like \u201cPoker Face,\u201d \u201cBorn This Way,\u201d and \u201cBad Romance\u201d without notable reinvention or retooling in the way that Madonna, Prince, and Beyonc\u00e9 did with their old gems. Also, she didn\u2019t have any guest performances, while the only covers were those (possibly) political numbers at the opening. A Lady Gaga concert is always a spectacular affair, and this certainly was, but she needed to cast her net wider for such an all-embracing cultural event.\n\n9. Michael Jackson (1993)\n\nJust because you\u2019re the first doesn\u2019t mean you do it best. For starters, the networks hadn\u2019t quite figured out how to broadcast a halftime show yet. It\u2019s hard to hear the music over all of the cheering (which lasted a full three minutes before a note was even played), there was a commercial break in the middle of the program, and the game was in California, so it wasn\u2019t quite dark out. Also, the production is painfully sincere in that way Michael Jackson loved: Instead of reaching into his packed back catalog, he performed \u201cWe Are the World\u201d with a children\u2019s choir, then did \u201cHeal the World\u201d while an enormous globe inflated in the middle of the stage. Sure, he also did \u201cBillie Jean\u201d and moonwalked, but for a consummate showman, Michael Jackson could have done more.\n\n8. Coldplay, Beyonc\u00e9, and Bruno Mars (2016)\n\nAlthough it was supposed to be Coldplay\u2019s year, they wound up basically ceding the stage to Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars. Thank God for those guest performances because Coldplay\u2019s contribution was pure Technicolor vomit. It was like a hippie van collided with a paint factory. Things got much better once Beyonc\u00e9 showed up dressed as Michael Jackson from his 1993 performance with a legion of backup girls for \u201cFormation.\u201d Bruno Mars came out with a bunch of boys for \u201cUptown Funk\u201d and the two of them squared off in the chicest battle of the sexes ever. Sorry, everyone else: This was Bey\u2019s moment, and it immediately joins Michael\u2019s as one of the most iconic. Too bad everything else had to drag her down.\n\n7. Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, Jessica Simpson, Kid Rock, Nelly, and P. Diddy (2004)\n\nWhatever this inexplicable theme was supposed to be, the real idea here was excess. Janet running around with countless dancers on a stage that looked like if the Fortress of Solitude were built by Cirque du Soleil, Diddy riding a moving platform through a sea of smoke, Nelly coming out in a giant red car to sing \u201cHot in Here,\u201d and Kid Rock somehow managing to wear four embarrassing outfits (including a poncho made from an American flag). Yes, Justin ripped off Janet\u2019s boob covering and we saw a bit of nip. Whatever. It was still a really good show.\n\n6. Diana Ross (1996)\n\nDiana Ross was considered a safe choice for Super Bowl XXX, but only a diva of her magnitude could pull off such a shocking performance. It starts off with her descending from the sky on a sparking platform, slowing considerably through a medley of her biggest hits, like \u201cBaby Love\u201d and \u201cStop in the Name of Love\u201d with tuxedo-clad dancers all around her. Then you realize that Ross has changed her outfit for every single song. And then you realize that the giant gold cape she\u2019s wearing is slowly enveloping the entire stage as she rises three stories in the air, singing \u201cAin\u2019t No Mountain High Enough.\u201d And then you realize that helicopter is going to land in the middle of the field. Diana gets in, waves to the crowd, and then flies off, sitting on the edge of the helicopter. Try to top that, Gaga.\n\n5. Katy Perry, Lenny Kravitz, and Missy Elliott (2015)\n\nThanks to the unforgettable and meme-able antics of the \u201cLeft Shark,\u201d this performance will be remembered for years to come, but it was also a technical marvel to behold. Perry arrives on the back of a giant lion puppet while singing \u201cRoar,\u201d then wound up being dragged around the sky, singing \u201cFirework\u201d and riding the More You Know shooting-star logo. There was lots to enjoy in the middle, namely bringing Missy Elliott onstage to do her thing on three \u2014 yes three \u2014 of her own songs. The psychedelic \u201960s pop-art color scheme was unforgettable, as was the message that Katy sent: At the Super Bowl, it\u2019s a good thing to share the spotlight.\n\n4. Aerosmith, NSYNC, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, and Nelly (2001)\n\nBy today\u2019s standards, Justin Timberlake, a still-closeted Lance Bass, and the rest of NSYNC doing \u201cBye Bye Bye\u201d while Steven Tyler pulled heartstrings with \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Miss a Thing\u201d might not seem revolutionary \u2014 especially considering the dated metallic outfits \u2014 but it definitely felt that way at the time. This was the first year that fans were allowed on the field surrounding the stage, which made the show feel more like a traditional concert \u2014 granted one where Timberlake literally shot fireworks out of his hands like he was one of the X-Men. The fan interaction, which has since become a staple, brought a whole new energy to the proceedings. When surprise guests Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, and Nelly came out for a thoroughly rousing finale of \u201cWalk This Way,\u201d both the older dudes who love Aerosmith and their teenage daughters lost their collective minds.\n\n3. Beyonc\u00e9 and Destiny\u2019s Child (2013)\n\nIf the Super Bowl allowed ties, Queen Bey would share the top spot with the next two performances. Her 2013 production was extravagant and jaw-dropping, while the all-black costumes and toned-down aesthetic provided a sophistication that other artists just can\u2019t emulate. The music was spot on, springing from \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d to \u201cBaby Boy\u201d and all the way to \u201cHalo\u201d as a swooping finale. It just barely loses a few points, though, because her performance didn\u2019t offer enough pastiche. The stage was literally made to look like two of her profiles facing each other, while a giant image of Beyonc\u00e9 burned above it. Yes, it was a totally awe-inducing performance, but it didn\u2019t include even one costume change. The only guests were her former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmates, who together sung \u201cSingle Ladies,\u201d which wasn\u2019t even one of their songs. Still, Beyonc\u00e9 only had women performers on that stage, an admirable change and a powerful message.\n\n2. Madonna, LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, Cee Lo Green (2012)\n\nA year after the halftime show embraced its pop sensibilities with the Black-Eyed Peas, Madonna arrived as a Greek goddess on a giant litter carried by a legion of Spartan soldiers, showing all the kids exactly how it\u2019s done. There was so much on the LED-lit stage at any given time: From the swirling dancers and the gospel choir to the slackline performer, it was almost too much. Madonna offered new arrangements of her old songs, like a drum-corps version of \u201cOpen Your Heart\u201d sung with Cee Lo Green and an LMFAO mashup of \u201cMusic\u201d with \u201cParty Rock Anthem.\u201d While she loses points for devoting significant time to the lackluster single \u201cGive Me All Your Luvin,\u201d at least that featured Nicki Minaj and a bird-flipping MIA. Madonna successfully moved through several modes in rapid succession, collaborated with other big artists, and made it all look effortless, as if being at the swirling center of 200 performers is what she does every Tuesday. Maybe because it is.\n\n1. Prince (2007)\n\nThe absolute best Super Bowl halftime performance of them all. Prince\u2019s show wasn\u2019t the most extravagant, but even today, it thrills and excites. In the middle of a stage shaped in the \u201cArtist Formerly Known As Prince\u201d symbol, the Purple One opened with the strains of Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d before switching gears with \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d Then the Florida A&M University marching band, strapped with glowing lights, joined in for a new arrangement of \u201cBaby I\u2019m a Star\u201d that recognizes the history of halftime shows past. This musical journey veered through covers of \u201cProud Mary\u201d and \u201cAll Along the Watchtower\u201d before ending with a huge scrim shot up into the night sky, with Prince\u2019s giant backlit silhouette projected as he shredded the guitar solo from \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d Oh, and he did the whole thing in the pouring rain. Who could ever top that?", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6a2/9a9/9ae229eb0cd0c7a860674a6a8ae074855b-03-jennifer-lopez-superbowl.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2020/02/03/03-jennifer-lopez-superbowl.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6a2/9a9/9ae229eb0cd0c7a860674a6a8ae074855b-03-jennifer-lopez-superbowl.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Moylan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/best-super-bowl-halftime-shows-ranked.html", "title": "Every Super Bowl Halftime Show Since 1993, Ranked", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Every Super Bowl Halftime Show Since 1993, Ranked", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/best-super-bowl-halftime-shows-ranked.html", "description": "Who had the absolute greatest Super Bowl halftime show?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6a2/9a9/9ae229eb0cd0c7a860674a6a8ae074855b-03-jennifer-lopez-superbowl.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Every Super Bowl Halftime Show Since 1993, Ranked", "description": "Who had the absolute greatest Super Bowl halftime show?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6a2/9a9/9ae229eb0cd0c7a860674a6a8ae074855b-03-jennifer-lopez-superbowl.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-02-03T09:55:00.000-05:00", "tag": "music, tv, super bowl, super bowl halftime show, vulture lists, rankings, vulture picks", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "In 1993, Michael Jackson created the Super Bowl halftime show as we know it today.
