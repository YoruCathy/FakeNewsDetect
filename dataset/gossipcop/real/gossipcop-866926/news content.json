Despite JAY-Z jokingly trying to snatch the paddle from his daughter, she bid again when the item\u2019s asking price shot up to $19,000, the outlet reported. However, director Tyler Perry beat out the bid and won the art piece for $20,000.\n\n\u201cI got the painting. I could not be outdone by a 6-year-old,\u201d he joked.\n\nImage zoom JAY-Z and Beyonce Marlon Reid/Splash News\n\nWork hard, play hard.

In a video taken at the tour opener, both musicians could be seen on a screen in all-white attire joined by Blue Ivy and twins Rumi and Sir for what appeared to be a vow renewal ceremony. The message \u201cTHIS IS REAL LOVE\u201d is projected during the film at the concert as the power couple sings their 2009 duet \u201cYoung Forever.\u201d\n\nBefore Bey and Jay shared the footage of the ceremony, photos of the pair holding two babies was shared along with the words \u201cLOVE IS UNIVERSAL\u201d and \u201cLOVE NEVER CHANGES.\u201d The Bey Hive presumably thought the children are Rumi and Sir (who will celebrate their first birthday on June 13), however, the babies are not.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the show the Carter babies were included in a family collage [however] the babies in the film clip at the beginning were not their children,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE.\n\nJune 2018\n\nA week later, the superstar couples stunned fans in London and around the world by releasing a new joint album called Everything Is Love. The nine-track LP, which lists the powerhouse couple simply as The Carters, is currently only available to stream on Tidal.\n\nA video for new track \u201cApes\u2014\u201d was shot by Ricky Saiz on location at The Louvre in Paris in May dropped simultaneously.\n\nThe couple announced the album during their concert in London on Saturday, with \u201calbum out now\u201d text appearing on a screen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all given so much love every time we come here \u2014 thank you.
