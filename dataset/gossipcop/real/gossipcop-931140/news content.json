Although the 47-year-old and her dance partner Sasha Farber were the last to be called safe during the Season 26 premiere and double elimination Monday, Harding used her appearance on DWTS Athletes Edition to let America know: \u201cI belong here.\u201d\n\nHarding and Farber performed the Foxtrot to Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston\u2019s \u201cWhen You Believe,\" scoring 23 out of 30. They skated through round two, beating out snowboarder Jamie Anderson and retired baseball player Johnny Damon.\n\nAfter learning she made the cut, Harding told E! News that she was praying Monday wouldn\u2019t be her last dance. \u201cI was like, \u2018No, lord, please, don\u2019t let this be the last dance. I\u2019m finally learning how to be a lady and learned how to dance and I haven\u2019t lost my last five pounds yet,\u201d she said.\n\nMore than shedding weight, Harding said working with Farber gave her a sense of purpose again. \u201cSasha is such a wonderful partner. He\u2019s taught me how to be graceful and it made me feel like I\u2019m worth something on the dance floor, like I belong here.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI\u2019m just here to have fun and to show to myself and my friends that I can do this. And to America that I belong here. I belong with the other competitors who are wonderful athletes and Olympians.\u201d\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nThe Oregon native was once the most popular figure skater in the world after she nailed the triple axel at an international competition in 1991. At the time, she was the second woman in ice skating history to do so. However, the 1994 attack against fellow U.S. skater Nancy Kerrigan resulted in Harding\u2019s downfall.\n\nKerrigan was clubbed in the knee one month before the 1994 Winter Olympics, which she and Harding were set to compete in. Within the weeks that followed, it was discovered that Harding\u201421 at the time\u2014conspired with her ex-husband to hire someone to attack Kerrigan. Although Harding pleaded her innocence, her connection to the crime resulted in her serving three years of probation, 500 hours of community service, paying a $160,000 fine and her banishment from the USFSA.\n\nIt was only in January 2018 when Harding started making headlines again\u2014although she briefly attempted a comeback as a fighter and competed in a 2002 Celebrity Boxing match. But this time around, it was Harding\u2019s biopic, I, Tonya, starring Margot Robbie.\n\nThe award-winning film served as a dramatization of Harding\u2019s darkest moments surrounding the scandal that cost her her skating career.\n\nAccording to Farber, Harding\u2019s appearance on DWTS was just another shot at a second chance. \u201cShe\u2019s been through so much and it makes it so much more wanting to make her a better dancer. To work with her is a dream,\u201d Farber told E! News. \u201cI know she had a lot of pressure tonight because it was the first time she\u2019s performed in many, many years. This is like a second chance now, this is it.\u201d", "images":
