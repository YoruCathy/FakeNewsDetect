If you want to go into season 3 with no knowledge of what might come, turn back now.\n\nSeason 2 of \u201cOutlander\u201d began with a disoriented Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) returning through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, alone and pregnant, to reluctantly reunite with her first husband, Frank (Tobias Menzies) in 1948. In the premiere, we saw Claire and Frank negotiating how they might raise a child together, with their relationship irrevocably strained by the events of Claire\u2019s absence and the man she fell in love with during that time away.\n\nSunday\u2019s finale, titled \u201cDragonfly in Amber,\u201d showed us the harrowing moments leading up to that reunion, as Claire\u2019s second husband, Jamie (Sam Heughan) convinced her to return to her own time in order to protect her and their unborn child, since he believed that he was destined to die with his men at the Battle of Culloden.\n\nThat seemed like the end of Claire and Jamie\u2019s story (although fans of Diana Gabaldon\u2019s novels already knew that there\u2019s plenty more of this tale to be told, with eight books currently published and more to come \u2014 not to mention the fact that the show was already renewed for season 3 and season 4), until Claire discovered that Jamie survived both Culloden and the execution of Jacobite soldiers that followed the battle, meaning that there was a chance they could still reunite if she went back through the stones \u2014 albeit after 20 years apart.\n\nGiven the number of books in Gabaldon\u2019s series (and the fact that viewers would probably riot if Sam Heughan suddenly disappeared from the show), it\u2019s not much of a spoiler to say that Claire and Jamie will someday find each other again. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of challenges to season 3 \u2014 there\u2019s a period of time where Jamie and Claire are apart; he thinks that he\u2019s lost her, or at least that she\u2019s alive and well but in the future, so what is he living for? What sort of man is he now?\u201d Heughan observes. \u201cShe will eventually return, but they\u2019re both older, so what is Jamie, who is the man he\u2019s become\u201d in the time since they last saw each other?\n\nThose questions \u2014 \u201cwho is Jamie without Claire, why is he still surviving, what has he got to live for when he\u2019s lost the woman that he loves\u201d \u2014 will be central to the character in season 3, according to Heughan.\n\nAnd therein lies both the tragedy and romance at the heart of the \u201cOutlander\u201d series, which, despite its genre-bending sensibilities, incisively explores the sometimes harsh realities of a lasting relationship, with all the triumphs, complications, joys and heartbreaks that go along with it. When they find their way back together after decades spent separated, Claire and Jamie will have to relearn what it means to be a couple, something that Balfe admits she\u2019s eagerly anticipating in season 3.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s going to be most exciting is the reunion between Claire and Jamie and them discovering each other again and falling in love all over again,\u201d she tells Variety. \u201cI think both of them have probably held each other up on a pedestal for 20 years, so in many ways, they\u2019re going to have to destroy that image first before they can fall in love with the person right in front of them, and that\u2019s going to be really interesting. I love the complexity of that, because you can\u2019t be in love with a ghost, and Claire is in many ways in love with Jamie\u2019s ghost, as Jamie is in love with her ghost, and that\u2019s not the people they are when they see each other again.\u201d\n\nThe season 2 finale may have jumped ahead in time to introduce us to Claire and Jamie\u2019s daughter, Brianna, on the cusp of adulthood, but we still have 20 years of lost time to revisit, and the show isn\u2019t likely to skip over all of it, especially since those life experiences will inevitably have shaped who Claire and Jamie are now that they\u2019re middle-aged.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m so excited about as well next season is we\u2019ll see, hopefully, some of her progression as a mother,\u201d Balfe says. \u201cSo even though we\u2019ve jumped forward in episode 13 [to see Claire] at 50, hopefully we\u2019ll see some of that journey between late 20s and 50.\u201d\n\nWhile the actors had yet to read scripts for season 3 when they spoke to Variety before the finale aired, Gabaldon\u2019s \u201cVoyager\u201d gives us some hints as to what we might see in the new season, including a final showdown between Jamie and Menzies\u2019 Black Jack Randall, who was destined to die on Culloden Moor.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve read the books you will know that Randall will appear again,\u201d Heughan teases. \u201cI know that Diana has written the scene of how they ended up [back together], so hopefully \u2013 and who knows, I haven\u2019t read the script yet, but hopefully, we\u2019ll get to see Jamie and Randall in the Battle of Culloden.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re also likely to see Frank again, to give viewers a sense of the realities of his relationship with Claire. We know from some of Brianna\u2019s comments in the finale that her parents\u2019 marriage wasn\u2019t particularly idyllic in its later years, and Menzies confirms that the tentative plan is for season 3 to explore the couple\u2019s dynamic following the move to Boston, including \u201cthe disintegration of their marriage out there\u2026 it\u2019s slightly \u2018Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf\u2019 in Boston, which hopefully will be really exciting stuff to dig into.\u201d\n\nBalfe agrees, \u201cThe relationship between Claire and Frank is so rich and complex, I\u2019m really looking forward to that.\u201d\n\nAfter the political intrigue of this season, Heughan says season 3 \u201cfeels like a very new chapter,\u201d with trips to tropical climates that are far removed from the chill of Scotland. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of travel involved, and I think that\u2019s the joy of the show \u2014 it\u2019s never the same thing, it\u2019s constantly moving, so next season should be quite an adventure.\u201d\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to seeing in \u201cOutlander\u201d season 3?
