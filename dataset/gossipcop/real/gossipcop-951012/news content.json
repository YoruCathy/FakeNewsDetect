He first gained popularity on the streaming platform SoundCloud and became something of a poster child for the digital age, with millions of young fans tracking his every utterance. But XXXTentacion was also mired in controversy and legal troubles, and was awaiting trial on charges including aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, false imprisonment and witness tampering at the time of his death.\n\nImage Michael Boatwright was served an arrest warrant for first-degree murder in the killing of XXXTentacion. Credit... Broward Sheriff's Office\n\nOn the day he was killed, the rapper visited Riva Motorsports with a friend. The police said two men followed XXXTentacion into the store and later, as he was leaving the dealership, blocked his vehicle and exited a dark-colored S.U.V. brandishing guns and demanding property. After a brief struggle, at least one of the suspects fired at the rapper, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital.\n\n\u201cThe investigation continues,\u201d the Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office said in its news release on Wednesday.\n\nSheriff Scott Israel of Broward said that his department was withholding additional information about the arrest of Mr. Boatwright, and sealed the arrest report, as it continued to pursue the case, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not releasing any information about it because we\u2019re still looking for two other suspects, including Robert Allen,\u201d Mr. Israel said. \u201cIf we release more information about the case, it may hamper detectives\u2019 ability or impede their progress to make those other arrests and take those two individuals into custody.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/music/12xxxarrest-2/12xxxarrest-2-popup.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/merlin_140386377_8014936b-9382-4ebd-9005-4e1bce50e1c8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/music/xxxtentacion-death-arrest.html", "title": "Second Suspect Arrested in Killing of Rapper XXXTentacion", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-07-11T15:41:15.000Z", "modified": "2018-07-11T15:51:46.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/joe-coscarelli", "tag": "Florida", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000006002171, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/15de2e81-26dc-5dbe-ae25-e1b2c7bde34a", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/2396e5d2c8c9492bbf43308c7ac4a84c", "description": "The police in Florida said on Wednesday that they had arrested one of two gunmen in the 20-year-old musician\u2019s death, but were still seeking an additional assailant.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Joe Coscarelli", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Murders and Homicides,Rap and Hip-Hop,XXXtentacion,Dedrick Devonshay Williams,Michael Boatwright,Florida", "pdate": 20180711, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/music/xxxtentacion-death-arrest.html", "type": "article", "title": "Second Suspect Arrested in Killing of Rapper XXXTentacion", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "A fan holds up an XXXTentacion shirt outside the memorial for the rapper in Florida.
