And as E! News reports, she has a particular outlook on people's obsession with her rekindled romance \u2014 or rather, lack thereof.\n\n\"I mean I don't think anybody truly, actually cares,\" she said when asked about her personal life. \"I think for me what's been great is that I've been able to live the life that I've wanted for myself. And that doesn't always look the way people maybe think it should look, but it's not really my concern anymore.\" She added, \"Look, my family is great, my health is great and I love deeply and I think that's just who I am, so I'm not really ashamed.\"\n\nSelena does have a point, as she recently revealed the kidney transplant she underwent this year was a matter of \"life-or-death\"; she later thanked her friend Francia Ra\u00edsa for \"saving my life\" during her Woman of the Year Acceptance speech. Fans may voice their concerns and weigh in on her pairing with Justin \u2014 many think she \"deserves better\" \u2014 but ultimately it's Selena's life, and her decision. As she said in her recent Billboard interview, \"I am grateful for who I am.\"\n\nRelated: Selena Gomez Said Her Kidney Transplant Finally Helped Her Love Her Body", "images": ["https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35992ac98298a550016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35b92ac98298a550019/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-109487949.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35992ac98298a550016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Rearick", "Lauren Rearic"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-on-justin-bieber-relationship-i-dont-think-anybody-cares", "title": "Selena Gomez on Justin Bieber Relationship: \"I Don't Think Anybody Cares\"", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Lauren Rearick", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Selena Gomez is weighing in on the public's opinion of her relationship with Justin Bieber \u2014\u00a0and she doesn't think anyone cares about Jelena.", "id": "5a21a99292ac98298a550009", "keywords": "culture,selena gomez,justin bieber, justin bieber", "news_keywords": "culture,selena gomez,justin bieber, justin bieber", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a21a99292ac98298a550009", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Selena Gomez is weighing in on the public's opinion of her relationship with Justin Bieber \u2014\u00a0and she doesn't think anyone cares about Jelena.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35992ac98298a550017/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35992ac98298a550017/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Huh.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35992ac98298a550016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Selena Gomez Doesn't Think Anyone Cares About Her Relationship With Justin Bieber", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-on-justin-bieber-relationship-i-dont-think-anybody-cares"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Huh.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a21b35992ac98298a550016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Selena Gomez Doesn't Think Anyone Cares About Her Relationship With Justin Bieber"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/201zC474BRk"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
