The rumor itself isn\u2019t all that interesting. But listening to her yesterday, I thought her candidacy for president would be fascinating.\n\nThe Democrats have a number of high-profile candidates who have been mentioned to take on the Republicans\u2019 reality-show star in 2020, many of whom rose outside of politics. In addition to Winfrey, there is Howard Schultz of Starbucks, actor Tom Hanks, former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump, of course, knows Winfrey well, having appeared on her show. And he\u2019s had nice things to say about her in the past. He undoubtedly still envies her mastery of branding and media as she built an empire after starting as a local newscaster in Nashville. Lately, he hasn\u2019t been as kind, calling her \u201cinsecure\u201d and saying he would love to run against her because (cue innuendo) he knows her \u201cweakness.\u201d\n\nBut Trump presumably knows her strengths, too. She has spent a lifetime interviewing people and understands how to give meaning to the struggles and aspirations of a wide cross section of Americans. If Trump is our national storyteller for fear and loathing, Winfrey is ours for hope and striving. Trump screams about an America under siege and beset by internal and external enemies; Winfrey has spent a lifetime in conversation with us about how we are all redeemable and that we can all have our piece of the pie.\n\nIt may be unlikely, but a presidential race which pits the slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again: The Sequel\u201d against \u201cThis land was made for you and me\u201d would get huge ratings and present our country with a very clear choice. Time will tell how the show plays out.\n\nAD\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/3dfea1f4-5a13-45de-9e96-0917661ecd4d.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GARMTN3B5UY2TKV5DVKLPENLJU.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/omMt_5lzR68prK96g0rZtNoxfWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YLMV3PEVFI2OXMAJJCAQRXD6MA.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/omMt_5lzR68prK96g0rZtNoxfWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YLMV3PEVFI2OXMAJJCAQRXD6MA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carter Eskew"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/11/02/as-oprah-hits-the-trail-is-2020-next/", "title": "As Oprah hits the trail, is 2020 next?", "meta_data": {"description": "If Oprah runs against Trump in 2020, Americans will have the clearest choice yet between optimism and pessimism.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2018/11/02/as-oprah-hits-the-trail-is-2020-next/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/omMt_5lzR68prK96g0rZtNoxfWc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YLMV3PEVFI2OXMAJJCAQRXD6MA.jpg", "title": "Opinion | As Oprah hits the trail, is 2020 next?", "description": "If Oprah runs against Trump in 2020, Americans will have the clearest choice yet between optimism and pessimism."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Opinion | As Oprah hits the trail, is 2020 next?", "description": "If Oprah runs against Trump in 2020, Americans will have the clearest choice yet between optimism and pessimism."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-06T22:48:35.719Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "true"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541088000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
