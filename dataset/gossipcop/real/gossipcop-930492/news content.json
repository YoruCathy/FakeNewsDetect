Entertainment via Getty Images Kim Kardashian poses for photos at the People's Choice Awards in November. Her interaction with Tristan Thompson as Khloe Kardashian gave birth -- just days after news broke that Thompson had cheated on Khloe -- was uncomfortable, to say the least.\n\nIf Khloe Kardashian\u2019s game is the revenge body, then Kim Kardashian\u2019s is just straight-up revenge.\n\nAs any Kardashian connoisseur will tell you, the reality TV star isn\u2019t afraid to unleash on those she thinks have wronged her \u2015 or worse, wronged anyone in her family. Enter Khloe\u2019s boyfriend and NBA player Tristan Thompson, who was caught cheating on her in multiple videos days before she gave birth to their daughter, True.\n\nKim predictably went ballistic after learning the news, unfollowing him on social media and declaring his actions were \u201cso fucked up\u201d during an appearance on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d shortly after.\n\nThe two have seemingly made up since (and made light of their feud), but a clip from this Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d shows Kim coming face-to-face with Thompson for the first time after learning he was unfaithful to her sister.\n\nAnd it\u2019s gloriously uncomfortable.\n\nThe two face off in Khloe\u2019s delivery room where Thompson is holding her hand through her contractions.\n\nKim, however, outright ignores him as she walks into the room. Then, she repeatedly makes throat-slitting gestures and sticks out her tongue behind his back.\n\nFinally, Khloe breaks the awkward silence and asks both Kim and Thompson, \u201cAre you going to say hi to each other or no?\u201d\n\nThompson makes the first move and brings Kim in for a deeply cringeworthy hug before the two pull away from each other.\n\n\u201cThe vibe in the room is calm. I thought there would be way more tension,\u201d Kim notes. \u201cAs much as I want to go off, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time. So I\u2019m gonna keep it cute, I don\u2019t have to have a lot of interaction. I just have to be there for her.\u201d\n\nTodd Williamson/E! Entertainment via Getty Images The KarJenner family poses with Chrissy Teigen backstage at the People's Choice Awards.\n\nDespite some of her family\u2019s reservations, Khloe chose to have Thompson in the delivery room for the sake of their daughter and to create a \u201cbeautiful birthing experience.\u201d\n\nThe Good American designer live-tweeted last week\u2019s episode and defended her decision to stick by the Cleveland Cavaliers player.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, everyone wants me to make a decision right this second and I just want to go and give birth and focus on that and try to enjoy this and try to enjoy it with him, as crazy as that sounds,\u201d Khloe said. \u201cI want to enjoy this with him. I don\u2019t want any negativity in the delivery room. I don\u2019t want anybody to talk about it, make me feel uncomfortable or make him feel uncomfortable. Let\u2019s just act normal.\u201d\n\nWhile she deeply sympathized with Khloe\u2019s struggle, Kim warned against giving Thompson another chance and advised her sister to break up with him.\n\n\u201cI told [Khloe], \u2018What are you going to get out of him?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re going to be worried and nervous and have an insecure life because if he\u2019s not faithful now, he\u2019ll never change.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2fb73c000020010b1930.jpeg?cache=3og96ssz8d&ops=210_120", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec95892100005204ca268d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=gt5shrj38l&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae35ce12000002e00b8fe73.jpeg?ops=210_120", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=gt5shrj38l&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc855a6240000090c524d4f.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5be08b611d00008b00309937.jpeg?cache=jrbc97efhq&ops=210_120", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=gt5shrj38l&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-khloe-tristan-thompson-cheating_n_5bec832fe4b0dbb7ea66b839", "title": "Kim Kardashian Confronting Tristan Thompson Over Cheating Scandal Is Petty Goals", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The two came face-to-face in Khloe Kardashian's delivery room.", "keywords": "kim kardashian,khloe kardashian,Tristan Thompson", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Confronting Tristan Thompson Over Cheating Scandal Is Petty Goals", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=gt5shrj38l&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=gt5shrj38l&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-khloe-tristan-thompson-cheating_n_5bec832fe4b0dbb7ea66b839", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The two came face-to-face in Khloe Kardashian's delivery room."}, "article": {"tag": "kim kardashian,khloe kardashian,Tristan Thompson", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-11-14 17:52:53 -0500", "modified_time": "2018-11-14 17:52:53 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Kim Kardashian Confronting Tristan Thompson Over Cheating Scandal Is Petty Goals", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bec8f5b240000aa025834cf.jpeg?cache=gt5shrj38l&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The two came face-to-face in Khloe Kardashian's delivery room.", "creator": "cdelbyck"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5bec832fe4b0dbb7ea66b839", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542235973.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
