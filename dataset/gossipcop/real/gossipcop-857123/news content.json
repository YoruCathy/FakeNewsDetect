And one need look no further than his latest studio effort under the Kid Fourteen solo moniker \u2014 the beguilingly titled \u201cLove\u201d \u2014 for proof of his near-universal disregard for convention.\n\nPursuing a concept that started off as a personal fascination with the notion of love as addressed by Arab literature, Ellaik \u201cslowly shifted into exploring the complexity of human intimacy, and how visceral feelings and vulnerability would sound if all other senses of expression were lost.\u201d\n\nThe result is a sonic rabbit hole of ethereal, synth-drenched landscapes and minimalist electronic beats that provide a fitting aural backdrop for this innovative musician\u2019s refreshingly honest musings on one of life\u2019s most powerful, mystifying emotions.\n\n\u201cI was fascinated by how, in Arab literature, that \u2018tingly\u2019 feeling and warmth associated with love are very sparsely talked about,\u201d he says, \u201cand then you\u2019re sucked into your own black hole of emotion.\n\n\u201cVery quickly,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou end up with obsession \u2014 it\u2019s no longer about pleasure; it\u2019s more like torture.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove\u201d is very much about dealing with those vertiginous vicissitudes of the heart. \u201cEven with my own relationships, it stopped being easy to sort of pinpoint what love is, and I wanted to express that sonically,\u201d Ellaik says.\n\nThe catalyst was the perfect collaborator: \u201cI found the right partner in Dani (Ghassan Arbid, Ellaik\u2019s friend and Berlin-based writer), who helped me back it all up lyrically. He happened, fortunately, to be writing about the same subject,\u201d Ellaik explains.\n\nDespite the obvious depth and aesthetic integrity of the lyrical expression, he opted for a novel creative approach on \u201cLove.\u201d \u201cAlmost half the album is instrumental; I wanted to see what happens if I don\u2019t express everything in words,\u201d he says. \u201cI stopped having the need to express things in an in-your-face way and wanted to be out of my comfort zone.\u201d\n\nThe final product took about a year to complete and is something Ellaik seems immensely proud of.\n\n\u201cI wanted this album to be its own universe, and I revisited it enough times to have very few regrets,\u201d he states.\n\nAlmost everything about his approach to the new record is a point of departure from his previous, more guitar-driven work. \u201cI took my time with this one... to work and rework and really try to bring the sounds I heard in my head to life,\u201d Ellaik says. \u201cTechnically, it was more of a learning curve \u2014 I worked with new machines, didn\u2019t use any guitars...\u201d\n\nBut the DIY, punk ethic that defined his early work is still very much there. Ellaik produced, mixed and mastered the record himself. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned at first, but then it became an essential element of the process. I started dabbling with mixing and got so deep into it that if I had handed it over to someone else, I wouldn\u2019t even have been able to explain what I wanted,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nKid Fourteen performing live.

In recent years, he has toured across the Middle East and Europe, and has found that \u201cpeople can identify with what you\u2019re expressing regardless of their musical taste or background. I would like to think it\u2019s an expression of the human condition, no matter where you are.\u201d\n\nHe believes that in spite of all the challenges of being an indie musician in the Middle East, \u201cIt\u2019s as good a place as any; this kind of self-expression is important and is very much a desirable thing, not only in the region, but beyond.\u201d\n\nTo help him fully realize the vision he had for his new album, Ellaik formed the \u2018kidsplay\u2019 collective with George Junior Daou (of the Lebanese indie festival Wicker Park) and Amer Hamzeh (of Arabic rock/indie folk duo Al-Mujalak). The goal of the new label has been to \u201cprovide the infrastructure and support needed by unique artists, who struggle to find their space within the business.\u201d The trio, who are all musicians, aspire to \u201chelp fellow artists reach a global audience\u201d.\n\nThat kind of artistic solidarity has made kidsplay an integral cog in bringing \u201cLove\u201d to life. \u201cWe are all creative in our own way, and the guys, like me, have the same frustrations; you end up having this genuine interest and dedication to the project,\u201d Ellaik says.\n\nIn the midst of a global pandemic and a situation that has put the entire world through a uniquely traumatic experience, Kid Fourteen and his collective have had to forgo the traditional promotional tactics when launching the album, which is, so far, only available digitally.\n\nBut Ellaik has plenty of plans moving forward. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing the Maazef platform, hosting a monthly radio show where I play fresh tunes, and I\u2019ll be releasing a collaboration that I did with (LA-based, experimental band) XiuXiu. I love them. They have been a big influence on me.\u201d\n\nKidsplay will also be a focal point for his creative energy, but not in front of a mic. \u201cI want to go into music production for the next few months, helping artists attain the sound that they want,\u201d he says enthusiastically. \u201cWhatever we do right with \u2018Love\u2019, we can apply to other artists with their own releases. We\u2019re all in this together, after all.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.arabnews.com/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/logo.png?sss", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_670_395/public/main-image/2020/04/18/2067096-1549427393.jpg?itok=bebtL8f0", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/18/2067001-431602626.png?itok=ifhcx78B", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/all/themes/narabnews/assets/img/logo.png", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_360_212/public/main-image/2020/04/03/2043186-1492687111.jpg?itok=vIYOGyCN", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/15/2062756-1251939963.jpg?itok=-rAYF69b", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/16/2064311-743251771.jpg?itok=_ORrutAk", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/18/2067096-1549427393.jpg?itok=QNL3NSI4", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_360_212/public/2017/05/08/907761-1804490872.jpg?itok=cPamaMj0", "http://mena-gmtdmp.mookie1.com/t/v2/learn?tagid=V2_605775&src.rand=[timestamp]", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/18/2067051-213107197.jpg?itok=MIAjchpZ", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/18/2067091-1378700412.png?itok=jXFE1Lga", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_670_395/public/2017/05/25/917756-509347835.jpg?itok=yKBFACKo", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/14/2061211-1613417089.jpg?itok=m9wPX5UD", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/25/917756-509347835.jpg", "http://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/userimages/445491/photo_by_beirut_electro_parade.jpg", "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_100_59/public/main-image/2020/04/18/2067071-2132061361.jpg?itok=AB8c-Ggn"], "top_img": "https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/25/917756-509347835.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bojan Preradovic"], "canonical_link": "https://www.arabnews.com/node/1104606/art-culture", "title": "\u2018I\u2019d never make it in Bollywood,\u2019 Brad Pitt tells Shah Rukh Khan", "meta_data": {"description": "MUMBAI: Brad Pitt told Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan that he doesn\u2019t have the moves to star in Bollywood films as he promoted his new movie \u201cWar Machine\u201d in Mumbai on Wednesday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t make it Bollywood because I can\u2019t dance or sing,\u201d said the American actor during an event with Khan in front of journalists in India\u2019s financial capital.
