Kardashian was replying to a fan\u2019s tweet saying the next episode, which will show the fallout of Thompson\u2019s alleged cheating, \u201cwill be insane.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadly, it will,\u201d Kardashian said about the next \u201cKUWTK\u201d episode. \u201cI signed up to show the for the good and the bad, right? The bad is very hard to relive but it\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nIn April, several photos and videos emerged showing the NBA star appearing to cheat on Kardashian with several women. Videos posted by The Daily Mail showed Thompson inside a New York City nightclub apparently kissing another woman while Kardashian was nine months pregnant.\n\nKardashian gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child, True Thompson, days after the reports emerged.\n\nKHLOE KARDASHIAN IS 'PROUD' OF HER STRENGTH FOLLOWING TRISTAN THOMPSON CHEATING SCANDAL\n\nThe couple has since been pictured together. On Saturday, Kardashian took to Instagram to thank Thompson for her \u201cWelcome Home\u201d balloons for when she returned from her recent trip to Bali.\n\nKardashian previously defended her decision to stay with Thompson, telling a fan that she has \u201cno knowledge of what goes on in our household or the enormous rebuilding [it] takes to even coexist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my strength,\u201d the Good American clothing founder tweeted.\n\nBut in recent weeks she has also posted cryptic messages about relationships.\n\nKardashian posted in an Instagram Story earlier this month: \u201cFree yourself from negative people. Spend time with nice people who are smart, driven and likeminded. Relationships should help you, not hurt you.\"", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1018693660.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/270/152/Jana-Kramer-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/Gwyneth-Paltrow-GETTY-cropped.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/LA-Premiere-of-5EThe-G_Admi.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ContentBroker_contentid-2a3b7e0246f54c32a6cd1da89f3ef154.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/11/931/524/694940094001_5768236854001_5768225833001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/640/320/GettyImages-1018693660.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1018693660.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
