Jimmy Fallon and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson teamed up for some fun and games at Universal Studios Orlando, and they even brought one man to tears while photobombing unsuspecting fans.\n\nThe Tonight Show host, 42, who is promoting his new Race Through New York ride at the theme park, challenged the Fate of the Furious star, 44, to play Race Through Universal Studios, which entailed dressing up as mascot versions of themselves. The stars attempted to score as many fan high-fives (worth one point), hugs (worth three points) and photos (worth five points) as they could in three minutes.\n\nAfter dashing around the park and interacting with dozens of tourists, the final tally showed Fallon was the winner with 111 points to Johnson\u2019s 103. The comedian took off his mascot head and celebrated as a huge crowd gathered to watch.\n\n\u201cWhile we have this on, want to go upstairs and photobomb some people?\u201d Fallon asked, to which the WWE star replied, \u201cUmm, what\u2019s that term? Hell, yes!\u201d\n\nThe duo proceeded to jump behind theme park visitors while they were having their photos taken at Fallon\u2019s brand-new attraction. In the background, the pair chest bumped, dabbed, twerked and tried on tiny hats, and at one point, they hilariously swapped heads. After the photos, they removed their heads and revealed their real identities to the delight of the tourists.\n\nOne visitor got particularly excited when the Baywatch actor\u2019s mascot emerged. \u201cThe Rock! My man, my hero since I was, like, 5 years old,\u201d the man said, unaware that the real Johnson was under the cartoon head.\n\nWhen the former wrestler took off the mask, the man began to cry. \u201cNo tears!\u201d Johnson told him, before taking several photos with the guy. The superfan also revealed that he had a giant tattoo of The Rock on his leg.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-jimmy-fallon-88d3b507-2ebb-4fe7-9519-e11f07b46774.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-jimmy-fallon-a8e7003d-8f3a-475e-a0e2-86dbd85ba0fe.jpg?crop=132px%2C165px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-jimmy-fallon-a8e7003d-8f3a-475e-a0e2-86dbd85ba0fe.jpg?crop=132px%2C165px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jimmy-fallon-the-rock-make-a-man-cry-while-photobombing-fans-w475483/", "title": "Jimmy Fallon, The Rock Make a Man Cry While Photobombing Fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Jimmy Fallon and Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson made a grown man cry while photobombing fans \u2014 find out why!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jimmy Fallon, The Rock Make a Man Cry While Photobombing Fans", "description": "Jimmy Fallon and Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson made a grown man cry while photobombing fans \u2014 find out why!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jimmy-fallon-the-rock-make-a-man-cry-while-photobombing-fans-w475483/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:19:36+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-jimmy-fallon-a8e7003d-8f3a-475e-a0e2-86dbd85ba0fe.jpg?crop=132px%2C165px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-jimmy-fallon-a8e7003d-8f3a-475e-a0e2-86dbd85ba0fe.jpg?crop=132px%2C165px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-06T20:50:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:19:36+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Jimmy Fallon and Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson made a grown man cry while photobombing fans \u2014 find out why!", "title": "Jimmy Fallon, The Rock Make a Man Cry While Photobombing Fans", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-jimmy-fallon-a8e7003d-8f3a-475e-a0e2-86dbd85ba0fe.jpg?crop=132px%2C165px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491511800.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
