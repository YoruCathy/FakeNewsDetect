With the Premiere Ceremony taking place before the show, several awards started being handed out as early as 3 p.m. ET -- 75, to be exact -- and Billboard was there to catch it all from the start.\n\nFrom red carpet interactions to press room commentary, Grammys given out early to behind-the-scenes moments inside the official show, here's a glimpse of what doesn't get caught on camera on music's biggest night.\n\n3:19 p.m. ET Ten minutes after the Grammy Awards Premiere Ceremony kicks off, the first Grammy of 2018 is awarded to LCD Soundsystem for their song \u201cTonite,\u201d marking the dance-rock band\u2019s first win after five previous nominations.

Later in the press room, Azerrad further explains his reasoning for tributing Berry. \u201c[He\u2019s] the only example of rock \u2019n' roll on the album .... Long after the Earth is swallowed up by the sun, Chuck Berry\u2019s record will still be floating in space. So it was kind of poignant on the 40th anniversary of the Voyager and our record coming out was also the year that he left us. He was a critical part of the project.\"\n\n3:38 p.m. Paul Schaffer\u2019s band plays an instrumental version of Fall Out Boy\u2019s \u201cCenturies\u201d as Leonard Bernstein composer goes up to accept historical album \u2014 coincidental timing for the choice, as Fall Out Boy had just earned their fourth No. 1 album as M A N I A debuted atop the Billboard 200 just hours before.\n\n3:49 p.m. India.Arie delivers the first performance of the 2018 Grammys, a poignantly relevant rendition of her 2013 hit, \u201cI Am Light.\"\n\n3:51 p.m. Sasha Barr, who worked with Father John Misty to create the Pure Comedy album packaging (and won this year\u2019s Grammy for best recording package) reveals to press room reporters that the two \u2014 who have worked together several times in the past \u2014 are already working on the follow-up to the album.\n\n3:59 p.m. 24K Magic engineers John Hanes & Charles Moniz celebrate their win for best engineered album, non-classical by talking about Bruno Mars\u2019 involvement with the album\u2019s engineering. \"He wants to try all permutations and exhaust all possibilities.

Despite his excitement for the nomination, Miranda wasn\u2019t there to accept the award.\n\n4:08 p.m. After Residente wins for best Latin rock, urban or alternative album, the Latin rapper talks to reporters in the press room and acknowledges the influence of Latin music on the pop world thanks to Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's \u201cDespacito\u201d and beyond: \"It\u2019s good what\u2019s happening.

As for their Grammy win, Pasek couldn\u2019t help smiling while saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a very surreal and wonderful experience, and we feel very honored to be here tonight.\"\n\n4:29 p.m. Justin Hurwitz reflects on the La La Land flub at last year\u2019s Oscars while holding his two Grammys for La La Land\u2019s wins in the best compilation soundtrack for visual media and best score soundtrack for visual media. \"It was a crazy moment, honestly it\u2019s a blur. I\u2019ve watched it on YouTube a few times because my actual memory is a blur,\u201d he says in the press room. \u201cIt was just very confusing, but it was a great night for our movie and obviously a great night for Moonlight which is a phenomenal film.\"\n\n5:10 p.m. Following his win for best contemporary Christian music album (Chain Breaker), Zach Williams mentioned that Chris Pratt had used one of his songs in an Instagram post earlier in the week that made it go viral.

It's about time. It's really about time that we had some success together.'\"\n\n10:39 p.m. With at least 20 minutes left to go, MSG is already emptying out as people start to head to after-parties.\n\n10:42 p.m. James Corden acts like he\u2019s about to introduce Barack Obama... and instead intros Recording Academy chief Neil Portnow. The MSG audience grumbles in response after haphazardly standing up for the fake-out.\n\n10:55 p.m. Logic using the word \u201cshitholes\u201d might have earned him a bleep-out in the telecast, but defending the countries President Trump recently dismissed as \u201cnot SHITHOLES\u201d also earned the rapper an immediate standing ovation from the Madison Square Garden attendees, who stood for the rest of his politically tinged sermon.\n\n10:58 p.m. As Chris Stapleton sports his three Grammys from the night -- the country crooner won for best country solo performance (\"Either Way\"), best country song (\"Broken Halos\"), and best country album (From a Room: Volume 1) in a sweep -- to the press room, admitting, \"I feel kind of awkward holding three of them right now.\" Stapleton also discusses working with Justin Timberlake on their recently released collaboration, \"Say Something\" and reveals that he plays the opening guitar lick on \"Filthy.\"\n\n11:05 p.m. Logic comes backstage to the press room after his moving performance of \"1-800-273-8255\" with Alessia Cara and Khalid and, despite the heavy yet uplifting message he shared after performing, he was in a bit of a witty mood as he took the mic. \"I've never done this, I feel like I should be on the Knicks or something,\" he jokes, later telling reporters that he was asked by the Recording Academy to give a speech. \"I wanted it to come from the heart. I\u2019m not Tupac, or this prophetic dude or anything like that, I just want to make music and have fun. However, I have a power that a a lot of people in this world don\u2019t, and I've been given a stage that the one percent get. I thought if I was going to have this power, I\u2019d use it for positivity -- peace love and positivity to spread a positive message. Everyone is beautiful, and the world isn\u2019t equal -- and we need to fight towards that.\"\n\n11:12 p.m. Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, comes to the press room post-show and addresses his 2017 comments about bringing Childish Gambino to an end -- even despite winning a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance (\"Redbone\") earlier in the night. \"I stand by that,\" he says. \"I'm really appreciative of this and I'm making another project, but I like endings. I think they're important to progress. If a lot of things had death notes or clauses we'd have less problems. Endings are good, they force things to get better.\"\n\n11: 55 p.m. Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich talks to reporters in the press room in a late post-show appearance (the final press room appearance of the night), briefly discussing Taylor Swift's absence at this year's awards -- and hinted that she may be invited to perform in 2019: \"Hopefully we'll see her next year, we'd like her on the show.\"", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/grammys-2018-recirc-billboard.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?31b846bafac45d8539bb", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096794/grammys-2018-what-fans-didnt-see-on-tv-behind-the-scenes", "title": "41 Things You Didn't See on TV at Grammys 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-01-31T13:06:12-05:00", "published_time": "2018-01-29T00:13:10-05:00"}, "description": "From red carpet interactions to press room commentary, Grammys given out early to behind-the-scenes moments inside the official show, here's a glimpse of what doesn't get caught on camera on music's biggest night.", "og": {"description": "From red carpet interactions to press room commentary, Grammys given out early to behind-the-scenes moments inside the official show, here's a glimpse of what doesn't get caught on camera on music's biggest night.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Grammys 2018: 41 Things You Didn't See on TV | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096794/grammys-2018-what-fans-didnt-see-on-tv-behind-the-scenes", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "41 Things You Didn't See on TV at Grammys 2018", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "From red carpet interactions to press room commentary, Grammys given out early to behind-the-scenes moments inside the official show, here's a glimpse of what doesn't get caught on camera on music's biggest night.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "41 Things You Didn't See on TV at Grammys 2018", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517202790.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
