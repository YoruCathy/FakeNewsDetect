Photograph: Daria Kobayashi Ritch\n\nThe journalist who interviewed Knowles has also asked for her name to be removed from the article and publicly disowned it.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Angelica Bastien said: \u201cI am publicly disowning the Solange piece London Evening Standard published today. The entire piece was a fiasco despite my efforts.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told my editors to take my name off of the byline because they distorted my work and reporting in ways that made me very uncomfortable, which was heartbreaking given how much work I put into it and my interest in Solange as an artist.\u201d\n\nThe story describes braiding as \u201cimportant to Knowles\u201d. The singer told the magazine: \u201cIt is an act of beauty, an act of convenience and an act of tradition,\u201d adding that it is \u201cits own art form\u201d.\n\nDiscussing growing up around her mother\u2019s hair salon, Knowles said: \u201cI got to experience women arriving in one state of mind and leaving in a completely transformed way.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about the hair. It was about the sisterhood and the storytelling. Being a young girl who was really active in dance, theatre and on the swim team, the salon was a kind of safe haven.\u201d", "images":
