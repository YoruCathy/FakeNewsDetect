I was sore and it hurt to walk.\"\n\nThe next hearing in the case has been set for August 8.\n\nEarlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on \"Good Morning America\" with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing.\n\nChyna told \"GMA\" she was \"devastated\" by Kardashian's actions.\n\n\"Like, this is a person I trusted,\" she said. \"I just felt...betrayed.\"\n\nShe denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.\n\nShe said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream.\n\n\"The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me,\" said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. \"If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law.\"\n\nBloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client.\n\nCalifornia has laws regarding \"revenge porn\" in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress.\n\nThe former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that's been documented on both social media and their E! reality series \"Rob & Chyna.\"\n\nThings were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian's younger sister, Kylie Jenner.\n\nOn Monday's \"GMA\" appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings.\n\n\"Any explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that's her choice,\" Bloom said. \"This is like saying that a woman can't be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It's her body, it's her choice,each and every time.\"\n\nChyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian's social media postings last Wednesday.\n\nChyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it.\n\n\"I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardsahians,\" she said.", "images": ["https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order-super-tease.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160912071340-rob-and-chyna-exlarge-169.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/blac-chyna-gma-restraining-order/index.html", "title": "Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "entertainment", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2017-07-10T13:12:14Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/blac-chyna-gma-restraining-order/index.html", "title": "Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian", "description": "Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2017-07-10T13:12:14Z", "lastmod": "2017-07-11T20:21:17Z", "author": "Lisa Respers France, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian", "description": "Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.", "keywords": "entertainment, Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/blac-chyna-gma-restraining-order/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "entertainment,art-vid"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499616000.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
