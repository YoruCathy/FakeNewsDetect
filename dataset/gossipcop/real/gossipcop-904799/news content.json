Portman went off script and stated, \"And here are all the male nominees.\"\n\nBarbara Streisand remains the only woman to ever win the best director prize. She was the first female director to be nominated and won in 1984 for Yentl. Streisand was again nominated in 1992 for The Prince of Tides.\n\nOnly four women have been nominated in the category following Streisand. In 1994, Jane Campion was nominated for The Piano, Sofia Coppola earned a nomination in 2004 for Lost in Translation, Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker and in 2013 for Zero Dark Thirty and Ava DuVernay in 2015 for Selma.\n\nSimilar to the Golden Globes, the Academy Awards have historically lacked representation of female directors in the nominations. Bigelow is the only woman to win the best director Oscar for The Hurt Locker, while Coppola, Campion and Lina Wertmuller are the only other women to be nominated in the category.\n\nThe nominees for the 2019 Golden Globe Awards were unveiled Thursday during a press conference held at the Beverly Hills Hilton. (The Golden Globe Awards ceremony is produced by Dick Clark Productions, which shares a parent company with The Hollywood Reporter.)", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2018/12/gettyimages-1078075520-h_2018.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/12/gettyimages-1078075520-h_2018.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom2/Banners/THR_goldenGlobes-embeds2x.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/12/gettyimages-1078075520-h_2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/no-female-directors-nominated-golden-globe-awards-2019-1166616", "title": "Female Directors Shut Out of Golden Globe Nominations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The 2019 Golden Globe Awards nominations were announced Thursday during a press conference held at the Beverly Hills Hilton.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/no-female-directors-nominated-golden-globe-awards-2019-1166616", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Female Directors Shut Out of Golden Globe Nominations", "description": "The nominations follow Natalie Portman's criticism of the lack of female directors nominated during the 2018 awards show.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/12/gettyimages-1078075520-h_2018.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Female Directors Shut Out of Golden Globe Nominations", "description": "The nominations follow Natalie Portman's criticism of the lack of female directors nominated during the 2018 awards show.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/no-female-directors-nominated-golden-globe-awards-2019-1166616", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/12/gettyimages-1078075520-h_2018.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Female Directors Shut Out of Golden Globe Nominations", "sailthru.description": "The nominations follow Natalie Portman's criticism of the lack of female directors nominated during the 2018 awards show.", "sailthru.author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "sailthru.vertical": "Awards", "sailthru.date": "2018-12-06 05:55:46", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Golden Globes,Golden Globes 2019"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544046946.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
