It wasn\u2019t any different for Emma Watson. The Harry Potter star shares it was an honour for her to share screen space with Hanks in their upcoming techno-thriller, The Circle. The film is being helmed by James Ponsoldt.\n\n\u201cGetting to act with Tom Hanks in any scene is bit of a dream. So like anything where it was the three of us (Hanks, Ponsoldt and her) it was kind of fun...,\u201d says the 27-year-old.\n\nTom Hanks plays the character of Eamon Bailey in the techno-thriller titled The Circle. ( REUTERS )\n\nThe actor was earlier quoted by the International media as saying that she started working on the film with a lot of expectations from Tom Hanks. And it goes without saying how he lived up to all of them. \u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be as nice as everyone says he is and whatever else. And then he was! He\u2019s so generous and funny and easy-going and he\u2019s all the things you would want him to be. So I\u2019m very happy to be able to report that to you sincerely because it would have broken my heart, I think, if Tom wasn\u2019t Tom,\u201d she was quoted by E! News.\n\nIn the film, while Emma Watson essays the role of Mae Holland, the youngest employee of The Circle, Tom Hanks plays Eamon Bailey, who is the founding head of the organisation. The Circle is expected to hit theatres in India on May 19.\n\nTalking about the relationship that their onscreen characters share, the Beauty and the Beast actor adds, \u201cMae and Bailey, well it starts out as employer employee and it becomes, I would say one of those very complicated, patriarchal relationships where Bailey takes on the kind of father figure sort of role with her but of course is her employer at the end of the day. So it becomes a very complex relationship.\u201d\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more", "images":
