Devil or angel? And does it even matter?\n\nNBC\u2019s delightful comedy series \u201cThe Good Place\u201d started out as a vision of paradise, albeit a rather odd and completely secular paradise; it ended its first season with the show-shattering reveal that our human characters had actually been spending their time in a radical new version of hell designed to get them to torture each other rather than leaving that job to the pros.\n\nAnd in Season 2, the show from \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d creator Mike Schur kept upending itself in the most delicious of ways.\n\nThis is a show that can make hell kind of charming and give a fun, cuddly twist to the afterlife. Kristen Bell somehow makes us root for a woman whose self-obsession knows no bounds but who\u2019s smarter and maybe even nicer than she lets on. Ted Danson was a scene stealer even in the first season as a human-torturing demon who had to hide his true nature from the other characters and from the audience.\n\n(Granted, words like demon may not be appropriate for an altogether nonreligious and bureaucratic afterworld; he\u2019s middle management at best, and not very good at his job of torturing humans.)\n\nAlso Read: 'Good Place' Creator Mike Schur Confirms Exactly Where Eleanor and the Gang Are in Season 3\n\nOn a break early in the filming of Season 3, Bell and Danson discussed the pleasures and challenges of a show that delights in blowing up its own premise over and over. (Warning: spoilers ahead.)\n\nSeason 2 must have been a real kick for you, Ted, because you finally got to\u2026\n\nTED DANSON Be who I am. Yeah, it was really fun. And it was easier to find the funny, because funny usually is this kind of triangular thing between you, another character and the audience. But I had no relationship to the audience in Season 1. They never saw me in a private moment, or I would have been twirling my mustache.\n\nWould you have taken the part without the knowledge that eventually you were going to get to show who this guy really is?\n\nDANSON Oh, I would have done it. I signed on before I saw a script. I knew that Kristen was likely going to do it. I then listened to Mike Schur empty his mind for an hour and tell me everything he knew about the show and the twist. And I really signed up for Mike Schur.\n\nKRISTEN BELL He can tell a story with detail that is frightening, like a computer. \u201cHere\u2019s what I want to do in Episode 9, and it\u2019s a callback to Episode 6\u2026\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYou haven\u2019t even written the pilot, bro! Slow down!\u201d\n\nDANSON Is this the first job you\u2019ve taken when you haven\u2019t read a script?\n\nBELL Yeah. Wow. Yeah. We were sold on the idea, with the twist, and with his commitment to cliff-hangers and pulling the rug out from under people. I just thought, \u201cWhat a goal. Let him try, I\u2019d love to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Kristen Bell Says 'Good Place' Set Really Is a Good Place - Thanks to 'No Jerks' Policy (Video)\n\nI feel as if Ted needed to know the twist to play his part, but you didn\u2019t.\n\nDANSON But she needed to know in order to take the part.\n\nBELL Well, yes and no. Mike is an unparalleled collaborator, and I think he had respect enough for me to say, \u201cI would like you to know what you\u2019re signing up for.\u201d So he opened the whole kimono that day.\n\nWas it frustrating to hide who this guy was, Ted?\n\nDANSON I don\u2019t know about frustrating, because I had my hands full just trying to fulfill the script. But watching it, I would go, \u201cYou\u2019re either doing a really good job, Ted, or that\u2019s some of the worst acting I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d And I couldn\u2019t quite make up my mind.\n\nBELL Around Episode 8 of the first season, my husband [Dax Shepard] said, \u201cI love your show, but my one critique is that Ted is just wildly underused. He\u2019s just kind of one-note.\u201d And I didn\u2019t tell him the twist, because I can keep a secret.\n\nDANSON [Silently mouths] I can\u2019t.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Good Place' Stars Ted Danson and Kristen Bell Portraits (Exclusive Photos)\n\nBELL I couldn\u2019t tell him that there was a very specific reason you\u2019ve never seen Michael on camera by himself, that all those choices were leading up to something wonderful.\n\nDANSON It was hard.\n\nBELL Keeping the secret?\n\nDANSON No, that was easy, because I didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t know how to be funny.\n\nBELL I don\u2019t think you realize how funny it is when you\u2019re bumbling.\n\nDANSON I don\u2019t.\n\nBELL It\u2019s pretty cute.\n\nAlso Read: 'The Good Place' Star D'Arcy Carden Teases Season 3 Surprises: 'Whew, Baby!' (Video)\n\nSo Kristen, were you looking forward to working with the unleashed Ted Danson in Season 2?\n\nBELL Big time. That terrifying cackle he gave at the end of Season 1, I was like, \u201cWhat is in store?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s in store is that Michael changes \u2014 he starts the season torturing humans and ends as something of a guardian angel.\n\nDANSON Well, he\u2019s madly in love with humans. And I think he recognizes that Eleanor\u2019s way smarter than he is.\n\nBELL I agree.\n\nDANSON He watches her change and still be doomed. And if you can change in the afterlife, you should be able to garner points or something. The system sucks, and it just seems horribly unfair to him that people he\u2019s grown to love don\u2019t stand a chance to be in the Good Place.\n\nAs a viewer, I have no idea where the show is going in Season 3. You blew up the premise at the end of Season 1, then took the setting for both seasons and stuck it in a museum on hell. The humans are back on Earth, but for how long?\n\nDANSON Nice try, thinking you can get us to tell you something about Season 3. Not me.\n\nBELL It\u2019s impossible not to say at the end of each of our seasons, \u201cWhere on Earth are they going to put us?\u201d No pun intended. \u201cWhat is going to happen, how could we possibly raise the stakes?\u201d But they figure it out. They are given a problem in that writers room and they figure it out. I don\u2019t even know how they do it, but it\u2019s fascinating what they do.\n\nAlso Read: Kristen Bell Says 'Good Place' Set Really Is a Good Place - Thanks to 'No Jerks' Policy (Video)\n\nKristen, when you were on TheWrap\u2019s comedy actors panel, you talked about how we\u2019re in a time where we need heroes who are good \u2014 that we\u2019re not looking for Walter White or Tony Soprano anymore. Do you think this is a show for its time?\n\nBELL I do. I think that when your reality is comfortable, you can be entertained by something uncomfortable. When your reality is more uncomfortable, I think you want to see people fighting for good. You want to see something relatable: \u201cOh, those people are in a crazy/s\u2014ty situation as well, and they\u2019re figuring it out, and they have hope and drive.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s why our show has been successful, because people enjoy that these characters are fighting for goodness amidst all their bumbling complexities and idiotic behavior.\n\nDANSON When I think about Mike Schur, one of the things I think about is that he\u2019s a decent man. And I think to talk about decency and ethics and consequences and do it with a 9-year-old\u2019s fart sense of humor and magical visual effects, it\u2019s just brilliant.\n\nWas the morality of it, for lack of a better word, one of the reasons you were interested?\n\nDANSON I don\u2019t think I got it until I started watching the shows and would see Eleanor wrap up a little moral to our story. It took me a while to get it. You must have gotten it faster.\n\nBELL For sure. In that love fest with Mike in our first meeting, I realized that he, too, has long been preoccupied with what it means to be a good person. I felt a connection with him.\n\nAlso Read: Ryan Hansen Trolls 'Veronica Mars' Fans, Dupes Kristen Bell Into Saving His YouTube Red Show (Video)\n\nSo you have that preoccupation as well?\n\nBELL Oh, yeah. It began as your regular old therapeutic codependency. I wanted to please people, and I want to be liked, and I\u2019m afraid to disappoint people. And in learning how to manage that a little bit more, and figure out how to be good to myself with self-care and boundaries, I realized that a lot of my codependency was things that I really enjoyed, and some of it wasn\u2019t codependency at all. It was just who I wanted to be.\n\nThere is a part that recognizes that good behavior makes me feel good. Who knows if there will ever be a reward, but the reward of feeling good is enough for me right now.\n\nTed, was it as much fun for you as it was for the audience when you showed up as a bartender in a scene late in Season 2?\n\nDANSON No! I hate getting behind a bar. It took me a year on \u201cCheers\u201d to not be embarrassed or shy. I was so not a bar person or a confident Romeo. I was a backwards, shy kind of kid. Took me almost a year to get that Sam Malone relief-pitcher, bartender arrogance. So having stopped that, I seriously have anxiety stepping behind a bar. It was a great scene, but I was so uncomfortable.\n\nAlso Read: Kristen Bell Knows How 'The Good Place' Ultimately Ends\n\nHad you two met before this series?\n\nBELL We had. My husband and I had just watched the first season of \u201cDamages,\u201d which is so good. Ted plays Arthur Frobisher, and we were so obsessed with it that for that year or two, we changed our alias to get mail to Holly and Arthur Frobisher.\n\nThen I booked this movie called \u201cBig Miracle,\u201d which Ted was also in. And I met him for the first time in Alaska in this lobby of the hotel. And I said, \u201cHello, Mr. Danson, my name is Kristen Bell. I don\u2019t want to freak you out, but I do want to let you know that I am checked into this hotel as Holly Frobisher.\u201d And he was like, \u201cOh, OK. Very nice to meet you.\u201d I realized in retrospect that was maybe not a good opener.\n\nDANSON Captain Cook.\n\nBELL It was the Captain Cook Hotel. Did it freak you out when I told you I was checked in as Mrs. Frobisher?\n\nDANSON Well, maybe.\n\nBELL Did you, like, tell the ADs to keep me away?\n\nDANSON No. And now that I know you and Dax, I can see how much fun you must have had doing it.\n\nBELL Oh, we loved it.\n\nAlso Read: Natalie Morales to Reunite With 'Parks and Recreation' Co-Creator Mike Schur for 'Abby's'\n\nI hear you took Ted to his first escape room, and I\u2019m wondering if there will be a second.\n\nDANSON No. No f\u2014ing way.\n\nBELL Shut up! There will be a second escape room. First of all, if Mary [Steenburgen, Danson\u2019s wife] and I have anything to say about it, there will be.\n\nDANSON Mary is dying to go again.\n\nBELL I should have done more research, so this one is on me. I should have realized that this was an escape room where A, they split your group up, which is already no fun, and B, they turn off the lights, so it\u2019s pitch black. You are given flashlights, and Ted just sat down on the little twin bed that was in the room and handed Dax his flashlight\u2026\n\nDANSON And just stretched out.\n\nBELL Meanwhile, Mary was killing it on our side. She was an amazing detective.\n\nDANSON It wasn\u2019t just that the lights were out and I like to take naps. It\u2019s also that I was with the guys, and the guys are meant to relax. If I\u2019m around women, I\u2019m up and interested. If it\u2019s the guys, I\u2019m gonna stretch out. There\u2019s no one to impress.\n\nAlso Read: How the 2018 Emmys Actor and Actress Hopefuls Beat Hollywood's Expectations (Video)\n\nGetting back to your show, do you have any ideas of how you\u2019d like things to end for your characters?\n\nDANSON I can guarantee that whatever I could possibly imagine would fall so short of whatever comes out of Mike\u2019s noggin.\n\nBELL Ditto. Yeah. We know our place, and we\u2019re so happy to live here.\n\nIt\u2019s a good place?\n\nBELL Exactly. I have no problem leaving the heavy lifting up to them.\n\nRead more of TheWrap\u2019s Comedy/Drama/Actors Emmy issue here.", "images":
