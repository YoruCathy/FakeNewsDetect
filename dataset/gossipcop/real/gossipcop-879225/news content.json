Kylie Jenner revealed in a Snapchat she shared with followers on Saturday, October 22, how she confused a pig for a chicken in a clip that went viral earlier this month.\n\nJenner, 19, looked calm and collected as she explained to fans why she blurted out, \u201cIs that a chicken?\u201d when she saw her mom, Kris Jenner, holding a baby pig wrapped in a blanket in a deleted scene from Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\n\u201cAll right, so everyone keeps tweeting me this one Vine of my mom getting me a pig and I mistake it for a chicken,\u201d she said in the Snapchat clip. \u201cBut here\u2019s the real story behind me thinking that it\u2019s a chicken.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kylie Jenner Snapchats (@kylizzlesnapchats) on Oct 22, 2016 at 9:05pm PDT\n\nKylie Jenner thinking this pig is a chicken https://t.co/q4qMFMqi6Q \u2014 anouk (@CARL0T0) October 11, 2016\n\n\u201cSo I love chickens, and my mom asked me what I wanted for my housewarming gift, so I told her, \u2018I want chickens, I want a chicken coop, I\u2019m dying to have a chicken,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cWe had, like, over 10 conversations about it, so when I saw her downstairs, I saw something that was all wrapped up in her arms, and I was upstairs, of course I assumed that it was a f\u2011\u2011king chicken. I never asked for a pig.\u201d\n\nThe makeup maven\u2019s confusion led to some fans creating Vines poking fun at her mistake, including clips of pigs being called chickens, and one in which a little girl can be heard saying in video of pigs in a pen, \u201cLook at all those chickens!\u201d\n\nJenner took the joking in stride and told her followers Saturday, \u201cBut yeah, I just wanted to make the public announcement that I do know the difference between a chicken and a pig, so you guys don\u2019t have to worry. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, then simply ignore all these Snapchats.\u201d\n\nThough Jenner\u2019s older sister Kim Kardashian has remained silent on social media following her harrowing Paris robbery, the rest of the reality clan has slowly returned to their very public lives.\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Oct 22, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT\n\nOn Saturday, Jenner also shared a photo of herself, sister Kendall Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s baby daddy, Scott Disick, sitting atop a sports car.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kyliejenner-c51adaca-19b6-4a68-b1ac-93c84521a719.jpg?crop=335px%2C87px%2C1641px%2C861px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kyliejenner-ee6a5938-5186-4360-b5aa-ee9ec93cc284.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kyliejenner-c51adaca-19b6-4a68-b1ac-93c84521a719.jpg?crop=335px%2C87px%2C1641px%2C861px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-explains-how-she-confused-a-pig-for-a-chicken-w446327/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Explains How She Confused a Pig for a Chicken", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kylie Jenner explained how she confused a pig for a chicken in a Snapchat she shared on Saturday, October 22, following a viral clip from earlier this month \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Explains How She Confused a Pig for a Chicken", "description": "Kylie Jenner explained how she confused a pig for a chicken in a Snapchat she shared on Saturday, October 22, following a viral clip from earlier this month \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-explains-how-she-confused-a-pig-for-a-chicken-w446327/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T23:31:37+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kyliejenner-c51adaca-19b6-4a68-b1ac-93c84521a719.jpg?crop=335px%2C87px%2C1641px%2C861px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kyliejenner-c51adaca-19b6-4a68-b1ac-93c84521a719.jpg?crop=335px%2C87px%2C1641px%2C861px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2016-10-23T21:49:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T23:31:37+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kylie Jenner explained how she confused a pig for a chicken in a Snapchat she shared on Saturday, October 22, following a viral clip from earlier this month \u2014 read more", "title": "Kylie Jenner Explains How She Confused a Pig for a Chicken", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kyliejenner-c51adaca-19b6-4a68-b1ac-93c84521a719.jpg?crop=335px%2C87px%2C1641px%2C861px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1477259340.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
