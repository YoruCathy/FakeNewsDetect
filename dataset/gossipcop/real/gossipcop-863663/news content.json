In details from the book published by the Daily Mail, one of Packer\u2019s co-workers points out just how weird it was for the businessman to team up with a global superstar: \u201cI always thought the last thing in the world he wanted was publicity.\u201d\n\nPacker and his staffers, meanwhile, say they tried to convince Carey she didn\u2019t need to be camera-ready at every moment. \u201cI remember telling her, \u2018No one can photograph you here, you don\u2019t need to worry about the paparazzi,\u2019\u201d says one staffer quoted in the Mail. \u201cBut she simply responded with words to the effect of, \u2018This is me.\u2019\u201d\n\nPacker\u2019s first wife, Jodhi Meares, also weighs in, calling the relationship \u201cunusual.\u201d She continues, \u201cBut then I thought these are two people who have had some extraordinary experiences and that is how they connect. That is how it made sense. She is Mariah Carey. I was like, \u2018wow.\u2019 She is extraordinarily creative, she is an incredible singer, I grew up with her [music], we are both the same age. She might be the biggest star I have ever met. She was lovely to me.\u201d\n\nPacker is also quoted in the book, praising Carey\u2019s talent and describing her concerts as \u201cfantastic.\u201d As the relationship continued, both Carey and Packer faced personal struggles, and in the end, one of Packer\u2019s friends, businessman Kerry Stokes, insisted on stalling the wedding.\n\n\u201cI did postpone his wedding,\u201d Stokes says. \u201cWe did have some issues at the time because Mariah\u2019s agent was most insistent that they would not be separated and the wedding take place . . . James was upset at not seeing [Mariah]. But he wasn\u2019t sure. He was obviously engaged to her. He was obviously emotionally involved. The fact that it was postponed, he was happy to get the chance to get himself into a better place.\u201d\n\nBy the time Carey\u2019s E! reality show, Mariah\u2019s World, was set to air, Packer reportedly became uncomfortable with the mounting publicity and the framing of himself as the rich boyfriend.\n\n\u201cDespite his dalliance with Carey, Packer wanted to be viewed as a serious global businessman,\u201d Kitney writes. \u201cBut the friend stresses that Packer never asked to be edited out of the series, as has been suggested. His lawyer, Guy Jalland, apparently asked for Carey\u2019s people to show him the signed consent forms from Packer allowing his image to be used in the series. They never materialized.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the couple broke off their engagement while yachting in Naples in 2016. The following year, Packer provided a rare comment about the relationship, saying, \u201cI was at a low point in my personal life . . . She was kind, exciting, and fun. Mariah is a woman of substance. She is very bright. But it was a mistake for her and a mistake for me.\u201d\n\nMore Great Stories from Vanity Fair\n\n\u2014 We talked to Prince Charles about climate change and [becoming king] (https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/11/prince-charles-becoming-king-camilla-british-monarchy?mbid=inline)\n\n\u2014 Analyzing Michelle Obama\u2019s next move\n\n\u2014 The true story behind the soup cans that redefined Pop art\n\n\u2014 James Wolcott on the return of the #MeToo\u2019d men\n\n\u2014 Here\u2019s everything Meghan Markle wore on her South Pacific tour\n\nLooking for more?
