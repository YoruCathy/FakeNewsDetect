Naturally, the conversation turned to President Trump \u2014 whom Baldwin hopes doesn't get to serve a second term.\n\nBaldwin \u2014 whose portrayal of Trump on Saturday Night Live has drawn Twitter criticism from the president himself but has earned the actor an Emmy \u2014 told Stern, \"I can only think of a couple people who I think could beat Trump.\" When Stern suggested that Baldwin should run for the Oval Office in 2020, the actor confidently replied, \"If I ran, I would win. I would absolutely win. I 1,000 percent would win.\"\n\nHowever, Baldwin said an official bid is highly unlikely because of his hosting duties on ABC's Match Game revival. Plus, his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, \"would kill\" him. \"I've got to do Match Game! The presidency of the United States or Match Game?\" he jokingly asked Stern. \"You tell me.\"\n\nBaldwin then slipped into his caricature of Trump and revealed his plans to take the summer off should he ever be elected. \"I'm gonna take the summer off and be like, 'Listen everybody, I'm going to East Hampton to relax. Howard and I have to go to Nick & Toni's,'\" he said, garnering laughter from Stern.\n\nWhen Stern brought up the idea of Baldwin running for president as Trump, the 30 Rock alum doubled down on his prior statement: \"If I ran for president, I would win! Hands down, I would win. It would be the funniest, most exciting, most crazy campaign.\"\n\n\"You're the hope of the Democratic Party,\" Stern said, to which Baldwin quickly replied, \"I'm not.\"\n\nHe elaborated: \"The only reason I say that is because I'd love to run for that position to just have things be very common sense. There's so many things that this country needs to do that are so obvious.\"\n\nDuring his chat with Stern, Baldwin emphasized that he'd like to \"see a healthy\" Republican Party. \"I don\u2019t want [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi to run everything either,\" Baldwin said of the California Democrat. \"I want the Democrats to have a smart opposition to keep them on their toes.\"\n\n\"I\u2019d like to see the Republican Party get back to [John McCain or Mitt Romney],\" he explained to Stern. \"I\u2019d like to think that this thing with Trump is a one-off.\"\n\nStill, Baldwin believes Trump's election has had a negative impact on the way Americans view potential candidates. \"We buy the presidency now \u2014 we vote for the president \u2014 like we buy gum or laundry soap,\" he said. \"It\u2019s all jingoism and all this marketing.\"\n\nBaldwin also offered a \"theory\" about Trump's history-making summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \"You can almost see Trump's people saying to Kim Jong Un\u2019s people, \u2018We don\u2019t really care if you get rid of the nukes. Let\u2019s just say you are,'\" Baldwin said, slipping into his impression of Trump again. \"'It\u2019s politics. Let me go home and say what I need to say to get reelected.'\"\n\nBaldwin has hinted that he might be done playing Trump on SNL. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said of the gig, \"Every time I do it now, it's like agony. Agony.\"\n\nWatch part of Baldwin's interview with Stern above.", "images": ["https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real", "Evan.Real Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-trump-winning-presidential-election-1119319", "title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \"I Would Win\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Alec Baldwin is confident he could beat Donald Trump if he were to run against the president in 2020.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-trump-winning-presidential-election-1119319", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \"I Would Win\"", "description": "The actor is confident that he could beat Trump if he were to place a 2020 bid for the real Oval Office.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \"I Would Win\"", "description": "The actor is confident that he could beat Trump if he were to place a 2020 bid for the real Oval Office.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alec-baldwin-trump-winning-presidential-election-1119319", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "type": "image/png"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \"I Would Win\"", "sailthru.description": "The actor is confident that he could beat Trump if he were to place a 2020 bid for the real Oval Office.", "sailthru.author": "Evan Real", "sailthru.vertical": "Politics", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-12 07:46:18", "sailthru.tags": "Politics,Alec Baldwin,Donald Trump,Howard Stern"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528760778.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
