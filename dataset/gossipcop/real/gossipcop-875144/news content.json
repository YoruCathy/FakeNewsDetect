This process has only strengthened our belief that true love does exist!\u201d continues the statement.\n\nImage zoom Larry Remiker\n\nThe couple wed last August and often battled on the show over DeGroot\u2019s hesitation to consummate their marriage. Though they chose to stay married on the season finale of Lifetime\u2019s hit show (produced by Kinetic Content), DeGroot revealed on the show\u2019s reunion episode that she still hadn\u2019t fallen for her husband.\n\n\u201cI still just don\u2019t feel in love, I think, so it\u2019s very hard for me to totally embrace it,\u201d said the dietitian about their lack of intimacy even after cameras stopped rolling.\n\nOn Tuesday, DeGroot opened up to fans on her Instagram page about their split. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an easy year, but it has been one of a lot of personal growth and of meeting some amazing people, including the one I got to marry,\u201d she wrote in a caption. \u201cWe value and respect marriage, but life is short and we also value happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile this was a difficult decision and divorce is not something either of us hoped for, we decided we will be happiest separating. Still got nothin\u2019 but love for you @codyknapek,\u201d she continued.\n\nThe two other couples from the pair\u2019s season \u2014 Anthony D\u2019Amico and Ashley Petta, and Sheila Downs and Nate Duhon \u2014 are still going strong.\n\nWhile none of the couples from the second and third season of the show worked out, fan favorites Courtney Hendrix-Carrion and Jason Carrion from the show\u2019s inaugural season are still happily wed.\n\nAnd most notably, Jamie Otis and her husband Doug Hehner, who also met and fell in love on the show\u2019s first season, welcomed their first child together Tuesday morning.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1475&h=772&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-danielle-cody-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-danielle-cody-2000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1475&h=772&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-danielle-cody-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/married-at-first-sight-cody-knapek-danielle-degroot-divorce/", "title": "Married at First Sight's Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot to Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Exclusive,Married at First Sight,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,Married at First Sight,News,TV", "description": "The couple are divorcing after one year of marriage, they tell PEOPLE exclusively in a statement", "og": {"title": "Married at First Sight's Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot to Divorce", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/married-at-first-sight-cody-knapek-danielle-degroot-divorce/", "description": "Married at First Sight\u2018s Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot are calling it quits on their marriage. \u201cAfter a year of marriage, and much thought and&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1475&h=772&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-danielle-cody-2000.jpg", "width": 1475, "height": 772}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/married-at-first-sight-cody-knapek-danielle-degroot-divorce/", "description": "The couple are divorcing after one year of marriage, they tell PEOPLE exclusively in a statement", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-danielle-cody-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/married-at-first-sight-cody-knapek-danielle-degroot-divorce/", "title": "Married at First Sight's Cody Knapek and Danielle DeGroot to Divorce", "description": "The couple are divorcing after one year of marriage, they tell PEOPLE exclusively in a statement", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1475&h=772&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F05%2Fmafs-danielle-cody-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
