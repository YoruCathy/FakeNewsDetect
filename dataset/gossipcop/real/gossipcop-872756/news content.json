The disagreement was between the 27-year-old singer and a 55-year-old former radio DJ called David Mueller, whom Swift says groped her at a concert in 2013; he lost his job as a result of the allegation, which he denied throughout the trial.\n\nOn Monday, August 14, the trial\u2019s eight-person jury unanimously found Mueller guilty of assault and battery. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the lawsuit and how Swift\u2019s case was won.\n\nWhen did the incident happen?\n\nOn June 2, 2013, when Swift was 23, she was carrying out a meet-and-greet with fans at her show in Denver, Colorado. Mueller, then 51, was a radio show host on Colorado station KYGO, and he posed with Swift for a photo alongside his then-girlfriend, Shannon Melcher. Swift says that as the three of them posed for a photo, Mueller reached under her dress and \u201clatched on\u201d to her \u201cass cheek\u201d. She told her security team, who removed Mueller from the gig. She also told her mother and her management, who passed the photo on to the radio station employing Mueller. They did not inform the police.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMueller was fired two days later, on June 4, 2013. The photo has since been leaked to TMZ.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nMueller sued Swift, her mother, and her radio liaison Frank Bell in September 2015, claiming the accusations were false, and that they had wrongfully resulted in him losing his job. He claimed that a colleague, Eddie Haskell, was the one who had touched Swift\u2019s bottom.\n\nSwift countersued Mueller in October 2015 for assault and battery. Her countersuit read: \u201cMueller\u2019s newfound claim that he is the \u2018wrong guy\u2019 and, therefore, his termination from KYGO was unjustified, is specious. Ms Swift knows exactly who committed the assault, it was Mueller \u2013 and she is not confused in the slightest about whether her long-term business acquaintance, Mr. Haskell, was the culprit.\u201d\n\nIn August 2016 Mueller tried to have Swift\u2019s counter-suit thrown out of court. He failed, and in October 2016 Swift provided a pre-trial deposition, saying: \u201cRight as the moment came for us to pose for the photo, he took his hand and put it up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek and no matter how much I scooted over it was still there. It was completely intentional, I\u2019ve never been so sure of anything in my life.\u201d\n\nWhat did the lawyers say as the trial began?\n\nThe Denver Post\u2018s Danika Worthington reported from the trial room that the jury consisted of eight people ranging from their 30s to \u201celderly women\u201d. Six were women, two were men.\n\nMueller\u2019s lawyer told the jury that sexual assault and falsely accusing someone of sexual assault are both \u201cnot tolerable\u201d. He said the case was to determine if Mueller had touched Swift\u2019s bottom and whether he was fired because of what Swift\u2019s team told KYGO. He attacked Swift\u2019s accounts and said someone else had committed the assault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwift\u2019s lawyer said the case was about \u201cwhether a woman can safely tell her employer that she was sexually assaulted\u201d, adding that Mueller had changed his story a total of seven times, had lost evidence, and was motivated by \u201cmoney, attention and revenge.\u201d\n\nWhat were Swift and Mueller seeking in the trial?\n\nMueller was seeking $3m in damages after losing his $150,000 salary. His case was against Taylor Swift, Andrea Swift and Frank Bell.\n\nIn her countersuit, Swift was seeking just $1 (77p), using the trial \u201can example to other women who may resist publicly reliving similar outrageous and humiliating acts.\u201d Newsweek reported that Swift was planning to donate \u201cany financial reward from the trial to charities supporting survivors of sexual assault and gender-based violence.\u201d\n\nWhat testimonies were made?\n\nOn August 8, David Mueller testified, saying his meeting with Swift was \u201cweird and awkward.\u201d He said: \u201cI know my hand was touching her rib or her skirt and it went behind her. And her hand \u2013 or arm \u2013 went behind my arm.\u201d When asked if he had grabbed Swift\u2019s bottom he said: \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d He ended his testimony saying: \u201cI\u2019m here to prove that I\u2019m innocent. I had a good reputation in radio and I would like to get it back.\u201d\n\ntestified, saying his meeting with Swift was \u201cweird and awkward.\u201d He said: \u201cI know my hand was touching her rib or her skirt and it went behind her.

I had a good reputation in radio and I would like to get it back.\u201d On August 9, Taylor Swift\u2019s mother Andrea Swift testified, saying \u201cI went to the dressing room and I saw her face. I could see that there was something horribly wrong. She said: \u2018Mom, a guy just grabbed my ass.\u2019 I wanted to vomit and cry at the same time\u2026 she was really shaken. She was humiliated.\u201d She added: \u201cHe sexually assaulted my daughter,\u201d pointing at Mueller and saying: \u201cRight there, that guy.\u201d\n\ntestified, saying \u201cI went to the dressing room and I saw her face.

I don\u2019t know him.\u201d\n\nThe meet-and-greet photographer Stephanie Simbeck also testified on Thursday, saying \u201cI saw her [Swift] fall into the female [Shannon Melcher], and she had a shocked look, and I saw his [Mueller\u2019s] hand grab her ass.\u201d Simbeck said she didn\u2019t know whether Mueller\u2019s hand was inside or outside Swift\u2019s skirt, but said that she could see Mueller inappropriately grabbing Swift from her position about five feet away.\n\nalso testified on Thursday, saying \u201cI saw her [Swift] fall into the female [Shannon Melcher], and she had a shocked look, and I saw his [Mueller\u2019s] hand grab her ass.\u201d Simbeck said she didn\u2019t know whether Mueller\u2019s hand was inside or outside Swift\u2019s skirt, but said that she could see Mueller inappropriately grabbing Swift from her position about five feet away.

My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organisations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-527338044.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-527338044-696x442.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-527338044.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Larry Bartleet"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/taylor-swift-groping-trial-background-lawsuit-2122259", "title": "Taylor Swift groping trial: everything you need to know about the case", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Taylor Swift and David Mueller are going through a civil trial with a jury to settle a long-running case about groping that began in 2013", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift groping trial: everything you need to know about the case", "description": "Taylor Swift and David Mueller are going through a civil trial with a jury to settle a long-running case about groping that began in 2013", "url": "https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/taylor-swift-groping-trial-background-lawsuit-2122259", "site_name": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-527338044.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-527338044.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "section": "NME Blogs", "published_time": "2017-08-15T11:00:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Taylor Swift and David Mueller are going through a civil trial with a jury to settle a long-running case about groping that began in 2013", "title": "Taylor Swift groping trial: everything you need to know about the case", "site": "@nme", "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-527338044.jpg", "creator": "@nme"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502794813.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
