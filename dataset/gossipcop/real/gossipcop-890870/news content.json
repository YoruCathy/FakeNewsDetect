Clarkson\u2019s been the real deal and telling it like it is for years now, but her recent interview with Howard Stern was probably her most revealing and entertaining.\n\n7 Really Interesting Things We Learned About Kelly Clarkson During Her Howard Stern Interview:\n\n1/2. \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d Was Much Different During 2002\n\nClarkson was the fourth person in line during the Texas auditions of the first season of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d and unlike most contestants, she knew who Randy Jackson was because she studied Mariah Carey\u2019s album liner notes growing up. Of course, she knew who Paula Abdul was, but Simon Cowell \u201cwas just a dude with an accent.\u201d\n\nDuring the early days of the show Clarkson revealed that they didn\u2019t even sing in front of a live audience until the Top 5 round\u2013 there was just a red light, \u201cWe were ghetto \u2018Idol\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n3. Clarkson Did Date Runner-Up Justin Guarini\n\n\n\nClarkson revealed that the two were really good friends and all of the rumors kind of helped them decide to date, but ultimately, \u201copposites don\u2019t attract.\u201d\n\n4. People Were Really Mean to Clarkson and Guarini\n\nOne of the reasons Clarkson and Guarini ended up being so close was because,\u201dI don\u2019t think people realized how mean people were to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were mean\u2026people were just pissed because they didn\u2019t know our stories, they just thought it was so easy and we just appeared overnight,\u201d she shared.\n\n5. Clarkson Has Only Watched \u201cFrom Justin to Kelly\u201d Once\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it, one, it wasn\u2019t a good movie and two, I never wanted to be an actress\u2026 I literally was in my apartment in Texas, in my closet crying to Simon Fuller because I didn\u2019t want to do that movie,\u201d Clarkson shared.\n\nShe also said she\u2019s not a good actress and they shot the entire thing in 28 days and she was terrified it would ruin her career before it even started.\n\n6. Clarkson Got Really Drunk at the Premiere of \u201cFrom Justin to Kelly\u201d\n\n\u201cI got very drunk at that premiere, I literally ended up in a fountain soaked and I\u2019ve only seen it once.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Avril Lavigne Elbowed Clarkson in the Face at the MTV VMAs Once\n\nStern, not Clarkson recalled an incident that happened right after she won \u201cIdol,\u201d asking her, \u201cWas it Avril Lavigne who elbowed you in the face?\u201d\n\nIt sure was she said, \u201cIt was her. But I will say this: Years later I saw her and she said, \u2018Oh my gosh, people keep saying I elbowed you in the face and I\u2019m so sorry!\u2019 And I don\u2019t know\u2026 she did it\u2026 but I don\u2019t know if she felt bad about it, or she didn\u2019t mean to do it, or what\u2026 but it felt purposeful! I think what I was bummed about is I\u2019m a fan of hers. I loved her music.\u201d\n\nLavigne was also one of the writers of Clarkson\u2019s hit \u201cBreakaway.\u201d", "images": ["https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2615691521997&noscript=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6df4dcfc871fd971dcd71a48c17d3c1f?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/origin-8181.jpg", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/oc-logo-white.png", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/one-country-logo-horizontal-1.png", "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/one-country-logo-horizontal.png"], "top_img": "https://www.onecountry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/origin-8181.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Cowling"], "canonical_link": "https://www.onecountry.com/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-howard-stern/", "title": "7 Really Interesting Things We Learned About Kelly Clarkson During Her Howard Stern Interview -", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "7 Really Interesting Things We Learned About Kelly Clarkson During Her Howard Stern Interview -", "description": "Maybe Kelly Clarkson really has figured out the meaning of life, like it\u2019s not just the name of her new album.
