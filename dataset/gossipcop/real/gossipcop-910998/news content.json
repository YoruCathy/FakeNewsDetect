Check out Gal Gadot's two-toned selection. The Wonder Woman star perfectly paired a bright pink suit with a red sweetheart top for a fun and flirty look, proving that the two shades belong together when done in a tasteful way.

Take a note of Margot Robbie's flowy dress that mixed a soft pale pink flower print with a touch of ruffles. The sweet look is just what you need for a seaside brunch, wine tasting or a picnic.\n\nPhillip Faraone/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, for those non-single ladies, let the world know you're taken like Paris Hilton did with her red heart-shaped Sara Battaglia bag. Donning a white dress on your Valentine's Day outing is a great blank canvas to either dress up or down.\n\nPair the ivory tone with pink or red heels and a matching statement accessory. The options are endless!\n\nMichael Tran/FilmMagic\n\nBusy working all day, but still want to show your V-Day spirit? A fitted and stylish colorful suit like Aubrey Plaza's is always great for the boardroom, lunch meeting or presentation.\n\nWhatever work environment you're in, change up the shoes for sleek sneakers, kitten heels or even wedges. Keep the rest of the look to a minimum.\n\nRobin Marchant/Getty Images\n\nReady to celebrate Galentines? Victoria's Secret Angels Romee Strijd and Josephine Skriver have fitting looks for day or night!\n\nStrijd's white dress with red heart prints can be played up with sexy heels and a peek-a-boo red bra or dressed down with sandals or even white sneakers. Meanwhile, Skriver's curve-hugging mini dress can take you from dinner to a night out on the dance floor with your besties.\n\nJB Lacroix/ Getty Images\n\nFor moms who will be stepping out for the night, look to Victoria Beckham. The mother of four is an expert at flawlessly rocking a comfortable and chic outfit wherever she goes. Done are the days of body-hugging and now loose-fitting and classic dresses are in!\n\nPair a maxi, wrap or midi dress with a nice sandal or heel and don't be afraid to let your face show with a messy updo and smoky makeup.\n\nCarlos Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nAnd lastly, dare to be bold like Zendaya by going for a major statement. A strapless silk jumpsuit in your choice of color gives you the courage to take things to a fearless level!\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Glamour\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nPHOTOS: White Hot Styles All-Year Round\n\nAngelina Jolie Is a Fashion Queen in Paris -- See Her Ultra-Chic Look!\n\nPHOTOS: Best Dressed Celebs: February 2018\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-02/aubrey_plaza_gettyimages-908093574.jpg?itok=BVDPXIF0", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-02/romee_strijd_josephine_skriver_gettyimages-915014580.jpg?itok=YofSjRke", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=fFDt7b4K", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2017-11/zendaya_getty873807496.jpg?itok=cg_dVQbr", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-02/paris_hilton_gettyimages-914716286.jpg?itok=b_lHpz7V", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=6OQEjiRL", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-01/gal_gadot_getty900910156.jpg?itok=nJY4PieD", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2019-02/1280lilly.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=mEP-Ghzt", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-02/margot_robbie_gettyimages-913776532.jpg?itok=e49Je41M", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-01/chrissy_teigen_GettyImages-912355068.jpg?itok=VThAIpCR", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/970xh/public/images/2018-02/victoria_beckham_gettyimages-906706530.jpg?itok=jcn9rtzc"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=fFDt7b4K", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadots-pink-suit-margot-robbies-floral-dress-more-celebrity-inspired-valentine-days-outfits", "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadots-pink-suit-margot-robbies-floral-dress-more-celebrity-inspired-valentine-days-outfits", "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits", "description": "Look to these stylish celebs for your red, white and pink V-Day looks!", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=fFDt7b4K", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Look to these stylish celebs for your red, white and pink V-Day looks!", "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Liz Calvario\u200d \u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadots-pink-suit-margot-robbies-floral-dress-more-celebrity-inspired-valentine-days-outfits", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=fFDt7b4K"}, "description": "Look to these stylish celebs for your red, white and pink V-Day looks!", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "Fashion, News, Gal Gadot, Chrissy Teigen, Celine Dion", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
