It also appeared to spark snickers from some of the players, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel and others in the crowd at Los Angeles' Staples Center.\n\nNumerous viewers hit Twitter to share their opinions, with a few calling it the \"worst rendition ever\" (though one argued that Roseanne Barr's intentionally bad performance at a 1990 San Diego Padres baseball game was worse).\n\nSee some of the reactions below.\n\nOmg. Omg. Omg. Neither Joel Embiid, Draymond Green nor Jimmy Kimmel were enjoying one bit of Fergie's rendition of the National Anthem. I am screaming. #NBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/FuhKVMIoNX \u2014 Chovan (@thechovanone) February 19, 2018\n\nDon't let Fergie's National Anthem performance distract you from the fact that the Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals despite having the first ever unanimous MVP and going 73-9 in the regular season. \u2014 CAVS (@jackie_kisley) February 19, 2018\n\nMy ear after listening to Fergie \"sing\" that pic.twitter.com/w4pgp1PU6W \u2014 Roff-A (@MJK_NY31) February 19, 2018\n\nLiterally dying at these reactions.
