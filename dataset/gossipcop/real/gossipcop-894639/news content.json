stage too.\n\nBehati Prinsloo will be making her VS return after a three-year absence and will be joined by Adriana Lima, Stella Maxwell, Elsa Hosk, Romee Strijd and many more.\n\nAs for the millennial models of the moment, Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner? All three will once again reunite on the runway.\n\nWho will wear the Fantasy Bra?\n\nVictoria's Secret revealed 2018's Fantasy Bra will be worn by 29-year-old Elsa Hosk, who made her Victoria's Secret debut in 2011.\n\nThe Swedish model will wear the 'Dream Angels Fantasy Bra' down the New York runway, which is made up of 100 per cent Swarovski diamonds and topaz.\n\nThe sparkly creation took over 930 hours to make, racks up 71 carats and is valued at $1 million.\n\nWhat is the Victoria's Secret designer collaboration this year?\n\nThe designer collaborations cause a lot of buzz. None more so than last year when the lingerie heavyweights joined forces with Balmain.\n\nIn contrast to the punky Balmain aesthetic, filled with studs and rhinestones, VS's 2018 collection with Mary Katrantzou is set to be a lot more feminine.\n\nGet ready to see lots of vibrant floral prints by the British designer brighten up the catwalk.\n\nWho will perform at the fashion show?\n\nThe musical performances are a huge part of the show and in recent years everyone from Rihanna to Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift to Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga have belted out their hits.\n\nLast year, Harry Styles did his thing, dressed in his signature statement suits. And who can forget the year before that, when newly separated Bella Hadid and The Weeknd had an awkward encounter on the catwalk?\n\nWho will provide the soundtrack to 2018's show? Not one, not two, but seven performers.\n\nVictoria's Secret confirmed that taking Harry Styles' heart-throb position would be Shawn Mendes, who will be joined by Rita Ora, The Chainsmokers, Halsey, Bebe Rexha, Kelsea Ballerini and The Struts.\n\nWhen will the VS show take place?\n\nVictoria's Secret Fashion Show 2017 - the runway 53 show all Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2017 - the runway 1/53
