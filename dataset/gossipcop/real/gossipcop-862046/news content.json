DEAD.\u201d\n\nFor those of you who can\u2019t figure it out based on context clues, \u201cLove And Hip Hop\u201d is a reality television franchise that documents the lives of rap, R&B, and hip-hop producers, the great majority of whom are black. In other words, because Rachel Lindsay is black, she belongs (according to Block\u2019s roommate) on \u201cLove and Hip Hop.\u201d\n\nA hilarious joke, truly one for the ages.\n\nLindsay, who is not to be messed with under any circumstance, quickly tweeted a response to Block\u2019s now deleted tweet.\n\nLet me know if she wants to meet Lee\u2026they sound like they would have a lot in common #ihavetimetoday https://t.co/CgEzZLxAWJ\u2014 Rachel Lindsay (@TheRachLindsay) June 20, 2017\n\nLindsay is referring to Lee Garrett, a contestant on her own season who made headlines for his extremely offensive Twitter account, replete with racially charged tweets of his own.\n\nBlock, acutely aware that she was out of her depth, issued a long apology on her Facebook page, vowing to be try harder in the future.\n\n\u201cI come forward honestly and openly, to extend my sincere apology for the tweet from my account on Monday, June 19th regarding the current season of The Bachelorette,\u201d wrote Block.\n\n\u201cOur Society should have no place for hate that targets any minority group. We can\u2019t make the future better until we make ourselves better. And I\u2019m starting now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nice to know that we live in an era where people are called out when they cross lines. This will hopefully serve as a lesson to Block \u2014 educate yourself or stop tweeting.\n\nBecky Scott is the editor of The Schmooze.
