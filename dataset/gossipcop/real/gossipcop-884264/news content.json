Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, Nicky Jam and Chayanne traveled to the US territory on Monday, October 2, on board a Jet Blue flight as part of a special program set up by the Despacito singer that will transport goods to the victims living on the island.\n\nLuis took to Instagram to share a photo of himself on the jetliner, which was named \"100x35 JetBlue\" after the island\u2019s measurements. Attached to a group picture of himself with his fellow musicians, the 39-year-old wrote, \"United more than ever by Puerto Rico.

Also on board the flight were basketball stars Ray Allen and Carlos Arroyo, in addition to TV personality Rashel Diaz and former Yankees star Jorge Posada. Cuban music legends Gloria and Emilo Estefan also took the flight and shared a special video with fans while en route.\n\nMORE: Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony and Pitbull form all-star alliance to aid Puerto Rico\n\n\u201cHello my beautiful people from Puerto Rico,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cWe are going to be with you to give you a hug person by person.\u201d Monday\u2019s stop is the first in a series of continuous weekly trips the jetliner will make to and from Puerto Rico, delivering essential needs, including food and medicine, to aid those who are reeling from the aftermath of the hurricane.\n\n\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf0e\u2764\ufe0f #JuntosPa\u2019lante #SoaringForwardTogether #Unidos #puertorico\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf7 @jetblue #100por35jetblue #100for35jetblue A post shared by Gloria Estefan (@gloriaestefan) on Oct 2, 2017 at 3:52am PDT\n\nDiscussing his relief operation with #Legend magazine Luis admitted, \"This hits home for me and I\u2019m trying my best to use all the connections and resources we have to try and help as best we can. When I say 'we,' I mean all the artists from Puerto Rico and beyond who have resources and influence that can help the island and those living there.\"\n\nThe Puerto Rican singer also opened up about the strength of his hometown and the importance of rebuilding. He said, \"On one hand, it\u2019s hard to see this and know what my friends and family are going through right now. On the other hand, it\u2019s so inspiring to see how everyone is joining hands to figure this out and how they can play a part in the recovery efforts.\u201d\n\nVIEW GALLERY Celebrities joined the Despacito singer on board the flight to Puerto Rico Photo: Instagram/@carroyopr\n\nMORE: Beyonc\u00e9 joins J Balvin for the Mi Gente remix - donates proceeds to Puerto Rico\n\nLuis continued, \u201cIt is even more true watching people who aren\u2019t necessarily from the island send supplies and planes and money. It\u2019s great. I know this will take a long time to fully recover, but it\u2019s going to make us stronger, even though it\u2019s a painful process. I know that Puerto Rico will bounce back. I have no doubt about that.\u201d", "images": ["https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/0-14-387/pr-flight-m.jpg?filter=w400", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-nicky-jam-fly-to-puerto-rico/0-14-389/group-pr-z.jpg", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019061224664/luis-fonsi-tour-latin-music-hola-usa-interview/0-182-354/luis-fonsi-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019110429774/latin-grammy-winners-before-after/0-215-196/christina-aguilera-j-blavin-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/0-14-387/pr-flight-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035866&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=XbAUn1QolK10cv", "https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hola/comunes/holacom.gif", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019111830134/justin-bieber-luis-fonsi-despacito-collaboration/0-217-33/luis-fonsi-justin-bieber-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019101129009/luis-fonsi-la-voz-the-voice-season-two-guest-judges/0-211-18/luis-fonsi-la-voz-the-voice-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-nicky-jam-fly-to-puerto-rico/0-14-388/fonsi-pr-z.jpg"], "top_img": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/0-14-387/pr-flight-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/", "title": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, more stars travel to Puerto Rico to personally deliver relief", "meta_data": {"title": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, more stars travel to Puerto Rico to personally deliver relief", "description": "Some of the biggest names in Latin entertainment took a special flight to Puerto Rico to deliver aid.", "keywords": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, Nicky Jam, Chayanne, Celebrities, Jet Blue, Celebrity Hurricane Relief, Celebrities React to Natural Disasters, Despacito, Living La Vida Loca, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma", "dc.title": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, more stars travel to Puerto Rico to personally deliver relief", "classification": "famosos,noticias-famosos,hola", "language": "en-US", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=3, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, Nicky Jam, Chayanne, Celebrities, Jet Blue, Celebrity Hurricane Relief, Celebrities React to Natural Disasters, Despacito, Living La Vida Loca, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Irma", "og": {"title": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, more stars travel to Puerto Rico to personally deliver relief", "description": "Some of the biggest names in Latin entertainment took a special flight to Puerto Rico to deliver aid.", "image": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/0-14-387/pr-flight-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "updated_time": "2017-10-02T14:37:31Z", "url": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/", "type": "article", "site_name": "HOLA USA"}, "fb": {"admins": 288444131299841}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-02T14:37:31Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-02T14:37:31Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@usahola", "creator": "@usahola", "url": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/", "title": "Luis Fonsi, Ricky Martin, more stars travel to Puerto Rico to personally deliver relief", "description": "Some of the biggest names in Latin entertainment took a special flight to Puerto Rico to deliver aid..", "image": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2017100210534/luis-fonsi-ricky-martin-travel-aid-puerto-rico/0-14-387/pr-flight-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f"}, "hmn": "true"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506955051.0, "source": "https://us.hola.com", "summary": ""}
