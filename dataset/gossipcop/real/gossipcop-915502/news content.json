The Kendra on Top star, 32, admitted on Instagram that she and the former NFL player, 35, are facing more marital issues, but also denied a recent report that claimed the couple are \u201cfaking it for TV.\u201d\n\n\u201c1. how do u fake marital problems? makes absolutely no sense,\u201d Wilkinson wrote on Wednesday, February 21. \u201c2. Yes we are having issues 3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what i wanted but was a part of my journey and story.\u201d\n\nThe Girls Next Door alum said that \u201ceveryone knows about\u201d her issues with Baskett, \u201cincluding producers and network, friends and family.\u201d She continued, \u201cMy job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions cuz the last thing i want to do is hurt Hank.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Wilkinson said she hopes \u201cto get back to the fun Kendra you all know,\u201d adding, \u201cThank you all for your support and understanding me at this time. I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy lately n hope all gets resolved for me, Hank,kids and even for TV. Lol.\u201d\n\nThe reality star and the former athlete \u2014 who marred in 2009 and are the parents of son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah, 3 \u2014 are no strangers to scandal. In 2014, he allegedly cheated on his then-pregnant wife with a transgender model. \u201c[Wilkinson] was extremely angry,\u201d a source told Us Weekly exclusively at the time, adding that the former Playboy model flushed her wedding ring down the toilet in a rage.\n\nBaskett later revealed on Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars that he met the trans woman while trying to buy marijuana. He claimed the model was naked and began fondling him through his basketball shorts, but he did not engage. \u201cI wanted to get out but I couldn\u2019t move,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThis person came to me and touched me.\u201d\n\nDespite the drama, Wilkinson and Baskett ultimately decided to stay together. She wrote on Instagram in March 2017, \u201cEven with a little bump in the road, nothing or nobody can be greater or make me feel more successful than @hank_baskett. Imperfection is where great change and growth happens with us.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hank-baskett-kendra-wilkinson.jpg?w=256", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hank-baskett-kendra-wilkinson.jpg?crop=114px%2C0px%2C1564px%2C821px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hank-baskett-kendra-wilkinson.jpg?crop=114px%2C0px%2C1564px%2C821px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kendra-wilkinson-admits-to-marital-problems-with-hank-baskett/", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Admits to \u2018Marital Problems\u2019 With Hank Baskett", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kendra Wilkinson admitted on Instagram on Wednesday, February 21, that she and husband Hank Baskett are having more \u2018marital problems\u2019 \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson: Hank Baskett and I Are Having \u2018Marital Problems\u2019", "description": "Kendra Wilkinson admitted on Instagram on Wednesday, February 21, that she and husband Hank Baskett are having more \u2018marital problems\u2019 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kendra-wilkinson-admits-to-marital-problems-with-hank-baskett/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-22T16:03:22+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hank-baskett-kendra-wilkinson.jpg?crop=114px%2C0px%2C1564px%2C821px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hank-baskett-kendra-wilkinson.jpg?crop=114px%2C0px%2C1564px%2C821px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-22T14:37:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-22T16:03:22+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kendra Wilkinson admitted on Instagram on Wednesday, February 21, that she and husband Hank Baskett are having more \u2018marital problems\u2019 \u2014 read more", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson: Hank Baskett and I Are Having \u2018Marital Problems\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/hank-baskett-kendra-wilkinson.jpg?crop=114px%2C0px%2C1564px%2C821px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519310233.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
