On Monday, the 29-year-old pro wrestler was named as one of the new cast members of \u201cTotal Divas,\u201d joining the Bella Twins, Natalya, Naomi, Lana and Maryse on the hit E! reality series. (Nia Jax and Alexa Bliss are also joining the show for Season 7.)\n\nTheWrap talked with Carmella \u2014 who was a dancer for the New England Patriots and L.A. Lakers before signing with WWE \u2014 to talk about her new reality TV gig, the \u201cwomen\u2019s revolution\u201d currently happening in the WWE, and what it means to be a role model for female fans.\n\nAlso Read: WWE Reveals New Cast of 'Total Divas,' Sets Premiere Date for 'Total Bellas' Season 2 (Video)\n\n\u201cI am really excited, I can\u2019t wait for the show to come out,\u201d Carmella, whose real name is Leah Van Dale, told TheWrap. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be a part of \u2018Total Divas\u2019 and show the world who Carmella is, not only on \u2018SmackDown Live\u2019 but in real life.\u201d\n\nTheWrap: Has joining the cast of \u201cTotal Divas\u201d become a benchmark that WWE Divas now aspire to?\n\nCarmella: I am not sure it is something we aim for, but I am honored to be a part of it and show the world who Carmella is, not only on \u201cSmackDown Live\u201d but in real life.\n\nThis is a super exciting time for the women in the WWE, so I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see the progress that the women have been making over the last few years. This year, there were two women\u2019s matches on the card WrestleMania \u2014 it has come a long way and I am really excited for the fans to see what\u2019s in store for the women now.\n\nWhy has there been such an explosion for women in the WWE?\n\nI think it was just time \u2014 the women have been working for so long and so hard. The fans helped a lot too as they demanded it, they knew what the women were capable of and started the whole women\u2019s revolution hashtag on Twitter. That gave the Divas a chance. The women took it and ran with it and have been running with it ever since then. They are now on main event pay-per-views. I was in the very first Money in the Bank ladder match for women, and I won it! So it has been a wonderful whirlwind. It is a great time to be a woman in the WWE.\n\nAlso Read: WWE WrestleMania 33: 11 Things You Didn't See on TV\n\nDid you used to watch \u201cTotal Divas\u201d before you were cast on it?\n\nI watched it before I was even signed by the WWE! I\u2019ve been watching since the very first season, so for me to be a part of it now is crazy \u2026 it doesn\u2019t even feel real.\n\nIs it hard having the cameras on you all the time, especially covering your personal life?\n\nIt was different at first, that\u2019s for sure. How am I supposed to act, what am I supposed to do? When you sign up for a reality show, you have to put your personal life out there.\n\nBut I am excited to share my struggle with my relationship. I am dating another WWE Superstar, Big Cass, he is on \u201cRaw\u201d and I am on \u201cSmackDown,\u201d so we get to show the world our struggles as it\u2019s like a long-distance relationship and we only see each other one-and-a-half days a week, sometimes less. I really want to show women that it is OK to have a career and put that \u2014 not necessarily first \u2014 but to put it out there. You can do it all. Is it going to be hard? Yes. Is it going to be worth it? Of course.\n\nAlso Read: WrestleMania 33: NFL Star Rob Gronkowski Jumps Into the Ring With Mojo Rawley in WWE Debut\n\nI don\u2019t think most people know how hard WWE Superstars work, do you think that \u201cTotal Divas\u201d is a good way to show that?\n\nIt is a great outlet for people to see what it takes to be in the WWE, but I don\u2019t think it shows all of it. [The job] isn\u2019t glamorous all the time by any means. There are a lot of perks, but viewers don\u2019t see the late-night flights, the race to the rental car shuttle, the to drive to the hotel to get two hours sleep \u2026 you can only explain that so much.\n\nHave the Bella Twins helped pave the way for Divas and female WWE Superstars?\n\nI love the Bella Twins. The very first story I was involved in when I got called up to \u201cSmackDown\u201d was with Nikki Bella. When she came back at SummerSlam, it was my first pay per view match, I was just so excited and couldn\u2019t believe she was going to be in the match, never mind that I got to do a story with her. She helped me out and I learned a lot from her. She is such a big name, so that definitely helps because all eyes are on these matches.\n\nAlso Read: WWE 'SmackDown Live' Commissioner Shane McMahon Walks Away From Helicopter Crash (Video)\n\nIs it hard to be the bad girl?\n\nNot at all, I love it. It\u2019s so fun because the Carmella you see on \u201cSmackDown Live\u201d is so different to me. It\u2019s great to be able to portray this character in a way that I never would in real life.\n\nWhat was the best piece of advice someone told you before going on a reality show?\n\nThat not everyone is going to like you, so you can\u2019t act a certain way or portray yourself in a way to make them. Just go in and be yourself. Whether you like me, you hate me or you love to hate me \u2026 I don\u2019t really care. I just go and be who I am as that\u2019s all I know how to do.\n\nAlso Read: Stephanie McMahon, Mark Giordano Among Winners at ESPN Sports Humanitarian Awards\n\nAs it\u2019s a really show, is there a lot of drama or conflict?\n\nI really think it is important especially at this time in the women\u2019s revolution to show we\u2019re not here to bring each other down, we\u2019re here to bring each other up. There\u2019s going to be inevitable drama with the travel, sometimes it gets to you and you forget what\u2019s really important and why we\u2019re all here. My role on the show so far from filming is trying to be the peacemaker and remind everyone what we\u2019re doing here \u2014 we are making history, having great matches and moving forward with this women\u2019s revolution. I just want to be champion, I want to make history. I am here, I am doing it and I want to make history.\n\n\u201cTotal Divas\u201d returns to E! in the fall, in the mean time you catch Carmella Tuesdays on \u201cSmackDown Live.\u201d", "images":
