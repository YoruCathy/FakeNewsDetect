{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/bachelorette-men-tell-all-garrett-yrigoyen-instagram-lincoln-adim-conviction", "text": "Next week, Bachelorette fans will finally get to watch all of Rebecca \u201cBecca\u201d Kufrin\u2019s exes\u2014a.k.a. the eliminated contestants\u2014gather together in one room. That is, save for one: Lincoln Adim, who was convicted of indecent assault and battery offscreen as the show aired its pretaped season. Adim will not be present, nor will the season\u2019s finalists\u2014including Garrett Yrigoyen, whose social-media history also caused a furor among fans.\n\nThe \u201cMen Tell All\u201d episode, which tapes later than the competition portion of the series, has traditionally been used as a platform on which the show can discuss controversies like these, which took place offscreen while the series aired. (The special was recorded just this week.) But with Adim and Yrigoyen absent from the group, this one will gloss over both controversies\u2014which, together, have been the center of most of the season\u2019s discussion. Both Kufrin and franchise host and producer Chris Harrison, however, want viewers to keep an open mind\u2014at least, regarding Yrigoyen.\n\n\u201cI want to be very careful about people that put Garrett and Lincoln in the same sentence because they do not belong in the same sentence,\u201d Harrison told The Hollywood Reporter after the episode finished filming. \u201cWhat Garrett did is something that people disagree with. What Lincoln did is illegal. It\u2019s against the law. He committed a crime. He was convicted of that, so that\u2019s very different. . . . That\u2019s not to say that I agree at all with what Garrett did or if he stood for that or what he stood for,\u201d Harrison added, \u201cbut I\u2019m very careful to differentiate those.\u201d\n\nFor those who need a refresher, Yrigoyen emerged as a front-runner as soon as this season premiered, nabbing the coveted First Impression Rose\u2014which is frequently awarded to the show\u2019s eventual winner. Just as the season premiered, however, Yrigoyen\u2019s offscreen life proved troublesome: on a subsequently deleted Instagram account, Yrigoyen had \u201cliked\u201d offensive posts that ran the gamut of transphobia and anti-immigrant sentiments\u2014as well as a post supporting the conspiracy theory that teenaged Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg was a crisis actor.\n\nAdim, meanwhile was convicted in May for indecent assault and battery, after an incident that occurred back in 2016. At the time of his conviction, Warner Bros. Television, which produces The Bachelor and all its offshoots, indicated to V.F. through a statement that no one on the show\u2019s production had any knowledge about Adim\u2019s history, adding that it was investigating how the third-party company it employs to run its background checks missed this. Speaking with T.H.R., Harrison had no concrete information to offer regarding how the shows might alter their vetting process to prevent such oversights in the future.\n\nThe distinction between Yrigoyen and Adim is obvious\u2014but the fact remains that, for different reasons, their separate offscreen controversies have become the two black marks at the center of an otherwise boring, formulaic season. Yrigoyen disavowed his \u201clikes\u201d in an apology, posted to a new Instagram account soon after the firestorm began: \u201cMy Instagram \u2018likes\u2019 were not a true reflection of me and my morals,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am not the negative labels people are associating me with. For those who do know me, I am a sincere, genuine, loving, light-hearted, open-minded and non-judgemental individual.\u201d\n\nAs far as Harrison is concerned, though, social media, in general, is toxic: \u201cIf I could have one wish, I would take Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, all of it, and throw it in the trash,\u201d Harrison told T.H.R. \u201cI think it continues to do more harm than good, especially now. You get a lot of yelling, you get a lot of the lowest 1 percent\u2014the vocal minority, as I call it\u2014and that\u2019s usually who you hear from.\u201d But as we saw last season, social-media activity can have a bearing on how contestants behave on the show. Just look at Lee Garrett\u2014who had his own history of racist social-media posts\u2014and his feud with black contestant Kenny King. (Yrigoyen has not caused any such disruptions during the season so far.)\n\nRegarding how contestants like Yrigoyen can be picked apart on social media, Harrison said, \u201cHere\u2019s the thing\u2014I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s ready for that kind of spotlight. I don\u2019t think that anybody in this day and age is ready for the mob mentality and that\u2019s what it\u2019s become. . . . It is a mob mentality of\u2014you\u2019re guilty, your life is ruined, it\u2019s done, you\u2019re gone. That is the scrutiny that everyone is under.\u201d\n\nKufrin, who has urged viewers to be \u201copen-minded\u201d about Yrigoyen since the news about his Instagram \u201clikes\u201d first broke, stuck to that argument when speaking with T.H.R.: \u201cI want people to stay open to who these guys are,\u201d she said. \u201cI was lucky enough to go on this journey with 28 guys and to really get to know them for who they are\u2014away from social media, away from all the distractions\u2014and so that was something special for me that I got to experience and I just hope that the viewers can be that same way.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b58a53686763009a9857ce3/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/149913_0150.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e2c719bedd20c4002b7a8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-Bachelorette-Dudes.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b0d58d814785d7498401a02/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-garrett.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b58a53686763009a9857ce3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149913_0150.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b57233211d0902df883bd10/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-final-two-garrett-blake.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b58a53686763009a9857ce3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149913_0150.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/bachelorette-men-tell-all-garrett-yrigoyen-instagram-lincoln-adim-conviction", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s \u201cMen Tell All\u201d Episode Will Ignore This Season\u2019s Biggest Problems", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "All of Becca Kufrin\u2019s jilted contestants will be back, save for Lincoln Adim, who was convicted of indecent assault and battery\u2014a detail that won\u2019t be addressed during next week\u2019s episode.
