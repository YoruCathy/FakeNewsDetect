Here\u2019s a side-by-side comparison of all the misconceptions we found.\n\nLily Martis, Monster staff\n\n\u201cIs it just like Grey\u2019s Anatomy?\u201d your non-health friends have probably asked you of your hospital job.\n\nWell, not quite.\n\nABC\u2019s Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2014a medical show filled with above-average looking doctors, forbidden romances, heartbreak, oh yeah, and blood, guts and unauthorized surgeries performed with a clipboard\u2014is back for its 13th season which premiered Thursday, Sept. 22.\n\nWhile, yes, some aspects of hospital life are similar to what\u2019s depicted on the show, most other elements are nothing like it.\n\nMonster spoke with Andrew Holtz, a former CNN medical correspondent and author of The Real Grey\u2019s Anatomy, which gives a behind-the-scenes look at the real lives of surgical residents he shadowed at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). Here\u2019s a side-by-side comparison.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nSurgeons get into really intense, close relationships with patients regularly.\n\nReal life:\n\nResidents and physicians actually spend more time away from the patients in rooms with computers and lab test results, Holtz says. Nurses are the ones who develop the close relationships with patients.\n\n\u201cAn awful lot of what you see on the show is what nurses do in terms of patient care,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cThe surgeons, the residents, the other physicians in the hospital are checking with the patients, they get to know their cases, but they don\u2019t spend anything like the kind of time actually in the room with the patients as the nurses do. Nurses really are the ones who take care of the patients, and the doctors get familiar with their cases and give instructions.\u201d\n\nWhat we\u2019re trying to say is, the Izzie Stevens-Denny Duquette romance would never have happened in real life.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nDoctors discuss their personal lives while working on an unconscious patient.\n\nReal life:\n\nActually, yes.\n\nOK, maybe they aren\u2019t talking about who slept with who, but that conference they attended last week or the concert they saw last night? Yeah, Holtz says it\u2019ll probably come up between incisions.\n\n\u201cSome surgeries last for hours and most of it\u2019s not that intense,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cYou would think it would be, but it\u2019s mostly methodical. They\u2019re very careful and things take time, so they do have time to chat.\u201d\n\nBut the second something changes, all conversation stops.\n\n\u201cI noticed, on a number of occasions, people would be having conversations, and then, all of a sudden, it would go quiet and people would snap to attention because of some uncertainty or some bleeding,\u201d Holtz says.\n\nBut nothing is usually quite to the dramatic extent of Grey\u2019s Anatomy where the patient has to code on the table for the surgeon to come out as a hero and save their life.\n\n\u201cAlmost every surgery goes according to plan and much of it is very routine,\u201d he says.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nThe residents are constantly competing for surgeries.\n\nReal life:\n\nIn the pilot episode, Richard Webber, chief of surgery, makes his famous introduction to the first year residents, \u201cLook around you. Say hello to your competition\u2026this is your starting line, this is your arena,\u201d he says as the new doctors size up their peers, sort of scheming how they can get ahead.\n\nHoltz says hospital workers tend to develop more camaraderie.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of stress, but I saw, for the most part, that people tended to support each other,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw a lot more collaboration and mutual support. More often than not, they tend to get along and sometimes socialize outside of the hospital.\u201d\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nNurses play a small role in the hospital.\n\nReal life:\n\nHoltz says this is one of the biggest myths on Grey\u2019s Anatomy and other TV medical shows.\n\n\u201cNurses are absolutely essential to health care,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cWhat you see on TV is mostly nursing care. Giving patients injections, making sure they have their medicine, taking their blood pressure and doing hands on things with the patient in the hospital room, that\u2019s almost all nursing care.\u201d\n\nEspecially to young doctors, Holtz says nurses are useful in helping them learn the ropes, and in good health care institutions, nurses are listened to and their opinions are valued.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nExperimental treatment is better than standard treatment.\n\nReal life:\n\nSurgeons aren\u2019t as big of risk takers as doctors like Derek Shepherd (you know him as McDreamy), his sister Amelia and Callie Torres would lead you to believe. Holtz says a common myth on Grey\u2019s Anatomy is that new is better, but people tend to not take those kinds of risks in real life.\n\n\u201cIf it was the better treatment option, it wouldn\u2019t be experimental.\u201d Holtz says. \u201cExperimental means you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s better or not.\u201d\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nSurgeons will find any excuse to get in the OR and cut open a patient.\n\nReal life:\n\nOn Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Cristina Yang and the other surgeons are almost addicted to the high that comes from cutting open a patient. Not just that, but as most cases on the show will lead you to believe, surgery is the Hail Mary when it comes to saving a patient\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cIf patients are high risk, they generally don\u2019t go into surgery,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cSurgeons don\u2019t want to go in there if they don\u2019t think the patient is going to pull through.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of emergency medicine and trauma surgery, Holtz says treatments are thought through and planned out in the hospital.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nFirst year residents spend a lot of time in the operating room.\n\nReal life:\n\nIn season 1, George O\u2019Malley, on his first day as a resident, gets selected, out of all his peers, to perform an appendectomy.\n\nYeah, that wouldn\u2019t happen in a real surgical program. In fact, a first year resident would be lucky to so much as touch a scalpel.\n\n\u201cMost of the actual surgery is done by chief residents and attending surgeons,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cFirst and second year residents spend more time on the floor, learning how to care for patients and observing.\u201d\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nWorking in a hospital is a high stakes environment.\n\nReal life:\n\nAs you probably know, working in a hospital isn\u2019t too exciting. In fact, Holtz says, when he went to write his book, he worried it wouldn\u2019t be entertaining enough.\n\n\u201cFor doctors and other people working in the hospital, it\u2019s just their everyday job,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t go to a job where you were on edge and totally stressed out every minute of every day because things were so dramatic. For the most part, the work is pretty routine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say working in a hospital doesn\u2019t come with its stresses. Holtz says many hospital workers are prone to nightmares and the worry that they might have forgotten to do something before they left the hospital.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy:\n\nDifferent personality types are associated with different health care workers.\n\nReal life:\n\nIn one episode in season 3, Meredith Grey\u2019s mother, the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, begins to ask her doctor, Cristina Yang, personal questions about Meredith.\n\n\u201cHas Meredith chosen a specialty?\u201d Ellis asks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a personal question?\u201d Cristina responds.\n\n\u201cFor surgeons, the most personal question you can ask.\u201d\n\nHoltz says there are strong personality differences between different health care professionals.\n\nFor example, Holtz says cancer surgeons have to enjoy talking to patients as they spend a great deal of time meeting with them and discussing treatment plans. On the other end of the spectrum, trauma surgeons don\u2019t really want to spend time chit-chatting with patients, as they provide quick fixes to medical emergencies as they come in. Similarly, orthopedic surgeons tend to like things very clear-cut, as their job is very mechanical, a bone is either in the right place or it\u2019s not.\n\nPhoto courtesy of ABC/Kelsey McNeal.", "images": ["https://privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/seal?rid=232f8c51-711d-4fbc-afed-b3b87885979a", "https://media.newjobs.com/mm/cms/mons/jobrapp/play-store.svg", "https://media.newjobs.com/mm/cms/mons/jobrapp/app-store.svg", "https://coda.newjobs.com/api/imagesproxy/ms/cms/content30/images/greys-anatomy.jpg"], "top_img": "https://coda.newjobs.com/api/imagesproxy/ms/cms/content30/images/greys-anatomy.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lily Martis", "Monster Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.monster.com/career-advice/article/healthcare-ways-your-job-is-nothing-like-greys-anatomy-0916", "title": "9 ways your job is nothing like \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "For one, real life nurses actually do the majority of the work performed by the doctors on the show.
