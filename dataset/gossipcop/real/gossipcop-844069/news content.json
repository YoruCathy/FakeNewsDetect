But other times, in the strongest moments - maybe through the words of Alice Cooper or Freddie Mercury, through Cronenberg films, or even in Chewbacca's growl, I experienced something deeper - the realization that I wasn't completely alone.\"\n\nGunn stressed to fans who may feel how he once felt that they are not alone.\n\n\"They're a group of heartbroken misfits whose lives have been bereft of tenderness and connection and who have a nearly impossible time trusting themselves or others,\" Gunn wrote. \"But they're learning, one step at a time. They are me. They are you. We are Groot.\"\n\nGunn expressed his heartfelt thanks to fans around the world for flocking to theaters to see his latest film.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 shot to $56.3 million Friday for a weekend debut in the $140 million range at the North American box office.\n\nRead Gunn's full post below.", "images": ["https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/blogs/promoflag-thr-latest-news.png?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-grey.png?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2020/04/hikari_molly_smith_metzler__cover_art_of_dan_and_sam_split-h_2020.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2020/04/shailene_woodley_-_getty_-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Parker", "Ryan.Parker Thr.Com", "Brian Davids", "Borys Kit", "Phil Pirrello", "Richard New", "Graeme Mcmillan", "The Associated Press", "Ashley Iasimone", "Billboard"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "sailthru.description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "sailthru.author": "Ryan Parker", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-06 13:33:27", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494048807.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
