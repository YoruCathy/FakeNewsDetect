She\u2019s a fantastic partner; we had fun all the time.\u201d\n\nBut behind the scenes it might have been a different story, with Viall reportedly attributing his failure to win enough votes from viewers to people and situations beyond his ballroom dance abiilty, according to the tabloid OK!\n\nViall felt that Murgatroyd, who gave birth earlier this year, didn\u2019t give it her all. He also was telling other cast members that he thought he was facing backlash over the recent arrest of fellow \u201cBachelor\u201d alum Chris Soules, a source told OK!\n\nSoules, who competed on Season 19 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d in 2015, was arrested last week in connection with a truck crash in Iowa that killed a 66-year-old farmer. Soules has been charged with leaving the scene of a traffic fatality and is being investigated for possibly driving under the influence at the time of the crash.\n\n\u201cHe was not in a good mood after being eliminated and told cast members that he felt like Chris Soules\u2019 incident had an impact on him,\u201d an insider told OK! \u201cBasically, he was blaming everyone else but himself.\u201d\n\nThe OK! report didn\u2019t mention that \u201cStar Trek\u201d legend William Shatner, a rabid, high-profile \u201cDancing WIth the Stars\u201d fan, campaigned against Viall. Early in this season of the TV ballroom dance competition, Shatner took to Twitter to urge other viewers to vote Viall off the show.\n\nViall and Mugatroyd did an Argentine tango Monday night and received two nines and two eights from the judges, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep them in the competition.\n\nThe site Wellpaint said it looked like Murgatroyd put a lot into her performances with Viall \u2014 and her effort probably brought the two of them further in this highly competitive season than most fans expected.\n\nAfter Viall was eliminated, he called his loss a \u201cbummer\u201d before being asked about Soules, who was said to be a friend of his. He called it a \u201cterrible situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously more than anything my heart goes out to the person who passed away and their family and I\u2019m just praying for everyone involved,\u201d he said, according to E! News.\n\nWhether Viall is bitter about the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d exit, he has said that he\u2019s ready to leave behind the world of reality TV for good.\n\n\u201cMy time in reality TV is probably done,\u201d the 36-year-old told Life & Style Weekly. Instead he\u2019s focused on launching a grooming line and spending more time with his \u201cBachelor\u201d fiancee Vanessa Grimaldi.\n\n\u201cVanessa and I, we\u2019re going to keep doing our thing,\u201d he said. \u201cDancing\u2019s over, that\u2019s a bummer, but I\u2019m really looking forward to the future and definitely spending more time with the business and Vanessa.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/viall.jpg?w=1024&h=838", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/146498_ejr_7569.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/viallvanessa.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px", "http://thumbnail.newsinc.com/32345478.sf.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/viall.jpg?w=1024&h=838", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
