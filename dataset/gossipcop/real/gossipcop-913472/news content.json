However, according to the controversial reality star and her husband, David Eason, it was actually Evans' decision to cut ties with the brand after being hired to promote their product months ago.\n\nOn February 13, E! News shared a report with readers, revealing that Blue Apron's official Twitter account announced they were no longer advertising with Jenelle Evans last Thursday (Feb.\n\n8). Prior to their announcement, the company had reportedly been bombarded by viewers of \"Teen Mom OG,\" who found it upsetting that they would be using the reality star to promote their product after she admitted to past drug use and was accused of child abuse.\n\nDavid Eason tweets and deletes a statement about Jenelle's role with the meal service\n\nFollowing the announcement from Blue Apron, Evans' husband, David Eason, took to his Twitter page and in a now-deleted tweet, he claimed his wife was the one who cut ties with the company.\n\n\"Jenelle dropped [Blue Apron],\" he tweeted. He then said that while the brand was attempting to play \"billy bad a**,\" they were actually just \"butt hurt\" after Evans allegedly cut ties with them. Around the same time, Evans spoke out.\n\nJenelle Evans explained to E! News that she opted against continuing her promotional duties with the brand because they hired a co-worker who she previously had tensions with.\n\nWhile Evans didn't reveal who it was that she was referring to, she has been estranged from the entire cast of \"Teen Mom 2,\" aside from Briana DeJesus, for some time. Evans continued on to the outlet, stating that the company chose to bash her on Twitter by responding to fake accounts due to her alleged decision to stop promoting their services.\n\nJenelle Evans' husband is bashing the brand on Twitter\n\nFollowing his deleted tweet days ago, David Eason returned to Twitter where he proceeded to re-tweet a number of angry posts from people who were unhappy with their experiences with Blue Apron. While Eason chose to delete his post about the brand being \"butt hurt,\" he has made a point to share negative comments shared by others about the brand after claiming his wife cut ties.\n\nJenelle Evans is in the midst of filming the upcoming season of \"Teen Mom 2\" with David Eason and their co-stars.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/12/660x290/b_160x130/on-90-day-fiance-fans-are-disgusted-over-big-eds-nasty-bath-with-roses-father-image-source-tlc-youtube_2439395.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/15/660x290/b_160x130/on-90-day-fiance-fans-suspect-jenny-is-in-india-already-married-to-sumit-image-source-tlc-youtube_2441781.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/4/410/profile_4410147_1489595730.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/50/50963/1280x330/b_350x93/39803150634345259c8fa1ccd0b9_c.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/8/8569/1280x330/b_350x93/41024150675557959cf43fb71fc7_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/2/14/660x290/b_502x220/jenelle-evans-poses-with-husband-david-eason-photo-via-facebook_1832503.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/default/sm-user.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/51/51733/1280x330/b_350x93/59484150283796459937ccc323cc_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/16/660x290/b_160x130/o15/90-day-fiance-ed-brown-gets-a-rude-awakening-over-relationship-with-rosemarie-vega-image-source-tlc-youtube-screenshot_2442597.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/2/14/660x290/b_1200x630/jenelle-evans-poses-with-husband-david-eason-photo-via-facebook_1832503.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/p/4/2018/02/14/v_640x360/7585482e-ad40-41b9-adb3-8a8665d3e107.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/2/43/profile_2043077_1512667597.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/23/23613/400x400/b_100x100/8568115191370825a8c313ac433f_c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/2/14/660x290/b_1200x630/jenelle-evans-poses-with-husband-david-eason-photo-via-facebook_1832503.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Lindsay Cronin", "'Rhobh' Star Camille Grammer Explains Why She Talks About Ex-Husband Kelsey", "'Rhoc' Star Tamra Judge Says Kelly Dodd Likes To 'Destroy'", "'Teen Mom Star Jenelle Evans Suggests She Wasn'T Happy With Husband David Eason"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2018/02/jenelle-evans-denies-she-was-fired-by-blue-apron-due-to-child-abuse-rumors-002364305.html", "title": "Jenelle Evans denies she was fired by Blue Apron due to child abuse rumors", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "description": "'Teen Mom 2' star Jenelle Evans and her husband, David Eason, are denying claims of a firing (but he deleted his post).", "news_keywords": "Jenelle Evans, Blue Apron", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2018/02/jenelle-evans-denies-she-was-fired-by-blue-apron-due-to-child-abuse-rumors-002364305.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Jenelle Evans denies she was fired by Blue Apron due to child abuse rumors", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/2/14/660x290/b_1200x630/jenelle-evans-poses-with-husband-david-eason-photo-via-facebook_1832503.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Jenelle Evans poses with husband David Eason. -
