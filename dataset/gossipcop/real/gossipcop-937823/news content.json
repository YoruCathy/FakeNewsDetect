I guess sometimes I just push myself too hard and I promise I'm gonna take better care of myself.\"\n\nCabello ended her statement by thanking fans for their support and toasting to \"more memories, more joy, more love, more music, more health, and more life!!\"\n\nCabello's run as an opening act on Swift's Reputation trek kicked off just a couple weeks ago, and is slated to continue all the way through September. It's unclear if she'll resume the tour for its next show, on May 25 in Denver.\n\nFeel better soon, Camila!\n\n\u2014 Madeline Roth", "images": ["http://mtv-intl.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:arc:content:mtvasia.com:41cf7bd9-1ca2-41f3-aff1-a75e26ea76c4?ep=mtvasia.com&stage=live&format=jpg&quality=0.8", "http://www.mtvasia.com/sitewide/images/brand/mtv/ajax_loader.gif"], "top_img": "http://mtv-intl.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:arc:content:mtvasia.com:41cf7bd9-1ca2-41f3-aff1-a75e26ea76c4?ep=mtvasia.com&stage=live&format=jpg&quality=0.8", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.mtvasia.com/news/wn982f/camila-cabello-cancels-reputation-concert-after-revealing-hospitalization", "title": "Camila Cabello cancels Reputation concert after revealing hospitalization", "meta_data": {"original-source": "http://www.mtvasia.com/news/wn982f/camila-cabello-cancels-reputation-concert-after-revealing-hospitalization", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0, maximum-scale=1", "publishDate": "2018-05-21T22:15:00Z", "og": {"url": "http://www.mtvasia.com/news/wn982f/camila-cabello-cancels-reputation-concert-after-revealing-hospitalization", "site_name": "MTV Asia", "title": "Camila Cabello cancels Reputation concert after revealing hospitalization | MTV Asia", "image": "http://mtv-intl.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:arc:content:mtvasia.com:41cf7bd9-1ca2-41f3-aff1-a75e26ea76c4?ep=mtvasia.com&stage=live&format=jpg&quality=0.8"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/mtvasia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Camila Cabello cancels Reputation concert after revealing hospitalization", "description": "She assures fans 'everything is fine' in a heartfelt note", "image": {"src": "http://mtv-intl.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:arc:content:mtvasia.com:41cf7bd9-1ca2-41f3-aff1-a75e26ea76c4?ep=mtvasia.com&stage=live&format=jpg&quality=0.8"}}, "search": {"imageUrl": "http://mtv-intl.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:arc:content:mtvasia.com:41cf7bd9-1ca2-41f3-aff1-a75e26ea76c4?ep=mtvasia.com&stage=live&format=jpg&quality=0.8", "title": "Camila Cabello cancels Reputation concert after revealing hospitalization", "contentType": "Article"}, "application-name": "", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sitewide/images/brand/mtv/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sitewide/images/brand/mtv/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sitewide/images/brand/mtv/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sitewide/images/brand/mtv/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sitewide/images/brand/mtv/mstile-310x310.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtvasia.com", "summary": ""}
