(Photo: Jemal Countess/Getty Images)\n\nAllison Mack is facing additional legal trouble for her alleged role in a sex-cult scandal that has catapulted the former Smallville star into headlines in recent months.\n\nThe actress was charged with racketeering conspiracy Tuesday stemming from her involvement in Nxivm; she has already been charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor for allegedly helping to run a sex cult within the self-help group, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nNxivm founder Keith Raniere, who is awaiting trial on the same three earlier counts, was also charged with racketeering conspiracy, as were four other members. Co-founder Nancy Salzman and her daughter, Lauren; longtime bookkeeper Kathy Russell; and billionaire heiress Clare Bronfman were arrested Tuesday on a superseding indictment. Bronfman is the heiress to the Seagram\u2019s liquor fortune and allegedly was one of Nxivm\u2019s key financiers.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York, the racketeering conspiracy involves \u201can array of crimes, including identity theft, extortion, forced labor, sex trafficking, money laundering, wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nYahoo Entertainment received a copy of the indictment, which claims the four aforementioned women, along with Mack, made up Raniere\u2019s \u201cinner circle.\u201d The documents state that \u201cthey comprised the second-highest level within the DOS \u2018pyramid\u2019 and that, other than Raniere, they wielded the most power within DOS.\u201d\n\nDOS, which is short for a Latin phrase that roughly translates as \u201cMaster Over Slave Women,\u201d refers to the women-branding secret sorority within Nxivm. Lauren Salzman and Mack are each referred to as \u201ca first-line master in DOS\u201d in the indictment and allegedly recruited women to serve as Raniere\u2019s sex slaves.\n\n\u201cAs alleged, this long-running conspiracy crossed multiple avenues of criminal activity, which included, among other things, electronic monitoring; identity theft; extortion; victim smuggling; and illegal trafficking of a victim after a period of unlawful confinement. The details of these alleged crimes become more and more grim as we continue to dig deeper into the conduct of this organization and its intended mission,\u201d stated William Sweeney, the assistant director in charge of the FBI\u2019s New York field office. \u201cToday\u2019s superseding indictment highlights our commitment to bringing justice to Nxivm\u2019s many victims.\u201d\n\nThe indictment contains new allegations in the ongoing case, but one of the more disturbing accusations involves Raniere and Lauren Salzman. They are accused of trafficking a former sexual partner of Raniere\u2019s for \u201clabor and services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe victim was confined to a room in Clifton Park, New York, for nearly two years as punishment for having romantic feelings for a man who was not Raniere,\u201d according to prosecutors. \u201cThe victim was told that if she left the room she would be sent to Mexico without any identification documents. As threatened, she was driven to Mexico and her family was instructed by co-conspirators, including Lauren Salzman, not to send the victim her identification documents.\u201d\n\nBronfman, Russell, and the Salzmans all pleaded not guilty when arraigned in federal court Tuesday. If convicted, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison for racketeering conspiracy, forced labor conspiracy, and wire fraud conspiracy charges, as well as a maximum of 15 years of imprisonment for the identity theft conspiracy charge.\n\nRaniere and Mack are already facing mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years, and up to life imprisonment, on related charges of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. They have pleaded not guilty. The 35-year-old actress is currently out on $5 million bond, but is on house arrest. In June, Raniere was deemed a flight risk and was denied bail.\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3X10BY2lDeGtfVpNCY1jZQ--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/518bd32ccc9da4445649bd42a6afe8b5", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kbHtpOYul.2GqPC4R12csQ--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO2ZpPWZpbGw7dz04NDtoPTg0/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/222e35f0-de29-11e9-bdbf-dab7faeea558", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7v.P25WAxVvbnIb_W1u0sA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/518bd32ccc9da4445649bd42a6afe8b5"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3X10BY2lDeGtfVpNCY1jZQ--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/518bd32ccc9da4445649bd42a6afe8b5", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taryn Ryder"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/allison-mack-faces-sex-cult-charges-seagram-heiress-3-others-arrested-191442683.html", "title": "Allison Mack faces more sex-cult charges as Seagram heiress, 3 others are arrested", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Allison Mack\u00a0is facing additional legal trouble for her alleged role in a sex-cult scandal that has catapulted the former Smallville star into headlines in recent months.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3X10BY2lDeGtfVpNCY1jZQ--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/518bd32ccc9da4445649bd42a6afe8b5", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3X10BY2lDeGtfVpNCY1jZQ--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/518bd32ccc9da4445649bd42a6afe8b5"}, "title": "Allison Mack faces more sex-cult charges as Seagram heiress, 3 others are arrested"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Allison Mack, Nxivm, sex trafficking, Clare Bronfman, racketeering conspiracy, sex slaves", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=6eb90ba7-8e03-3454-b024-a8e498f20143&src=web", "description": "Allison Mack\u00a0is facing additional legal trouble for her alleged role in a sex-cult scandal that has catapulted the former Smallville star into headlines in recent months.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3X10BY2lDeGtfVpNCY1jZQ--~B/aD05MDc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/518bd32ccc9da4445649bd42a6afe8b5", "description": "Allison Mack\u00a0is facing additional legal trouble for her alleged role in a sex-cult scandal that has catapulted the former Smallville star into headlines in recent months.", "title": "Allison Mack faces more sex-cult charges as Seagram heiress, 3 others are arrested", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/allison-mack-faces-sex-cult-charges-seagram-heiress-3-others-arrested-191442683.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 73756409831, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6eb90ba7-8e03-3454-b024-a8e498f20143&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6eb90ba7-8e03-3454-b024-a8e498f20143&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532459682.0, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
