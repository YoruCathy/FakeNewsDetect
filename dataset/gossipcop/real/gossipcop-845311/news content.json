Blake Lively shut down a reporter who asked her about fashion at Variety\u2019s Power of Women event in NYC on Friday, April 21, where she was honored for her work combating child pornography.\n\n\u201cReally? At this event, you\u2019re asking me about my outfit?\u201d the 29-year-old actress demanded of a reporter on the red carpet when asked who she was wearing. \u201cSeriously \u2026 Would you ask a man that?\u201d\n\nA visibly flustered Lively continued to lecture the journalist, \u201cI\u2019m here so we \u2026 become more aware, and that we change, and that we build [women up]. So, you can ask me another question.\u201d\n\nThe Gossip Girl alum was, however, eager to talk about the empowering women in her life and how she hopes to set a good example for her daughters \u2014 James, 2, and Ines, 6 months \u2014 whom she shares with husband Ryan Reynolds.\n\n\u201cMy mom has always stood up to people who didn\u2019t have a voice,\u201d she told Us on the red carpet. \u201cI saw that in small ways through her humanity, and she was very aware and conscious of other people. That\u2019s why I want to stand up for children who are being sexually abused, and I\u2019m so grateful to be able to share their story when they can\u2019t for themselves.\u201d\n\nLively added that she is inspired by women in Hollywood who are not afraid to be themselves, and are so clearly \u201ccomfortable with themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a shame that women are called bossy and that when a woman is in power, we refer to her as a boss because if they were just successful, we could just call them that,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI\u2019ve looked up to so many women in my career, from Meryl Streep, who is always at the top of her game, to Hillary Clinton, who was almost our first female president \u2026 all those women inspire me.\u201d\n\nAdded the actress, \u201cIt\u2019s still a struggle for me, feeling comfortable in my own skin, so I look to those women who are so confident. Even coming here today, I felt that I don\u2019t deserve to be here, I don\u2019t deserve to be honored among these incredible women. And I think women have a tendency to minimize themselves. We were taught that growing up, so I look to every woman who\u2019s comfortable in her own skin as a boss woman and I\u2019m grateful to have examples of women who I aspire to be and also from my friends who are comfortable with them.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-lively-5e336b2e-a947-4acb-944e-f7a5969762bd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2070px%2C1086px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-lively-2a68bed2-7ac3-4666-bb84-36d1284b55dc.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-lively-5e336b2e-a947-4acb-944e-f7a5969762bd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2070px%2C1086px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", "Travis Cronin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-lively-shuts-down-reporter-who-asks-about-fashion-w478282/", "title": "Blake Lively Shuts Down Reporter Who Asks About Fashion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Blake Lively shut down a reporter who asked her about fashion at Variety\u2019s Power of Women event in NYC on Friday, April 21 \u2014 read more and see what she said", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Lively Shuts Down Reporter Who Asks About Fashion", "description": "Blake Lively shut down a reporter who asked her about fashion at Variety\u2019s Power of Women event in NYC on Friday, April 21 \u2014 read more and see what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-lively-shuts-down-reporter-who-asks-about-fashion-w478282/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:12:40+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-lively-5e336b2e-a947-4acb-944e-f7a5969762bd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2070px%2C1086px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-lively-5e336b2e-a947-4acb-944e-f7a5969762bd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2070px%2C1086px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-04-21T23:54:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:12:40+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Blake Lively shut down a reporter who asked her about fashion at Variety\u2019s Power of Women event in NYC on Friday, April 21 \u2014 read more and see what she said", "title": "Blake Lively Shuts Down Reporter Who Asks About Fashion", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blake-lively-5e336b2e-a947-4acb-944e-f7a5969762bd.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2070px%2C1086px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492818840.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
