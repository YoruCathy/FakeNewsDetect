Actress Jameela Jamil didn\u2019t shy away from publicly bashing Quentin Tarantino following news that he cast Emile Hirsch in a new project just two years after Hirsch pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault on a female movie executive.\n\nThe 32-year-old Good Place actress took to Twitter on Friday, June 8, to share her feelings in multiple heated posts.\n\n\u201cCool. Emile Hirsch strangled my tiny female best friend until she blacked out at a party in front of dozens of witnesses at Sundance Film Festival (and was convicted) but Tarantino just cast him in a movie,\u201d Jamil tweeted alongside a casting announcement for the upcoming film, titled Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cINTENSE case of rich white male privelege eh? Cool. Cool. Cool,\u201d she continued the lengthy tweet followed by a middle finger emoji.\n\nShortly after her first tweet, she added: \u201cLeft her with three years of PTSD and never paid for her treatment, and still hasn\u2019t apologized to her. Not today Satan, not today\u2026\u201d\n\nJamil later called out Hirsch for not apologizing, along with the rest of those involved in Tarantino\u2019s upcoming film based on the Manson Family murders.\n\n\u201cEmile Hirsch has not apologized for this heinous crime,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut is re-joining Hollywood\u2019s elite. Slow clap to everyone involved in this movie. So many other actors who haven\u2019t attacked women to choose from\u2026\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Hirsch was accused of putting Daniele Bernfeld, an executive at Insurge Pictures, a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures, into a chokehold outside of Tao nightclub in Park City, Utah, in January 2015. Bernfield recalled the incident as \u201cinsanely painful and absolutely terrifying\u201d in documents obtained by the Associated Press at the time.\n\nThe Into the Wild actor pleaded guilty to the charges in August that same year and was sentenced to 15 days in jail. The AP reported that the Hirsch, 33, entered into a plea deal with prosecutors at the time to avoid a maximum stint of five years in jail.\n\nBeyond his 15 days in jail, his punishment included $4,750 in fines and 50 hours of community service.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jameela-jamil-emile-hirsch.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jameela-jamil-emile-hirsch.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jameela-jamil-emile-hirsch.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jameela-jamil-calls-out-quentin-tarantino-for-casting-emile-hirsch/", "title": "Jameela Jamil Calls Out Quentin Tarantino for Casting Emile Hirsch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "'The Good Place' actress Jameela Jamil bashed Quentin Tarantino in multiple tweets on Friday, June 8, after news broke that he casted Emile Hirsch in an upcoming film \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Actress Calls Out Quentin Tarantino for Casting Emile Hirsch After Assault Case", "description": "'The Good Place' actress Jameela Jamil bashed Quentin Tarantino in multiple tweets on Friday, June 8, after news broke that he casted Emile Hirsch in an upcoming film \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jameela-jamil-calls-out-quentin-tarantino-for-casting-emile-hirsch/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-04-09T15:58:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jameela-jamil-emile-hirsch.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jameela-jamil-emile-hirsch.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-08T22:27:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-04-09T15:58:12+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'The Good Place' actress Jameela Jamil bashed Quentin Tarantino in multiple tweets on Friday, June 8, after news broke that he casted Emile Hirsch in an upcoming film \u2014 details", "title": "Actress Calls Out Quentin Tarantino for Casting Emile Hirsch After Assault Case", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jameela-jamil-emile-hirsch.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528496846.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
