Kim Kardashian has spent months advocating for convict Alice Marie Johnson\u2019s release and President Donald Trump has finally granted her clemency.\n\nMic reports that Trump, 71, freed Johnson, a first-time nonviolent drug offender serving a life sentence without parole, on Wednesday, June 6.\n\n\u201cBest news ever!!!! So grateful to @realDonaldTrump, Jared Kushner & to everyone who has showed compassion and contributed countless hours to this important moment for Ms. Alice Marie Johnson. Her commutation is inspirational & gives hope to so many others who are also deserving of as second chance,\u201d Kardashian, 37, tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cI hope to continue this important work by working together with organizations who have been fighting this fight for much longer than I have and deserve the recognition.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe phone call I just had with Alice will forever be one of my best memories. Telling her for the first time and hearing her screams while crying together is a moment I will never forget.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s lawyer, Shawn Holley, shared an update on the situation in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cI just got off the most wonderful, emotional and amazing phone call with Alice, Kim and Alice\u2019s lawyers. Kim was the one to tell Alice that she was being released,\u201d Holley told Us. \u201cIt was a moment I will never forget. Once Alice\u2019s family joined the call, the tears never stopped flowing.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian also complimented sister Kim for her devotion to freeing Johnson. \u201cKimberly you are such a beautiful person inside and out!!! I am constantly amazed by your determination,\u201d the Good American founder, 33, tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cNo matter what, you never let anyone else dictate your life! What\u2019s right is right! You did what was right! God bless you.\u201d\n\nThe happy news comes exactly one week after Kardashian sat down with Trump to discuss Johnson\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon,\u201d she said in a statement on May 30. \u201cWe are optimistic about Ms. Johnson\u2019s future and hopeful that she \u2014 and so many others like her \u2014 will get a second chance at life.\u201d\n\nThe Selfish author and husband Kanye West, an avid Trump enthusiast, are committed to continue advocating for prison reform. \u201cKanye has been super vocal about supporting Trump and it seems there is a motive \u2014 one being the release of Chicago inmates,\u201d a source previously told Us. \u201cKim and Kanye have been paying legal bills and fighting to get a handful of people out of jail.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the KKW Beauty founder dished on her plans to meet with the commander in chief. \u201cI\u2019ve been in communication with The White House and trying to bring [Johnson\u2019s] case to the president\u2019s desk and figure out how we can get her out,\u201d she told Mic on May 9. \u201cThat\u2019s such a huge step from where we started with that not even being not heir radar.\u201d\n\nKardashian added that, if given the opportunity to speak with Trump, she would \u201cexplain to him that, just like everybody else, we can make choices in our lives that we\u2019re not proud of and we don\u2019t think all the way through. I really do believe that she\u2019s going to thrive outside of prison and I would just urge him to please pardon her.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/donald-trump-kim-kardashian-meeting.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1130px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kim-kardashian-thanks-trump-after-alice-johnson-granted-clemency/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Thanks Trump After Alice Johnson Granted Clemency", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kim Kardashian expressed her gratitude to President Donald Trump after he granted convict Alice Marie Johnson clemency \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Thanks Trump After Alice Johnson Is Granted Clemency", "description": "Kim Kardashian expressed her gratitude to President Donald Trump after he granted convict Alice Marie Johnson clemency \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kim-kardashian-thanks-trump-after-alice-johnson-granted-clemency/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-06T18:23:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Kardashians", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-06T17:59:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-06T18:23:26+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kim Kardashian expressed her gratitude to President Donald Trump after he granted convict Alice Marie Johnson clemency \u2014 get the details", "title": "Kim Kardashian Thanks Trump After Alice Johnson Is Granted Clemency", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kim-kardashian-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528307995.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
