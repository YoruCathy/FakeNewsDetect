The This Is Us star is the first black man to win the The Actor, the Screen Actors Guild Award, for the Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series at the Sunday, Jan. 21 ceremony. This history-making win came a few weeks after Brown won the Golden Globe for Lead Actor in a Drama Series, the first black actor to win the award since 1998.\n\nHe already has an Emmy for his work as Randall Pearson on the NBC drama.
