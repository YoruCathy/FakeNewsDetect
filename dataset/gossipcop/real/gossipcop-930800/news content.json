She was 15 when the photo was taken.\n\nIM NOT SORRY\n\n\n\nFuck YOU #10yearsagopic.twitter.com/YTJmPHKwLX \u2014 Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) April 29, 2018\n\nWhen the image originally came out in the Vanity Fair piece, the then-Disney star brushed it off, saying, \u201cI mean I had a big blanket on. And I thought, \u2018This looks pretty and really natural.\u2019 I think it\u2019s really artsy.\u201d\n\nShortly after the image was released, Cyrus issued a statement, apologizing for posing in such a manner. \u201cI took part in a photo shoot that was supposed to be 'artistic' and now, seeing the photographs and reading the story, I feel so embarrassed,\" she said at the time. \"I never intended for any of this to happen and I apologize to my fans who I care so deeply about.\"\n\nAt the time Leibovitz also released a statement on the subject, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that my portrait of Miley has been misinterpreted. Miley and I looked at fashion photographs together, and we discussed the picture in that context before we shot it. The photograph is a simple, classic portrait, shot with very little make-up, and I think it is very beautiful.\"\n\nCyrus\u2019 image and sound have certainly evolved since her Disney days.
