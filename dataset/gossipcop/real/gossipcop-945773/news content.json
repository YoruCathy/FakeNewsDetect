Season two then immediately resolved the question of \u201cWhat\u2019s down the hatch?\u201d in an unexpected way. The premiere episode began with a man living underground, listening to the music of \u201cMama\u201d Cass Elliot, getting ready for another day of trying to lead a flawless life, to avoid a fate worse than death.\n\nIn tonight\u2019s The Good Place, \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Good Life Pass You By,\u201d we finally meet the legendary Doug Forcett: the Calgary man who in 1972 got high on mushrooms and figured out almost exactly how the afterlife works, making him a celebrity in the great beyond. And what is he doing the first time we see him? Living far off the grid, listening to Mama Cass, reading Peter Singer\u2019s book The Most Good You Can Do, and striving for personal perfection.\n\nOnce Lost fans were let inside the hatch, the show changed, becoming more overtly a wild science-fiction/fantasy epic. I have a feeling the arrival of Doug Forcett is going to be just as pivotal to The Good Place.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand: It\u2019s not that Doug\u2019s all that impressive as a person. As played by the masterful Michael McKean (getting a chance to be funny again after his long stint as a stick-in-the-mud on Better Call Saul), Doug\u2019s the definition of \u201cvirtuous to a fault.\u201d Terrified of eternal damnation, he\u2019s spent the past 46 years leading a miserable, inconsequential life, eating only radishes and lentils, drinking his own filtered waste, and allowing himself to be pushed around by every jerk kid and stray canine that wanders onto his property. \u201cI\u2019ve been mauled several times,\u201d he admits, while gesturing to a cute small dog. \u201cThis little guy goes right for the squeaker.\u201d\n\nMichael and Janet \u2014 disguised as ace journalists \u201cMichael Scoop\u201d and \u201cJanet \u2026 Scoop\u201d \u2014 are initially impressed with how much Doug \u201cgets it,\u201d and think he could be just the man to model for humankind the way to save our souls. But it doesn\u2019t take long for them to see that Doug\u2019s become \u201ca happiness pump,\u201d sacrificing for others unthinkingly. Even when they assure him that he\u2019s likely earned more than enough points to get into the Good Place, and can now lighten up a bit, he can\u2019t conceive of how that would work. \u201cEat something besides lentils,\u201d Michael suggests. \u201cLike radishes?\u201d Doug asks.\n\nDuring the time that Michael and Janet spend with him, Doug accidentally steps on a snail and almost has a breakdown, yelling at his guests to fetch him some scotch tape while he applies pressure to the tiny mollusk. (\u201cToo much pressure!\u201d he wails. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need that tape!\u201d) And yet he\u2019s oblivious to how bizarre and out of balance his existence has become. \u201cIt\u2019s the only rational way to live,\u201d he insists, before adding, \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to walk to Edmonton to give $85 to a snail charity.\u201d\n\nHonestly, Shawn couldn\u2019t have designed a better Bad Place than the one Doug has made for himself. And speaking of the demon we love to hate, Shawn shows up at the end of \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Good Life Pass You By,\u201d with his whole demon army, ready to haul the humans back to perdition, and to enjoy the stunned, sad look on Michael\u2019s face. (\u201cI love seeing the looks on people\u2019s faces,\u201d he snarls. \u201cIt\u2019s the best part of my job.\u201d)\n\nBefore Shawn arrives, Eleanor, Tahani, Chidi, and Jason are killing time at a pub called the Puking Moose, in scenes that would be fairly pointless time-wasters if not for two things: (1) How adorable Chidi and Jason are together playing \u201cJacksonville-style pool,\u201d where the players use their hands instead of cues, and they make up their own points, and (2) how Eleanor gradually psychs herself up to confess to Chidi that she saw herself falling in love with him in a Good Place memory, and that, \u201cThere\u2019s a real possibility that I\u2019m in love with you again\u2026 here\u2026 on this plane of existence\u2026 today\u2026 now\u2026 in Canada\u2026 during this brawl\u2026 with demons.\u201d\n\nBrawl with demons? Yes, brawl with demons. A big reason why this episode gets the max star rating \u2014 besides McKean\u2019s perfect performance as Doug \u2014 is because the bar fight in the Puking Moose is one of the most entertaining sequences in the entire run of the series. From Jason popping up suddenly with one of his molotov cocktails (starting to shout, \u201cBortl\u2026!\u201d before getting shushed), to Tahani fencing with a pool cue (and giving herself a three-tenths deduction for braining her opponent), to Janet hissing, \u201cScrew this, let\u2019s fight!\u201d before karate-chopping and kicking her way through the hell-hordes, everything about this five minutes of TV is pure fun. The writers and cast (and director Dean Holland) should expect a healthy amount of Good Place points when they die, just for this episode.\n\nThe chapter then ends with multiple thickenings of a plot that had been running a little thin in recent weeks. Meeting Doug has convinced Michael of something he\u2019s suspected for a while: that the afterlife points system is messed up, and he needs to talk to the accountants about what they\u2019re doing wrong. Before he can slip off to do that, more demons arrive, and Janet has no choice but to zap everyone into her Void.\n\nSo that\u2019s where we leave things: with the humans heading down a dark (metaphorical) hole, before beginning a mission to save humanity by changing the rules of the universe. From now on, as they used to say on Lost, whatever happens, happens.\n\nSoul Patrol\n\n\u2022 Let\u2019s get to theorizin\u2019! Michael shoves Shawn through a portal before the demon can explain what he meant about the humans\u2019 families \u2014 and Doug Forcett! \u2014 all ending up in the Bad Place. (\u201cI mean why let the guy keep saying mean stuff, right?\u201d Michael mutters, defending why he sent Shawn packing.) I\u2019ve wondered since season two whether there really is a Good Place. Maybe there\u2019s just one afterlife of limitless possibilities, which crummy dead humans turned bad eons ago, as we are wont to do. Could this be what Shawn was suggesting? If I\u2019m even 92 percent right, I expect to get my picture up on the wall in The Good Place writers room.\n\n\u2022 As he usually does when he\u2019s pretending to be human, Michael goes way overboard as folksy reporter Michael Scoop, launching into a long reverie about the good ordinary people on this big blue marble of ours, before Janet shuts him down. (Janet, meanwhile, forgets where she is for a moment, and when Doug asks if his guests know anything about snail first aid, she reflexively answers, \u201cYes.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Doug calls every snail \u201csnail,\u201d because, \u201cI don\u2019t name them in case they already have a name they prefer.\u201d But he does give a name to one he kills: Martin Luther Gandhi Tyler Moore Snail. (Other dead animals on Doug\u2019s property: Rosa Parks the Deer Tick; Franklin Delano Raccoon; and Abraham Lincoln Einstein Mandela Goose.)\n\n\u2022 Seriously though, how good is Michael McKean? With his deep, rich voice and genteel demeanor, he can make even the simplest line funnier. Like: \u201cWhat else can I do for you? Would you like to move in, permanently?\u201d; or, while warning other snails that he\u2019s walking by, \u201cLook out\u2026 Here comes a shoe.\u201d\n\n\u2022 I\u2019d assumed this would be the last Good Place of the year, given the way the show\u2019s past seasons have been parceled out; but apparently the show will just be off the air for a couple of weeks, and then back on December 6 with the real last Good Place of the year, an episode called \u201cJanet(s)\u201d (which already sounds amazing).", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/11/15/recaps/15-the-good-place.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/11/15/recaps/15-the-good-place.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/11/15/recaps/15-the-good-place.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Noel Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/the-good-place-recap-season-3-episode-9-doug-forcett.html", "title": "The Good Place Recap: True North", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Good Place Recap: True North", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/the-good-place-recap-season-3-episode-9-doug-forcett.html", "description": "The arrival of a pivotal character marks a standout episode that also features one of the most entertaining sequences of the entire series.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/11/15/recaps/15-the-good-place.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Good Place Recap: True North", "description": "The arrival of a pivotal character marks a standout episode that also features one of the most entertaining sequences of the entire series.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/11/15/recaps/15-the-good-place.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-11-15T21:01:00.000-05:00", "tag": "tv, tv recaps, overnights, recaps, the good place, the good place season 3", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "The arrival of a pivotal character marks a standout episode that also features one of the most entertaining sequences of the entire series.
