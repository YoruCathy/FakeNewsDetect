In videos shared on social media, Chyna is seen grabbing a pink stroller and swinging it around wildly. Neither child is seen in the footage, posted by Twitter user AliciaaAngiee.\n\nThe Tweets have since been deleted.\n\nAn eyewitness told E! News that the incident occurred at 6:45 p.m. at the exit of the X2 ride. It is not clear what incited the incident.\n\nAfter the videos went viral, Chyna took to Instagram Stories to allude to a person setting her off by trying to touch her child. She did not reference the fight directly but the timing of the post appeared to coincide with the incident. She said she doesn't condone violence but she is a protective mother.\n\n\u201cBeing famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it\u2019s a whole other story,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost.\u201d\n\nChyna's new boyfriend, rapper YBN Almighty Jay, allegedly got involved in the altercation and tried to stop it, reports XXL. YBN and security reportedly attempted to restrain Chyna from the unidentified person.\n\n[Photo: Getty Images]", "images": ["https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/screenshot_5063.jpg?itok=D3TdVqwQ", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/2020-04/mok-phone-booth.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/chanel-galle.jpg?itok=tO4Jwh8I", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/heather-inks-pd_0.jpg?itok=l5xMBB89", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/2020-04/reginald-mcfadden.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/video-oxygen.akamaized.net/oxygen_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Oxygen/647/35/160720_3071008_A_Short_History_of_Blac_Chyna.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/bravo_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Oxygen/684/639/190131_3899775_Ted_Bundy_s_Relationships__Explained.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/david-gretchen-anthony-pd.jpg?itok=u2f_6jGu", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/field_blog_image/2016/03/blac-chyna-getty.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/sagal-hussein-pd.jpg?itok=HYnHK5kk", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/asm.jpg?itok=WExyqYzZ", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/video-oxygen.akamaized.net/oxygen_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Oxygen/808/319/191007_4044011_A_Beloved_Chicago_Dermatologist_Didn_t_Call_.jpg?itok=rfyyiOUB", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post--computer/public/2020-04/hawaiijpg.jpg?itok=Q2bowLJl", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/video-oxygen.akamaized.net/oxygen_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Oxygen/168/231/200407_4146345_Laurie_Barros_Revisits_Sam_Little_Crime_Scen.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/video-oxygen.akamaized.net/oxygen_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Oxygen/656/738/171027_3609747_3_Teacher_Student_Sex_Scandals.jpg?itok=Rsxc7TyW", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/2020-03/kathleen-in-1998.jpg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2020-04/natalia-uriarte-francisco-uriarte-fb-pd.jpg?itok=jUpKiULU", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/2019-07/lynette-fromme-squeaky_0.jpg?itok=C-Yd-jVg", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/styles/watch_full_episode_thumbnail__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/video-oxygen.akamaized.net/oxygen_video_thumbnails/NBCU_Oxygen/526/531/livestream.jpg?itok=54GqUu4B", "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/2020-03/kim-kardashian-west-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/field_blog_image/2016/03/blac-chyna-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/blac-chyna-six-flags-fight-easter", "title": "Blac Chyna Speaks Out After Alleged Six Flags Fight On Easter", "meta_data": {"title": "Blac Chyna Defends Herself After Alleged Six Flags Fight | Crime News", "og": {"site_name": "Oxygen Official Site", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/blac-chyna-six-flags-fight-easter", "title": "Blac Chyna Speaks Out After Alleged Six Flags Fight On Easter", "description": "Blac Chyna\u00a0is defending herself as a caring mother after she was caught on camera swinging a\u00a0baby stroller in a public altercation at a Six Flags amusement park on Easter Sunday.", "image": "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/field_blog_image/2016/03/blac-chyna-getty.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@oxygen", "description": "Blac Chyna\u00a0is defending herself as a caring mother after she was caught on camera swinging a\u00a0baby stroller in a public altercation at a Six Flags amusement park on Easter Sunday.", "title": "Blac Chyna Speaks Out After Alleged Six Flags Fight On Easter", "url": "https://www.oxygen.com/crime-time/blac-chyna-six-flags-fight-easter", "image": "https://www.oxygen.com/sites/oxygen/files/field_blog_image/2016/03/blac-chyna-getty.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 282902305377590}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-03T07:34:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-03T10:22:45-04:00"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "vertical_name": "Crime News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522755240.0, "source": "https://www.oxygen.com", "summary": ""}
