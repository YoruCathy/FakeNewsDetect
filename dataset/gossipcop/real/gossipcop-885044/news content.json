You betcha\n\nOur favourite Bachelor hotties are returning for another shot at love\u2014and this time it\u2019s going international.\n\nThe new Bachelor spinoff, The Bachelor Winter Games, debuts on Feb. 13 at 8:00 EST and is basically a show where contestants compete in a series of winter-themed challenges for a chance to win the ultimate prize: love. *Cue eye rolls now* The show, described as \u201cdifferent and fun\u201d by host Chris Harrison, is a four-part series filmed in Manchester, Vermont, at what producers call a \u201cluxurious winter resort.\u201d (Basically, it\u2019s a fancy AF space for cozy rendezvous, cuddle sessions and, obviously, drama.)\n\nWhile we\u2019re stoked that some of our fave Bach Nation contestants will be taking part (hello Eric Bigger!), we don\u2019t know a heck of a lot about this new *reality* show. So, we did a deep dive into The Bachelor Winter Games and this is everything we learned so far about the show we will complain about non-stop while compulsively watching. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nWhen it airs\n\nClear your calendars, babes. The four-parter airs from 8:00 EST to 10:00 EST on Tuesday, February 13, Thursday February 15, Tuesday February 20 and Thursday February 22 on ABC. That means\u2014including Arie\u2019s season\u2014there will be six hours of Bachelor Nation programming on the weeks of February 12 and 19. We are seriously not sure if we can handle it all, HBU?\n\nHere\u2019s how the game works\n\nTen former Bachelor/Bachelorette contestants from the United States along with 14 contestants from overseas editions of The Bachelor\u2014including Australia\u2019s Tiffany Scanlon, Canada\u2019s Benoit Beausejour Savard and New Zealand\u2019s Jordan Mauger\u2014will compete for \u201cdate cards\u201d that they can use to pursue romantic one-on-ones with fellow competitors. How does one win a date card, you ask? Simple. By showing off one\u2019s skiing, biathlon and ice-dancing skills.\n\nAccording to a press release by ABC, the competitions will \u201ctest the contestants\u2019 perseverance in pursuing relationships with one another while faced with language barriers and cultural differences.\u201d Producer Mike Fleiss hopes the games will \u201ccreate a global celebration of unity and love.\u201d Hey, if that means we get to see Ben Higgins\u2019s winter bod we\u2019re alllllllll for it.\n\nThe special guests are insane\n\nIn case you are bummed about missing some of the actual Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea (which will air at the same time), you can get your athlete fix with special appearances by world figure skating champions Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner, and Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. Other special appearances include former Bach contestants and forever lovebirds Trista and Ryan Sutter, who will kick off the games as \u201cgrand marshals,\u201d former Bachelorettes Rachel Lindsay and JoJo Fletcher, and current Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr.\n\nThese are the contestants we are most stoked to see\n\nBen Higgins\n\nOur hearts filled and then eventually broke for season 20 Bachelor Ben and his now-ex Lauren Bushnell. But hey, if Ben can\u2019t find love in Vermont, Amy Schumer seems to dig him.\n\nAshley Iaconetti (a.k.a. Ashley I)\n\nC\u2019mon. As if we wouldn\u2019t be excited for the return of infamous Kim Kardashian-esque crying Ashley! It\u2019s been too long since we saw her on Bachelor in Paradise seasons 2 and 3. And if the games are anything like the promo suggests, there will be plenty of tears ahead.\n\nEric Bigger\n\nSweet, charming, sexy Eric was a fan favourite on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of The Bachelorette. He wasn\u2019t lucky enough to capture her Final Rose, but will her guest appearance bring up old feelings? WE HOPE SO.\n\nLuke Pell\n\nWe still have a serious bone to pick with Luke about his not-so-cute f-ckboy tendencies, so we will be watching to see if he\u2019s improved his behaviour.\n\nDean Unglert\n\nHe won our hearts when he showed his sensitive side on Rachel\u2019s season of The Bachelorette, but got a bad boy reputation on Bachelor in Paradise season 4 when he tried to date BOTH Kristina Schulman and Danielle Lombard. Which Dean will we get this time?\n\nHow do Bach fans feel?\n\nMany fans are stoked for the triumphant return of our favourite Bachelor babes\n\nOH MY GOD BACHELOR WINTER GAMES???
