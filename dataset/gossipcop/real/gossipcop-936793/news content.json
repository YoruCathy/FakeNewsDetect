And they\u2019ll be sitting in the same positions on opposite sides of the aisle. #RoyalWedding \u2014 Elaine L. (@LaineyGossip) May 19, 2018\n\nCameras captured Ragland as she was overcome with emotion throughout the ceremony, particularly when Markle and Harry exchanged their vows.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle exchange vows #royalwedding pic.twitter.com/Iev31Y6KOz \u2014 Liam Edwards (@Ed_7991) May 19, 2018\n\nOn social media, people commended Markle's mother for attending and sitting at the wedding alone. Ragland and Markle's father, Thomas Markle Sr., divorced in 1987, and it was announced that he was unable to attend the wedding after suffering a heart attack earlier this week.\n\n\"Beautifiully [sic] dressed Doria sitting alone in such a beautiful historical moment shows strength, & grace that must be an inspiration to Meghan,\" one user wrote. \"This is the reality of many single parents.\"\n\n\"Kudos to #DoriaRagland for sitting there alone representing,\" another said. \"It can't be easy with all that pressure and scrutiny.\"\n\nBeautifiully dressed Doria sitting alone in such a beautiful historical moment shows strength, & grace that must be an inspiration to Meghan.

They know the layout of St. George\u2019s Chapel, and they will guide him.\"\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eileen Reslen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20754831/meghan-markle-mother-doria-ragland-sitting-alone-royal-wedding/", "title": "Why Meghan Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland, Sat Alone at the Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Why Meghan Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland, Sat Alone at the Royal Wedding", "description": "Here's everything you need to know about the seating arrangements.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20754831/meghan-markle-mother-doria-ragland-sitting-alone-royal-wedding/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-05-20 02:01:06", "published_time": "2018-05-19 02:00:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Why Did Meghan Markle's Mother Doria Ragland Sit Alone in Second Row at Royal Wedding? - Royal Wedding Seating Chart", "description": "Doria Ragland, Meghan Markle's mother, sat in the second row at St. George's Chapel, opposite the Queen of England, during the royal wedding ceremony.", "keywords": "doria ragland, meghan markle mother, royal wedding seating chart, where did doria ragland sit at the royal wedding, why did doria ragland sit in the second row, why did meghan markle's mother sit in the second row, royal wedding, meghan markle mother royal wedding, doria ragland royal wedding, royal wedding seating chart", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=0.837xw:0.558xh;0.112xw,0.0898xh&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-19T14:00:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=0.837xw:0.558xh;0.112xw,0.0898xh", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Why Meghan Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland, Sat Alone at the Royal Wedding", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526666400.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
