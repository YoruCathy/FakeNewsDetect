Everyone\u2019s going to come to my house for dinner.\u2019 George begins to say, \u2018Listen, I want you guys to know how much you\u2019ve meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,\u2019\u201d recalled the restauranteur.\n\n\u201cI came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I\u2019m so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn\u2019t be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we\u2019re still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases,\u2019\u201d Clooney said, according to Gerber. \u201cWe open it up, and it\u2019s $1 million dollars in $20 bills. Every one of us \u2013 14 of us \u2013 got $1 million. Every single one of us. We\u2019re in shock.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Famal-clooney-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1223&h=640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Famal-clooney-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1223&h=640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F06%2Famal-clooney-5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/george-clooney-amal-clooney-pass-out-headphones-to-passengers-on-flight-with-6-month-old-twins/", "title": "George, Amal Clooney Pass Out Headphones on Flight with Twins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Amal Clooney,Babies,George Clooney,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Parenting", "news_keywords": "Amal Clooney,Babies,George Clooney,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News,Parenting", "description": "George and Amal Clooney passed out noise-canceling headphones during a recent flight to Amal's native England, a source confirms to PEOPLE", "og": {"title": "George, Amal Clooney Pass Out Headphones on Flight with Twins", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/george-clooney-amal-clooney-pass-out-headphones-to-passengers-on-flight-with-6-month-old-twins/", "description": "George Clooney&nbsp;and Amal Clooney&nbsp;were&nbsp;well-meaning parents handing out headphones to their fellow passengers to apologize for having their 6-month-old twins on board.
