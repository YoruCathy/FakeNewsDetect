The group was launched first in Europe and essentially became an overnight success with their singles \u201cI Want You Back\u201d and \u201cTearin\u2019 Up My Heart\u201d before they were signed to RCA, transferring their success to North America. While their first album did well, their second album, No Strings Attached, did even better, becoming both the best-selling album of the decade and the top-selling album of 2000. It all came to a halt after a whirlwind of domination in the music industry when the group went on hiatus in 2002 and never re-formed. Everyone is well aware of the success and celebrity Justin Timberlake has enjoyed in his solo career, but in case you ever wondered how everyone in the group fared since their money-making heyday, check out NSYNC: How Much Are They Worth Now?\n\n5. Chris Kirkpatrick\n\nEstimated Net Worth: $13 Million. Chris Kirkpatrick may unfortunately be one of the most easily forgotten NSYNC members, but he is still doing well for himself with a net worth of $13 million. Following his days with the band, Kirkpatrick worked as a voice over actor, most notably on The Fairly OddParents. He then surprised fans when he appeared on the show Gone Country 2, and although he didn\u2019t win, he impressed many with country song writing and singing skills. Since then he has kept a low profile and in 2015 appeared in the cult classic Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!", "images": ["https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2015/11/shutterstock_311901425.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/484044_10153756991595114_2102945264_n-150x150.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/08/98-Degrees.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/07/Lauryn-Hill.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2019/07/426795.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/08/shutterstock_187230275.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/04/New-Kids-on-the-BLock-4.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2015/12/029527.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/close.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2015/12/00004312.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2015/12/246959.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/22670791-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2019/08/19180283.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/08/taylor-swift-7591.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2015/12/00004312.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop/qool-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2014/03/shutterstock_98749658.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2019/03/20247294-1.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/00004312-1024x731.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_480,$w_895/f10/2015/12/00004312.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/09/Katy-Perry-3.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/03/13759966.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2015/12/4863517.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2019/04/GettyImages-1142774697.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2015/12/246959.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2019/04/GettyImages-1020376568.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/08/shutterstock_111164276.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2015/12/4863517.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/05/shutterstock_99585242.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/JPI_Episode13832_0001864744-600x337.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/hamburger.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FEB10fame10logo-web-1.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/03/Ellen-DeGeneres-Finger-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2019/06/31221907.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2017/07/1870905.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/00004312-1024x731.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/nsync-how-much-are-they-worth-now/", "title": "NSYNC: How Much Are They Worth Now?", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NSYNC: How Much Are They Worth Now?", "description": "It has been 20 years since NSYNC formed in Orlando, Florida, bringing together Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and JC Chasez to form one of the biggest boy bands in the world.
