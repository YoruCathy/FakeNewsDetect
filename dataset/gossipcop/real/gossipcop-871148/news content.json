The actor told The Hollywood Reporter in January that he's grateful for Aquaman because it's led to more opportunities to provide for his family.\n\n\"I haven't been an actor who's been able to pick and choose roles, and being a family man, it's been about putting food on the table,\" he said. \"This has been the best moment of my career because the superhero roles are letting me get the other roles I want.\"\n\nMomoa is also known for playing Khal Drogo on the HBO series Game of Thrones and Declan Harp on the Netflix drama Frontier.
