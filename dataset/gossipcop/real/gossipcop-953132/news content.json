{"url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/07/danica-patrick-host-espys-monologue-jokes-best-worst-nascar-awards-2018", "text": "Danica Patrick hosted the 2018 ESPYS on Wednesday night in Los Angeles, opening the show with a seven-minute monologue that received mixed reviews from the internet.\n\nShe nailed several jokes, but her comedic timing was a little off on others and led to a few awkward moments. And it probably didn\u2019t help that the audience didn\u2019t seem settled in their seats and fully into the routine.\n\nPrior to the show, Patrick told For The Win she prepped by practicing her monologue to ensure the jokes were delivered in her voice. She took plenty of shots at other athletes \u2014 including LeBron James, Tiger Woods and the U.S. men\u2019s soccer team \u2014 and said that when she was often the target of jokes, she took it as a compliment because she was \u201cimportant enough\u201d to be thought of.\n\n\u201cI loved the creative process and coming up with ideas and jokes and putting in my two cents there, along with the help of a dozen highly qualified writers,\u201d Patrick told FTW by phone Saturday.\n\nSo because there were some highs and lows at the show, here are Patrick\u2019s best and worst jokes.\n\nThe Best\n\n1. A topical joke, for the win\n\n\u201cThe Caps won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. And Alex Ovechkin couldn\u2019t be any happier. I haven\u2019t seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since, well, two days ago.\u201d\n\n2. Tiger back?\n\nThrough the self-deprecating humor Patrick promised, she took a shot at Tiger Woods and herself \u2014 but also her trolls on social media who constantly questioned why people cared about her NASCAR and IndyCar careers when she only won one race in 14 years on the track.\n\n\u201cTiger Woods is back. Sort of I guess. I mean, why do people keep talking about this guy who isn\u2019t winning? Who does he think he is? Me?\u201d\n\n3. Sorry, Cleveland\n\n\u201cNo matter what else is going on in the world, sports have always had the power to inspire and give hope\u2026 unless those people are from Cleveland.\u201d\n\n4. Another punch\n\nFollowing an awkward joke about LeBron James\u2019 hair (see below in The Worst), Danica made a great joke about poor J.R. Smith not knowing what the score was during Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s OK. LeBron, when he hosted, he made fun of me too. I\u2019d say we\u2019re even. J.R. Smith would say we\u2019re up by one!\u201d\n\nThat one was met with heavy applause. And she continued\u2026\n\n\u201cYeah, he made quite the little oopsie in the playoffs this year. You know, it\u2019s not good when you have 100 tattoos and none of them are your biggest mistake.\u201d\n\n5. Keeping Up with the Kardashians\n\nPhiladelphia 76s star Ben Simmons is reportedly dating Kendall Jenner, so who could resist an easy target?\n\n\u201cSo many big NBA moves this offseason. Kawhi Leonard went to the Raptors, Dwight Howard went to the Wizards and Ben Simmons went to the Kardashians.\u201d\n\n6. Adam Rippon\u2019s Instagram stardom\n\nWhile highlighting the amazing performances by Team USA in the 2018 Winter Olympics, Patrick said:\n\n\u201cOur gold-medal winning women\u2019s hockey team is here, gold medalist Chloe Kim is here and Instagram\u2019s Adam Rippon is here\u2026 I\u2019m told he also won a medal.\u201d\n\nCut to Rippon \u2014 who won a figure skating bronze medal in South Korea \u2014 who was hilariously posing like he would for his Instagram account, which is spectacularly entertaining. He stole the show briefly with this joke, but it was cute all around.\n\n7. A short joke\n\nDanica is only about 5-foot-2, so she doesn\u2019t have much of a leg to stand on here when teasing Houston Astros\u2019 All-Star second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve. But as someone who\u2019s in the same height range, this writer always appreciates short jokes.\n\n\u201cWorld Series champion Jos\u00e9 Altuve is here. And when I say it\u2019s incredible that Jos\u00e9 can reach the top of his profession without being able to reach the top shelf of his locker, it\u2019s out of respect.\u201d\n\nThe Worst\n\n1. It started off fine\u2026\n\nPatrick threw a jab at the NFL\u2019s new policy that players must stand for the national anthem if they\u2019re on the field, which the players themselves found ridiculous and pointed out how it still misses the point of the peaceful protests. But then the joke continued as she addressed \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d with the national anthem controversy, and an image of Fergie appeared on the screen behind her.\n\n\u201cGive it up for the U.S. men\u2019s curling team, they also took home gold. And for those unfamiliar, curling is the sport where you are allowed to kneel. It\u2019s encouraged. \u201cThat\u2019s right, we have to mention the elephant in the room. It\u2019s time to talk about the national anthem controversy. (Cut to an image of Fergie.) I don\u2019t know what Fergie was thinking either.\u201d\n\nThis was just a bad joke involving serious issues, like of racial injustice and police brutality, and Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 Chris Long \u2014 one of the leading advocates for peaceful protests \u2014 was seen saying it was bad. However, it turns out he was talking about Fergie\u2019s terrible performance from the NBA All-Star Game.\n\nFor the record geniuses I was talking about Fergie https://t.co/sZN4tyw9Rz \u2014 Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) July 19, 2018\n\n2. Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s hair\n\n\u201cOdell is, once again, healthy and will return to the field next season, but his hair style\u2019s still listed as questionable.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve heard this one before, and Patrick\u2019s delivery was a little bit off. However, Patrick also appeared on stage wearing a shorts suit, saying she borrowed it from OBJ. He seemed to enjoy that quip a little more.\n\n3. And then LeBron James\u2019 hair\n\nThis one just straight up fell flat, and the timing was all kinds of off.\n\n\u201cWho doesn\u2019t love LeBron James? He\u2019s one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and now, LeBron is the newest Los Angeles transplant. Los Angeles transplant is also what he Googles when he needs new hair.\u201d\n\n4. No, the USMNT wasn\u2019t in the World Cup\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard by now, the soccer tournament that started more than a month ago and ended last weekend didn\u2019t include the U.S.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to France on winning the World Cup. I\u2019d make a joke about the U.S. soccer team, but they didn\u2019t qualify for this monologue.\u201d\n\n5. KD\u2019s burners\n\nPatrick closed her monologue with one final joke, this one aimed at Kevin Durant. It was funny, but not new and seemed like a missed opportunity to throw a punch at the 76ers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to give out some awards tonight. Remember, the ESPYS are voted on by all of you. And there\u2019s no greater honor than being recognized by actual fans. This year, millions of them cast their votes on Twitter, and only 1,000 were from Kevin Durant\u2019s burner accounts.\u201d\n\nBonus:\n\nThis wasn\u2019t part of her monologue, but the costumes were great for Patrick and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s Game of Thrones non-sketch.", "images": ["https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-ftw.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/headshot.jpg?w=48&h=48&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/butler.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gty-1001462466_101577557-e1531969040196.jpg?w=100&h=70#038;h=709", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/warriors.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/pjimage-94-e1587064131765.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/usp_nba__all_star_game-team_lebron_at_team_stephen_97671794-e1519144246714.jpg?w=1000&h=555", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/logo-usat-bar.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/ftw-icon-section-head.png", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ap-2018-espy-awards-show_101575967-e1531968479379.jpg?w=1000&h=640", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/usp-nascar_-media-day-2.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/usp-nba_-playoffs-boston-celtics-at-milwaukee-buck-e1557406697527.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/zabit.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/ap-celtics-bucks-basketball.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ap-2018-espy-awards-show_101575967-e1532014590823.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ap-2018-espy-awards-show_101575967-e1531968479379.jpg?w=100&h=64#038;h=640", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/usp_nba__all_star_game-team_lebron_at_team_stephen_97671794-e1519144246714.jpg?w=100&h=55#038;h=555", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/gty-1001452154-e1575297703217.jpg?w=24&h=24&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/lebron-jr-smith.jpg?w=100&h=70#038;h=703", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lamartrump.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ap-2018-espy-awards-show_101577561.jpg?w=100&h=66#038;h=666", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gty-1001462466_101577557-e1531969040196.jpg?w=1000&h=709", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/fifa.png?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/lebron-jr-smith.jpg?w=1000&h=703", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/screen-shot-2020-04-18-at-5.44.02-pm.jpg?w=34&h=20&crop=1", "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ap-2018-espy-awards-show_101577561.jpg?w=1000&h=666"], "top_img": "https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/ap-2018-espy-awards-show_101575967-e1532014590823.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle R.
