Designed by Raf Simons, the piece found its roots through early conversations with Saltzman, with the color being determined immediately. \u201cIt is a pink, which is what I was trying not to do,\u201d added Saltzman, who conceded, \u201cbut it was just right.\u201d\n\nThe resulting bow-trimmed gown, coupled with Ronan\u2019s new cropped hair, is poised to sit alongside other memorable Oscar red carpet moments, including Nicole Kidman\u2019s mandarin-inspired Galliano for Dior couture dress in 1997 and Julia Roberts\u2019s black and white Valentino stunner from 2001. \u201cI want this to be timeless,\u201d said Saltzman. \u201cIt needed to be about Saoirse, as a person.\u201d It also functioned as Simons\u2019s statement on elegance, femininity, and what it means to dress as a woman on the awards show circuit. \u201cIt\u2019s what girls are made of, and what women can wear,\u201d said Saltzman. \u201cIt\u2019s just so beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe dress itself married couture-level craftsmanship with modern design. An inner sheath hit Ronan just above the ankle, while the exaggerated bow in the back was a bold touch. \u201cI just want that bow,\u201d Saltzman said. \u201cThis should be a really beautiful moment. It\u2019s modern.\u201d For jewelry, Saltzman and Ronan chose diamonds to punctuate the look. \u201cI put this thinnest strand of clear diamonds\u2014they are barely there on her ears\u2014and the most beautiful ring from 1929, this diamond,\u201d said Saltzman.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the team had an ingenious plan for the Oscars after-party in place: the ultimate quick-change. \u201cThe train comes off, so she can party her ass off,\u201d said Saltzman, laughing. Just your average, couture dress\u2013wearing, three-time-Oscar-nominated 23-year-old.\n\nSee All of the Celebrity Looks From the 2018 Oscars Red Carpet:", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c94f64650d478d14ab415/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927255242.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c995dd3a5026d7da8dd4c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927261592.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5858494d44b5d45318dc9545/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Edward-Barsamian-author-pic.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9da02c9af20559538f9f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/01/Banner-Oscars1.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d521d6ee50bf5842b6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9461a8e2b84d5b0f258e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-927251968.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d9c0bb59c445d4dbdeb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d9d1415a85dc8348ab5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-story-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d521d6ee50bf5842b6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Edward Barsamian", "Edward Barsamia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-by-appointment-elizabeth-saltzman-walker-oscars-2018-celebrity-red-carpet-diary", "title": "Why Saoirse Ronan\u2019s Pink Calvin Klein Oscars Dress Is Already Iconic", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Edward Barsamian", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Saoirse Ronan\u2019s stylist, Elizabeth Saltzman, shares the story behind the actress\u2019s Calvin Klein By Appointment Oscars dress.", "id": "5a9c75ce1a71770bab843594", "keywords": "celebrity style,fashion,runway,saoirse ronan,oscars 2020,calvin klein", "news_keywords": "celebrity style,fashion,runway,saoirse ronan,oscars 2020,calvin klein", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a9c75ce1a71770bab843594", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Saoirse Ronan\u2019s stylist, Elizabeth Saltzman, shares the story behind the actress\u2019s Calvin Klein By Appointment Oscars dress.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d4e4650d478d14ab419/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d4e4650d478d14ab419/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The three-time Oscar-nominated actress reignited the spark between herself, her stylist, and the American fashion house on the 2018 Oscars red carpet.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d521d6ee50bf5842b6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Why Saoirse Ronan\u2019s Pink Calvin Klein Oscars Dress Is Already Iconic", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-by-appointment-elizabeth-saltzman-walker-oscars-2018-celebrity-red-carpet-diary"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "The three-time Oscar-nominated actress reignited the spark between herself, her stylist, and the American fashion house on the 2018 Oscars red carpet.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a9c9d521d6ee50bf5842b6c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-saoirse-ronan-calvin-klein-oscars.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Why Saoirse Ronan\u2019s Pink Calvin Klein Oscars Dress Is Already Iconic"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
