Though the cause of death is still unknown, People reports that it is not believed to be related to storm chasing.\n\nFellow storm chasers and acquaintances are posting painful remembrances of the friend they lost so unexpectedly.\n\nRIP my best friend and storm chasing partner, Joel Taylor. I am shocked and absolutely devastated by the loss of my incredible, caring friend. We chased so many intense storms, and I wish we could have just one more storm chase. I'll miss you forever, Joel. We lost a legend pic.twitter.com/htN45t8wik \u2014 Reed Timmer (@ReedTimmerAccu) January 24, 2018\n\n\"I am shocked and absolutely devastated by the loss of my incredible, caring friend,\" Taylor's storm-chasing partner and pal Reed Timmer wrote. \"We chased so many intense storms, and I wish we could have just one more storm chase. I'll miss you forever, Joel. We lost a legend.\"\n\nIn addition to Storm Chasers, Taylor and Timmer also costarred in the 2003 documentary Tornado Glory and the TVNweather.com series Tornado Chasers. Taylor hailed from Oklahoma (part of Tornado Alley, where all three were filmed), specifically the town of Elk City.\n\n\"Our community of Elk City and the Storm Chasing community lost a great guy today,\" a local Facebook page, Team Western OK Chaser, wrote. \"Joel Taylor was truly an inspiration to myself and many who knew him. He was one of the most level headed chasers on the roads and truly a classy guy outside of chasing. He didn't chase for the glory he chased because he had a true passion for storms.\"\n\nI was lucky enough to meet Joel a few years ago at Reed\u2019s wedding. He was so kind to me and we got to hang out for a bit during those few days. I snapped this photo of him and that just seemed like who he was. A huge smile. RIP Joel Taylor\u2026you will be so missed. pic.twitter.com/mZI5eHzhKG \u2014 Mike Olbinski (@MikeOlbinski) January 24, 2018\n\nAnother friend, filmmaker, photographer, and storm chaser Mike Olbinski recalled Taylor's \"huge smile.\"\n\n\"I'm heartbroken to hear of the passing of Joel Taylor,\" meteorologist Jim Cantore of The Weather Channel show Atmospheres tweeted, adding that \"his passion for tornadoes was infectious.\"\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken to hear of the passing of Joel Taylor. My heart goes out to his parents. Long before his Discovery fame, Joel and his parents accompanied us on a trip to Hawaii while we taped our show Atmosphere\u2019s.
