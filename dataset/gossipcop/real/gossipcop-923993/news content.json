That is what the E! series The Arrangement examines through the multi-layered Hollywood love story of Kyle (Josh Henderson), one of the world\u2019s biggest movie stars, and Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista), a talented young actress who gets more than she bargained for when she auditions for the female lead in Kyle\u2019s next movie.\n\nThe connection is instantaneous between the two, but before their relationship can proceed, Megan must sign a contract that was created by the Institute of The Higher Mind \u2018s (IHM ) leader Terence Anderson (Michael Vartan), a self-help organization of which Kyle is the most famous member.\n\nAs Season 2 comes to its close \u2014 only two more episodes remain \u2014 Megan has found out some disturbing news about Kyle that could put a monkey wrench in their wedding plans.\n\nParade.com spoke to Vartan about the dark tone the series has taken, who he thinks Terence really is, how far Terence will go to keep IHM on top, how real he feels the series reflects what actually happens in Hollywood, and more.\n\nLast season was about Kyle and Megan falling in love and there was a little bit of darkness with what Megan had to go through at Terence\u2019s hand, but this season feels so much darker. Do you see that?\n\nAbsolutely. Season 1 was, as you said, very much about establishing the characters. Last year when we were doing prep, the basic storyline was The Arrangement is a love story with Hollywood as a backdrop and, obviously, there are a lot of nefarious characters behind the scenes doing a lot of bad things. But at the core, you\u2019re absolutely right. It was the story of Kyle and Megan and if their relationship will survive in spite of all the forces at play.\n\nWhereas in Season 2, they are enmeshed and entangled together in a way that to get out of that situation would be very complicated for both of them. Now, of course, the stakes are much higher and people\u2019s boundaries are being pushed to the limits of their ability to deal with. As an actor, it\u2019s certainly more fun to play dark stuff. I\u2019ve always heard playing the bad guy is so much more fun and, in my career, I\u2019ve never really had a chance to do so, so I was very happy with the direction of Season 2.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ve learned a lot about Kyle\u2019s background and Megan\u2019s background, but not so much Terence. What can you reveal about his backstory that led him to become this very controlling leader of IHM?\n\nHis actual childhood, I don\u2019t know anything about. I suspect we would reveal some of that if we\u2019re lucky enough to have a third season. Actually, there\u2019s a funny story. We were shooting a scene in Season 1 and Lexa Doig, who plays Deann, Terence\u2019s wife, said something about my parents. And Terence\u2019s line was, \u201cLeave my parents out of this, okay?\u201d So I went to Jonathan Abrahams, our showrunner, creator, our guru, and I said, \u201cJonathan, what does this mean?\u201d And he just looked at me and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know if he said that to me because he was withholding information and wanted to reveal it at a later time, or maybe he just really didn\u2019t know, but at that time the line seemed very apropos, mysterious and weird, so I went with it.\n\nWe don\u2019t know much about Terence\u2019s childhood, but we know that he\u2019s a failed actor. He wanted to be an actor when he was young. He taught an acting class, obviously, before he started IHM. That\u2019s where he met Kyle, and, I think, early on in his life when he first started IHM, he had nothing but the best intentions at heart. He really wanted to make the world a better place and help people improve themselves, and as the Institute grew, and more money came in, and Kyle became the most famous movie star in the world and being the face of the Institute, and attracting more influential people, I think Terence lost his north a little bit and succumbed to corruption, fame, money, and all the things that we read about in the newspapers.\n\nThe female cop that Terence made Kyle sleep with is back. So it looks like there may be something else going to happen there. How far will Terence go to cement his success? He had to practically blackmail Kyle to spend the night with her.\n\nAbsolutely, and I\u2019ll be honest with you, when I read that scene last year, I had to do a double take and think to myself, \u201cIs this real? Is this really happening?\u201d It was so extreme. I talked to Jonathan about it and he explained to me the reason for that scene. In a weird way, it wasn\u2019t only for the story and plot lines, but was to show that Terence really does love Kyle. There\u2019s a weird big brother/younger brother, father/son relationship. Their relationship is very complex.\n\nThere\u2019s jealousy on Terence\u2019s part because Kyle has become what Terence wanted to be when he was younger, but I think that scene clearly illustrates that Terence will stop at nothing to safeguard the Institute. So if you were to ask Terence: Kyle, Deann, their dog if, they had a dog, or the Institute, which one comes first? It\u2019s clear to me that Terence will always choose the Institute over anyone.\n\nI love playing Terence because that, to me, is what makes him so interesting. On the one hand you have this guy who is trying to help people better themselves and become better people, but conversely, he\u2019s more than happy to murder someone who gets in the way of his plans. It\u2019s this really weird dichotomy of a human being who\u2019s clearly very flawed, very conflicted, not necessarily a good person at all, but also does have a human side and that\u2019s one of the things I try to focus on in playing Terence.\n\nIf I played him just as the bad guy, it\u2019s not very interesting. Every time I read an episode, I look for something that makes me feel like, \u201cOh, poor Terence. If only his mother had held his hand a little more or something.\u201d\n\nSo what was interesting about the cop showing up when she did is that Kyle and Megan had just applied for their marriage license and the wedding\u2019s supposed to be in a couple of weeks. This woman could blow up everything, and if she blows up the wedding, I think Kyle would turn on Terence. It\u2019s a small scene, but it seems like it\u2019s so pivotal.\n\nIt is pivotal and I\u2019m not going to give anything away, but Detective Gaffey (Tracy Waterhouse) is going to have a big role to play and an influence on certain decisions that Terence has to make.\n\nYou\u2019ve just mentioned Terence\u2019s problem. I think he\u2019s not 100 percent certain that if Kyle were to leave the Institute that the Institute would survive. The Institute certainly has grown to the point it could possibly stand on its own two legs, but without Kyle, it\u2019s a different animal. Let\u2019s be honest, Terernce loves Kyle to a certain extent, but his need to keep Kyle in the Institute is purely for selfish reasons.\n\nSo Terence has to be very careful with Kyle and how he handles him because, as you said, if Kyle were to find out that Terence was the reason his marriage fails or some movie that was greenlit all of a sudden didn\u2019t go and it was Terence\u2019s fault, Kyle could easily turn on him and that would not be good for good old Terence.\n\nTerence isn\u2019t completely na\u00efve about it. He is trying to groom other people and not put all his apples in Kyle\u2019s basket, but so far nothing has taken.\n\nThe way I play Terence in my head, he sees himself as always the most intelligent person in the room. His ego is the biggest ego in the room always. He clearly is an absolute control freak, but from an outside perspective, I think he\u2019s becoming a little bit untethered without him necessarily realizing it, and he\u2019s losing his grip on certain things. I think he\u2019s trying to find what to hold onto. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really clear on that yet.\n\nHe still has issues with Megan, obviously. She still is this albatross around his neck. I don\u2019t think he knows how deep her hatred and how far her intent is in destroying IHM . He definitely knows that she wants nothing more than to leave the Institute and take Kyle with her. He doesn\u2019t know that Megan wants to destroy the Institute. He just thinks that she wants Kyle out of there and never see Terence again.\n\nSo, on one side, he\u2019s very much in control and aware of many things, but also very oblivious to certain things that are right under his nose. I won\u2019t give anything away that happens later on at the end of this season, but Terence and Deann\u2019s relationship is going to go through a major shift shall we say.\n\nRight. Well, he wants her to have the baby now when he never has before. I am not sure if that is a control thing because he thinks he might be losing her, or does he really want an heir to take over IHM?\n\nIf we\u2019re being honest, Terence has no interest in having a child with Deann so they can have a cute little family, the white picket fence, get a dog and go to the farmer\u2019s market on Sunday with a stroller. He literally wants an heir to the throne. He\u2019s interested in legacy and, as he says in the scene, someone who can carry his vision forward once he\u2019s gone. That obviously comes from an incredibly narcissistic and egotistical place.\n\nIt\u2019s not a loving gesture of, \u201cOh, my God, we were wrong Deann. Back in the day, we should have tried.\u201d The way in which he presents the scenario to Deann is very, \u201cWe could have a beautiful child. We would raise this amazing human being.\u201d What he\u2019s actually internally thinking is, \u201cPlease have a child with me. I need someone to take over the Institute once I\u2019m dead because Kyle\u2019s not going to do it.\u201d Deann is the ace in the hole. She\u2019s the wild card in all this. She\u2019s possibly the strongest character on the show in terms of her resolve and her backbone, so she\u2019s certainly not going to take anything laying down.\n\nDo you, Michael, see IHM as a cult?\n\nNo, I don\u2019t actually. I see it as a weird institute only because Terence is the head of it and he\u2019s just such a weird guy. He\u2019s got, obviously, a lot of issues and for someone with that mental makeup be the head of a self-help group is a little strange.\n\nIf you remove Terence from the equation, I see it just as a place where people can come to try and maybe shed some baggage from their past, or take a step forward into a new future and better themselves. I really don\u2019t see it as a cult because throughout the story, Terence has had people taken to the \u201cfacility,\u201d but that\u2019s reserved for people who can play a major positive or negative aspect in his life. It\u2019s not as though everyone who signs up for IHM has to abide by all of these crazy rules and contracts. I think the average IHM goer has a pretty normal self-help experience when they go to IHM.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because he\u2019s putting people through all this, but he\u2019s not trained in any way.\n\nBut he\u2019s the smartest human being on earth. At least he thinks he is.\n\nNo, you\u2019re right. That is interesting and Jonathan and I talked about that. One of the things we talked about, this is before we even shot the pilot, is that Terence is actually a very incredibly intelligent person and he does have a very keen sense of and understanding of the human psyche, psychology and the emotional inner workings of people. You see it in the show.\n\nTerence is able to absorb certain emotional or every day catastrophes and digest them a lot better than other people, and, I think, it\u2019s because he really does have a superior understanding of human nature in general.\n\nWhen he first started IHM, along the way he\u2019s learned more about what he\u2019s preaching and, obviously, learned things about himself and how to help other people, but that\u2019s actually a really good point you make. He does not have any formal training as a psychiatrist or a psychologist, so it\u2019s interesting that he went from being a failed actor to acting teacher to self-help group. You\u2019ve got to love TV, right?\n\nThe show is grounded in reality enough for me. I know that contracts exist in the lives of the very famous and I know that there\u2019s this penchant in Hollywood for people to go to self-help organizations. Do you see that there\u2019s enough grounding in reality that that\u2019s why it feels real to people?\n\nI think so. We definitely take some creative license and push the envelope a little bit to juice it up and make it fun for the audience, but I do think there\u2019s definitely many aspects of the show that are grounded in reality. I\u2019ve been in this business for 30 years. Very few of my friends are in the business. Very few of my friends are actors. It\u2019s just not an industry that interests me outside of the work if you will, so I\u2019ve never heard of any proof of contract marriages, but I am absolutely sure that they happen.\n\nI agree with you. I think maybe one of the reasons people in Hollywood are attracted to all these self-help groups is that come on, who wants to be an actor? I mean, who wants to pretend to be someone else for the rest of their life? Someone with some psychological scars I would assume, so it stands to reason that a lot of actors are in therapy or in self-help groups. I certainly was in therapy when I was a teenager, so I think they go hand-in-hand.\n\nAnd I think if you remove the glitz and the glamour and the TMZs and all that stuff, at the core, acting is an art and artists are historically, not everyone obviously, but artists are historically very feeling people, very conflicted people. People who feel both good and bad very deeply, so along with that comes having to find a way to emotionally deal with these things, so hence I think self-help, at times, is necessary.\n\nThe
