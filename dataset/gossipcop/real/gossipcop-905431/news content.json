So much so, in fact, that the British actor proposed to his wife, art curator Gisele Schmidt, in character.\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Oldman, 59, confirmed to the late night host that he had indeed popped the question while on set for the Joe Wright-helmed film released in November 2017.\n\n\u201cThere was a break in the filming, and we had talked about it and I just felt the urge,\u201d the actor told Kimmel. \u201cWe were down in the war rooms, and I took her into the map room. And as Winston Churchill, I said \u2018Will you marry me?'\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s romantic moment didn\u2019t last long, however. Oldman explained that almost immediately following his life-changing question, he was called back on-set to shoot the next scene. \u201cSo you did not get the chance to consummate as Winston Churchill?\u201d Kimmel asked jokingly. A flustered Oldman turned beet red and smiled sheepishly.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you should say that,\u201d the actor said, \u201cbecause my wife has often said she went to bed with Winston Churchill but woke up with Gary Oldman.\u201d\n\nThe couple first went public at Milan Men\u2019s Fashion Week in June 2015. They married in August 2017, at the Beverly Hills home of his friend and manager Doug Urbanski in front of several dozen friends. Asked in an interview later to confirm his rumored marriage, Oldman said he and Schmidt had opted to get married \u201cquietly.\u201d\n\nThis is the actor\u2019s fifth marriage, after ending his marriage to his fourth wife, Alexandra Edenborough, in 2015.", "images": ["https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cec381d2-93e9-4201-9271-30f51f4fec94~rs_200.h", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gary-Oldman-Gisele-Schmidt-1500.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-the-knot-news-logo@2x.png", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brittany-Tyler-Couch-Story-Lead-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Questions-About-How-Coronavirus-Could-Affect-Your-Wedding_-Read-This-LEAD-shutterstock-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2127-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89960078_664744544273850_2656838980867194880_o-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1554396644-120x67.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gary-Oldman-Gisele-Schmidt-1500.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.theknotnews.com/gary-oldman-proposed-wife-winston-churchill-25902", "title": "Gary Oldman Proposed to His Wife While Dressed as Winston Churchill", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The \u2018Darkest Hour\u2019 actor said he was immediately called to do a scene after his proposal", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gary Oldman Proposed to His Wife While Dressed as Winston Churchill", "description": "The \u2018Darkest Hour\u2019 actor said he was immediately called to do a scene after his proposal", "url": "https://www.theknotnews.com/gary-oldman-proposed-wife-winston-churchill-25902", "site_name": "The Knot News", "updated_time": "2018-01-11T20:53:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gary-Oldman-Gisele-Schmidt-1500.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gary-Oldman-Gisele-Schmidt-1500.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1200}}, "article": {"tag": "secret celebrity weddings", "section": "Celebrity", "published_time": "2018-01-11T20:45:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-11T20:53:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "The \u2018Darkest Hour\u2019 actor said he was immediately called to do a scene after his proposal", "title": "Gary Oldman Proposed to His Wife While Dressed as Winston Churchill", "image": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gary-Oldman-Gisele-Schmidt-1500.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.8", "wp-parsely_version": "2.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.xoedge.com/patterns/images/windows-tile-144x144.png", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://static.xoedge.com/patterns/images/windows-tile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://static.xoedge.com/patterns/images/windows-tile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://static.xoedge.com/patterns/images/windows-tile-310x310.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#6CC6F0"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pNOCzV5jG0"], "publish_date": 1515703506.0, "source": "https://www.theknotnews.com", "summary": ""}
