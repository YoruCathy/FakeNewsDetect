Gail Simmons has welcomed her second child \u2013 a baby boy. The Top Chef star announced the news with a sweet photo of the newborn on Monday, May 28.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s here! And he\u2019s a keeper. Please excuse the social media silence but I\u2019ve been busy ogling this little guy who barreled into our lives Wednesday morning,\u201d Simmons, 42, captioned the Instagram pic. \u201cThank you friends far and wide for all your love and support. So far it\u2019s been beautiful chaos. #mamaoftwo.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly confirmed in December 2017 that Simmons and her husband, Jeremy Abrams, were expanding their family. They are already parents of daughter Dahlia Rae, 4.\n\nBack in March, Simmons admitted that having another child wasn\u2019t \u201ca cut-and-dry decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve loved the last four years with Dahlia, so it was a big move to consider going from one to two kids,\u201d she said during an interview with HATCHland at the time. \u201cOnce we decided, it took a minute, as I\u2019ve never been the person that could sneeze and get pregnant. I\u2019m so grateful to be having our baby, but I\u2019m cognizant of how it\u2019s going to change our lives and the systems we have in place.\u201d\n\nSimmons and Abrams tied the knot in 2008.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/454060768_gail-simmons-jeremy-abrams-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/454060768_gail-simmons-jeremy-abrams-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/454060768_gail-simmons-jeremy-abrams-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/top-chefs-gail-simmons-gives-birth-welcomes-second-child/", "title": "Top Chef\u2019s Gail Simmons Gives Birth, Welcomes Second Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "A family of four!
