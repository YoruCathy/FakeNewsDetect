Not only have I had to change my diet, I\u2019ve had to change the way that I work out\u2014the way that I live.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe 52-year-old Biggest Loser trainer recounts the dizzy spells he had been experiencing weeks prior to collapsing at a New York City gym on that fateful day. \u201cWhat I should have done was seen a doctor immediately,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a workout nut, so I\u2019m used to being uncomfortable, I\u2019m used to being in pain. So I did something that\u2019s so dumb\u2014I learned how to adjust. It was not smart on my part.\u201d\n\nBut what a difference a year makes. Here, the author and television personality shares the five ways he has transformed his health\u2014and his life\u2014from the inside out.\n\nHe is embracing carbs.\n\nHarper, who is currently a health contributor on TODAY and a frequent co-host of the Racheal Ray Show, was consuming a high-protein, high-fat diet prior to his heart attack. \u201cI was healthy, I was fit, I was strong, I watched what I ate. But now I realized that what my diet was lacking\u2014maybe I don\u2019t want to say lacking, but how it was different\u2014was that it didn\u2019t have balance,\u201d he explains.\n\nSt. Martin's Press\n\nThe missing component: Carbohydrates. After all, he was well-aware that cutting out carbs typically results in rapid weight loss. \u201cYet what I\u2019ve found for longevity, it\u2019s very hard for a lot of people to sustain that type of diet.\u201d Today, his meal plan \u201cleans more on the Mediterranean-style\u201d with a focus on plant-based foods, including more fruits and vegetables, as well as whole-grains. \u201cThere are so many great pastas out there, like red lentil, chickpea pasta, and quinoa pasta,\u201d he adds. \u201cI like being able to eat a sandwich and not feel like I\u2019ve committed a cardinal sin!\u201d\n\nAnd yes, it is possible to shed unwanted pounds\u2014and keep them off\u2014on this regime, which is the premise of his latest book, . \u201cI think the biggest thing people are going to learn from my book is I want to press the reset button,\u201d explains Harper. \u201cI think there have been a lot of very lopsided, extreme diets for the last couple of decades. I want to put balance back onto your plate\u2014and get you to lose weight, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to do\u2014with protein, fats, and carbohydrates so you can not only do this diet, but have it be a way of life. Balance in every aspect of my life\u2014especially now\u2014is super important.\u201d\n\nHe has said goodbye to intense workouts.\n\nThis longtime CrossFit enthusiast admits that modifying his fitness routine was not an easy adjustment. \u201cI was the guy who was posting these workouts of myself in the gym doing these really crazy things, but I\u2019m not able to do that anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve cut myself slack, which is a new thing for me.\u201d\n\nHe labels his current workouts as mid-intensity with a longer time domain, \u201cmeaning I\u2019m working out a little longer to condition more heart, to keep my heart rate up\u2014that\u2019s what I learned in my cardiac rehab,\u201d continues Harper. \u201cThey want me to keep my heart rate up for about 30 to 45 minutes, but not too intense.\u201d\n\nPlus, he\u2019s added other forms of exercise to his lifestyle. \u201cI walk a lot with my dogs [Karl and Vivienne] here in the city [New York City], I\u2019m doing a lot of yoga, and I\u2019ve been wanting to incorporate boxing\u2014that\u2019s my challenge for 2018.\u201d And he\u2019s no longer sweating it out every single day (he averages about five days a week). \u201cI used to be very regimented\u2014I knew how I was going to work out on Monday, I knew what I was going to do every day following. But now it\u2019s a little more relaxed.\u201d\n\nHe takes time each day to focus on inner calmness.\n\nA three-time New York Times bestselling author, Harper regularly practices transcendental meditation (TM), which involves silently repeating a mantra in order to place your body in a state of profound rest and allow your mind to achieve a sense of peace, as defined by the Mayo Clinic. \u201cTM, yoga, and my dogs really help me with managing my stress,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cI tell people you have to find whatever it is in your life that you can do to turn off the white noise, just for a few minutes. If it means sitting with your phone off for five or ten minutes and not having to focus on anyone or anything\u2014 those things are so good for you. It helps your brain, it helps your body.\u201d\n\nHe is living in the moment.\n\nAnother similar lesson Harper has learned over the last year is to be present in the present. He recalls suffering from depression and an identity crisis early in his recovery since his only goal was to hit the gym hard once again.\n\nBob Harper on Biggest Loser, season 17. Getty Images\n\n\u201cI felt like beating my fist up again the wall because I wasn\u2019t able to do it,\u201d he confesses. \u201cAll I wanted to do in my recovery was get back to work and what I thought was normal again\u2026 I was the fitness guy\u2014I went to the gym for social, I went to the gym for fitness, I went for stress, I went for all these things. And when my doctors took that away from me after my heart attack, I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nYet he discovered that \u201cthe universe had a way of self-adjusting\u201d his perspective on life. \u201cI understand now that I\u2019m more than just the fitness guy\u2014I\u2019m more than that,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd that was kind of liberating to come to that conclusion.\u201d Today, he relies on a special piece of jewelry that encourages him to be mindful. \u201cI have this bracelet that I wear all the time that says, \u2018Be Here Now.\u2019 It\u2019s that touchstone that says, \u2018Okay, I can\u2019t stress about the big things or the small things.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe leans on his medical team.\n\nPrior to February 2017, Harper would head to the doctor\u2019s office for a routine physical exam every now and then. \u201cI didn\u2019t see doctors very much and I would kind of get nervous when I\u2019d go to the doctor,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now, I\u2019m very comforted by having a doctor. I\u2019m working with a team of doctors that have become a part of my life that are guiding me through this new journey.\u201d\n\nSomething else that is also \u201ccompletely new\u201d for him is taking medication. \u201cOne of the things that was a really big wake-up call for me after I had a heart attack was when my doctors told me I\u2019d be more likely to have another heart attack within the first year,\u201d states Harper. \u201cI said, \u2018Okay, you tell me what I need to do.\u2019\u201d He was instructed to leave the hospital with BRILINTA, a prescription drug for heart attack treatment. Today, Harper is working with AstraZeneca, the company that distributes the med. \u201cTeaming up with them has been very personal for me because I am a heart attack survivor. It was such an organic fit.\u201d\n\nAnd he hopes his experience will inspire others to establish a relationship with their physician. \u201dI remember Savanah Guthrie from the TODAY show reached out to me and said, \u2018When I heard this happened to you, I immediately went to my doctor,\u2019\u201d he concludes. \u201cI thought that was so powerful because I want people to be proactive. I don\u2019t want you to just look in the mirror and say, \u2018Damn, I look good.\u2019 I want you to be able to see your doctor and make sure that you are good.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=1.00xw:0.832xh;0,0.0347xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/16/20/2560x1280/landscape-1463421965-gettyimages-461491920.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/51/2560x1280/1513878899-landscape-1513877370-gettyimages-857999162.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/11/768x384/1489770946-landscape-1489162048-screen-shot-2017-03-10-at-110705-am.png?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=1.00xw:0.832xh;0,0.0347xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Capetta", "Amy Capetta Has Been Writing Health", "Lifestyle Articles For Over Years."], "canonical_link": "https://www.womansday.com/health-fitness/a18535968/bob-harper-heart-attack-lessons/", "title": "Bob Harper Post-Heart Attack Workout Routine and Diet", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Woman's Day", "title": "One Year After His Near-Fatal Heart Attack, Bob Harper Has Made Some Major Life Changes", "description": "\"Balance in every aspect of my life &mdash; especially now &mdash; is super important.\"", "url": "https://www.womansday.com/health-fitness/a18535968/bob-harper-heart-attack-lessons/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=1.00xw:0.832xh;0,0.0347xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 189409181375, "pages": 23369976782}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/womansdaymagazine", "modified_time": "2019-10-22 09:27:33", "published_time": "2018-02-25 01:13:00", "section": "Health + Fitness", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WomansDay", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=1.00xw:0.832xh;0,0.0347xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "88OheVwz361qAoXqcBWp3eud94wa7HYEcEEydEZZZRk", "title": "Bob Harper Post-Heart Attack Workout Routine and Diet", "description": "One year after experiencing a near-fatal heart attack, Biggest Loser trainer Bob Harper opens up to Woman's Day about the major changes he's made to his diet, workout routine, and more.", "keywords": "bob harper, biggest loser, heart attack, bob harper diet, bob harper workout, what is bob harper doing now, bob harper after heart attack", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=0.604xw:1.00xh;0.199xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Health + Fitness,health-fitness", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-25T01:13:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=1.00xw:0.832xh;0,0.0347xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-24-at-7-57-54-pm-1519520423.png?crop=0.604xw:1.00xh;0.199xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "One Year After His Near-Fatal Heart Attack, Bob Harper Has Made Some Major Life Changes", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519492380.0, "source": "https://www.womansday.com", "summary": ""}
