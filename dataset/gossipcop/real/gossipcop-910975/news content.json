The Spring 2018 range, their fourth one together, includes track-inspired designs, like the black and white check, color-blocked leather jackets, and, of course, fingerless driving gloves.\n\nThe model and designer aren't the first to be inspired by speed; other brands like Rihanna's Fenty x Puma, Dior, and Ralph Lauren incorporated similar athletic elements in their Spring 2018 collections, which hit the runway last fall. Hadid and Hilfiger's renditions, however, stay true to the brand's red, white, and blue color palette. It will also launch on February 25, the same day the clothes hit the runway at Milan Fashion Week.\n\nBefore dabbling in driver-friendly fashion, Tommy x Gigi's previously channeled nautical inspirations, western influences, and rock 'n' roll aesthetics in earlier collections.\n\nThis will mark Tommy x Gigi's first time showing in Italy, following previous presentations in New York, Los Angeles, and London. At this point, the star-studded runway shows have evolved into full-blown runway extravaganzas. Last season's \"Rock Circus\" was set in a stadium-like venue in London and featured aerial dancers and acrobats. The Chainsmokers also performed.\n\n\"It\u2019s about the fusion of fashion, entertainment and pop culture with experiences, performances and inspiring interactions that are designed around our consumers. As one of the fashion capitals of the world, Milan is the perfect place to celebrate our next TOMMYNOW show,\" Hilfiger said in a statement about his next venue. We're sure the upcoming presentation will be even more epic than the first three.\n\nThe countdown to February 25 starts now.
