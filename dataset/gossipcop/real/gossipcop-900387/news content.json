Fisher passed away in December 2016 after suffering a heart attack, but had reportedly already finished filming her scenes for Episode VIII at the time of her death.\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi begins with the Leia-led Resistance making a mad dash to evade the encroaching forces of the First Order. Unfortunately, in the midst of their escape, Leia\u2019s ship is hit by a blast that destroys its entire command center. For a few minutes, it seems as though that will be the last we see of her. But then Leia appears on-screen again, drifting through the galaxy. She reaches out her hand and \u2014 using her connection to the Force\u2014 manages to fly through space back to the Resistance fleet.\n\nRead More: John Boyega Is a Star of His Own Making\n\nThe general is unconscious for the majority of the rest of The Last Jedi as she recovers from her ordeal. But, of course, at the Resistance\u2019s greatest moment of need, she wakes up ready to command. Leia gets a heartwarming reunion with her twin brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) \u2014 or at least his Force projection \u2014 and seems to pass the torch of leadership to Poe (Oscar Isaac).\n\nIn Leia\u2019s final scene, she boards the Millennium Falcon with Rey (Daisy Ridley) \u2014 both seeming to know that Luke is gone \u2014 to fly off into the galaxy once again. When the credits roll, a dedication to the late Fisher appears on-screen: \u201cIn loving memory of our princess, Carrie Fisher.\u201d\n\nAlthough there were rumors that Fisher\u2019s role in The Last Jedi would be changed to account for her absence in Episode IX, director Rian Johnson has said that he didn\u2019t alter the movie at all. \u201cI felt very strongly that we don\u2019t try to change her performance,\u201d he told the New York Times in September. \u201cWe don\u2019t adjust what happens to her in this movie. Emotionally, you can\u2019t help recontextualize it, now that she\u2019s gone. It\u2019s almost eerie how there are scenes that have an emotional resonance and a meaning, especially now. She gives a beautiful and complete performance in this film.\u201d\n\nDisney has also stated that there will be no computer-generated version of Leia in Episode IX like there was in Rogue One. \u201cWe had to deal with tragedy at the end of 2016,\u201d said Disney CEO Bob Iger during a March talk at the University of Southern California. \u201cCarrie appears throughout VIII. We are not changing VIII to deal with her passing. Her performance remains as it is in VIII. In Rogue One, we had some digital character. We are not doing that with Carrie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any intention of beginning a trend of re-creating actors who are gone,\u201d Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy reiterated to Vanity Fair in May.\n\nConsidering Leia\u2019s storyline was left pretty open-ended, it\u2019s unclear how Episode IX director J.J. Abrams will deal with tying up the loose ends. All we can ask is that it does Fisher justice.\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
