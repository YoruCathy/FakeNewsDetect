Both were young Jewish actors who often competed for the same roles. They shared a first name and even a favorite number, sort of. Haim\u2019s was 222. Feldman\u2019s was 22.\n\nAs they spoke, it became clear that they also shared horrific histories of abuse.\n\nHaim confided in his new friend that on the set of the 1986 film \u201cLucas,\u201d \u201can adult male convinced him that it was perfectly normal for older men and younger boys in the business to have sexual relations, that it was what all the guys do. So they walked off to a secluded area between two trailers . . . and Haim allowed himself to be sodomized.\u201d\n\nHaim then followed this shocking tale with a question.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d he said to his new bestie. \u201cI guess we should play around like that, too?\u201d\n\nThe Meal Ticket\n\nIn \u201cCoreyography,\u201d Feldman \u2014 one of Hollywood\u2019s top child actors in the 1980s with hits like \u201cStand By Me,\u201d \u201cThe Lost Boys,\u201d \u201cGremlins\u201d and \u201cThe Goonies\u201d \u2014 shares tales of his own abuse at the hands of trusted adults throughout his Hollywood experience.\n\nAlong the way, he recounts his often twisted friendship with Haim \u2014 the two spent their teen years partying and living with their molesters (and no, Feldman writes, he did not take Haim up on his suggestion) \u2014 as well as his friendship with Michael Jackson, which, in a sign of how screwed up Feldman\u2019s life was, served as one of his healthiest and most supportive relationships.\n\nFeldman\u2019s troubles began at home. His mother, Sheila, was a former Playboy model with severe depression and drug issues, and his father, Bob, had been in a post-hit version of \u201960s one-hit wonders Strawberry Alarm Clock and only seemed to care about his son when they were getting high together.\n\nSheila began telling Feldman how flawed he was at age 4, when she dyed his hair blond, saying, \u201cYou were supposed to be blond.\u201d She also tortured him about his weight, calling him fat and eventually force-feeding him diet pills.\n\nWhen she caught him sneaking two cookies when he was 5, she made him stand facing a wall for an hour, then went off, Feldman writes, on an insane verbal rant.\n\n\u201cYou have no right to disrespect me like this . . . you ungrateful s \u2013 \u2013 t,\u201d she railed before somehow segueing to, \u201cDo you realize that most women would die to look like this after two kids? Look at these t \u2013 \u2013 s,\u201d she said, cupping her breasts toward him.\n\nBy the time he was 7, Feldman was working as a commercial actor and was relied on as the family bread-winner. He was banned from ever riding a bicycle because, his mother told him, he couldn\u2019t afford to be injured. \u201cYou have responsibilities now,\u201d she said.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the starved-for-love Feldman began acting out on-set and became regarded by some as a brat. When he was fired from a TV movie, his mother forced him to remove his clothes as she reached for \u201ca long wooden dowel . . . [that acted] as a window stop.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018How could you f \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 ing do this to me?\u2019 she screams. She is out of control, wild-eyed, like an animal. Her face is bright red and blotchy, her cheeks are streaked with mascara. \u2018You know I need this f \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 ing money. I will kill you. I will f \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 ing kill you, you worthless piece of s \u2013 \u2013 t.\u201d\n\nFeldman tried to hide under his little brother\u2019s crib as his mother shoved the dowel toward him.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s bent at the waist, ramming the pole under the cotton eyelet dust ruffle . . . jabbing at my ribs, my arms, my face,\u201d he writes. \u201cMy skin is raw and bleeding. I think that, maybe, she is serious. She really does want to kill me. Then everything goes black.\u201d\n\nLater that week, she taunts him further.\n\n\u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you.\u2019 My mother delivers this line in a sing-song cadence, like she\u2019s suggesting we go to a picnic, or make balloon animals, or fly a kite in Chatsworth Park. \u2018On Saturday,\u2019 she says, with a wink.\u201d\n\nNights with \u2018Ron\u2019\n\nWith such turmoil at home, Feldman sought relief on Hollywood soundstages, where he could interact with other like-minded kids and hopefully be around genuine adult role models. But while Steven Spielberg, who hired him for the first time for \u201cGremlins,\u201d and director Richard Donner became trusted and supportive friends, most of the adults he met did him harm.\n\nHis father, who managed him for a time, hired an assistant in his early 20s who Feldman calls \u201cRon.\u201d Ron struck up an instant friendship with Feldman, who writes, \u201cIt was almost eerie how similar we were. It was as if he had studied me and was copying my every move.\u201d\n\nRon was soon spending all his time with Feldman, taking him out on the town and turning him on to new drugs. One night, after taking a concoction of pills \u201cthat Ron had made up,\u201d the woozy teenager felt a hand on his thigh. Ron asked if it was OK and wound up having oral sex with the \u201cpetrified\u201d and \u201crevolted\u201d Feldman, who was frightened of a confrontation and of alienating his new close friend.\n\nThis twisted relationship lasted for years. With none of his family members there for him, Feldman formed relationships with any adults who reached out, and in numerous instances, these men turned out to be pedophiles. In one especially sad aside, he reflects on a picture he took at his 15th birthday party and notes that in the photo, he and Haim were flanked by five of them.\n\n\u201cSlowly, over a period of many years,\u201d he writes, \u201cI would begin to realize that many of the people I had surrounded myself with were monsters.\u201d\n\nIt got so bad that after fleeing Ron\u2019s clutches one night only to have another adult male friend attempt to molest him right after, he escaped to the only safe and friendly place he knew.\n\n\u201cI was shattered, disgusted, devastated. I needed some normalcy in my life. So, I called Michael Jackson,\u201d he writes. \u201cMichael Jackson\u2019s world, crazy as it sounds, had become my happy place. Being with Michael brought me back to my innocence. When I was with Michael, it was like being 10 years old again.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, his friendship with Jackson \u2014 who, he makes very clear, never touched him sexually or even tried to \u2014 includes some of the book\u2019s lightest passages.\n\nIntroduced by mutual friend Spielberg, the two became close friends, and Feldman got to know Jackson\u2019s playful side. When they spoke on the phone, Jackson would put on voices, including \u201can imitation of what sounded like an uptight, conservative Caucasian, not unlike [when] Dave Chappelle . . . pretends to be white.\u201d\n\nThe pair confided in each other about their respective childhood traumas, with Feldman noting that even then, Jackson was \u201cstill absolutely terrified of his father.\u201d\n\nAnd when they decided to take a trip to Disneyland, Feldman discovered that Jackson kept a secret penthouse apartment on Wilshire Boulevard in Westwood, for the sole purpose of housing the many disguises he used when going out in public.\n\nSadly, the friendship ended in 2001, when Jackson heard a rumor that Feldman was planning to trash him in a book. Despite Feldman\u2019s adamant denials, Jackson shut him out, and the two never spoke again.\n\nCorey Gone Wild\n\nFar sadder was his friendship with Haim, a brotherhood bonded by terrors. From that first meeting, when Feldman had to explain to his new friend that having sex with grown men was \u201cnot what kids do, man,\u201d the two shared their best and worst moments.\n\nPublicly, they made nine films and starred in one TV series, the reality show \u201cThe Two Coreys,\u201d together and had their partying antics heavily documented in the press. But privately, these antics were driven by the darkest of secrets.\n\nFrom early on, whenever they hung out, Haim would beg Feldman to find him someone to have sex with, harping endlessly on, \u201cI need a girl. I need a girl right now. Can you call a girl for me? Come on, man. I just need somebody to take care of me.\u201d\n\nOne time, Haim was so horny that he again tried to hook up with Feldman. Wanting to deflect his attention, Feldman writes, he referred Haim to a man he refers to as Tony Burnham who he knew had a crush on Haim, and Burnham became in Haim\u2019s life similar to what Ron was in Feldman\u2019s.\n\nThe boys\u2019 lives became so deranged that when Feldman\u2019s father kicked him out of the house, the only person Feldman had to turn to was Burnham, and he rationalized it because \u201che was the only person in my immediate circle who wasn\u2019t molesting me.\u201d\n\nFeldman\u2019s cocaine use, which began when he once found his mother\u2019s stash, found him snorting an eight ball \u2014 an eighth of an ounce \u2014 every two days, a habit helped along by his new friendship with comedy party monster Sam Kinison. Together, the two smoked bales of weed in Feldman\u2019s trailer, and were \u201chaving regular coke-off challenges, daring each other to see who can stay up the longest, who can do the most rails.\u201d\n\nIn the ensuing years, Haim spiraled hard, even once being caught asking high-school students where he could buy crack.\n\nHis career in tatters, Haim rehabbed and relapsed several times, and died of pneumonia in 2010 at age 38.\n\nHell of Child Stars\n\nFeldman\u2019s spiral was harsh as well. His heroin habit \u2014 Ron had introduced him to that drug and crack \u2014 grew to $300 a day and precipitated several arrests. By 1990, he was \u201cselling my CDs on a corner in exchange for crack rocks.\u201d\n\nWhile attempts at sobriety proved challenging, he writes that since a severe but short relapse in 1995, he \u201cnever had another hard drug again.\u201d\n\nThese days, Feldman still acts \u2014 often in low-budget horror films \u2014 and performs music with his band, Truth Movement. He also has a 9-year-old son named Zen from his second marriage, to Playboy model Susie Sprague, which ended in 2009.\n\nAfter all he went through, Feldman has blunt words for those who propose to drag their children through show business.\n\n\u201cPeople always ask me about life after childhood stardom. What would I say to parents of children in the industry?\u201d he writes. \u201cMy only advice, honestly, is to get these kids out of Hollywood and let them lead normal lives.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_right-1.png", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/spanx-sale.png?w=300&h=200&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/feldman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dogears_133x41_left.png", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/feldman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/feldman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2013/10/19/the-childhood-hell-of-the-lost-boys/", "title": "The childhood hell of \u2018The Lost Boys\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
