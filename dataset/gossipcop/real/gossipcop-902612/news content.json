For instance, this past spring Kim Kardashian West revealed her full, luxury skin-care routine, which costs $4,500 and includes products from La Mer and Guerlain. That being said, she hasn't held back when it comes to her drugstore favorites either. What's more: Thanks to a recent post on her app, we now know that sister Khlo\u00e9 is a fan of affordable skin care, too.\n\nAs first reported by People on Wednesday, November 28, the new mom shared the go-to products she uses to keep her complexion clear. And believe it or not, you can snag them at your local CVS.\n\n\"To get my skin clean, first I wash my face (of course), then use two Neutrogena towelettes to remove any left-over product, including one that's just for eyes since eyeliner and mascara can be so tricky,\" she wrote of the first step in her routine. She said these are what work best to remove stubborn makeup that's been on all day. Allure editors agree, too, having named them one of the best makeup wipes of all time.\n\nOnce she's removed the main bulk of her face and eye makeup, she said she then uses PanOxyl's Acne Foaming Wash, which contains 10 percent benzoyl peroxide to prevent and heal blemishes. It also costs less than $10. She added that her skin is actually pretty clear for the most part, but that this is the cleanser she uses when she feels blemishes lurking. \"[This one] is strong enough to battle the worst breakouts,\" she said.\n\nDid we mention Kardashian's tried-and-true blemish-busting products won't cost you more than a movie ticket? Needless to say, you should definitely give these wallet-friendly products a shot so long as you consult your dermatologist beforehand.\n\nNow read more about the Kardashian's skin-care favorites:\n\nDone reading?
