The body was discovered about 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday (12:30 p.m. PT) in Port Edgar, Queensferry, just west of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.\n\nNo official cause of death was given. A statement from Hutchison\u2019s family, issued Friday afternoon by Police Scotland, said the singer had been struggling with mental health problems.\n\n\u201cAs a family, we are utterly devastated with the tragic loss of our beloved Scott,\u201d the statement said. \u201cDespite his disappearance, and the recent concerns over his mental health, we had all remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself. Scott, like many artists, wore his heart on his sleeve and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts.\u201d\n\nThe family said Hutchison had \u201cbattled bravely with his own issues\u201d for many years. \u201cDepression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe are immensely proud of [Scott] for being so open with his struggles. His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old singer and guitarist was reported missing early Wednesday, and was last seen near the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had issued a tweet Tuesday night referring to his life in the past tense: \u201cBe so good to everyone you love\u2026.I didn\u2019t live by that standard and it kills me.\u201d Twenty minutes later, his final, poignant tweet simply said: \u201cI\u2019m away now. Thanks.\u201d\n\nBe so good to everyone you love. It\u2019s not a given. I\u2019m so annoyed that it\u2019s not. I didn\u2019t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones. \u2014 Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018\n\nI\u2019m away now. Thanks. \u2014 Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018\n\nHutchison\u2019s family was informed of the discovery of the body, and formal identification took place Friday.\n\nHutchison formed Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit in 2003.
