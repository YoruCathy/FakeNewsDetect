Now there's four of us, but we're gonna make it five!\"\n\nChris and Morgane, 35, met when they were both singer-songwriters in 2003, and wed in 2007. She now sings backup on many of his songs. Besides the twins, they also have an 8-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter. (The children's names have been kept private).\n\nChris and Morgane Stapleton at the 2016 CMT Music Awards in Nashville. Getty Images\n\n\"We're married so we hold each other accountable,\" Chris told The New York Times in 2017. \"We can lift each other up on bad nights, kind of give each other a wink when we screw up or do something funny.\"\n\nCongratulations to the busy parents and their ever-growing brood!", "images":
