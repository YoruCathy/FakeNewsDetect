Scorsone revealed that she thinks this trauma will allow Amelia to have a new perspective on life and start a new chapter. \u201cI think, obviously, things are looking up for Amelia. They can\u2019t get much more down,\u201d Scorsone shared.\n\n\u201cI know that this whole season, there\u2019s been the emphasis on bringing some of the lighthearted humor back, infusing it into the show in the way that we had it a little earlier on\u2026 When Amelia was on Private Practice her voice was really quite comedic and humorous. I think that again, now that we\u2019ve gotten through this very tragic story line, I\u2019m anticipating and I\u2019m starting to see there\u2019s a lot of lightness in store.\u201d\n\nAside from the tumor, Scorsone also commented on her character\u2019s on-and-off relationship with Owen. \u201cPeople are complicated and relationships are complicated,\u201d she explained matter-of-factly. \u201cThere\u2019s so much love and there\u2019s so much that they\u2019ve shared, and yet there\u2019s so much trauma and hurt and there\u2019s just so much to wade through in terms of what was real and what wasn\u2019t and what hurts and what was good.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cSo I\u2019m sure the feelings are not straightforward for the two of them.\u201d\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy airs at 8 pm on Thursdays on ABC.", "images": ["https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_165/f10/2016/04/10384239.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2015/11/3397161.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2015/10/08611059.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2015/11/01351960-1.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/04/8411808.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/close.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/08250046.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_480,$w_895/f10/2017/10/14961970.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/04/Sandra-Oh-4.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/plugins/cm-emailoverlay/close.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/01/02834914.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/22670791-600x337.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/oliviadipede-150x150.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/05/08612168.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop/qool-logo-white.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2016/01/02834914.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2015/04/03886484.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/08/1997046.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_400,$w_400/f10/2017/10/14961970.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2016/04/shutterstock_147562943.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/7392974.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/14961970-637x1024.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/04/The-Catch-3.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/03/Greys-Cast.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2015/10/08611059.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2020/04/JPI_Episode13832_0001864744-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/01/02834914.jpg", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/themes/cm_desktop_child_fame10/hamburger.png", "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FEB10fame10logo-web-1.png", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_105,$w_105/f10/2017/03/Ellen-DeGeneres-Finger-600x337.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2016/04/311094CP.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_384,$w_576/f10/2015/12/Kyle-Chandler-Greys.jpg", "https://cl.fame10.com/image/upload/t_tn,f_auto,q_auto,$h_100,$w_100/f10/2016/04/shutterstock_147562943.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.fame10.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/14961970-637x1024.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fame10.com/trending-news/greys-anatomys-caterina-scorsone-says-lighter-days-are-ahead-for-amelia-shepherd/", "title": "Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Caterina Scorsone Says Lighter Days Are Ahead For Amelia Shepherd", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Caterina Scorsone Says Lighter Days Are Ahead For Amelia Shepherd", "description": "Photo by Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock Grey\u2019s Anatomy star Caterina Scorsone has opened up about her character Amelia Shepherd and revealed she will have lighter experiences going forward!
