News that her decision to attend the AMAs with Roem was in line with the anti-bullying theme of her hit, \u201cSorry Not Sorry,\u201d which she performed during the show.\n\n\u201cWe connected because I heard her story. She is actually the first out and seated transgender state legislator in American history, and when I heard that, I was just completely inspired by it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to have her in the audience with me tonight because I feel like we have been through some of the same things and now we get to share this experience together.\u201d\n\nAmong those to applaud the gesture was GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis, who praised Lovato and Roem as \u201ctwo strong and inspirational women who embody the need for all Americans to stand together united and to take action today against any form of discrimination and oppression\u201d in an email statement sent to HuffPost.\n\n\u201cDanica Roem is a trailblazer whose win in Virginia showcased both how young people and marginalized communities can impact voting results and how every American deserves an opportunity to work hard and achieve their dreams,\u201d Ellis added. \u201cDemi Lovato continues her legacy of raising the bar for entertaining audiences around the world and for spotlighting social issues that need the most attention.\u201d", "images":
