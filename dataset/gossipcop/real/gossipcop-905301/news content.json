However, that excitement \u201cquickly evaporated\u201d after he saw the \u201cdisturbing image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether an oblivious oversight or not, it\u2019s truly sad and disturbing that in 2018, something so racially and culturally insensitive could pass by the eyes of so many (stylist, photographer, creative and marketing teams) and be deemed acceptable,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t allow for my name and brand to be associated with a company that could let this happen. I hope that this situation will serve as the wake up call that H&M and other companies need to get on track and become racially and culturally aware, as well as more diverse at every level.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd tweeted on Monday: \u201cWoke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo.
