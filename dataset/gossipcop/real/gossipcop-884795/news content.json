And I just, I\u2019ve got a lot of emotions. I don\u2019t even know what to say. I mean, it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad for me, but I\u2019m putting myself to work, keeping myself busy, and trying to move past it and move on to the next chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nAs for D\u2019Agostino, \u201cWe\u2019re not hanging out, but we\u2019re on friendly terms, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d she said, adding that they intended to settle things swiftly: \u201cWe wanted it to be amicable, and that\u2019s how we live our lives. \u201d\n\nThe businessman\u2019s attorney, Daniel Lipschutz, confirms the case was amicably settled and that uncontested divorce papers were submitted Sept. 18 after D\u2019Agostino filed for divorce in early August.
