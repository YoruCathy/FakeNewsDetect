She finished the look with a pair of boots by Tabitha Simmons.\n\nAnd despite social media backlash, the former Suits actress stuck to her sartorial instincts and wore her hair up in another laid back bun. A subtle hint at a more relaxed approach to her soon-to-be royal status?\n\nPrince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle are seen during a walkabout at Cardiff Castle on January 18, 2018 in Cardiff, Wales.
