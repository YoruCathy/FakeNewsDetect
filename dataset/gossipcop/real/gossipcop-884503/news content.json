But within minutes, she starts to worry about their safety at the beachfront estate where they\u2019re staying, which is owned by Girls Gone Wild founder and family friend Joe Francis.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nShe calls up Francis and dissolves into tears immediately.\n\n\u201cI just have anxiety,\u201d she cries over the phone. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s safe here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s safe there \u2014 I promise you,\u201d he reassures her. \u201cLook, I went through the same thing \u2014 I promise you it\u2019s safe. I have my kids there. It\u2019s safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver since Paris, I just go through this worst-case-scenario mode in my head,\u201d she continues. \u201cI was so excited to come on this trip, and I had no idea that I was going to end up feeling this way, but it hit me right as we were getting off the plane that all these people at the airport are going to see 17 or 18 girls with all of our Chanel bags and Louis Vuitton [things], and it just hit me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are the biggest target ever,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019m just like, why did I come, you know?\u201d\n\n\u2018KUWTK\u2019 RECAP: Scott Disick Is \u2018Jealous\u2019 Of Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s Mexican Vacation Partying\n\nOn Oct. 3, 2016, Kardashian West was robbed at gunpoint at the No Address Hotel during Paris Fashion Week. Masked men stole millions of dollars worth of jewelry from her in the middle of the night \u2014 including a $4 million ring.\n\nThe star was deeply shaken by the traumatic experience, and following the robbery she immediately returned to the United States and retreated entirely from the spotlight for three months.\n\nShe has since reflected on how the harrowing experience turned her into a \u201cdifferent person.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was probably no secret, you see it on the show \u2014 me being flashy \u2014 but I was definitely materialistic before,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres in April. \u201cNot that there\u2019s anything bad about having things and working hard to get those things \u2014 and I\u2019m really proud of everyone that\u2019s around me that\u2019s successful. But I\u2019m so happy that my kids get this me. And that this is who is raising my kids. Because I just don\u2019t care about that stuff anymore, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want to start crying, but \u2026 I\u2019m such a different person. I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fkim-kardashian1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-sobs-robbery-fears-mexico/", "title": "Kim Kardashian West Sobs as She Fears Being Robbed on Mexico Vacation: 'We Are the Biggest Targets Ever'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up with the Kardashians,Kim Kardashian,News,TV", "description": "\"All these people at the airport are going to see 17 or 18 girls with all of our Chanel bags,\" she says in a sneak peek at this week's episode of KUWTK", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian West Sobs as She Fears Being Robbed on Mexico Vacation: 'We Are the Biggest Targets Ever'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-sobs-robbery-fears-mexico/", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EllS87Qo_gc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent Kim Kardashian West\u2018s terrifying Paris heist significantly changed the way she lives her life&nbsp;\u2014 but it continues to stoke fear.
