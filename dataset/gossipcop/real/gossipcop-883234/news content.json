A Concert for Disaster Relief, the benefit that was televised Saturday night on Telemundo, Univision and NBC from Miami and Los Angeles.\n\nReality TV star Kim Kardashian West was among the celebrities who answered calls from viewers who were encouraged to pledge money toward the American Red Cross, Reach Out Worldwide, United Way, United for Puerto Rico and other aid groups during the telethon.\n\nLopez's baseball star boyfriend Alex Rodriguez worked with her and her ex-husband Anthony on the event, which featured performances by the organizers as well as Ricky Martin, Chris Martin, Gwen Stefani, Demi Lovato, Maroon 5, Mary J. Blige and others.\n\nLopez, who has family in Puerto Rico, told People.com that it was not difficult to work with the two men on this project.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no question about it when it comes to things like this,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth is, we are all one. We are all family. We are doing this because it\u2019s the right thing to do. Our community needs us right now, and we are very aware that we are leaders in our community. If we step out and do something, hopefully people will follow and do the same.\u201d\n\nMORE: Jennifer Aniston donates $1 million to Puerto Rico recovery efforts\n\nRELATED: Lin-Manuel Miranda urges more U.S. aid for Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\n\nALSO: Stephen Colbert, Nick Kroll's #PuberMe raises $1 million for Puerto Rico\n\nOn Sunday, Lopez posted on Instagram a message of thanks to everyone who donated and said \"Thank you for everyone who tuned in and donated...30 million and counting!!
