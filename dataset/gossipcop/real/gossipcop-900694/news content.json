In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved \u201ca spectrum of behaviour\u201d.\n\nDamon said there was \u201ca difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added that society was in a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d and said it was \u201cwonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u2018Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: \u201cGod God, seriously?\n\n\n\n\u201cGosh it\u2019s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women\u2019s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.\u201d\n\nDriver\u2019s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: \u201cThere are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it\u2019s still cancer.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: \u201cI felt I desperately needed to say something. I\u2019ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.\n\n\u201cI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can\u2019t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it\u2019s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.\u201d\n\nDriver\u2019s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape.\n\nSpeaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2013 well, we can work with that,\u201d Damon said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know Louis CK. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... \u201d\n\nDriver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me that he thinks that because he didn\u2019t rape somebody \u2013 so far as we know \u2013 that what he did do wasn\u2019t as bad.\u201d\n\nThe comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said \u201cthese stories are true\u201d but did not specifically apologise.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Driver continued. \u201cIf good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we\u2019re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.\u201d\n\nDriver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.\n\n\u201cI felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,\u201d she said. \u201cPut abuse in there \u2026 that all abuse is equal but some is worse.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThere is no hierarchy of abuse \u2013 that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn\u2019t want or ask for \u2026 you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other.\n\n\u201cAnd it certainly can\u2019t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.\n\nPeter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more\n\n\u201cHow about: it\u2019s all fucking wrong and it\u2019s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it\u2019s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.\u201d\n\nSince the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein.\n\n\u201cThere is not a woman I know,\u201d Driver said, \u201cmyself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn\u2019t sleep with.\u201d\n\nDriver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women.\n\n\u201cIn the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,\u201d she said, \u201cI feel that\u2019s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question.\n\n\u201cMen can rally and they can support, but I don\u2019t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse. Ever.\u201d\n\n", "images":
