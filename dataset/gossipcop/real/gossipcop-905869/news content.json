Whether she\u2019s trying out trendy colors like Champagne pop blonde, playing with a smoky quartz shade, or going dark for a summer goth vibe, she\u2019s a total hair chameleon.\n\nBut her latest look has little to do with color and everything to do with a dramatic haircut. In fact, she\u2019s proving that blunt bangs might be the trend to watch in 2018.\n\nEmma was on hand at the 2018 Critics\u2019 Choice Awards to support her longtime partner Evan Peters, who was nominated for Best Actor for his role in American Horror Story: Cult. The couple walked the red carpet together, but we gotta say, Emma\u2019s blunt bangs stole the show.\n\nEmma has been rocking a short blonde bob for a while now, but her blunt bangs are giving us so many vintage vibes. She looks like an old Hollywood movie star, especially in her cream satin strapless Giorgio Armani gown, which she paired with coordinating strappy sandals. She kept her jewelry and accessories simple and elegant, complimenting the look with a statement brow with pink lip. It all came together for the perfect hint-of-edge vibe.\n\nImage zoom SANTA MONICA, CA - JANUARY 11: Emma Roberts arrives at the The 23rd Annual Critics' Choice Awards at Barker Hangar on January 11, 2018 in Santa Monica, California.
