She was asked, \"If you have nine pizzas and then cut each pizza into eight slices, how many slices do you have?\" Poehler confidently said, \"73 slices,\" before immediately doubting her answer.\n\n\"No. No!\" she said. Anaya whispered the correct answer of 72 to Poehler, who then said, \"That's what I meant [by] 73 \u2014 after I buy an extra slice.\"\n\nFallon similarly struggled with his question, in which he had to determine the preposition in a sentence. Maya tried to shake her head to help him guess the correct answer, and while he eventually chose it, it took a lot of stalling on his part.\n\nThe game continued with coaxing from Anaya and Maya until the final question about the number of bones in a human body.
