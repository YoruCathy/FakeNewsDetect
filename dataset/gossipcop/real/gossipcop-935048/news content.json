Or, like, 40 days.\"\n\nBella continues: \"So hearing Brie and Lauren, JJ and Bryan all talk about their family stuff and their kids, it makes it, like, sink in a little bit more of how lonely it will be and how lonely it gets.\"\n\nThe footage comes just one day after ET caught up with Bella at NBCUniversal's upfront presentation in New York City, where she revealed she's holding out hope for a reconciliation with Cena.\n\n\"John is such an amazing man. He really is the love of my life,\" Bella exclusively told ET. \"I truly hope one day that we can work it out and get back together. I think there is hope.\"\n\n\"I just want us both to live the rest of our lives happy,\" the WWE superstar continued. \"Hopefully that's together, maybe it's not. Right now I'm just focusing on me. I think I kind of lost me and now I want to find [myself].\"\n\nOn the Today show Monday, Cena detailed his own heartbreak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it is very difficult -- I had my heart broken out of nowhere, or for me, it was out of nowhere,\" he said. \"And anyone who has experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings.\u201d\n\nThe Blockers star continued: \"I don't want anybody else. I love Nicole. I'm really trying to support her in her trying to find whatever it is she wants that made this fall apart in the first place, and in doing so, I'm also just trying to live. But I don't have any other hopes, other than one day that we can work it out.\"\n\nAs for not wanting children, Cena said he's changed his mind about that too.\n\n\"I'm willing to go back on all of these things I said, and a lot of things I was holding on to just out of stubbornness \u2014 'I won't have kids' \u2014 and it took a really strong look in the mirror for me to be like, 'Why?' This person is my number one, and it's something that's very valuable to her, and of course we can do this ... all of that switched because I love her,\" Cena admitted. \"She's my number one and I just want to make her happy ... and right now, she's happy.\"\n\n\"For anyone who's speculating what's going on, I love her, I want to be with her. I want to make her my wife. I want to be the father of her children. I just want us to work,\" Cena shared.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nNikki Bella Hopes She and John Cena Can 'Work It Out' and 'Get Back Together' (Exclusive)\n\nJohn Cena On Nikki Bella Split: 'I Had My Heart Broken Out of Nowhere'\n\nNikki Bella Reveals She's Living With Twin Sister Brie Amid 'Really Difficult Time' Post-John Cena Split\n\nJohn Cena Still Loves Nikki Bella 'With All My Heart' (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
