Kendra Wilkinson indulged in some liquid therapy following news she had filed for a divorce from husband Hank Baskett after almost nine years of marriage.\n\nThe former Girls Next Door star, 32, shared a photo of herself on her Instagram story on Friday, April 6, and captioned it, \u201cLol drunk bunny gamer\u201d with crying-laughing emoji faces. In the photo, she takes a sip from a frosted shot glass while wearing gamer headphones with a video game controller on her chest. According to her Instagram story, earlier in the day, she kept busy by golfing with Jon Lovitz and did a puzzle wth her daughter Alijah, 3. (Wilkinson and Baskett, 35, also share an 8-year-old son, Hank IV.)\n\nAs previously reported, the Kendra on Top star announced the end of her relationship with the retired football star in an emotional Instagram post on Friday morning.\n\n\u201cToday is the last day of my marriage to this beautiful man. I will forever love Hank and be open but for now we have chosen to go our own ways,\u201d she wrote alongside a photo of the former couple. \u201cI\u2019m beyond sad and heartbroken because I did believe in forever, that\u2019s why I said yes but unfortunately too much fear has gotten in the way.\u201d\n\nWilkinson\u2019s confirmation came just one week after Us Weekly exclusively revealed that the former Playboy Playmate was planning to file for divorce from Baskett. A source told Us at the time, \u201cShe\u2019s been really unhappy and felt uncomfortable in the marriage and they have been fighting a lot.\u201d\n\nDays later, she took to Instagram to share how devastated she was that her marriage was ending, telling her followers through tears, \u201cI did everything I could. It wasn\u2019t good enough. I will always love him \u2026 Guess it\u2019s just not meant to be. I\u2019m so scared.\u201d\n\nThe reality TV personality had hinted at the dissolution of their relationship that same day, tweeting, \u201cToday will be the saddest, scariest day of my life. Today I will have to be the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. Today, my rebirth begins.\u201d\n\nBaskett and Wilkinson had been through their fair share of ups and downs throughout the course of their relationship. In 2014, Baskett became embroiled in a sex scandal following news he allegedly had an affair with a transgender model while his wife was eight months pregnant with their daughter. The pair later documented their journey trying to overcome their issues on Kendra on Top and Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1581px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1581px%2C893px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram.jpg?w=169", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1581px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kendra-wilkinson-gets-drunk-after-filing-for-divorce-from-hank-baskett/", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Gets \u2018Drunk\u2019 Hours After Filing for Divorce from Hank Baskett", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kendra Wilkinson shared a photo of herself taking a shot on Friday, April 6, hours after she announced she had filed for divorce from husband Hank Baskett \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Gets \u2018Drunk\u2019 Hours After Filing for Divorce from Hank Baskett", "description": "Kendra Wilkinson shared a photo of herself taking a shot on Friday, April 6, hours after she announced she had filed for divorce from husband Hank Baskett \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kendra-wilkinson-gets-drunk-after-filing-for-divorce-from-hank-baskett/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1581px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1581px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-07T14:21:10+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kendra Wilkinson shared a photo of herself taking a shot on Friday, April 6, hours after she announced she had filed for divorce from husband Hank Baskett \u2014 find out more", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Gets \u2018Drunk\u2019 Hours After Filing for Divorce from Hank Baskett", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kendra-wilkinson-drunk-bunny-gamer-instagram-divorce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1581px%2C831px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523110870.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
