And at the end of it, I was like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m alive,'\u201d she told E!. \u201cI\u2019m alive again. I feel free and this end to that chapter, just a moment of time in my life, but a pretty big one because a lot of emotional stuff I worked through, is going to open the most beautiful things to come. And I wanted to tell people before people found out from different sources. And that was my way of sharing, you know, really, truly, an end is a new beginning, and anything\u2019s possible now.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s only been a short time since her departure was announced, Eden says she\u2019s talked to a few of her RHOBH co-stars since the news broke. And believe you\u2019ll be shocked at the names Eden drops!\n\n\u201cKyle and I spoke this morning through text and respect, respect for her to reach out and say the things and really say all the things she did. And you know? There\u2019s an untapped friendship there someplace deep because it was interesting between her and I. And I think we understand one another in a lot of ways. And Rinna and I, I reached out to her just kind of thanking her for the beautiful journey I had gone on with her.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so happy to see Eden go. Nothing against her personally \u2013 I think she\u2019s a cool person she\u2019s just not a good fit for reality TV. It was clear that Eden was vying to be part of the season 8 cast, but her efforts failed miserably. Too little too late. I\u2019m hoping that Bravo finds a better fit for season 8 and brings on actual \u201cfriends\u201d of the Housewives.\n\nDo you believe Eden is at peace with being fired from RHOBH? Was Eden hoping to be part of season 8? Are you surprised that Kyle and Rinna reached out to Eden? Will you miss Eden on RHOBH?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.", "images": ["https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-80x80.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kyle-richards-garcelle-beauvais-rhobh.jpg", "https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/RHOBH-Feud-Season-8-Cast-Eden-Sassoon.jpg?fit=620%2C387&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/teresa-giudice-1.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jennifer-Aydin.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tamra-braunwyn.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Denise-Richards-WWHL-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/denise-richards-rhobh.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bravocon-.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/180716_3762858_Did_Vicki_Gunvalson_Set_Up_Kelly_Dodd_s_Ex_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small-1.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RHONJ-season-10-gia-giudice-frank-catania-ava-tortorici-miss-teen-usa-nj.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/RHOBH-Feud-Season-8-Cast-Eden-Sassoon.jpg?fit=620%2C387&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/05/10/real-housewives-beverly-hills-reached-departing-eden-sassoon/", "title": "Which Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Have Reached Out to Departing Eden Sassoon? - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Which Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Have Reached Out to Departing Eden Sassoon? - The Real Housewives | News.
