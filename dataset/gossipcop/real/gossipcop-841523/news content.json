Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t stay as steamy at they would have preferred. Megan and Kyle are plagued by thoughts of Nate and the LAPD detective. They\u2019re both keeping secrets from each other, and it\u2019s weighing on them.\n\nMegan\u2019s best friend, Tessa, is getting married so she has to head back home for the weekend. She\u2019s officiating! Kyle can\u2019t go because of a work commitment. It\u2019s awkward between them because they\u2019re keeping secrets. Come on, guys. Get it together!\n\nNate calls Megan and says the play might get a run in New York. He needs her help in a meeting to move this forward. Megan is going to be on the east coast for the wedding, so a short trip to NYC isn\u2019t a problem. The thing is, she doesn\u2019t tell Kyle about Nate\u2019s call.\n\nUnderstandably, Kyle is beyond pissed at Terence for forcing him to have sex with the LAPD detective. Kyle\u2019s been avoiding Terence since it all went down. Terence isn\u2019t going to let that fly. \u201cWe have to fix this together,\u201d Terence says. \u201cWith bullsh*t conversations and apologies and you trying to convince me that everything you did was OK?\u201d Kyle snaps back. Terence tries to calm Kyle down, but Kyle just slams him against a wall. Kyle is finally seeing Terence for who he truly is.\n\nThe Other Side Of Megan Morrison\n\nWith all the drama going on, Kyle decides he needs to get out of LA. He asks Megan to go to wedding with her. She gets a hint that something\u2019s wrong, but Kyle won\u2019t open up to her. There\u2019s also something up with Megan. The last time Megan was back home was for her mother\u2019s funeral.\n\nMegan\u2019s BFF Tessa is a trip. She can read Megan like a book. Immediately, Tessa knows that Megan is conflicted about her new life. Kyle is introduced to Tessa\u2019s family, who happen to be Megan\u2019s second family. Kyle is seeing a side to Megan that he\u2019s never seen before. But there\u2019s a part of Megan who\u2019s not so sure Kyle is going to like what he sees. Later, Tessa asks Megan how it\u2019s going with Kyle. Megan admits that they\u2019ve always had this unspoken, deep connection. She\u2019s just worried that things will fly off the rails.\n\nWhen Megan and Kyle head up to Tessa\u2019s room to crash, Megan\u2019s sees a picture of another friend up on the wall. This woman, Rebecca, is going to be at the wedding. Megan is not OK with it. There\u2019s some drama over a guy named Evan. When Megan goes to get some water, she hallucinates a mysterious man and can\u2019t stop shaking. She breaks down and starts crying.\n\nA Crazy Trip\n\nMeanwhile, Terence goes to see a doctor named Isaac. He takes mushrooms and is encased in a vault filled with water. He goes on a wild trip to figure out what\u2019s wrong with him. This trip takes him deep inside his subconscious and unearths some very interesting things about Terence. During this hallucination, Terence is Kyle. He has everything Kyle has \u2014 movie career, fame, and Megan. He wants to be Kyle and have Kyle\u2019s life. This guy is twisted AF.\n\nTerence\u2019s trip ends with him coming face-to-face with Kyle. Here\u2019s the thing about Terence, he knows he\u2019s effed up. \u201cI built my life around helping people, and I don\u2019t care about anybody,\u201d he says. He asks Kyle for help but ends up strangling him. WTF?!\n\nMegan officiates the wedding and spots Rebecca in the crowd. She gets a bit shaken up and Kyle notices. At the the reception, Rebecca comes up to Megan. When Rebecca starts talking about Evan, Megan walks away. Kyle follows and begs Megan to open up. She doesn\u2019t want to talk about Evan. Megan and Kyle dance, but she freaks when she hallucinates Evan again.\n\nA Shocking & Devastating Reveal\n\nOnce again, Kyle tries to help Megan, but she shuts him out. When he\u2019s walking away, she admits she\u2019s upset over her step-brother. She reveals that he molested her when she was 11 years old. She feels like a terrible person because, when he started dating Rebecca, she thought she did something wrong. Rebecca has no idea that Evan took advantage of Megan. That\u2019s why it\u2019s awkward. Thankfully, Evan is no longer a part of the equation. He died after getting mixed up with the wrong crowd, but his presence still lingers.\n\nAfter Megan finally opens up, her relationship with Kyle changes. They\u2019re stronger now. When Megan looks over at Kyle when they\u2019re back at the party, he mouths \u201cI love you.\u201d At the end of the day, it\u2019s only Kyle and Megan.\n\nOn their way home, Megan thanks Kyle for being such an amazing boyfriend. \u201cYou let me be exactly the way I needed to be,\u201d she says. Kyle made her feel safe and that means more to her than he could ever know. \u201cYou\u2019re always safe with me,\u201d he assures her.\n\nAfter a rendezvous with Anika, Deann goes to Terence to figure out the next step with Kyle\u2019s directing project. Terence tells Deann to make all the decisions. He\u2019s letting go of all the unnecessary BS (for now) and focusing entirely on IHM.\n\nKyle and Megan get back to LA and find his apartment has been broken into. Nothing\u2019s been stolen, which is weird. The police officer warns that someone was likely trying to make a point that they can come in at any time. Who could it have been? LISBETH?!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did you think of tonight\u2019s episode of The Arrangement?", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F04%2F16%2Fthe-arrangement-episode-7-season-1-recap-megan-molested-step-brother%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2551008&comment_count=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/avery_arya.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/the-arrangement-tv-recap-ftr-6.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/the-arrangement-tv-recap-ftr-6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Avery Thompson", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Entertainment Director"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/04/16/the-arrangement-episode-7-season-1-recap-megan-molested-step-brother/", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Recap: Megan Reveals A Heartbreaking Secret About Her Past", "meta_data": {"description": "Megan goes back home and finally opens up to Kyle about her past on the April 16 episode of 'The Arrangement.'
