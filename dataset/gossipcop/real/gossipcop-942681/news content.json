One of the great storytellers of our time who connected with so many. I wish him peace. My love and prayers are with his family, friends and loved ones.\u201d\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, a friend of Bourdain\u2019s who appeared as a guest on \u201cNo Reservations,\u201d \u201cParts Unknown\u201d and also served as a guest judge on \u201cThe Taste,\u201d added that he would always keep Bourdain in his heart.\n\n\u201cMy friend, I know you are on a Ferry going to somewhere amazing \u2026 you still had so many places to show us, whispering to our souls the great possibilities beyond what we could see with our own eyes \u2026 you only saw beauty in all people. You will always travel with me.\u201d\n\nNigella Lawson and Ludo Lefebvre, Bourdain\u2019s co-judges on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Taste,\u201d both tweeted that they were \"heartbroken\" to learn of his death, with Nigella saying she would be taking a break from Twitter as a result, and Lefebvre sharing a photo of a spoon tattoo Bourdain and he shared.\n\n\u201cHeartbroken to hear about Tony Bourdain\u2019s death,\u201d Lawson wrote. \u201cUnbearable for his family and girlfriend.

And the irony, the sad cruel irony is that the last year he\u2019d never been happier. The rest of my heart aches for the 3 amazing women he left behind. Tony was a symphony. I wish everyone could have seen all of him. A true friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIron Chef\u201d star Michael Symon added that he was \u201cin complete shock\u201d over the news.\n\n\"RIP Tony Bourdain ...Wtf ...in complete shock ... loss for words,\" Symon wrote Friday morning.\n\nFood Network's Tyler Florence added simply that he was \"shattered\" by the news.\n\nAs a guest judge on \u201cTop Chef,\u201d Bourdain was also mourned by its stars, including chef and restaurateur Tom Colicchio and cookbook author and TV host Padma Lakshmi.\n\nColiccio tweeted that for Bourdain, resting in peace was \u201cdoubtful\u201d as Bourdain\u2019s \u201crestless spirit will roam the earth in search of justice, truth and a great bowl of noodles.\u201d\n\nLakshmi added that she was \u201cin shock and devastated\u201d over losing one of the wittiest people she knew.\n\n\n\nTV personality and \u201cTop Chef\u201d contestant Carla Hall, formerly of \u201cThe Chew,\u201d called Bourdain a \u201cbeloved presence in the culinary community\u201d and shared the number of a suicide hotline.\n\nBaker and \"Cake Boss\" star Buddy Valastro also wrote that he was \"gutted\" by Bourdain's passing, and referred those in need of help to the number of a suicide hotline.\n\nRestaurateur David Chang, also the host of Netflix\u2019s \u201cUgly Delicious,\u201d Instagrammed only a black square alongside the lyrics of the Bonnie \u2018Prince\u2019 Billy song \u201cI See a Darkness.\u201d\n\nRenowned chef and cookbook author Thomas Keller said Bourdain's work made the world a \"kinder, more connected place\" and sent his love to Bourdain's family and fans.\n\nThe Travel Channel, which aired Bourdain\u2019s \u201cNo Reservations\u201d and \u201cThe Layover,\u201d mourned the loss of a \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d and said his presence will be missed.\n\n\u201cWe are stunned and deeply saddened to hear that the world is now without its global ambassador, Anthony Bourdain. He was an incredible talent who shows us beautiful, gritty, complicated and delicious places in every corner of the world. His wit and perspective will be missed. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nA number of food critics and reporters were also shocked and saddened at Bourdain's death.\n\n\u201cI loved that Bourdain didn't do a cooking show, he did a culture show. It taught how to think and feel, and how to empathize,\u201d wrote New York Times wine critic Eric Asimov.\n\nKat Kinsman, an author and food editor for Extra Crispy, urged that those in the restaurant industry, specifically, should \u201cbe kind to yourself and one another.\u201d She also directed industry workers to a website which shares resources for restaurant workers suffering from stress or mental health issues.\n\nThe Culinary Institute of America also mourned the loss of Bourdain, a graduate of the CIA class of 1978, and praised him sharing his love of food with the world.\n\n\"The CIA is deeply saddened to learn of the passing Anthony Bourdain '78, renowned chef, author, and TV personality. He opened the world of food and different cultures to all through his brilliant storytelling,\" the culinary school wrote.", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/fox-news-lifestyle_fox-news-lifestyle.png", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/tiger-cow-2-Jam-Press.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/08/694940094001_5795342265001_5795330328001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/08/931/524/694940094001_5795342265001_5795330328001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Tunnel2Towers-on-2020-04-15-at-10.21.00_05_58_13.Still001.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/01/270/152/PlantMillennialIstock.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Cuomo.png?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/08/694940094001_5795342265001_5795330328001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/anthony-bourdains-death-celebrity-chefs-in-complete-shock", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's death: Celebrity chefs 'in complete shock'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Chefs and admirers across the world are mourning the loss of chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain following his reported suicide Friday morning.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "food-drink", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Michael Bartiromo", "dc.title": "Anthony Bourdain's death: Celebrity chefs 'in complete shock'", "dcterms.abstract": "Chefs and admirers across the world are mourning the loss of chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain following his reported suicide Friday morning.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Chefs and admirers across the world are mourning the loss of chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain following his reported suicide Friday morning.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:adab8ea6-7320-517c-b90c-68850ea91200", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-06-08", "dcterms.created": "2018-06-08T07:53:16-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-06-08T16:19:05-04:00", "og": {"title": "Anthony Bourdain's death: Celebrity chefs 'in complete shock'", "description": "Chefs and admirers across the world are mourning the loss of chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain following his reported suicide Friday morning.", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/08/694940094001_5795342265001_5795330328001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/anthony-bourdains-death-celebrity-chefs-in-complete-shock", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's death: Celebrity chefs 'in complete shock'", "description": "Chefs and admirers across the world are mourning the loss of chef and television personality Anthony Bourdain following his reported suicide Friday morning.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/06/08/1024/512/694940094001_5795342265001_5795330328001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/anthony-bourdains-death-celebrity-chefs-in-complete-shock"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/FOOD DRINK/FOOD/Celebrity Chefs,/FOX NEWS/FOOD DRINK", "classification-isa": "celebritychefs,food-drink,fooddrink"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
