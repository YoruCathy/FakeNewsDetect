Fast and Furious 9 is slated for a 2020 release.\n\nJohnson confirmed he and Tyrese had yet to speak about the drama during a recent appearance on TV chat show Watch What Happens Live, sharing, \u201cThat whole thing with Tyrese, it was pretty disappointing because I\u2019d been friends with Tyrese for a very long time.\u201d\n\nDwayne said, \u201cI always feel like a beef requires two people to actually jump in it. It was really one-sided, and he had voiced his opinion a lot on social media.\u201d\n\nAnd now Tyrese has opened up about the spat in a chat with Van Lathan for his The Red Pill podcast, admitting he was not \u201cprofessional\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have yet to talk to The Rock (Johnson\u2019s nickname)\u2026 and we will have a conversation,\u201d Tyrese says. \u201cI did have a conversation with his producing partner\u2026 and that was pretty much the gist of any communication, as far as my thoughts and feelings around all that stuff at the time.\n\n\u201cI found myself being the messenger on behalf of various people associated to the (Fast & Furious) franchise, but stupid me, I was the only one who went public about those feelings.\u201d\n\nTyrese now freely admits he may have gone too far, adding Johnson didn\u2019t deserve much of what he said: \u201cI don\u2019t really recall anything that he either said directly or subliminally that was ever as big of a deal as the way I was going at him.\u201d", "images": ["https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/canoe-com-logo-white-vertically-centered.png", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/19trump.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/rockyjohnson1000.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/globalmedic-e1587257110413.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/rock1000.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/25241bb6f3baefa544fc48ae2d9edaad?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cordero.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=107&h=80&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/paltrow1000b.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=107&h=80&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cordero.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/people_tyrese_60104994-e1531493197140.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/beckham.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=107&h=80&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/27311082-8229131-image-a-8_1587115584411-e1587213503764.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://s1.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/postmedia-plugins/postmedia-geolocation/images/weather/hp_w_ibn_l.svg", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/simonedwayne.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/people_tyrese_60104994-e1531493197140.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["More Wenn - World Entertainment News Network"], "canonical_link": "https://canoe.com/entertainment/celebrity/its-not-cool-tyrese-gibson-regrets-public-feud-with-dwayne-johnson", "title": "'It's not cool': Tyrese Gibson regrets public feud with Dwayne Johnson", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "Tyrese Gibson has taken one step towards squashing his beef with Dwayne Johnson following their public spat about the future of the Fast &amp;
