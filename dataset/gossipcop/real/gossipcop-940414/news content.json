There was 2017's Kidnap, in which Halle Berry transforms into a car-chasing vigilante when her child is abducted, and then the recent Breaking In, which has Gabrielle Union out to protect her children from violent intruders. Now Jennifer Garner joins the bloody, ripped mom ranks in Peppermint, a movie where she seeks gruesome revenge for the death of her child.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGarner plays a mom named Riley, whose daughter and husband are gunned down by members linked to the \u201cGarcia cartel.\u201d Gaslighted by corrupt cops and the justice system, who let the murderers off the hook, she disappears and spends five years toning her muscles and training to fight (read: stocking up on a gazillion semi-automatics.) And when the five-year anniversary of her family\u2019s murder comes along, she comes back for revenge.\n\nWhile I love the idea of Garner starring as a crazed mom out for blood, I\u2019d have to say that something about this movie feels uncomfortably Trumpian (ugh I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry!!!) The trailer is littered with lines like \u201cwell at least somebody\u2019s doing something,\u201d which feels like catnip dialogue for people who go crazy over their right to bear arms. Do we really need a revenge thriller that overly exaggerates Latino gangs shooting down innocent white people right now?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d Riley says in the trailer. \u201cI want justice.\u201d I think if I shoo away all the weird political implications of a movie like this, at the end of the day, that\u2019s all I want for Jennifer Garner, too.\n\nPeppermint is in theaters September 7.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/l0xwppi3kddwgrvbwyne.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/l0xwppi3kddwgrvbwyne.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://themuse.jezebel.com/jennifer-garner-is-a-ripped-mom-out-for-revenge-in-the-1826480785", "title": "Jennifer Garner Is a Ripped Mom Out for Revenge in Peppermint", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "P13oAn8o8LB6FVCJWKsHWXvxfbR-SJrmvox6EgULpUs", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/auj4p7qsrkznkdstuufo.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/auj4p7qsrkznkdstuufo.png", "keywords": "jennifer garner, revenge mom, peppermint, Revenge movie, The Muse", "news_keywords": "jennifer garner, revenge mom, peppermint, Revenge movie, The Muse", "twitter": {"url": "https://themuse.jezebel.com/jennifer-garner-is-a-ripped-mom-out-for-revenge-in-the-1826480785", "card": "summary", "site": "@jezebel", "title": "Jennifer Garner Is a Ripped Mom Out for Revenge in Peppermint", "description": "\u201cVigilante Mom\u201d is turning into a full-blown, though low-budget, action genre right now.
