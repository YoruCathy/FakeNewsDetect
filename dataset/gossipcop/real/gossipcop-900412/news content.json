I mean, and that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer,\u201d Damon continued in an interview for ABC News\u2019 \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers.\u201d\n\nDamon, who stars in the upcoming film \u201cDownsizing,\u201d worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film \u201cGood Will Hunting,\u201d which was produced by Weinstein\u2019s production company Miramax.\n\nIn the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\n\u201cAny allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,\u201d his spokesman previously said.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year.\n\nRead part of Damon\u2019s conversation with Travers below.\n\nIn an overarching discussion with Peter Travers on ABC News' \"Popcorn With Peter Travers,\" Dec. 12, 2017, Matt Damon opened up about Harvey Weinstein, sexual harassment and confidentiality agreements. Maryellen McGrath/ABC\n\nPeter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There\u2019s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We\u2019re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls.\n\nMatt Damon: I think we\u2019re in this watershed moment. I think it\u2019s great. I think it\u2019s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it\u2019s totally necessary \u2026 I do believe that there\u2019s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we\u2019re going to have to figure \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? \u2014 I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It\u2019s like at what point \u2014 you know, we\u2019re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think.\n\nAnd we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we\u2019re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, \u201cWait a minute. None of us came here perfect.\u201d You know what I mean? \u2026 The Louis C.K. thing, I don\u2019t know all the details. I don\u2019t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, \u201cI did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.\u201d And I just remember thinking, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the sign of somebody who \u2014 well, we can work with that\u201d \u2026 Like, when I\u2019m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world.\n\nAnd the fear for me is that right now, we\u2019re in this moment where at the moment \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t stay this way \u2014 the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life\u2019s going to get ruined \u2026\n\nI mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that\u2019s prison. Right? And that\u2019s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That\u2019s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think \u2026 I don\u2019t know Louis C.K.. I\u2019ve never met him. I\u2019m a fan of his, but I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he\u2019s paid at this point is so beyond anything that he \u2014 I just think that we have to kind of start delineating between what these behaviors are.\n\nPT: It\u2019s harder, isn\u2019t it, though, when you actually know someone who gets accused? We both know Harvey Weinstein. I\u2019ve worked with him. But I didn\u2019t see any of this.\n\nMD: When you see Al Franken taking a picture putting his hands on that woman\u2019s flak jacket and mugging for the camera, going like that, you know, that is just like a terrible joke, and it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s wrong, and he shouldn\u2019t have done that \u2026 But when you talk about Harvey and what he\u2019s accused of, there are no pictures of that. He knew he was up to no good. There\u2019s no witnesses. There\u2019s no pictures. There\u2019s no braggadocio \u2026 So they don\u2019t belong in the same category.\n\nPT: I think it becomes for all of us, too, that are in any way around it, even though we\u2019re not seeing it, is, what\u2019s our responsibility to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen?\n\nMD: A lot of people said, \u2018Well, Harvey \u2014 everybody knew.\u2019 As you were saying, that\u2019s not true. Everybody knew what kind of guy he was in the sense that if you took a meeting with him, you knew that he was tough and he was a bully, and that was his reputation. And he enjoyed that reputation, because he was making the best movies out there \u2026\n\n[With regard to the rape allegations,] nobody who made movies for him knew \u2026 Any human being would have put a stop to that, no matter who he was. They would\u2019ve said absolutely no. You know what I mean? \u2026 I knew I wouldn\u2019t want him married to anyone close to me. But that was the extent of what we knew, you know? And that wasn\u2019t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that \u2014 I mean, look at the guy. Of course he\u2019s a womanizer \u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t hang out with him.\n\nPT: But you can\u2019t live his life for him. Or be responsible for his life.\n\nMD: Right. So the question is, at what point does somebody\u2019s behavior that you have a professional relationship with \u2026 away from the profession bother enough that you don\u2019t want to work with them? For me, I\u2019ve always kind of, you know, as long as nobody\u2019s committing a crime \u2014 well, that\u2019s your life, and you go live it. I don\u2019t need to be spending time with you, away from my professional life, at least.\n\nMatt Damon appears on \"Popcorn with Peter Travers\" at ABC News studios, Dec. 12, 2017, in New York City. Maryellen McGrath/ABC\n\nPT: [We\u2019ve seen] Ridley Scott, who directed you in \u201cThe Martian,\u201d having to erase Kevin Spacey from \u201cAll the Money in the World\u201d and having to replace him with Christopher Plummer.\n\nMD: That was smart. That was a total business decision by Ridley. I haven\u2019t talked to him, but \u2026 it wasn\u2019t a creative choice for Ridley. Ridley has a big movie coming out \u2026 and nobody right now is in the mood to see a Kevin Spacey movie.\n\nAnd I think he\u2019s right about that. He\u2019s one of the few directors who could just turn on a dime and shoot for a week a month before a movie comes out and, you know, expunge an actor. And I don\u2019t disagree with his decision to do that. I mean, that movie, I think, will do much better without Kevin in it.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: In response to the allegations against him made by Anthony Rapp, Kevin Spacey released a statement on Oct. 29, saying, in part, \u201cI\u2019m beyond horrified to hear his story. I honestly do not remember the encounter \u2026 But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\u201d In November a spokesperson for Spacey said he was \u201ctaking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment.\u201d]\n\nPT: When it\u2019s in that gray area and it\u2019s friends of yours or people that you do know, do you try to talk to them afterwards and say, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Can I help?\u201d\n\nMD: It depends on what the accusation is. It depends what\u2019s going on. If it\u2019s a friend of mine, I\u2019m always talking to them. I know the real story if it\u2019s my friend. If it\u2019s a colleague \u2026 I don\u2019t know \u2026 I guess it depends on the situation and the allegation and how believable I think it is.\n\nPT: We\u2019re going to see the change in the making of movies now with people being so aware.\n\nMD: I also think the day of the confidentiality agreements is over. I think it\u2019s just completely over. Ten years ago, you made a claim against me and I had a big movie coming out, OK? I have $100 million or I have a movie that is personally important to me coming out, and close to the release of that film, you say, \u201cMatt Damon grabbed my butt and stuck his tongue down my throat.\u201d We would then go to mediation and organize a settlement. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t want this out there. Peter\u2019s going to go out and talk to the press and run his mouth, and it\u2019s going to be overshadowing the opening of this movie. How much money do you want?\u201d The lawyers would get together, and they do this cost-benefit analysis, and they\u2019d go, \u201cOh, this is what it\u2019s worth.\u201d And I look at the number and go, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll pay it, but you can never talk about this again. You\u2019re f------ lying about this, but never talk about this again.\n\nNow \u2026 with social media, these stories get \u2014 it\u2019s like they get gasoline poured on them. So the moment a claim is made, if you make that same claim today to me, I would be scorched earth. I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t care if it costs $10 million to fight this in court with you for 10 years, you are not taking my name from me. You are not taking my name and my reputation from me. I\u2019ve worked too hard for it. And I earned it. You can\u2019t just blow me up like that.\u201d So I think once a claim is made, there will no longer be settlements. That\u2019s just my prediction, I mean, just based on what I\u2019ve seen.\n\nPT: Isn\u2019t that a good thing? Women have been doing it, and they\u2019ve been told they can\u2019t express what happened to them.\n\nMD: One hundred percent \u2026 I think that it\u2019s important, especially in that, you know, we believe every woman who\u2019s coming forward with one of these stories needs to be listened to and heard. I think one of the surprising things for me has been the extent to which my female friends, as, I think, of all the ones I\u2019ve talked to in the last year since all this stuff started happening \u2014 I can\u2019t think of any of them who don\u2019t have a story at some point in their life. And most of them have more than one.\n\nPT: I don\u2019t know how old your daughters are, but how do you deal with them living in this world where even they, whatever ages they are, can\u2019t escape this in the headlines?\n\nMD: You just have to raise children with, like, self-esteem, because you\u2019re not going to be there to make all of their decisions for them. And you have to just hope that they have enough self-respect to make the best decisions they can. I mean, the Harvey situation is particularly horrible, because, you know, those women \u2014 when you say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s take a meeting in a hotel room.\u201d I mean, we auditioned, you know, for \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d in a hotel room. Like, it\u2019s common to take meetings in a hotel room.\n\nAnd this is the most powerful man in the movie business at the time, like in the \u201990s, like Harvey was. That was the place to be. And if you get a thing from your agent on the letterhead of your agency that says, \u201cGo meet Harvey Weinstein, the rainmaker, the guy that makes these great movies, at the Peninsula Hotel,\u201d you\u2019re going to that meeting \u2026 You don\u2019t go into that meeting thinking something bad is going to happen to you \u2026 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s taking meetings in hotel rooms now. I mean, sometimes you\u2019re in a different city and you just don\u2019t have anywhere to meet. But, so no matter how smart my daughters are, no matter how prepared they are, there\u2019s still those situations that that\u2019s the nightmare kind of scenario.\n\n0:00\n\nPT: Do you worry about your daughters less because of the change in the industry?\n\nMD: With social media, you know, and a Twitter account, you have the same platform as The New York Times now, so there aren\u2019t secrets. It\u2019s harder to do this type of thing. I would like to point out, though, that even though it feels like there\u2019s this avalanche of men \u2026 Well here\u2019s my optimistic spin, this is like 1 percent of the guys who are losing their careers. It\u2019s not everybody. It just feels like it. There\u2019s so many great men and women in the movie business. So many great people. It\u2019s such a wonderful collection of people overall. And these rotten horrible apples are getting weeded out right now.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s progress. But again, when we go back to talking about our own growth and development as human beings. We have to get to a place where we\u2019re looking at one end of the spectrum and saying, \u201cWell, let\u2019s deal with this with some reflection and dialogue and some reconciliation, and let\u2019s all grow together and move on.\u201d And then I\u2019ll think we\u2019ll be making progress.\n\nWatch part of Matt Damon\u2019s interview in the video above, and tune in for the full ABC News\u2019 \u201cPopcorn With Peter Travers\u201d interview on Dec. 27, on ABCNews.com.\n\nDownload the \"Popcorn With Peter Travers\" podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Tunein, Google Play Music and Stitcher.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/matt-damon-gty-jt-171214_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/matt-damon-gty-jt-171214_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Alexa Valiente", "Angela Williams", "December", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/matt-damon-opens-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-confidentiality/story?id=51792548", "title": "Matt Damon opens up about Harvey Weinstein, sexual harassment and confidentiality agreements", "meta_data": {"description": "Matt Damon opened up about Harvey Weinstein and others on \"Popcorn With Peter Travers.\"", "keywords": "matt damon, harvey weinstein, sexual harassment, louis c.k., al franken, kevin spacey, abc news, popcorn with peter travers", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
