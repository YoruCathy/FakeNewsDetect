Tom Brady?\n\nYes, some celebrities are known for owning the red carpet, and while Tom and his wife Gisele Bundchen are no strangers to posh events such as the Met Gala, Monday night's appearance left some wanting more.\n\nThe five-time Super Bowl winner and model attended the annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute which also includes the opening of a new exhibit. The fashion theme changes each year.\n\nThis year, the theme is \"Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.''\n\nBut the quarterback for the New England Patriots and the Brazilian-born Bundchen played it safe, especially considering some rather unorthodox choices that hit the red carpet. If you're not sure how that theme might translate into fashion, consider Rihanna's heavily beaded glitter Pope look, headpieces that resemble crowns and plenty of crosses.\n\nBrady and Bundchen were a bit more subtle, with Brady in an all black tux save for the gold embroidery on his jacket lapels . His look seemed to channel a priest, but some NFL fans were not having it. The gold matched perfectly with his wife's shimmery organic silk dress from Versace.\n\nBrady gave fans a sneak peek with an Instagram post from their limo ride to the event, in which he writes: ''24k Magic.....My Beautiful Date @gisele''\n\nFormer baseball player Alex Rodriguez also attended with girlfriend Jennifer Lopez. Rodriguez embraced a look that was all black as well, allowing J-Lo to shine in a heavily beaded gown with a cross as the centerpiece.\n\nFollow Heather Tucker on Twitter @HeatherR_Tucker.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f15518f6a8eb10e85623461ea43c7d7cc2369bc/c=0-112-2370-1451/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613243425622405-AP-2018-MET-Museum-Costume-Institute-Benefit-Gala-99696905.JPG?width=2370&height=1339&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/39cb728dac8aeebe7540c468ba4f31f307b00fae/c=153-89-2112-2701/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613243425622405-AP-2018-MET-Museum-Costume-Institute-Benefit-Gala-99696905.JPG?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5781489086001_5781478598001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f15518f6a8eb10e85623461ea43c7d7cc2369bc/c=0-112-2370-1451/local/-/media/2018/05/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636613243425622405-AP-2018-MET-Museum-Costume-Institute-Benefit-Gala-99696905.JPG?width=2370&height=1339&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/patriots/2018/05/07/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-arrive-met-gala-red-carpet/588957002/", "title": "Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen turn heads on Met Gala red carpet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen turn heads on Met Gala red carpet", "description": "New England Patriots QB Tom Brady and his\u00a0wife Gisele Bundchen are no\u00a0strangers to posh events such as the Met Gala.
