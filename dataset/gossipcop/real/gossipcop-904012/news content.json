The $100,000 payout was \u201cnot to be construed as an admission\u201d by Weinstein, but intended to \u201cavoid litigation and buy peace,\u201d according to a legal document reportedly reviewed by the NYT.\n\nOver 50 women have now accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct since The Times and The New Yorker documented decades of allegations in investigative stories published in October.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Rose McGowan Speaks Out Against Stars Wearing Black at the Golden Globes\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Weinstein\u2019s attorneys have denied any allegations of sexual assault.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has never at any time committed an act of sexual assault, and it is wrong and irresponsible to conflate claims of impolitic behavior or consensual sexual contact later regretted, with an untrue claim of criminal conduct,\u201d his lawyers said. \u201cThere is a wide canyon between mere allegation and truth, and we are confident that any sober calculation of the facts will prove no legal wrongdoing occurred.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, to those offended by Mr. Weinstein\u2019s behavior, he remains deeply apologetic.\u201d\n\nCitizen Rose documents the Charmed star\u2019s journey as an outspoken advocate for women\u2019s rights and the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u201cBeing brave doesn\u2019t mean your ankles don\u2019t shake and that you\u2019re not scared,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish I had more middle fingers.\u201d\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.
