Still, on her first day working alongside friend Mariska Hargitay on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, \u201cI was so nervous to come into this well-oiled machine that I called her my character\u2019s name,\u201d Shields said, laughing.\n\nShe\u2019s referring to the scene that ended this week\u2019s episode of the NBC procedural: Olivia, who at the top of the episode was relieved to hear that her child-abuse investigation had been closed, answers a knock at her apartment door to find Shields standing on the other side. \u201cOlivia Benson?\u201d the woman says, \u201cI\u2019m Sheila Porter, Noah\u2019s grandmother.\u201d\n\nFans of the series know this is not great for Lt. Benson, who adopted her son, Noah, after his mother Ellie died. And as Liv reminded Trevor Langan in Wednesday\u2019s hour, Ellie had told Olivia that both of her parents were dead.\n\nTurns out, Ellie lied. And now that Sheila is making moves to vacate Noah\u2019s adoption, expect to see a lot more of Shields\u2019 character in the coming weeks.\n\nShields told reporters at a recent press event that she\u2019s very aware of how Olivia\u2019s enemies are viewed by SVU diehards. \u201cBut I think what fans will understand is that both of these woman actually have a valid argument, and what does that mean? It is about winning? Is it about finding the healthiest compromise?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m not there to replace [Olivia]. I\u2019m not there to undermine or stamp her out, so I\u2019m not an adversary in that way.\u201d\n\nNew showrunner Michael Chernuchin credits Hargitay with thinking of Shields for the part, an idea that came up after Hargitay saw Shields act in an episode of mutual pal Ali Wentworth\u2019s Pop comedy Nightcap.\n\n\u201cI sit at the screening, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my god, she\u2019s perfect!\u201d Hargitay recalls.
