On Thursday night\u2019s season finale of \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race All Stars\u201d Season 3, the clear frontrunner \u2014 one Miss Shangela \u201cHallelu\u201d Laquifa Wadley \u2014 was shut out from even competing in the final lip sync. Perhaps the most chilling part of the whole kerfuffle is that the decision was made by her fellow queens. (The episode\u2019s title: \u201cA Jury of Their Queers\u201d).\n\nEven more shocking was the final vote breakdown, posted to Twitter after the episode (using a weighted voting system that could give the Oscars a run for its money) which Ru-vealed that only one queen voted for Shangela. (Thorgy Thor, you are redeemed.) Instead of an epic three-season long redemption arc for Shangela, whose growth and tenacity is as fitting a metaphor for \u201cDrag Race\u201d as any, we got a lethargic lip-sync that ended with the crowning of the season\u2019s third best queen.\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nHeading into Thursday\u2019s finale, Shangela\u2019s biggest competition, BenDeLaCreme, had already eliminated herself in the season\u2019s first wig-snatching twist. This seemed to lock in the crown for Shangela, whose scene-stealing performances had landed her consistently in the top two throughout the competition. Alas, it was not meant to be, and comedy queen Trixie Mattel took her place in the \u201cAll Stars\u201d hall of fame after beating out Kennedy Davenport in the final lip-sync.\n\nThe threads began to unravel with Ben\u2019s self-elimination, a pseudo-noble act that reeked ever so slightly of self-importance. In the same episode, the winner had to eliminate someone and bring back one of the eliminated queens. Ben chose to bring back Morgan McMichaels, who had bombarded her with questions about why she was eliminated first, rather than Aja, who clearly performed best in the episode. In her concluding interview, Ben said: \u201cI think the actual title is more important to them than it is to me.\u201d Translation: You all know I was going to win, and my career will be fine.\n\nVH1\n\nSuddenly, the goal post had shifted. Ben seemed to think \u201cAll Stars\u201d is simply about giving more exposure to performers who need a career boost, and there is no doubt that \u201cDrag Race\u201d has spawned a community of internationally recognized drag queens. Appearing on just one episode can boost someone\u2019s profile significantly enough that she can work as a drag queen full time for many years to come. That\u2019s great for the contestants, but viewers watch the show for the competition, and they expect some semblance of fairness \u2014 or they might just revolt.\n\nThere are many factors that could have contributed to the season\u2019s disappointing ending: the eliminated queens were either envious of Shangela or friends with Trixie, the convoluted twists producers concocted to add drama ended up sabotaging the outcome, or the show\u2019s recent move from Logo to VH1 invited an audience that doesn\u2019t remember Shangela from earlier seasons and does know Trixie from her Viceland series, \u201cThe Trixie and Katya Show.\u201d If the latter is true, it could also be the case that the expanded VH1 audience is younger, whiter, and straighter than ever before.\n\nThis is not the first time a white queen has won over a better or equally talented black queen. Though not quite as cut and dry, Trixie\u2019s win over Shangela harkens to Sasha Velour\u2019s win over Shea Coule\u00e9 in Season 9. Though \u201cDrag Race\u201d winners have been a fairly mixed bag over the years, the \u201cAll Stars\u201d hall of fame now features three white winners. It\u2019s an unsettling statistic because, in contrast to regular \u201cDrag Race,\u201d \u201cAll Stars\u201d is more dependent on fan and contestant voting than RuPaul\u2019s final decisions.\n\nNo one is under the illusion that reality shows are completely fair all of the time, though reality competition shows are subject to the usual federal regulations due to the money at stake. But while viewers understand that the behind-the-scenes narrative is manipulated to create drama or keep a villain on, the final win should feel fair. Some might say it\u2019s much ado about a reality show. But \u201cDrag Race\u201d is the most successful and long-running LGBTQ show on television, one that has grown from a micro-budget cult favorite to an Emmy-winning superstar-maker. \u201cDrag Race\u201d needs to remember where it came from, and who\u2019s been there since the beginning.\n\nAnd let us say: Hallelu.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
