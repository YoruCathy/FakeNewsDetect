And while Goldblum knew first-hand that he was still alive, many of his friends and family didn't have that luxury.\n\nSpeaking with The Talk on Wednesday, the 65-year-old actor -- who is currently starring in Wes Anderson's animated dramedy Isle of Dogs -- reflected on how the hoax really scared his mother.\n\n\"It went all over the world for a little bit for a couple of hours before I could set the record straight,\" Goldblum recalled. \"So people thought that I'd died. And those were the days when I had a telephone landline and my answering machine and before I could call everybody, I got a couple of messages that I wasn't able to pick up, from like, my mother. It was, 'Jeffrey, are you there? Are you there?'\"\n\n\"So be careful about gossip,\" he added. \"Be careful about spreading something that you haven't sourced entirely or that's not factual.\"\n\n'Thor: Ragnarok' Extended Scene: Jeff Goldblum's Grandmaster and The God of Thunder Meet (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

And now, in the light of the hoax, he's not sure if he ever should visit.\n\n\"Could you imagine if that's the way I go?\" Goldblum joked. \"Wow. Could you imagine? 'They foretold the future, he actually did fall off a cliff in New Zealand.' It's got to happen some way!\"\n\nIn real life, Goldblum is actually healthy and happy and will soon be seen on the big screen reprising his role as mathematician and dino-adventurer Dr. Ian Malcolm in the upcoming Jurassic World: Forbidden Kingdom.\n\n'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' Trailer: It's a Dino Rescue Mission!
