Presley Walker Gerber, Cindy Crawford's 18-year-old son, turned heads at Paris Fashion Week on Saturday, leaving no doubt in our minds that he inherited his mom's modeling chops.\n\nGerber appeared in the Balmain Homme menswear show as part of Paris Fashion Week. Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images\n\nAs for Mom herself, she couldn't have been more proud.\n\nStuff We Love Get a daily roundup of items that will make your life easier, healthier and more stylish.

After the show, the modeling icon, her son and her daughter, 16-year-old Kaia Gerber, who's also in fashion, hit the town.\n\nThe Crawford-Gerber crew, all dressed in some form of chic black, posed for a photo while out to dinner. How they all manage to look so ethereally beautiful in dim restaurant lighting is another question. But hey ... they're models, after all.\n\nCrawford, 51, has been supportive of her children's fashion careers. They've even worked together! Last year, Kaia appeared in the same Versace show as her mother. And Presley helped re-create Cindy's iconic Pepsi ad, which will air during Super Bowl 52.\n\nIt's only sensible. With genes like that, it would be a shame to waste them!\n\nCongratulations on a fabulous show, Presley! Mom, you taught him well.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_pop_cindy_crawford_180112_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1312026/cindy-crawford-presley-gerber-today-180121-tease-01_d39a6ca933e9d9f5e19b82a4102a8d25.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1312026/cindy-crawford-presley-gerber-today-180121-tease-01_d39a6ca933e9d9f5e19b82a4102a8d25.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/cindy-crawford-cheers-son-presley-paris-fashion-week-t121483", "title": "Cindy Crawford cheers on son Presley at Paris Fashion Week", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/style/cindy-crawford-cheers-son-presley-paris-fashion-week-t121483", "title": "Proud mom Cindy Crawford cheers on 18-year-old son at Paris Fashion Week", "description": "Crawford's son, Presley Walker Gerber, definitely inherited her modeling chops.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1312026/cindy-crawford-presley-gerber-today-180121-tease-01_d39a6ca933e9d9f5e19b82a4102a8d25.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1312026/cindy-crawford-presley-gerber-today-180121-tease-01_d39a6ca933e9d9f5e19b82a4102a8d25.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1312026/cindy-crawford-presley-gerber-today-180121-tease-01_d39a6ca933e9d9f5e19b82a4102a8d25.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Proud mom Cindy Crawford cheers on 18-year-old son at Paris Fashion Week", "description": "Crawford's son, Presley Walker Gerber, definitely inherited her modeling chops.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Cindy Crawford was on hand to see her son, Presley Walker Gerber, walk the runway at Paris Fashion Week on Saturday.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_03/1312026/cindy-crawford-presley-gerber-today-180121-tease-01_d39a6ca933e9d9f5e19b82a4102a8d25.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516566240.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
