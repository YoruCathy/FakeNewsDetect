{"url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nick-cannon-on-his-unconditional-love-of-mariah-carey-and-the-return-of-wild-n-out", "text": "Over his nearly two-decade career, Nick Cannon has accomplished more than most celebrities\u2014let alone former child stars\u2014do in a lifetime.\n\nCannon is a rapper, an actor, a comedian, a director, a screenwriter, and a radio and television personality. Whether it\u2019s in the classic Drumline or the less classic Drumline: A New Beat, Cannon is always working.\n\nAnd while he\u2019s always been a multitasker, the 36-year-old has recently upped the ante when it comes to creative productivity. The star\u2019s recent decision to part ways with America\u2019s Got Talent has left Cannon with even more time to devote to his passion projects, like helming the Wild \u2019N Out reboot at MTV and working on new music.\n\nOne of Cannon\u2019s many passions recently led him to Kingston, Jamaica, where he was inspired by the local dancehall scene. Believing that this story had yet to reach a mainstream audience, Cannon wrote, directed, executive produced, and starred in a musical drama called King of the Dancehall, premiering on YouTube Red on Aug. 2.\n\nNaturally, when Nick Cannon single-handedly wills a dancehall drama into being, that film also happens to star Whoopi Goldberg, Busta Rhymes, Louis Gossett Jr., and Kreesha Turner (and it shoots on location in Jamaica).\n\nArguably, it was Cannon\u2019s insistence on juggling multiple careers and personas that landed him in hot water earlier this year.\n\nWhile taping for his Showtime stand-up special, Cannon joked that he was losing his \u201cblack card\u201d because of America\u2019s Got Talent. The implication was that Cannon felt somehow controlled or censored by the expectations of the network hosting gig.\n\nNBC allegedly believed that the joke \u201cdisparaged their brand,\u201d and may have even gone so far as to threaten Cannon with termination. So the host of the wildly popular summer talent competition quit instead.\n\n\u201cThere is no amount of money worth my dignity or my integrity,\u201d Cannon wrote in a subsequent Facebook post. \u201cNot to get too detailed but this isn\u2019t the first time executives have attempted to \u2018put me in my place\u2019 for so called unruly actions\u2026 I will not stand for it. My moral principles will easily walk away from the millions of dollars they hang over my head.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s this insistence on creative autonomy at any cost that truly sets Nick Cannon apart.\n\nDuring a recent phone call with The Daily Beast, Cannon further articulated his \u201cboss\u201d mentality. We discussed King of the Dancehall, co-parenting with Mariah Carey, and his passion for show-stopping turbans.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about King of the Dancehall, which you wrote, directed, executive produced, and starred in\u2014can you speak on your vision for this project?\n\nMore than anything it was just trying to shed light on the subculture of dancehall and Jamaica. I took a trip to Kingston and was inspired by the community so much, and I felt like there was never a story told on a mainstream platform about this world. So I figured they had all the Step Ups and the Dirty Dancings and all that, so why not have something specifically about dancehall? So I wrote it! And put it all together.\n\nDancehall is definitely having a mainstream moment right now with artists like Drake and Rihanna.\n\nYeah well that was the thing! I felt like people have been brought on to the culture for quite some time, but were never really paying homage or telling the true story of where everything comes from, the raw ideas or this actually being a lifestyle. So I wanted to do that in a big way so even more people have a chance to\u2014with Drake and Rihanna and the Justin Bieber song\u2014to actually know where that stuff came from.\n\nAnd how was shooting on location in Jamaica?\n\nIt was intense at times because it was just so raw. But we made it happen, it was an incredible experience.\n\nSo how does it feel to be doing Wild \u2019N Out again at MTV?\n\nIt\u2019s exciting! More than anything it\u2019s exciting. Again, it\u2019s something I created from nothing, with just an idea. So to see it be so successful and continue to be so successful almost 15 years later and hundreds of episodes later\u2014this generation and the previous generation. And we\u2019re expanding in so many different ways, different verticals, brick and mortar, sports bars, Wild \u2019N Out comedy clubs. And bringing out all the new talent that you see as well, just giving other people even more opportunities through the Wild \u2019N Out brand.\n\nIn the past you\u2019ve compared Wild \u2019N Out to Def Comedy Jam and In Living Color, and you\u2019ve certainly helped launch the careers of a bunch of comedians, and black comedians specifically.\n\nDefinitely\u2014this was the first place a lot of people were introduced to Katt Williams and Kevin Hart. Even people on SNL like Taran Killam and Pete Davidson, these are people who started their career on Wild \u2019N Out. It\u2019s been a great platform for young comedians and hip-hop culture. So I take pride in that, to be able to build up young talent and give them a platform.\n\nWild \u2019N Out is really unique in that you have these huge celebrities on, and they\u2019re actually willing to be honest and candid. I saw that episode you just did with Blac Chyna, and you guys really went there.\n\n(Laughs.) Yeah, I mean you just got to create an environment of fun. And an environment where no one\u2019s taking themselves too seriously. And so we offer them that. Cause everybody\u2019s handling everything with gravity, and we\u2019re like no, this is an environment where you can address things and address them in a way that says it\u2019s not as serious as everyone makes it. So you can have that fun\u2014and obviously usually I\u2019m the first to take it, I bear the brunt of everyone\u2019s jokes, and so everyone sees it like, \u201cHey, Nick\u2019s not tripping, so why should anyone else.\u201d\n\nSo if a celebrity came with a list of off-limits topics, would you not be about that?\n\nNah, that happens all the time! Sometimes people will come on and say please don\u2019t say anything about this and this, and we\u2019re sensitive to that. We\u2019re nice and professional people! So if you ask us not to talk about something, we\u2019ll follow the rules. We can be professional!\n\nWhen all of the stuff was going down with America\u2019s Got Talent, you wrote a statement that touched on the lack of minority executives in the entertainment industry, which is a huge issue, and the challenges of being a black artist in general\u2014do you feel like you\u2019ve seen any sort of progress on that front over the course of your career?\n\nDefinitely\u2026 We\u2019ve come a long way but we\u2019ve got a long way to go. A lot of times for me it\u2019s more about the mentality. When it comes to talent specifically, they have to \u201cknow their place\u201d or \u201cbe grateful to have the opportunity,\u201d and that\u2019s not for me at all. I\u2019m more about creating my own, and developing and owning and having equity, not only with studios and brands but with content, and owning IP, not just because that\u2019s where the money is, but that\u2019s where the power is as well. So I just don\u2019t like that employee mentality. I feel like I can\u2019t be an employee anymore, I aim to be a boss and an owner in everything that I do. So when someone puts me in a position where they want to treat me a certain way, and question me, then I have to step up.\n\nAt what point did you get so comfortable calling people out and asserting yourself like that?\n\n(Laughs.) You know what, I feel like I\u2019ve always been doing that? I just don\u2019t really care about the consequences, I care about staying true to myself. So it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh I\u2019ve reached a certain point and now I can do it.\u201d I\u2019ve always done it. And luckily I am in a position where even when there are consequences\u2026 like I\u2019m no longer working on America\u2019s Got Talent, but there are other jobs, so it doesn\u2019t really phase me.\n\nYou mean you don\u2019t need the money.\n\nRight. Pretty much!\n\nOK, shifting from a serious issue to sort of a silly one: The internet went sort of wild when you were spotted at the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show wearing a turban\u2014were you surprised that everyone was tweeting about it and all that? Because you\u2019ve been wearing turbans for a while now, right?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s been a minute. I mean I guess I\u2019m a stylish person, but I never really set out to make a statement and style with it. It\u2019s more of a cultural thing, but I guess it\u2019s part of my style too. I never really give that stuff too much attention\u2014when it comes to being flamboyant, it\u2019s like, why not? Why not rock a pink turban?\n\nDoes it upset you when people judge you on the internet, or have you been famous for so long that you actually don\u2019t read the comments?\n\nI definitely read the comments! I read it, laugh at it, and put it on Wild \u2019N Out, most of the time! That\u2019s great banter. And none of that stuff really phases me because it\u2019s not real life. It\u2019s stuff that you can always laugh at. I always say I\u2019m not worried about other people\u2019s opinions, I just laugh and keep it moving and then do it all over again.\n\nThere is constant speculation about how you and your ex-wife (Mariah Carey) have managed to remain such close friends and co-parents even after your split\u2014from the outside, it just looks like a really healthy relationship. How have you managed to stay so close with your ex? What\u2019s the secret?\n\nIt\u2019s really just about unconditional love, taking your ego out of the situation and understanding that that\u2019s how it goes. You\u2019ve moved on, but at the end of the day you\u2019ve got to raise children. It\u2019s pretty simple when you think about it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem so simple though!\n\nYou\u2019re right\u2014you can make it hard or you can just deal with it and embrace it, and I think everybody\u2019s coming from a positive place.\n\nAre you sick of having to constantly address rumors that you\u2019re getting back together?\n\nYeah, I mean there\u2019s a rumor about that every week, there\u2019s a rumor about who I\u2019m dating. There are so many rumors that I don\u2019t even pay attention to it anymore.\n\nUnless they\u2019re really funny.\n\nExactly. I try to find the humor in it.\n\nSo what other projects are you working on right now?\n\nI\u2019m focusing on music. I have so much free time after America\u2019s Got Talent, that used to take up my entire summer, and so now I\u2019ve just been focusing\u2014I\u2019ve got a hot record out right now with Quavo called \u201cDream Girl\u201d that\u2019s been shooting up the charts. Aside from that I\u2019ve been DJ\u2019ing and building up the Wild \u2019N Out brand like I told you, getting all that together and getting ready for the next season, so I\u2019ve been busier than ever. Obviously the film is coming out and then I\u2019m working on another film, doing the same thing, writing, financing, shooting everything but this one takes place in Inglewood, California, and it\u2019s a basketball film about female street ball called She-ball. So that\u2019s kind of cool.\n\nWhere do you think your sound is at right now? Because you\u2019ve obviously been making music for a while.\n\nI\u2019m always going to be influenced by gospel music because that\u2019s my favorite type of music. The older stuff I\u2019m always going to be influenced by. But the stuff I\u2019m vibing with, that I\u2019m loving out there right now, is everything from Kehlani, who\u2019s actually one of my artists that I discovered, to everything that\u2019s going on in the hip-hop scene, from Kendrick to Chance to Migos. Those are the guys I\u2019m paying close attention to because that\u2019s who I\u2019m chasing right now.\n\nAnd are you still enrolled at Howard University?\n\nI am! I\u2019m still trying to figure that out, school starts on the 22nd of August I think, so got to get all of that stuff together.\n\nWhat are you studying?\n\nI\u2019m majoring in strategic, legal and management communication in the school of communications.\n\nSo that\u2019s a lot you have going on!\n\nAlways.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1501630706/170802-zimmerman-nick-cannon-hero_j0zf0o", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779073/author/amy-halperin-zimmerman-author.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1501630706/170802-zimmerman-nick-cannon-hero_j0zf0o", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1501630706/170802-zimmerman-nick-cannon-hero_j0zf0o", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nick-cannon-on-his-unconditional-love-of-mariah-carey-and-the-return-of-wild-n-out", "title": "Nick Cannon on His \u2018Unconditional Love\u2019 of Mariah Carey and the Return of \u2018Wild \u2019N Out\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Nick Cannon on His \u2018Unconditional Love\u2019 of Mariah Carey and the Return of \u2018Wild \u2019N Out\u2019", "keywords": "Mariah Carey, MTV, America's Got Talent, Nick Cannon", "og": {"title": "Nick Cannon on His \u2018Unconditional Love\u2019 of Mariah Carey and the Return of \u2018Wild \u2019N Out\u2019", "description": "The 36-year-old multi-hyphenate talks what it takes to co-parent twins with the Elusive Chanteuse, along with juggling a new film, new music, and MTV\u2019s reboot of \u2018Wild \u2019N Out.\u2019", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/nick-cannon-on-his-unconditional-love-of-mariah-carey-and-the-return-of-wild-n-out", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1501630706/170802-zimmerman-nick-cannon-hero_j0zf0o"}, "description": "The 36-year-old multi-hyphenate talks what it takes to co-parent twins with the Elusive Chanteuse, along with juggling a new film, new music, and MTV\u2019s reboot of \u2018Wild \u2019N Out.\u2019", "authors": "Amy Zimmerman", "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2017-08-02T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/authors/amy-zimmerman"}, "fb": {"app_id": 189930913679}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thedailybeast", "creator": "@ahzimm", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_600/f_jpg/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1501630706/170802-zimmerman-nick-cannon-hero_j0zf0o"}, "sailthru.date": "2017-08-02T05:00:00.000Z", "sailthru.expire_date": "2017-08-16T05:00:00.000Z", "publicationDate": 201708020500, "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Amy Zimmerman\",\"link\":\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/nick-cannon-on-his-unconditional-love-of-mariah-carey-and-the-return-of-wild-n-out\",\"metadata\":{\"articleType\":\"article\",\"rubric\":\"NEXT STEP\"},\"post_id\":\"nick-cannon-on-his-unconditional-love-of-mariah-carey-and-the-return-of-wild-n-out\",\"pub_date\":\"2017-08-02T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"tags\":[\"Mariah Carey\",\"MTV\",\"America\\u0027s Got Talent\",\"Nick Cannon\",\"typeArticle\"],\"title\":\"Nick Cannon on His \u2018Unconditional Love\u2019 of Mariah Carey and the Return of \u2018Wild \u2019N Out\u2019\",\"type\":\"post\"}"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Bju_5l5NVQ?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UQds5MR08Q?&enablejsapi=1&playsinline=0&autoplay=0"], "publish_date": 1501650000.0, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
