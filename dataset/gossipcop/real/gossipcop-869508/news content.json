In the video, Bobbi belts out Adele\u2019s \u201cSomeone Like You,\u201d crooning: \u201cDon\u2019t forget me, I beg / I\u2019ll remember you said / Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMy Prerogative\u201d singer added information for The National Domestic Violence Hotline to the end of the video. \u201cToday we remember you #BobbiKristina ?#eN?ough #LoveShouldntHurt ??\u201d he wrote.\n\nBobbi Kristina, who was also the daughter of Whitney Houston, was found unresponsive in a bathtub at her Georgia home in January 2015. She passed away on July 26, 2015, at age 22 after spending nearly six months in a medically induced coma.\n\nOne month after her death, Bobbi Kristina\u2019s estate filed a $50 million wrongful death suit against Nick Gordon, her boyfriend at the time. The estate\u2019s conservator, Bedelia Hargrove, alleged in court documents that \u201cMs. Brown died due to a violent altercation with [Gordon] after which he placed her in a bathtub, unconscious, after he injected her with a toxic mixture.\u201d\n\nGordon, who was like a brother to Bobbi Kristina before they started dating in 2012, vehemently denied these allegations. However, he was found \u201clegally responsible\u201d in the civil lawsuit after he failed to show up to a court appearance in September 2016. Two months later, he was ordered to pay more than $36 million in damages.\n\nAt the time, Bobby responded to the judgment in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cI am pleased with the outcome of today\u2019s court proceedings. All I ever wanted was answers relating to who and what caused my daughter\u2019s death,\u201d the statement said. \u201cToday\u2019s judgment tells me it was Nick Gordon. Now I need to process all the emotions I have and lean on God to get me and my family through this.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobbi-kristina-105dab4e-56e9-4c56-9b6f-83c04818b09f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1368px%2C718px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/whitney-houston-kristina-and-bobby-brown-4aa7db98-600f-405b-af6a-74d9ef4f3ae4.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobbi-kristina-105dab4e-56e9-4c56-9b6f-83c04818b09f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1368px%2C770px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobbi-kristina-105dab4e-56e9-4c56-9b6f-83c04818b09f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1368px%2C718px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bobbi-kristina-brown-sings-adele-in-video-shared-two-years-after-her-death-w494585/", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown Sings Adele in Video Shared Two Years After Her Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bobbi Kristina Brown sings an Adele song in a video shared by her father, Bobby Brown, on the second anniversary of his daughter\u2019s death \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown Sings Adele in Video Shared Two Years After Her Death", "description": "Bobbi Kristina Brown sings an Adele song in a video shared by her father, Bobby Brown, on the second anniversary of his daughter\u2019s death \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bobbi-kristina-brown-sings-adele-in-video-shared-two-years-after-her-death-w494585/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:47:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobbi-kristina-105dab4e-56e9-4c56-9b6f-83c04818b09f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1368px%2C718px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobbi-kristina-105dab4e-56e9-4c56-9b6f-83c04818b09f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1368px%2C718px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-07-27T19:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:47:21+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bobbi Kristina Brown sings an Adele song in a video shared by her father, Bobby Brown, on the second anniversary of his daughter\u2019s death \u2014 watch", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown Sings Adele in Video Shared Two Years After Her Death", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobbi-kristina-105dab4e-56e9-4c56-9b6f-83c04818b09f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1368px%2C718px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501182960.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
