I don\u2019t know why Fergie isn\u2019t on the project. You will have to ask Fergie that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe other members of the group which formed in 1995 are apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda) and Taboo (Jaime Luis Gomez). Fergie joined them in 2002.\n\nAdams revealed that the group has a WhatsApp group chat called \u201cBlack Eyed Peas family\u201d which Fergie isn\u2019t a part of. However, Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Sherzinger is in it.\n\n\u201cIt has nothing to do with making music or money. It\u2019s about friendship,\u201d explained Adams of the group chat, not mentioning if they will be working with her. They did consider her as a member in the early 2000s, but she had to decline for another project.\n\nHe also said there\u2019s no news from Scherzinger if the Pussycat Dolls will make a comeback.\n\nAfter finding success with Black Eyed Peas, Fergie went solo in 2006, then worked with the group in 2009. She began working on her second solo album \u201cDouble Dutchess\u201d in 2013 and released it in September 2017.\n\nIn June 2017, rumors circulated that Fergie had left the group. She and Adams both clarified that she was still in it but that she was focusing on her new solo album.\n\nBlack Eyed Peas\u2019 hits with Fergie include \u201cWhere Is the Love\u201d, \u201cMy Humps\u201d and \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d. The group sans Fergie released its first single in seven years last January titled \u201cStreet Livin\u2019\u201d. Ni\u00f1a V.
