The two are not looking to get back together following her split from Younes Bendjima, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively.\n\n\u201cNothing with Scott is rumored or even remotely on the horizon at all, so while people will inevitably try to spin it and say he\u2019ll try and get back with her, they aren\u2019t going to,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cHe and Sofia [Richie] are happy where they are now and they\u2019re simply doing their own thing, and Scott and Kourtney are coparenting their kids as they have been with great success.\u201d (The exes share Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3.)\n\nThe source adds: \u201cScott will always love and be there for Kourtney and is just happy that they are on good terms for the sake of their kids. He has Sofia and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered with any drama.\u201d\n\nUs confirmed on Tuesday, August 7, that Kardashian, 39, and Bendjima broke up the same day photos surfaced of the 26-year-old model with another woman in Mexico. He denied being unfaithful, though the reality star\u2019s sisters, Kim Kardashian and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, called him out on social media on Tuesday. \u201cShe ended it because it just wasn\u2019t working anymore,\u201d a source told Us. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any dramatic moment.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Kris Jenner opened up about the possibility of her eldest daughter reuniting with Disick, 35. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody can ever predict what\u2019s going to happen with this family, so I\u2019ve learned long ago to not really make my judgment on the different couple relationships when there\u2019s a rift, especially with Scott, because Scott\u2019s like my family,\u201d the momager, 62, exclusively told Us on July 24. \u201cI love him very much. I feel like he\u2019s my son, and he\u2019s been around for going on 13 years, I think, and he\u2019s the father of my grandchildren, so with us it\u2019s like he\u2019s family. So I look at it much differently from the inside than somebody might look at it from the outside.\u201d\n\nJenner reiterated that the duo are focused on their children: \u201cI think from the outside, there is this shift because they\u2019re coparenting these beautiful kids, and everybody really does get along, and the kids are happy. And all I really care about is that the kids are happy. I want happiness for my children, of course, but my grandkids, it\u2019s really important that they stay really happy and grounded and they understand what\u2019s going on in this transition, and I think everybody\u2019s doing OK.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief split in June, Us broke the news in July that Disick was taking the next step with Richie, 19, whom he has been dating since September 2017. \u201cScott and Sofia are moving in together,\u201d an insider revealed at the time. \u201cShe\u2019ll move into his house.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Carly Sloane and Brody Brown\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nFor the latest celebrity news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d below!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges-music/images/badges/en_badge_web_music.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Scott-Disick-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-not-getting-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Scott-Disick-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-not-getting-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Sofia-Richie-and-Scott-Disick1.jpg?w=294", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Scott-Disick-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-not-getting-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-not-getting-back-together-after-younes-split/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick Not Getting Back Together After Younes Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick don\u2019t want to reboot their romance after her split from Younes Bendjima, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick Not Getting Back Together After Younes Split", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick don\u2019t want to reboot their romance after her split from Younes Bendjima, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-not-getting-back-together-after-younes-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:07:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Scott-Disick-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-not-getting-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Scott-Disick-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-not-getting-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-08-08T18:40:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:07:55+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick don\u2019t want to reboot their romance after her split from Younes Bendjima, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 details", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian, Scott Disick Not Getting Back Together After Younes Split", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Scott-Disick-and-Kourtney-Kardashian-not-getting-back-together.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533753639.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
