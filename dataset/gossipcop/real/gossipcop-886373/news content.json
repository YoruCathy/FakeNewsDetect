Ever the hero, Archie accepted the prosecutor\u2019s deal for a lessened sentence even though his trial resulted in a hung jury. The boy-next-door doesn\u2019t want to put his parents and friends through that again!\n\nShowrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa told TheWrap in an interview ahead of the premiere that we\u2019re out of the courtroom for the season, but now everyone will be working together to try to free Archie. He also said that he was inspired by classic noir films like \u201cShawshank Redemption\u201d for scenes in which Archie is behind bars.\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale' Finally Casts Its Gladys and Jellybean\n\nAguirre-Sacasa also quelled our fears about Betty, who was left seizing on her porch at the end of the episode.\n\n\u201cBetty\u2019s very good at throwing herself into projects,\u201d he said, adding that she and Jughead will be teaming up and focusing on the Gargoyle King mystery. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the big mysteries, is are the seizures connected to the Gargoyle King? What is the Gargoyle King exactly?\u201d\n\nSee our interview with Aguirre-Sacasa below.\n\nTheWrap: You\u2019ve said that Season 3 won\u2019t be too heavy on the courtroom stuff with Archie. Now that he\u2019s pled guilty and he\u2019s in juvenile detention, what can you say about his fate?\n\nAguirre-Sacasa: \u201cThat\u2019s it for the trial stuff. We are definitely going to see Archie in juvenile detention. You know, we always do kind of noir and crime stuff, and we wanted to do some \u2014 there are some great, obviously, classic noirs that are set in prisons and jails, so we wanted to do sort of like almost an homage to \u201cShawshank Redemption,\u201d which is one of my favorite movies. And yeah, on the outside, we\u2019re definitely going to see everyone working to get Archie out. Especially Veronica, who doesn\u2019t want to be separated from her man.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Why Sabrina Didn't End up on 'Riverdale' -- Or on the Big Screen\n\nSpeaking of Veronica, she tells her dad in this episode, \u201cYou have no daughter.\u201d So how is that going to affect the Lodge family? Hermione especially, dealing with this crazy family life and mayoral duties.\n\n\u201cHermione\u2019s definitely caught between the two of them. And you know, Veronica and Hiram, they did fight last year, but Veronica\u2019s always been kind of a Daddy\u2019s Girl, and I think in Season 3 we really see her stop being that, and start being a real rival to her father. Last year, it was all about Hiram and Archie, and this year it\u2019s all about Veronica and Hiram.\u201d\n\nAnother character I wanted to ask you about is Betty. We find out she\u2019s been lying and hiding drugs all summer, and really avoiding the trauma from Season 2 \u2014 and then the episode ends with her having a seizure! How might this affect the rest of the season?\n\n\u201cI think you know, the good thing about this season is that after the premiere, we have a great murder mystery and a great sort of mystery and you know, shocking crime for Betty and Jughead to investigate. So Betty\u2019s very good at throwing herself into projects. So she\u2019s going to throw herself into that. And she\u2019s also going to throw herself into helping her mom, who is getting deeper and deeper into this place called the farm.\u201d\n\nYes \u2014 and in the trailer we saw the Gargoyle King right behind Betty. So is that related to the end scene when she is seizing and having this crazy vision of the babies floating?\n\n\u201cOne aspect of this season is we\u2019re going to see how all these things tie together \u2014 or if they do. And that\u2019s one of the big mysteries, is are the seizures connected to the Gargoyle King? What is the Gargoyle King exactly?\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale' Star Lili Reinhart on Her 'Twin Peaks' Inspiration for Season 3's Flashback Episode\n\nI know you said you\u2019ve been inspired by the first season of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotally.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m interested in is this game that Dilton and Ben are playing. What can you tell us about this game? Will that be part of the mystery?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really big aspect of the season. You know, when I was a kid, or when I was a teenager, Dungeons & Dragons was huge. It was kind of when it first really broke out. And a lot of adults and parents were against Dungeons & Dragons because they thought it like led to Satanism and murder and suicide and cult behavior. So Griffins & Gargoyles is sort of Riverdale\u2019s version of Dungeons & Dragons. How the game fits into all of this is also sort of part of this \u2018True Detective\u2019-like mystery.\u201d\n\nWe also in the premiere see the return of the Ghoulies when the Serpents are trying to save Hot Dog. How much will that rivalry play into the rest of the season?\n\n\u201cIt felt like last year we did a lot of stuff with the Serpents, and we did a significant amount of stuff with the Ghoulies. You know, Jughead is the Serpent King, Betty is the Serpent Queen. The Serpents are definitely in conflict with other gangs. That\u2019s a world that we\u2019re not leaving behind, but I\u2019d say that Betty and Jughead are mostly focused on the mystery at first.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale': There's a Creepy New Mystery Promised in the New Season 3 Teaser (Video)\n\nAnd then I had a question for you just about your day-to-day. How has it been balancing \u201cRiverdale\u201d and \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d?\n\n\u201cBrutal! Brutal, brutal, brutal. I mean listen, you know, I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s been exhausting and challenging and I don\u2019t have weekends anymore and I don\u2019t sleep. But I love the shows, so it\u2019s easy to kind of throw myself into it. I have such great writing staffs, they make it possible. And really it\u2019s like two groups of, two teams working at the best of their, at the top of their game. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nWe know not to expect a crossover at least anytime soon, but when working on two shows at the same time, do you find that an idea you had for \u201cRiverdale\u201d might not work there, but on \u201cSabrina\u201d instead, or vice versa?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really good question. Yeah, you know there\u2019s always a little bit of cross-pollination that way. I will say that the shows are \u2014 because the genre is different, one is horror and one is pulpy crime, there\u2019s not tons of overlap. But I think there\u2019s no denying that they\u2019re both products of their time. And you know, that they kind of refract what I\u2019m thinking about and what the writers are thinking about. But they\u2019re pretty distinct, I would say.\u201d\n\nWe finally got to learn about the Gladys and Jellybean casting during New York Comic-Con over the weekend, which I know was exciting for fans.\n\n\u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale' Casts Anthony Michael Hall as Principal for 'Breakfast Club' Inspired Flashback Episode\n\nHave they been on set already? What can you tease about how they\u2019ll fit in?\n\n\u201cWe just shot their first episode, and they\u2019re amazing. I love them. I love them I love them I love them. They\u2019re great. You know, Gina Gershon is an icon obviously, and she\u2019s been in two of my favorite crime movies. She was in a movie called \u201cKiller Joe\u201d and she was also in one of the great modern pulp noirs, \u201cBound,\u201d which I love. And she knew Skeet [Ulrich] \u2014 it\u2019s amazing. And Trinity, who plays Jellybean, she\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nAnd how will Betty get along with Jellybean and Gladys?\n\n\u201cVery good question. Probably not well, right?\u201d\n\nDuring our interview at TCA this summer, we talked about another musical episode happening in Season 3. Have you narrowed down which musical yet?\n\n\u201cI definitely still want to do it, it\u2019s obviously one of my \u2014 it\u2019s such a fan favorite episode, and we all love it. You know, we haven\u2019t narrowed it down yet. We have a list, a running list, but it really has to be the perfect musical at the perfect time for it to work, or else it just won\u2019t be as good as last season. And kind of no one wants that, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nYeah. So we talked about \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d you mentioned \u201cShawshank Redemption,\u201d and obviously the flashback episode is inspired by \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d \u2014 what, if any, other pop culture or pulp crime touchstones did you draw inspiration from for this season?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely, you know for Veronica\u2026 she says in the [Season 2] finale, she said she\u2019s opening a speakeasy. And we\u2019re really like\u2026 there are a couple of homages to like the movie \u201cCasino,\u201d a little bit younger, the Tom Cruise movie \u201cRisky Business.\u201d We\u2019ve got some\u2026 You know the movie \u201cCabaret\u201d or the musical \u201cCabaret\u201d is obviously another inspiration. So we\u2019re going to add a little bit of showbiz glamour to Riverdale with the speakeasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRiverdale\u201d airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on The CW.", "images":
