I love this country and honestly tried my best.\"\n\nThe statement comes 18 hours after Fergie stood at center court inside Staples Center to perform \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in front of a starry set of A-listers (Beyonc\u00e9, Cardi B, Chris Rock, Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Jimmy Kimmel, Kevin Hart, Chance the Rapper and Dave Chappelle among them) and the league's most prominent basketball stars (LeBron James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook).\n\nFergie, who is hosting Fox reality competition show The Four on the heels of releasing her second studio album Double Dutchess in late 2017, delivered a version that many have described as jazzy, blues-inspired and sexed-up. Others simply called it not good, and social media users were quick to weigh in and #FergieNationalAnthem became a trending topic on Twitter.\n\nRoseanne Barr faced critics after her own disastrous 1990 performance. She weighed in, too, tweeting on Sunday night, \"Who saw Fergie's national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game? I think mine was better lowkey.\"\n\nThis All Star opening is confusing me. WTF is going on? Anyone? \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) February 19, 2018\n\nWho saw Fergie's national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game?
