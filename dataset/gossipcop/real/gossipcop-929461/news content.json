Kym Johnson gave birth to her twins with husband Robert Herjavec on Monday, April 23. The first-time mom shared a photo of her beau holding the newborns via Instagram.\n\n\u201cI never thought my heart could feel so full. We\u2019re so in love with our little angels. Born at 7.44am and 7.45am 4/23/18,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe dancer told Us Weekly in January that Herjavec, 55, had put together a baby shower in Australia for her ahead of the twins\u2019 arrival. \u201c[Robert] is the best. He spoiled me with a trip back home to Australia to see all my girlfriends,\u201d she gushed to Us and a group of reporters. \u201cThere was a little baby shower and saw my family and stuff so that was nice. I feel really good. I\u2019ve been keeping active and I think I\u2019ll probably slow down now. I\u2019m in the last trimester. I feel like I\u2019m about to explode.\u201d\n\nJohnson continued: \u201cOh my gosh, all my girlfriends gave me some really good Australian books, with Australian native animals. I want the kids to know their heritage and that was really sweet, to have those books to be able to read to them,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was some Aussie onesies and things like that, that you can only get in Australia. That was sweet.\u201d\n\nDuring her pregnancy, the Australian professional dancer proudly showed off her baby bump on social media. She shared a video of herself working out in January. \u201cBack in the studio with my growing belly! (23 weeks),\u201d she captioned an Instagram clip at the time. \u201cI\u2019ll be teaching this Saturday morning 10am so come join me for Dance Fit Latin #dance #fitness #pregnantfitness #23weekspregnant #twins.\u201d She also shared some snaps of her workout to her Instagram Story. \u201cFeeling strong,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe babies are happy to be back.\u201d\n\nJohnson, 41, confirmed in December 2017 that she and her husband were expecting. The mom-to-be shared a sonogram photo on Instagram, and captioned it: \u201cIt\u2019s thumbs up.\u201d A source then confirmed to Us Weekly the following day that the couple were expecting twins.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a thumbs up\u201d \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd30\ud83d\udc95 A post shared by Kym Herjavec (@kymherjavec5678) on Dec 11, 2017 at 10:54am PST\n\nThe former Dancing With the Stars partners tied the knot in July 2016 at a romantic ceremony in Los Angeles, one year after their stint as partners on season 20 of the ABC hit series. The DWTS pro spoke to Us Weekly at the 2016 Creative Arts Emmy Awards in September 2016, just months after saying \u201cI do.\u201d She told Us: \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing. It\u2019s been the most incredible summer of my life.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThe ceremony was amazing. I was most nervous about that, but that was the most beautiful moment. Even though our family and friends were all there, it was really just about Robert and I at that moment. It was just us two, exchanging our vows, and that was the most special moment.\u201d\n\nThe investor and Shark Tank personality was previously married to Diane Plese, with whom he shares three children. They divorced in 2016.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kym-johnson-and-robert-herjavec.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kym-johnson-and-robert-herjavec.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kym-johnson-and-robert-herjavec.jpg?crop=0px%2C53px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kym-johnson-robert-herjavec-welcome-twins/", "title": "Kym Johnson Gives Birth, Welcomes Twins With Robert Herjavec", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Dancing With the Stars' Kym Johnson has given birth to her twins with husband Robert Herjavec on Monday, April 23 \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "First Pic!
