You can\u2019t hide,\u2019\u201d, Williams said in a profile of the duchess that was published in Vanity Fair in 2017.\n\nThis year, both Meghan and Williams were thrust into the spotlight to an even greater degree than usual, what with the duchess becoming a member of the royal family and Williams becoming embroiled in a widely discussed row with US Open umpire Carlos Ramos.\n\nWilliams spoke to Lisa Wilkinson of The Sunday Project about her friendship with Meghan, and the way in which it\u2019s evolved as of late.\n\n\u201cWe were actually just texting each other this morning,\u201d she said when Wilkinson asked how often they correspond.\n\n\u201cWe have known each other for a long time, but we really are relying on each other a lot recently.\u201d\n\nShowing their support\n\nThe royal family often visits Wimbledon during the annual tennis championships.\n\nHowever, this year when Meghan took her seat in the royal box alongside her sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, she did so both as a tennis fan and as a supporter of her close friend, 23-time Grand Slam winner Serena Williams.\n\nMeghan watched as her friend lost the Women\u2019s Singles Final to Angelique Kerber, who won the match in straight sets.\n\nA couple of months later, it was revealed that Meghan had been involved in the creation of the Together: Our Community Cookbook, a recipe book produced with the aim of supporting families affected by the tragic Grenfell Tower fire.\n\nWilliams tweeted her support of Meghan\u2019s first solo project as a member of the royal family, writing: \u201cI used to call you Meghan (and I still do) but dear Duchess of Sussex your first project \u2018Together\u2019 a cookbook bringing women of all cultures together.\n\n\u201cI could not be more excited about it and proud of you,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful - diversity, inclusivity, coming together in grief and joy.\u201d\n\nWhile Williams may be regarded as one of the greatest athletes of all time, she also has another pastime that she\u2019s very passionate about: fashion.\n\nEarlier this year, she revealed the launch of her very own eponymous fashion line, which features a variety of casual, smart and sportswear.\n\nWhile in Australia with Prince Harry as part of a 16-day tour, Meghan wore a piece from Williams\u2019 clothing collection: the \u2018Serena Boss Blazer\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe face you make when you and the Duchess of Sussex Meghan have matching @serena blazers,\u201d Williams wrote on Instagram.\n\nGlitz and glam\n\nOn May 19 when Meghan and Prince Harry married at St George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor, many people were enthralled by the sheer volume of A-list celebrities who attended the ceremony, including the likes of Amal and George Clooney, Victoria and David Beckham and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWilliams attended the nuptials with her husband Alexis Ohanian, wearing a blush pink Versace wrap dress and Bulgari jewellery.\n\nFor the evening reception, William changed into a Pierpaolo Piccioli black and floral gown, which she paired with a pair of comfortable, Valentino trainers.\n\n\u201cLittle known fact: I often wear sneakers under my evening gown,\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThese @maisonvalentino @pppiccioli gave to me last min. I told him be careful I tend to be comfy for long nights.\"", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/18/13/meghan-serena.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/18/13/meghan-serena.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/meghan-markle-serena-williams-friendship-jacket-royal-wedding-super-bowl-a8590056.html", "title": "Meghan Markle and Serena Williams: A timeline of the duchess' friendship with the tennis superstar", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/meghan-markle-serena-williams-friendship-jacket-royal-wedding-super-bowl-a8590056.html", "title": "A timeline of Meghan Markle\u2019s friendship with Serena Williams", "description": "The pair have bonded over the trials and tribulations of being in the public eye", "updated_time": "2018-10-18T14:30:38+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/18/13/meghan-serena.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5839318610001_5839318643001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5839318643001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/8590056"}, "description": "Over the past eight years, the Duchess of Sussex and Serena Williams\u2019 friendship has gone from strength to strength.
