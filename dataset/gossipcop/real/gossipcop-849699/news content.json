Nine years after the actor\u2019s untimely death at 28 from an accidental, lethal combination of prescription medications, such a movie has arrived, and it is hardly boring.\n\nDirected by Derik Murray and Adrian Buitenhuis, the film paints a portrait of the Australian actor through footage he took himself \u2014 he seemed always to have a camera in hand \u2014 and interviews with his family, friends and colleagues. Among the talking heads are childhood friends, his ex-girlfriend Naomi Watts, his longtime agent and friend Steve Alexander and directors including Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) and Catherine Hardwicke (Lords of Dogtown).\n\nThe documentary, which airs tonight on Spike at 10 p.m. EST and will be available on iTunes and Amazon on May 23, aims to reveal the person behind not only the roles but also the ravenous tabloid coverage that followed his death. Through the memories of those closest to him, Ledger is resurrected as a devoted father, an actor whose constant striving was often fueled by self-doubt, a lover of music, chess and Burning Man, and a talent whose future seemed boundless.\n\nHere are some of the lesser-known elements of Ledger\u2019s story which the film brings into focus:\n\nHe was certain he had flubbed a major screen test with his idol, Mel Gibson.\n\nLedger grew up idolizing the Mad Max actor, who was once the biggest Australian movie star. When he went to do a screen test for the 2000 Gibson starrer The Patriot, he flubbed his lines, then stopped the audition and apologized to Gibson and director Roland Emmerich for wasting their time. But Gibson and Emmerich saw something in the young actor and took a chance on him, giving him his first big role since breaking out in 10 Things I Hate About You.\n\nMORE: Jake Gyllenhaal on How Heath Ledger\u2019s Death Affected Him\n\nIt was during the promotion of A Knight\u2019s Tale that Ledger began to really struggle with fame.\n\nLedger\u2019s next move after The Patriot was the medieval adventure film A Knight\u2019s Tale. His ruggedly handsome face and tousled hair \u2014 accompanied by the promise, \u201cHe will rock you\u201d \u2014 was plastered all over Los Angeles, and he was set to tour the U.S. as the film\u2019s \u201csecret weapon.\u201d But the role of salesman didn\u2019t sit well with the actor. As his friend, the director Matt Amato, puts it in the documentary, \u201cHe wanted fame. And then when he got it, he didn\u2019t want it. He was mortified, and he felt owned.\u201d\n\nHeath Ledger in 2006. Sarah Rhodes\u2014Getty Images\n\nAng Lee cast Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain because of his performance in Monster\u2019s Ball.\n\nLee says that initially he wasn\u2019t sure if Ledger could carry the film. He ended up hiring him based on his work in Monster\u2019s Ball, in which he plays a corrections officer opposite Billy Bob Thornton. Lee adds that Ledger is the only actor he has ever allowed to look at the monitor after takes. Rather than making him overly self-aware, as Lee feared such self-observation might, Ledger used the process to reflect on his performance and turn out even better takes.\n\nLedger\u2019s romantic interest in his Brokeback costar Michelle Williams became clear after she got injured on set.\n\nWhile filming a scene in which Ennis (Ledger) and Alma (Williams) go sledding, the toboggan flipped and Williams needed to be taken to the hospital. \u201cWhen we reached the hospital we saw Heath holding her hand trying to comfort her,\u201d Lee recalls in the film. \u201cIt was pretty obvious he was interested in her.\u201d Their daughter Matilda was born the following year, and they remained together until 2007.\n\nHe once surprised his friend, the musician Ben Harper, with a grand piano, asking for a lullaby in return.\n\nAfter a night playing music with Ledger on the actor\u2019s grand piano, Harper went home to get some rest. He awoke to hear a commotion outside: the piano had arrived on his doorstep, a gift from Ledger. When Harper protested his friend\u2019s generosity, Ledger told him, \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be with you.\u201d A few weeks later, Ledger, who was expecting a child with Williams, asked Harper to write a lullaby they could play for their daughter when she was born. \u201cNothing has ever been asked of me that\u2019s that precious,\u201d Harper says in the documentary.\n\nOne of his trademarks as the Joker was the result of challenges in the makeup room.\n\nLedger did much of his own makeup for his role as the Joker in Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight, a part for which he would go on to win a posthumous Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He wore a prosthetic on his mouth to create the illusion of the villain\u2019s famous scarring, but it frequently became detached when he spoke. Rather than repeatedly returning to the makeup room to have it re-glued, explains his dialogue coach Gerry Grennell, Ledger began licking his lips to keep it in place. As he repeated the motion, he began to incorporate it into the character.\n\nAn avid chess player and aspiring director, he was planning to direct a movie about the game.\n\nLedger loved chess from a young age, and he was good at it: his father Kim says that by the time his son was 10 or 11, he was difficult to beat, and he was only a few points away from achieving Grand Master status when he died. He was also an aspiring director, having directed music videos for Harper and the hip hop artist N\u2019fa, a childhood friend. He planned to combine those loves by directing an adaptation of The Queen\u2019s Gambit, a novel about a chess player who is addicted to pills, but Ledger died before production began.\n\nGet The Brief.
