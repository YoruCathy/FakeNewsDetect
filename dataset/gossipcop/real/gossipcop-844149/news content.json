In an unexpected and welcome surprise Sunday evening (4/29), Carrie Underwood was revealed to be the National Anthem performer ahead of the Nashville Predators\u2019 Stanley Cup playoff game.\n\nThe crowd, complete with red Nissan-sponsored light sabers, quickly jumped to their feet when the arena\u2019s announcer revealed the surprise guest to center ice. As each high note was hit, fans quickly applauded the country powerhouse\u2019s vocal abilities.\n\nUnderwood is a huge fan of the Nashville Predators, as both a resident of Music City and the wife of one of the players, Mike Fisher. She is often seen celebrating the team\u2019s triumphs from a box within Bridgestone Arena.\n\n\u201cI think going to the Stanley Cup Finals last year was such a confidence booster. I mean, nobody expected them to make it as far as they did. I did, but [laughs] nobody else. We seem to be the underdogs in every single situation. And seeing Mike and hearing Mike talking about those guys and how much talent was on the ice and how much they had in them, it wasn\u2019t surprising to me at all that they made it to the finals last year,\u201d Underwood said of the team spirit recently.\n\nOn Friday (4/27), the Preds faced an unfortunate loss against the Winnipeg Jets in game one of the second round of playoffs. After Sunday night\u2019s game, the teams will move to Winnipeg for the next few games.\n\nThe Oklahoma native performed the Star-Spangled Banner last year during the Predators first run in the Stanely Cup playoffs. Since then, many other country stars, including Dierks Bentley, Vince Gill, Maren Morris, among others, have taken to the ice for surprise performances.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=260180471043367&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=X2NWm1aMp4Z352", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Carrie-Underwood-Preds-1525044234.png", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Carrie-Underwood-Preds-1525044239.png", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carrie-Underwood-a-1585922991-1000x597.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/themes/soundslikenashville-v2/assets/images/brand/logo-mini-w.png", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Wayne-1587140879-1000x709.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Store-Ad-1573510267.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Carrie-Underwood-1586132327-1000x563.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Carrie-Underwood-Preds-1525044239.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/carrie-underwood-national-anthem-preds/", "title": "Carrie Underwood Brings Down The House With National Anthem at NHL Playoff Game Sounds Like Nashville", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Carrie Underwood surprised a packed crowd in Bridgestone Arena with the National Anthem ahead of the Nashville Predators playoff game.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carrie Underwood Brings Down The House With National Anthem Performance", "description": "WOW WOW WOW!", "url": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/carrie-underwood-national-anthem-preds/", "site_name": "Sounds Like Nashville", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Carrie-Underwood-Preds-1525044239.png", "secure_url": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Carrie-Underwood-Preds-1525044239.png", "width": 599, "height": 319}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/soundslikenashville", "author": "lafferlauren", "tag": "Nashville Predators", "section": "News", "published_time": "2018-04-29T23:24:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Carrie Underwood surprised a packed crowd in Bridgestone Arena with the National Anthem ahead of the Nashville Predators playoff game.", "title": "Carrie Underwood Brings Down The House With National Anthem at NHL Playoff Game", "site": "@SoundsLikeNash", "image": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/FB-Carrie-Underwood-Preds-1525044239.png", "creator": "@laurlaff1"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.2.4", "p": {"domain_verify": "99dae4a28a5644b1db204730b5be7ccc"}, "fb": {"pages": 58155286816}, "google-site-verification": "UIk94odLuKBOAyMvPay3LTMGDzELhrLFtwppaywdaiw"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525044267.0, "source": "http://www.soundslikenashville.com", "summary": ""}
