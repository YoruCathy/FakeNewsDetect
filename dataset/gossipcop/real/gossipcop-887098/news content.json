What\u2019s at issue here is a deeply troubling problem that has no place in our society. The Board continues to work to establish ethical standards of conduct that all Academy members will be expected to exemplify.\"\n\nA couple of famous members of the Academy tweeted in support of the board's decision.\n\nActress Mia Farrow, whose son Ronan recently published a New Yorker investigation with rape and sexual assault allegations against Weinstein's, wrote that she's proud of the Academy, and \"hopefully we are witnessing the end of an awful era.\"\n\nActor Ron Perlman also said he's \"proud of their decision to expel Harvey Weinstein.\"\n\nActress Marlee Matlin tweeted, \"Bravo\" to the Academy for \"highlighting willful ignorance and complicity.\u201d\n\nWeinstein becomes the second person ever to be kicked out of the Academy, after Godfather actor Carmine Caridi, who was removed in 2004 for illegally sharing Oscar screeners. Meanwhile, several Hollywood figures known for alleged sexual misconduct, including Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby, remain members.\n\nOver his career, Weinstein has cobbled together 341 Oscar nominations and 81 wins. His films include The King's Speech, TheArtist and Shakespeare in Love, all of which won best picture.\n\nEarlier: Bob Weinstein speaks out\n\nFallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal continues more than a week after an explosive New York Times investigation detailed decades of sexual harassment accusations against Weinstein. The Weinstein Company, which he helped to found has fired him, and Weinstein's wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published Saturday, Weinstein's brother Bob said he's living in \"a waking nightmare.\"\n\nBob Weinstein, co-founder of The Weinstein Company, said he knew that his brother was a philandering bully, but had no idea \"the type of predator\" his brother is accused of being. \"I want him to get the justice he deserves,\" Bob Weinstein said.\n\nMore: A timeline of Harvey Weinstein\n\nMore:Bob Weinstein: Brother Harvey is a bully who should get 'justice he deserves'\n\nMore:Can Harvey Weinstein be charged?
