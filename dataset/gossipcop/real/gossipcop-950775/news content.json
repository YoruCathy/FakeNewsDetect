In fact, photographers have captured Drake, 31, courtside at Williams' matches since 2011.\n\nRapper Drake attends day eight of the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, July 10, 2018 in London.

After losing the first set, Williams was able to turn her game around and defeat Giorgi.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what I did,\" Williams said in a post-game press conference. \"After the first set, I just said, 'Let\u2019s go three sets.' I just kept fighting. I feel good. I feel like I did better today, I had to.\"\n\nStill, Williams said she's not getting too excited as she's still adjusting to tennis after returning from maternity leave.\n\nIn September, the tennis champion and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, welcomed a daughter named Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. Three months later, Williams and Ohanian, 35, wed in an intimate New Orleans ceremony.\n\nSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Italy's Camila Giorgi during their women's singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of the 2018 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, London, July 10, 2018.

The two compete Thursday at Wimbledon.\n\nAhead of the big game in London, Williams admitted to \"Good Morning America\" that her body had changed after the baby.\n\n\"It wasn't as tight as I was used to,\" she said last month. \"I've played tennis for over 30 years, so I'm so used to [being] incredibly fit. But I realized everyone is different.\"", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-wimbeldon-1-gty-thg-180710_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-wimbeldon-1-gty-thg-180710_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "July", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/serena-williams-drake-watches-win-wimbledon-tennis-star-56483951", "title": "Serena Williams' ex, rapper Drake, watches her win at Wimbledon, tennis star headed to semifinals", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Serena Williams Wimbledon, Serena Williams Camila Giorgi, Serena Williams Drake Wimbledon, restaurants, tennis, games, singer", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
