Having announced that they're expecting their first child together, due in the Spring of 2019, the newlyweds have been greeted by royal fans in Australia this week. And the warm welcome is sure to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days.\n\nAs they're now expecting a baby, it's exciting to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an impressive royal tour wardrobe along the way.\n\nBut what makes Meghan and Harry's appearance at the Invictus Games 2018 so significant is the fact that they first made their public debut as a couple at last year's event. And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year.\n\nOn September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries:\n\nAFP Contributor Getty Images\n\nThe separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event:\n\nDanny Lawson - PA Images Getty Images\n\nAfter that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017:\n\nNow, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more unified than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have truly become a unit. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly supporting the causes and organizations that are important to them both.\n\nHaving gotten married in May 2018, and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess aren't wasting time when it comes to their love story.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/meghan-markle-jenna-coleman-emilia-wickstead-1540057487.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1052576966-1540029775.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.349xh;0,0.0558xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1052577836-1540052345.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.755xh;0,0.0865xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1052577836-1540052345.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.755xh;0,0.0865xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23983803/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-tour-invictus-games-one-year-on/", "title": "Meghan Markle & Prince Harry Attend the Invictus Games One Year On from First Appearance", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Why Meghan & Harry\u2019s Unified Appearance at the Invictus Games Is Significant", "description": "One year on from their first public appearance together, everything has changed for Meghan and Harry.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23983803/meghan-markle-prince-harry-royal-tour-invictus-games-one-year-on/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1052577836-1540052345.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.755xh;0,0.0865xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-10-20 08:49:50", "published_time": "2018-10-20 08:01:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1052577836-1540052345.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.755xh;0,0.0865xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Meghan Markle & Prince Harry Attend the Invictus Games One Year On from First Appearance", "description": "As they're now expecting a baby, it's exciting to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\ufeff attending so many events together, and displaying such an impressive royal tour wardrobe along the way\ufeff.
