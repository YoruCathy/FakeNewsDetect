The country superstar spoke the truth about turning 50 during a recent stop on the 2017 Soul2Soul Tour with husband Tim McGraw.\n\nIn between songs, Hill dished out a dose of spirit to the packed audience, saying that she's proud to be celebrating her milestone birthday. \"I\u2019m going to stand here and say this right now, I'm happy to be 50,\" she says passionately. \"You put a 25-year-old girl up here next to me and I tell ya what, I\u2019ll give her a run for her money.\"\n\nHer husband is just as excited, saying, \"I have never been so proud to have a 50-year-old wife\" with a bright smile across his face. The crowd was clearly in agreement, showing their support with ecstatic cheers. Hill turns 50 on Sept. 21.\n\nCountry's Hottest Over 40? You Decide\n\nThe superstar wasn't lying when she said she can take on someone half her age, proving her fierceness with a sexy hip shake during a show in Boston, Mass., on July 8, not to mention her praiseworthy performance of the National Anthem during Game 6 of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Nashville, slaying the audience with her rendition.\n\nIn beween dates on their massive tour, the power couple took some time to give back to those affected by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma by taking part in the Hand in Hand benefit concert on Tuesday (Sept. 12). McGraw recently announced a new business venture with Snap Fitness to create his own line of gyms, Tru Mav Signature Clubs. The Soul2Soul Tour concludes on Oct. 27 in New York City.\n\nTim McGraw Talks About 20 Years With Faith\n\nSee Tim and Faith's Best Photos Through the Years", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/faith-hill-turning-50.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2017/09/faith-hill-turning-50.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cillea Houghton"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/faith-hill-turning-50-proud/", "title": "Faith Hill Is \u2018Happy to Be 50\u2032 and Isn\u2019t Afraid to Say It!", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "Preach it Faith Hill!
