They all have lives. They\u2019ve all moved on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just human beings; we\u2019re going to be here for a very short time,\u201d Caitlyn adds. \u201cWe come and we go and at the end, when it\u2019s all said and done, hopefully your family is going to be there.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn also goes into detail about her initial plans to complete a gender transition by the time she turned 40, in 1989, only to get started, then backtrack, after she and then-wife, Kris Jenner, welcomed their daughter, Kendall, in 1995.\n\nAccording to the article, Caitlyn underwent more than four years of hormone therapy and had developed \u201ca little B-cup\u201d by the time she met Kris (who denied knowing that Caitlyn -- who went by Bruce at the time -- was transgender when they met, during an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians).\n\n\"When Kendall was born, I had liposuction and got rid of [my breasts],\u201d explains Caitlyn, who welcomed a second daughter, Kylie, with Kris in 1997, and has four other children from previous relationships. \u201cBecause I thought, \u2018I can\u2019t even go swimming with my kid.\u2019\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian Shares Throwback of Mom Kris With Caitlyn Jenner Before Her Transition This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

Screw \u2018em.\u201d\n\nAt her lowest point as Bruce, she kept a wig and women\u2019s clothing on board her plane and would allow Caitlyn to come to life while up in the sky, far away from the real world and feeling \u201cfree as can be.\u201d\n\nCaitlyn also addresses the controversy ignited by her political views and comments made during media interviews, which have upset the LBGTQ community.\n\n\u201cAlong the way, did I make mistakes? Absolutely,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I never did it maliciously. I just didn\u2019t know, you know? And I really didn\u2019t realize how critical the community was going to be.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the controversy, she stands by her political standing.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s good that I\u2019m on the Republican side because the Republicans know that, and I have an immediate in with them to change their minds,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Republicans need the most work when it comes to our issues, I get that. I would rather work from the inside. I\u2019m not the type of person who is going to stand on a street corner with a sign and jump up and down. No, I\u2019m going to go have dinner with these people.\u201d\n\nThe transgender community aren\u2019t the only ones whom she has felt \u201cbashing\u201d her. The Kardashians reportedly felt \"betrayed\" when Caitlyn published her 2017 memoir, The Secrets of My Life.\n\n\u201cI got the trans community out there bashing on me, I got the Kardashians out there bashing on me,\u201d she reflects. \u201cAll I do is sit here in the house and try to stay out of trouble.\u201d\n\nSee more on the I Am Cait star below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nNEWS: Kim Kardashian Posts Throwback Photo of Caitlyn Jenner Before Her Transition\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Caitlyn Jenner 'Wasn't Happy at First' About Kylie Jenner Becoming a Young Mom, Source Says\n\nNEWS: Caitlyn Jenner Didn\u2019t Trust the Kardashians Not to Leak Her Gender Reassignment Surgery\n\nKhloe Kardashian Says Having a Baby Won't Bring Her and Caitlyn Jenner Back Together This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
