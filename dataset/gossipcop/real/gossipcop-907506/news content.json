The nod to selecting styles from designers with local roots, often called diplomatic dressing, is also done by Princess Kate on official royal diplomatic tours.\n\n\"One thing to really take into account is that Megan has always been very conscious of where she's going when she dresses,\" Scobie said. \"Of course we've seen her make nods to the locations she's at or the country she's in with the style choices she's made.\"\n\nLooking ahead to Markle's wedding day, Scobie added, \"I think on the day of the wedding we'll very much see her kind of make a nod to the different places that she feels are important to her.\"\n\nMulroney is the wife of Ben Mulroney, whose father is a former prime minister of Canada.
