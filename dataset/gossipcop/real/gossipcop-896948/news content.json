The Teen Mom OG star \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d about her ex-fiance\u2019s surprise marriage, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cAmber is happy in her new life,\u201d the source tells Us. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care that Matt is married.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Baier tied the knot with his girlfriend of six months, Jennifer Conlin, in Las Vegas on Monday, November 27. Portwood, meanwhile, is expecting with her boyfriend of five months Andrew Glennon. (Portwood is already mom to 9-year-old daughter Leah with ex Gary Shirley).\n\n\u201cWhen I first found out I was a little scared. I don\u2019t know what to expect. Having a new baby is new likes, new wants, new needs, so it\u2019s very nerve-racking,\u201d Portwood exclusively told Us earlier this month. \u201dWe\u2019re both very happy. I feel like it\u2019s a new chapter of my life.\u201d\n\nPortwood and Baier officially ended their relationship in August two months after calling off their wedding. The final straw was when Baier, a recovered drug addict, offered Teen Mom OG cast member Catelynn Lowell a Xanax during the show\u2019s press day in NYC.\n\n\u201cIt was rough, but it was a necessary thing to do,\u201d Portwood told Us. \u201cI needed to see where I was in my head and it\u2019s a beautiful thing because I just feel better.\u201d\n\nReporting by Brody Brown", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/469531572_amber-portwood-matt-baier-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/469531572_amber-portwood-matt-baier-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C61px%2C2000px%2C1130px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/469531572_amber-portwood-matt-baier-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-reacts-to-ex-fiance-matt-baiers-surprise-marriage/", "title": "Amber Portwood Reacts to Ex-Fiance Matt Baier\u2019s Surprise Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "A source exclusively told Us Weekly how Amber Portwood reacted to her ex-fiance Matt Baier getting married \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amber Portwood Reacts to Ex-Fiance Matt Baier\u2019s Surprise Marriage", "description": "A source exclusively told Us Weekly how Amber Portwood reacted to her ex-fiance Matt Baier getting married \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-reacts-to-ex-fiance-matt-baiers-surprise-marriage/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:13:58+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/469531572_amber-portwood-matt-baier-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/469531572_amber-portwood-matt-baier-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Teen Mom", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-29T19:57:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:13:58+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A source exclusively told Us Weekly how Amber Portwood reacted to her ex-fiance Matt Baier getting married \u2014 get the details", "title": "Amber Portwood Reacts to Ex-Fiance Matt Baier\u2019s Surprise Marriage", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/469531572_amber-portwood-matt-baier-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C63px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511985457.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
