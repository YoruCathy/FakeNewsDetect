And based on some of the footage in the trailer, it would appear that the Barden Bellas are indeed taking their show on the road \u2014 or at least the seas. There are shots of Anna Kendrick and some of her costars jumping into the water, DJ Khaled hanging out with some military members, and the Bellas decked out in camo.\n\nNew cast members include Ruby Rose, Andy Allo, and John Lithgow. Fans can catch a glimpse of the Trial and Error actor in the teaser, as Sie notes he and actress Rebel Wilson are like \u201cpeas in a pod.\u201d Along with Kendrick and Wilson, all the rest of the original Bellas will be returning, including Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Ester Dean, Chrissie Fit, Hana Mae Lee, and Hailee Steinfeld, who made her Pitch Perfect debut in the 2015 sequel.\n\nWatch the teaser trailer above. Pitch Perfect 3 arrives Dec. 22.", "images":
