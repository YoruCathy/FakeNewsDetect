Brinkley captioned the photo stating: \u201cMy mermaid Sailor Brinkley Cook rocking it in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit.\u201d She added a \u201cproud mama\u201d hashtag.\n\nAn Instagram user posted a rude comment comparing Sailor\u2019s looks to Alexa Ray Joel\u2019s. The comment has since been deleted but Joel was able to hit back at the social media user.\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY, 63, STUNS IN NEW PHOTO SHOOT\n\n\u201cBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, Mr. Big Shot. You may think I\u2019m hideous, but I like the way I look,\u201d Joel commented. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really all the matters. (Besides, there\u2019s a lot more to people than just what they look like.) But hey, continue being a shallow, hateful troll in life and see where it gets you!\u201d\n\nBrinkley applauded her daughter and thanked social media users who came to Joel\u2019s defense.\n\n\"I am also grateful for all the kind-hearted people on this thread that jumped to Alexa's defense. Thank you all,\" Brinkley wrote.\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY\u2019S DAUGHTER SAILOR TAPS INTO HER \u2018SEXY SIDE\u2019 WITH NEW PHOTO SHOOT\n\n\"[You] have to feel sorry for people like that,\u201d Brinkley wrote in reference to the social media critic.\n\nThe daughter of the now-divorced famous couple has faced scrutiny from the public previously. Joel told People she was \u201cshy\u201d when she was a teenager.\n\n\"I was a painfully shy teenager,\u201d Joel told People. \"Before I decided to be a performer, I was a little shell-shocked when paparazzi would be around. When you're young, it's easy to pick on you. There was a tabloid page that would draw things on my face. When you come from privilege, they just see you as, \u2018Oh, she got it all handed to her.'\"", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/brinkleys.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20110019543582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/headshot-48513.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/270/152/Brad-Paisley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/brinkleys.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/brinkleys.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Joyce", "Kathleen Joyce Is A Breaking Trending News Producer For Foxnews.Com."], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alexa-ray-joel-slams-online-troll-who-called-her-hideous-i-like-the-way-i-look", "title": "Alexa Ray Joel slams online troll who called her hideous: 'I like the way I look'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Alexa Ray Joel did not hold back on Instagram when a troll called her hideous.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Kathleen Joyce", "dc.title": "Alexa Ray Joel slams online troll who called her hideous: 'I like the way I look'", "dcterms.abstract": "Alexa Ray Joel did not hold back on Instagram when a troll called her hideous.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Alexa Ray Joel did not hold back on Instagram when a troll called her hideous.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:ba2fb108-a3be-5c99-b975-b290e69fa040", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-02-01", "dcterms.created": "2018-02-01T13:58:07-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-02-01T15:52:07-05:00", "og": {"title": "Alexa Ray Joel slams online troll who called her hideous: 'I like the way I look'", "description": "Alexa Ray Joel did not hold back on Instagram when a troll called her hideous.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/brinkleys.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alexa-ray-joel-slams-online-troll-who-called-her-hideous-i-like-the-way-i-look", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Alexa Ray Joel slams online troll who called her hideous: 'I like the way I look'", "description": "Alexa Ray Joel did not hold back on Instagram when a troll called her hideous.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/brinkleys.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/alexa-ray-joel-slams-online-troll-who-called-her-hideous-i-like-the-way-i-look"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Media", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment,media"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
