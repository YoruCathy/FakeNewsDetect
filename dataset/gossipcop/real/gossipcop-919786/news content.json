There, suites can go for more than $5,000 a night.\n\n\u201cAmangiri is a remote hideaway tucked within the luminous canyons of the American Southwest,\u201d the hotel explains on its website. \u201cLocated in a protected valley in Canyon Point with sweeping views, the luxury 5-star resort offers both adrenaline-fueled adventure experiences and a peaceful retreat.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Courtesy of Amangiri\n\nGuests staying at the resort can choose from renting out a private suite, or the resort\u2019s private home, which comes with four bedrooms and its own private pool.\n\nAt the resort, Ratajkowski and any other guest can sit back and relax in its expansive spa, which uses \u201chealing traditions of the Navajo through the four elements of earth, wind, fire and water.\u201d The spa also offers stunning vistas of the undeveloped desert landscape below, along with treatments ranging from massages, scrubs, and wraps to flotation therapy.\n\nImage zoom Courtesy of Amangiri\n\nRatajkowski of course showed off all that the 5-star resort has to offer on her Instagram account. In her first post, the model shared \u201cMorning in the desert\u201d as she took a dip in the hotel\u2019s pool.\n\nNext, the star shared a truly gorgeous sunset from inside her hotel suite:\n\nAnd another as she sat by her room\u2019s outdoor fire pit.\n\nRatajkowski shared one final image from Utah on what appears to be a hike through one of the state\u2019s gorgeous slot canyons.\n\nSo yeah, she might not have spent big on a wedding, but honestly, it looks like she made the right choice on where to splurge instead.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2Famangiri-lounge-utah-desert-EMRATMOON0318.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2019%2F12%2Farequipa-peru-WHERETOGO2020.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2017%2F07%2F1-gibbs-farm-WBSAFLODAF0517-150x150.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2FEmily-Ratajkowski-EMRATMOON0318.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2063'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B800%2C500%5D&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2FEmily-Ratajkowski-EMRATMOON0318.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F01%2Feagle-beach-aruba-365BEACHESH1217-150x150.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2Famangiri-desert-landscape-EMRATMOON0318.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B800%2C500%5D&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2FEmily-Ratajkowski-EMRATMOON0318.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stacey Leasca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/emily-ratajkowski-honeymoon-amangiri-utah", "title": "Emily Ratajkowski's Utah Honeymoon Is Way More Luxurious Than Her Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Travel and Leisure", "news_keywords": "Travel and Leisure", "description": "It looks like the actress and model made the right choice on where to splurge.", "og": {"title": "Emily Ratajkowski's Utah Honeymoon Is Way More Luxurious Than Her Wedding", "type": "article", "site_name": "Travel + Leisure", "url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/emily-ratajkowski-honeymoon-amangiri-utah", "description": "Model and actress Emily Ratajkowski may have gone for a low-budget wedding,&nbsp;saying her vows in a courthouse ceremony while rocking a $200 Zara suit, but&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B800%2C500%5D&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2FEmily-Ratajkowski-EMRATMOON0318.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 838}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/emily-ratajkowski-honeymoon-amangiri-utah", "description": "It looks like the actress and model made the right choice on where to splurge.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2FEmily-Ratajkowski-EMRATMOON0318.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "url": "https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/emily-ratajkowski-honeymoon-amangiri-utah", "title": "Emily Ratajkowski's honeymoon is way, way more luxurious than her wedding", "description": "It looks like the actress and model made the right choice on where to splurge.", "site": "@TravelLeisure", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=%5B800%2C500%5D&w=1600&h=838&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F28%2F2018%2F03%2FEmily-Ratajkowski-EMRATMOON0318.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1186687021348564, "pages": 25440929072}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.travelandleisure.com", "summary": ""}
