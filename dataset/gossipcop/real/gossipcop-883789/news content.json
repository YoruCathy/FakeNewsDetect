In an essay comparing the \u201cheterosexually omnipotent, but increasingly prosthetic\u201d manhood of the fictional James Bond and the very real Hugh Hefner, Patrick O\u2019Donnell, the academic, describes Mr. Hefner\u2019s schedule as he exhibited it in the 1980s as one without end: \u201cEach \u2018evening\u2019 begins precisely at the same time; each night of the week is dedicated to a different purpose: Monday is new movie night, Wednesday is poker night with the boys, Friday is party night, Sunday is vintage movie night, etc.\u201d\n\nIn recent years he still had the kind of schedule that a particularly anxious adolescent would find comforting. Wednesdays and Fridays, Mr. Hefner and his entourage would make the round of the clubs, and then, according to a memoir from his ex-girlfriend Holly Madison, would retire to chambers. (There, all the \u201cgirls\u201d would change into pajamas \u2014 flannel for them, not silk, she said.)\n\n\u201cIt was always exactly the same because that\u2019s just how he likes to live his life,\u201d Ms. Madison told BuzzFeed in 2015.\n\nThis treadmill of night, day, indoor, outdoor, nightclub and bedroom lent itself to the endless metronome of magazine publishing and of TV production. It lent itself to a life in pajamas and slippers, and to the near-seasonless existence of Los Angeles. After his death, Playboy redirected every page of its website to a photo of Mr. Hefner, with a quotation attributed to him: \u201cLife is too short to be living someone else\u2019s dream.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER1/29pajamas-1-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER2/29pajamas-2-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER2/29pajamas-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Choire Sicha"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/hugh-hefner-pajamas.html", "title": "Hugh Hefner, the Pajama Man", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2017-09-28T14:10:49.000Z", "modified": "2017-09-28T20:18:20.000Z", "section": "Fashion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/choire-sicha", "tag": "Fashion and Apparel", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005465276, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/9b313949-3357-57a9-a962-d00c45692907", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/4df6bf38814347728a28cf4eec0b481a", "description": "Hugh Hefner\u2019s long life in sleepwear.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER2/29pajamas-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Choire Sicha", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER2/29pajamas-2-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Hugh Hefner,Pajamas,Playboy Magazine,Fashion", "pdate": 20170928, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/hugh-hefner-pajamas.html", "type": "article", "title": "Hugh Hefner, the Pajama Man", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER2/29pajamas-2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Hugh Hefner in 1982."}, "description": "Hugh Hefner\u2019s long life in sleepwear."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/hugh-hefner-pajamas.html", "title": "Hugh Hefner, the Pajama Man", "description": "Hugh Hefner\u2019s long life in sleepwear.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/style/01HEFNER2/29pajamas-2-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Hugh Hefner in 1982."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/9b313949-3357-57a9-a962-d00c45692907"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "fashion", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/hugh-hefner-pajamas.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/9b313949-3357-57a9-a962-d00c45692907", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/hugh-hefner-pajamas.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/fashion/hugh-hefner-pajamas.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506528000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
