Blaney was able to escape the carnage, but Patrick, who was racing her No. 7 car in the middle of the drafting pack, could not avoid a spinning Elliott.\n\n\"The car was a lot better than it was in the (Can-Am) Duel, a lot better than in practice,\" Patrick said after being checked and released from the infield care center. \"(Crew chief) Tony Eury Jr. really did an awesome job. We only pulled this car together not long ago.\n\n\"I said earlier today that I feel like the whole thing was picture perfect with Go Daddy on that car and it being that green again, but it just wasn't meant to be. But I am proud, we raced the whole race, and it was competitive. That's the gamble about Daytona. It can go so well and it can go so awful.\n\n\"I'm grateful for everything. Thank you to all the fans. I still got one more. It's not stock cars, but I got one more.\"\n\nPatrick will end her racing career at the Indianapolis 500 in May, where she will drive for Ed Carpenter Racing.\n\nFollow Horrow on Twitter @EllenJHorrow\n\nPHOTOS: DANICA PATRICK'S NASCAR CAREER\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7cd37f49d8bdc66324d55db7c259033a34c4b9f6/c=404-161-1638-858/local/-/media/2018/02/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636545709690730844-patrick.jpg?width=1234&height=697&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5593207488001_5593193439001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7cd37f49d8bdc66324d55db7c259033a34c4b9f6/c=404-161-1638-858/local/-/media/2018/02/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636545709690730844-patrick.jpg?width=1234&height=697&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/02/18/danica-patrick-daytona-500-crash-nascar-career-ends/349699002/", "title": "Danica Patrick's NASCAR career comes to a close with Daytona 500 crash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Danica Patrick's NASCAR career comes to a close with Daytona 500 crash", "description": "Danica Patrick was caught up in a multi-car crash Sunday at Daytona International Speedway.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2018/02/18/danica-patrick-daytona-500-crash-nascar-career-ends/349699002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7cd37f49d8bdc66324d55db7c259033a34c4b9f6/c=404-161-1638-858/local/-/media/2018/02/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636545709690730844-patrick.jpg?width=1234&height=697&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1234, "height": 697}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Ellen J.
