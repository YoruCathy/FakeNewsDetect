As you may know, Abraham is not Indian, nor is she a Bollywood star.\n\nImagine wearing something that's apart of someone else's culture just for attention. She looks so bad and desperate. #MTVAwards pic.twitter.com/3M8xIpVyUV \u2014 baby boy \ud83c\udf52 (@darkwavebaby) May 7, 2017\n\nFARRAH ABRAHAM IS NOT FUCKING INDIAN WHY IS SHE TRASHING THEIR AMAZING CULTURE I'M FUMING \u2014 lauren (@laurcndelrey) May 8, 2017\n\nFarrah Abraham is gonna get so much shit for that outfit. \u2014 AJ Pitts (@BigBroYoyo) May 7, 2017\n\nAbraham didn\u2019t seem too concerned about the backlash though, telling TooFab that she wanted to \u201cbring culture\u201d to the red carpet and thought her look would \u201cinspire others to embrace new cultures and have good experiences.\u201d\n\nShe also said her outfit, which is admittedly beautiful on its own, made her feel \u201cfreaking amazing, Bollywood and sexy.\u201d\n\nStill, we can all agree that adopting another culture\u2019s traditional dress and stripping it of context diminishes it to nothing more than a costume. (Has Abraham learned nothing from Selena Gomez or Vanessa Hudgens?)\n\nDon\u2019t go yet! Try out our Entertainment newsletter.
