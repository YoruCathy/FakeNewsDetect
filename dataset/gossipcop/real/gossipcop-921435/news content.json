Television Festival at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Friday, the 75-year-old icon was honored alongside American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy for her body of work in television.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cNever,\u201d she replied when Murphy asked if she had ever been sexually harassed at any point in her career.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t like those pretty girls with those nice little noses,\u201d she added. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why.\u201d\n\nHowever, Streisand said she will continue to stand with those who have been sexually exploited and fight for gender equality.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a strange time now, in terms of men and women, and the pendulum swinging this way and that way, and it\u2019s going to have to come to the center,\u201d Streisand said of the #MeToo movement.\n\nImage zoom Barbra Streisand Kevin Mazur/Getty\n\nThe star also opened up about her tricky relationship with the media. Over the years, Streisand has remained reluctant to participate in interviews and interact with the press, partially due to a 1991 interview with TV journalist Mike Wallace, whose hurtful questions brought her to tears.\n\nWhen she called him afterward to complain about him being \u201cmean\u201d to her, Wallace, in turn, told viewers that she \u201cloved\u201d the interview, according to Variety.\n\n\u201cI thought \u2018I don\u2019t know what date rape is, it\u2019s terrible, but it was such a violation,\u201d she said of Wallace. \u201cWhy lie?\u201d\n\nAnd during a 1990s interview with Barbara Walters, Streisand disagreed with how footage was edited of her supporting Al Gore in his presidential bid. However, when the \u201cWoman in Love\u201d singer appeared on C-Span to clarify her comments, Walters became angry.\n\n\u201cShe got really angry with me because I told C-Span what I wanted to say,\u201d said Streisand. \u201cShe thought I betrayed her because I went on C-Span, but I wish her well. She\u2019s a good woman.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2Fegot-winners-4-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1357&h=710&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2Fegot-winners-4-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1357&h=710&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F11%2Fegot-winners-4-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Sands"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/barbra-streisand-hasnt-had-me-too-moment/", "title": "Barbra Streisand Says She's 'Never' Had a #MeToo Moment in Her Career", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Barbra Streisand,Celebrities,Music News,News", "news_keywords": "Barbra Streisand,Celebrities,Music News,News", "description": "Barbra Streisand told American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy that she's \"never\" had a #MeToo moment during the span of her six-decade career", "og": {"title": "Barbra Streisand Says She's 'Never' Had a #MeToo Moment in Her Career", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/barbra-streisand-hasnt-had-me-too-moment/", "description": "Barbra&nbsp;Streisand says she has never felt sexually harassed in Hollywood after spending more than six decades in the industry.
