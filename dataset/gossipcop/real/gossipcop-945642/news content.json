We call it 'Colonoscopy Eve' in Canada.\"\n\nThey go through the process of avoiding solid foods, consuming liquids and clearing their bowels to get ready.\n\n\"And it\u2019s catered,'' Martin said. \"There\u2019s Jell-O, you know, there\u2019s not much you can (eat). You have to purge all day and then we toast.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

The group joked about throwing \"colonoscopy parties.\" Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube\n\nShort also joked about the portion of the party that isn't so fun.\n\n\"What\u2019s shocking is with Steve, you know, he\u2019s a wealthy man,'' he said. \"Who would think he would have one bathroom? I mean, by 10 p.m., the bathroom looks like Day 14 of a Carnival cruise.\"\n\n\"I thought the bathroom ended up looking like a Jackson Pollock,\" Martin added.\n\nThe four friends share one car on the ride to get their colonoscopies the next day, playing cards to determine who has to go last for his exam, the duo said.\n\n\"It was fun,'' Martin said about the party. \"It's a great way to do something that you should do.\"\n\nThe colonoscopy crew: Martin, Hanks and Short. Jokes aside, men should start getting colonoscopies starting at age 45. Getty Images\n\nKimmel himself has also been an advocate for raising awareness of the importance of getting colonoscopies. Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cancer death for men and women combined.\n\nHe celebrated turning 50 this year by having former TODAY anchor Katie Couric walk him through the process and go through the results in a hilarious scene while also stressing the importance of the exam. Couric's first husband, Jay Monahan died at 42 of colon cancer in 1998.\n\nThe legendary comedians correctly noted to Kimmel on Tuesday that colon cancer screenings should start at 45 instead of 50 under new guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society last month.\n\nColonoscopy parties don't need to be as frequent as every other year like those of the four friends. People who are in good health with no increased risk should have a colonoscopy every 10 years, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nIf you\u2019re at increased or high risk of colorectal cancer (or think you might be), talk to your health care provider to learn more. Your provider can suggest the best screening option for you, as well as determine what type of screening schedule you should follow, based on your individual risk.\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott
