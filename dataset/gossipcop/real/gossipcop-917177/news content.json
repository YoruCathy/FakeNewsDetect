But for now, he\u2019s relaxing backstage, waiting for some technical issues to be sorted and planning the next chapter of his life.\n\nIf 2018 isn\u2019t the Bobby Brown renaissance, it\u2019s at least the year that content will trump gossip for a singer as well-known for his turbulent private life as his music. Next week, BET begins shooting the Brown-produced The Bobby Brown Story, a follow-up to the channel\u2019s successful 2017 miniseries The New Edition Story set for release this fall. To coincide with the movie, Brown has reunited with producers Teddy Riley and Babyface to work on a new solo album, his first since 2012\u2019s The Masterpiece, and is planning a world tour.\n\nIn addition, Sunday marks the first Celebration of Serenity Gala, a concert and fundraiser to raise money for Brown\u2019s anti\u2013domestic-violence charity Bobbi Kristina Serenity House. Brown says his 2016 memoir Every Little Step: My Story, which detailed his reaction to both the 2012 death of wife Whitney Houston and 2015 death of daughter Bobbi Kristina, was \u201ctherapy.\u201d But as the singer tells Rolling Stone, the pain remains even as the future looks optimistic.\n\nYou just turned 49. Have you started thinking about your 50th birthday?\n\nOne of my teachers told me I would never make it to be 17. When [1988\u2019s] Don\u2019t Be Cruel came out, we was on tour so I went up to the school to see her. Her name was Mrs. Schwartz. I didn\u2019t forget her name. She was so elated and shocked to see me, she gave me a big hug. It was a very peaceful meeting, but I was letting her know that not only did I live, but I\u2019m the biggest thing since sliced bread right now.\n\nWas there any part of you that was reluctant to replay the more negative parts of your life in the movie?\n\nNo, no. I\u2019m glad they\u2019re doing it now and not when I\u2019m gone. I have no reason to tell stories. My life has been difficult, but at the same time, I wouldn\u2019t change any part of it for nothing. After writing [my 2016 memoir Every Little Step], I was able to release all of the pressure and all of the things that was eating me up inside. Being able to tell my side of the story is therapeutic for me. I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am right now if, if I regretted anything.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Whitney] died from drugs. She was really working hard on herself to try to be a sober person.\u201d\n\nWhat would be the one piece of advice you would give to a singer whose career is just starting to ascend?\n\nTake your time. Don\u2019t rush through life with the partying and shit like that. And \u201cJust say no\u201d when somebody [laughs] tries to give you drugs or anything. Just say no. I\u2019ve been clean from narcotics for 15 years. When I think about it, it\u2019s like, \u201cDamn. I wasted so much time doing something that\u2019s fucking absolutely stupid.\u201d Me and my wife have three kids and when they find out when they get old enough, \u201cDaddy used to be like this,\u201d it\u2019ll teach them what not to do. That\u2019s going to be a great thing and a rough one at the same time.\n\nWhat\u2019s been your anchor for sobriety?\n\nThe love for my kids. The love that they give me. My older kids know everything about me and they still love me. [Laughs] The love of my wife for her loving me the way she does and holding me down the way she does has been everything for me. It\u2019s been my rock. When I did get sober, I knew that I wasn\u2019t going to turn back.\n\nHow did you know?\n\n[Beats chest] Just my heart. I was done with trying to kill myself and beating myself up over different things and petty shit.\n\nWhen you see footage of yourself while you were on drugs, does it feel like the same person?\n\n[Pauses] It was a different Bobby Brown, I believe. I was sad. I was married and lonely at the same time and that\u2019s hard to deal with. I\u2019m not lonely anymore. I\u2019m not sad. I have nothing to be sad about. My life has treated me well. After everything I\u2019ve been through \u2013 heart attacks, strokes, things like that \u2013 I\u2019m still standing. I\u2019m moving on with everything from my past and I accept it. I\u2019ve accepted that shit happens.\n\nJune is the 30th anniversary of Don\u2019t Be Cruel. Did you gravitate to the songs immediately or did it take some getting used to?\n\nI didn\u2019t like some of the songs. \u201cEvery Little Step\u201d: hated it. \u201cDon\u2019t be Cruel\u201d: hated it. I wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t seeing the bigger picture and the vision that everyone had. But when people liked it [laughs] and started jamming to it, I was like, \u201cFuck it.\u201d I told [producer and label exec] Louis Silas Jr., \u201cDude, I\u2019ll sing the song, but I got to go work with Teddy [Riley]\u201d and that was the compromise.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel\u201d is still one of the songs I don\u2019t want to perform [now], but everybody wants me to perform. It\u2019s just like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I don\u2019t remember some of the rap sometimes. You forget some of the lyrics. [Laughs] We getting to the song while we performing and sometimes I just get to the point and go, \u201cThis is ridiculous. Stop,\u201d and I tell my band to stop and we go into another song.\n\nWhat spurred you to create Serenity House and organize the upcoming Serenity Gala?\n\nDomestic violence is just the worst shit in the world \u2026 We started the Serenity House because women will go through it and think they are wrong like it\u2019s their fault. So we\u2019re doing this to build houses like safe havens for women that are being abused to get away from the relationship and get some therapy spiritually and mentally.\n\n\u201c\u2018Every Little Step\u2019: hated it. \u2018Don\u2019t be Cruel\u2019: hated it.\u201d\n\nWe want to let women know that they don\u2019t have to be scared and stay in that relationship. This isn\u2019t a fucking game. You either are going to be healthy or you\u2019re going to end up dying. And I don\u2019t want to see another father or mother have to go through what I went through.\n\nIn 2016, Nick Gordon was ordered to pay $36 million to the estate of your daughter. Do you feel there has been justice related to her death?\n\nNo, not yet.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause he\u2019s still walking around free.\n\nWhat does justice look like to you?\n\nJustice? If he was locked up somewhere where somebody can rape him. That\u2019s just how I feel. He raped me by taking my daughter away.\n\nThis month marks the sixth anniversary of Whitney\u2019s death. What do you think was the most misunderstood thing about her?\n\nUm \u2026 whoa [long pause] \u2013 I don\u2019t think she died from drugs.\n\nYou don\u2019t?\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nWhat do you think it was?\n\nShe was really working hard on herself to try to be a sober person and, um [pauses] she was a great woman.\n\nWhen you say you don\u2019t think she died of drugs, do you mean you don\u2019t think there were drugs in her system at the time?\n\nYes.\n\n[Alicia Etheredge-Brown, wife and manager, interjecting]: There were drugs in her system.\n\nWell, I don\u2019t think so.\n\n[Etheredge-Brown]: You feel that other things played a part \u2026\n\nThat played a part. Yes.\n\nWhat do you attribute her death to if it wasn\u2019t drugs?\n\nJust being broken-hearted.\n\nWhat about yourself? When you look back on your life, what do you think is the most misunderstood thing about you?\n\nHmm. [Pauses] That I\u2019m a bad person. I\u2019ve been through my scrapes and I\u2019ve been through some bad times, but as far as my heart is concerned, my heart is pure.\n\nWhat we learned from the new Whitney Houston documentary \u2018Can I Be Me,\u2019 which delves deep into her addiction and brilliant yet troubled career.
