Perlongo will substitute for longtime host Max Joseph.\n\nSchulman and Perlongo were married in 2017, nearly a year after the birth of their first daughter, Cleo James. Though they\u2019re a happy family now, their relationship wasn\u2019t always perfect.\n\nThe pair met on Instagram in 2015. After a DM asking her to dinner, Perlongo met Schulman outside of her workplace with his motorcycle in tow.\n\nThe pair later broke up because Schulman was \u201ctoo in love with\u201d Perlongo, he told Us Weekly in January. \u201cI just got out of a thing, and I had been damaged by that, and I felt that maybe I was all messed up, and I wasn\u2019t ready,\u201d Schulman said. \u201cI screwed it up and then I had to win her back.\u201d Perlongo added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I officially took him back until we got pregnant.\u201d\n\nDave Kotinsky/Getty Images for Shorty Awards\n\nNow, the couple advocates for parents, couples and young adults in their Facebook web series We Need To Talk. In lighthearted clips, the couple conquers topics from \u201cclingy partners\u201d to cheating and grooming habits.\n\nThe pair also actively creates content for ATTN, a Los Angeles media company dedicated to social activism.\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nPerlongo has appeared on Catfish before. She\u2019s given brief input via video chat when Shulman calls home from the road and appeared in one Catfish meeting last season.\n\nSchulman joked about Joseph\u2019s absence on the Wednesday episode saying \u201che had \u2018more important things to do,\u2019\u201d in a tweet. At the time of filming, Joseph was filming a Ted Talk in France, according to the episode\u2019s first trailer.\n\nSchulman asked judgemental viewers not to hound Perlongo for her appearance. \u201cFor everybody out there getting to Tweet, like, \u2018Who dis bitch\u2026\u2019 save it,\u201d Shulman said in the trailer.\n\nThe episode will follow Angel as she tries to decide between two on-and-off boyfriends, one in real life, and one on the internet. The couple will speak with Angel\u2019s friend Cece, who Schulman implies could be the Catfish.\n\nSchulman became the host and executive producer of Catfish after his 2010 documentary of the same name became a viral phenomenon. In the documentary, Schulman traveled to meet his own Catfish, who was nothing like he'd expected her to be.\n\nPerlongo is a freelance writer. She aims her writing focus on the millennial generation, according to her LinkedIn. She currently works as a freelance creative director.", "images":
