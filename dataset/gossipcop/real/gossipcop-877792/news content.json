Since your skin is at its dewiest, a more matte finish can look really chic. The only problem: Without the proper techniques, matte lipstick can sometimes appear more dated than modern. And that's not cute. Not sure how to get it just right? Follow these easy steps:\n\n1. Exfoliate your lips.\n\nDry, dead skin is often what makes your lipstick look rough and uneven, so slough it off before you apply any color. You can use a sugar scrub or gently exfoliate your lips with a soft bristle toothbrush.\n\nI used Fresh Sugar Lip Polish ($22.50, Sephora).\n\n2. Add moisture.\n\nNext, apply a lightweight lip balm or moisturizing treatment to your lips. This helps fill in any cracks so your matte lipstick will go on smooth and more even.\n\nI used Murad Rapid Collagen Infusion for Lips ($24, Murad).\n\n3. Finish up the rest of your makeup.\n\nDon't put on your matte lipstick right away! If you do, the finish will be too creamy. Instead, do the rest of your makeup to give your lips a chance to absorb the moisturizer you've just applied. Note: If you choose a bright color, stick to a simple makeup look for daytime. You can always add a cool smokey eye later if you plan to go out.\n\nI used Lorac POREfection Foundation in PR1 ($36, ULTA), Cargo Swimmables Water Resistant Blush in Los Cabos ($26, Birchbox), Skinn Wake Up! Big Bright Eyes Brow Wax ($28, Skinn), Too Faced Natural Matte Palette in Heaven and Strapless ($36, ULTA), Make Up For Ever Ink Liner ($23, Sephora), Benefit Roller Lash Mascara ($24, Birchbox).\n\n4. Use lip liner to get the perfect shape.\n\nBecause matte lipstick is often highly pigmented, it is difficult to get off and redo without irritating or staining your skin, so you want to get it right on your first try. Applying lipliner before using your matte lipstick ensures you have lines to \"color in.\" Tip: Use our easy lipliner guide to learn a foolproof lining technique.\n\nI used Nyx Cosmetics Slim Lip Pencil in Hot Red ($3.49, ULTA).\n\n5. Apply your matte lipstick.\n\nWhether it's straight from the tube or you're using a lip brush, try to be a precise as possible.\n\nI used Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick in Fiery ($24, Sephora).\n\n6. Blot lips on a piece of toilet paper.\n\nThis removes any excess color or leftover shine. While a tissue or paper towel work just fine, in my experience, a small piece of toilet paper leaves the fewest fibers on your lips.\n\nNow you're good to go!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/2560x1280/landscape-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg?resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/2560x1280/landscape-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Escobar", "Sam'S Enthusiasm For Makeup Is Only Rivaled Their Love Of All Things Relating To Cats."], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/makeup/a33635/matte-lipstick-tips/", "title": "How to Wear Matte Lipstick Without Looking Like You're From the '90s", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Good Housekeeping", "title": "How to Wear Matte Lipstick Without Looking Like You're From the '90s", "description": "It's all in the technique.", "url": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/makeup/a33635/matte-lipstick-tips/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/2560x1280/landscape-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 119423528138309, "pages": 40241492597}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GOODHOUSEKEEPING", "modified_time": "2018-03-21 05:52:56", "published_time": "2015-07-29 06:16:00", "section": "Makeup Tips", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@goodhousemag", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/2560x1280/landscape-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "Cyrrih2f3Dh884Dysa4Fuafe2UewzpbR6gnQipgICss", "title": "How to Wear Matte Lipstick - Matte Lipstick Tips", "description": "Stop yourself from looking dated in your matte lipstick with these easy tips.", "keywords": "matte lipstick, matte lipstick tips, matte lipstick 90s, matte lipstick trend, how to wear matte lipstick", "auto-publish": "evergreen", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/1280x1280/square-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Beauty,beauty,makeup,matte lipstick,lipstick,makeup tips", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-29T18:16:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/2560x1280/landscape-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ghk.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/1280x1280/square-1438190734-lipstick-matte-collage.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "How to Wear Matte Lipstick Without Looking Like You're From the '90s", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1438121760.0, "source": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com", "summary": ""}
