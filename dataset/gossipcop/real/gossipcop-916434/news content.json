So I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father.\u201d\n\nAt least 20 women have come forward to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. The president and his official spokespeople have challenged the veracity of the women\u2019s claims.\n\nQ&A Who are the 20 women accusing Donald Trump of assault and harassment?

In 2006, when the family sales pitch was centered on the reality show The Apprentice, she gamely entertained much pricklier questions about her father.\n\nIn an appearance on the Howard Stern talkshow, a 24-year-old Ivanka sat laughing between her father and her brother Don as the elder Trump sheepishly nodded agreement to a suggestion by a co-host that he was a sexual predator.",
