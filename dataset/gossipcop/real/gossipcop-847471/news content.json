As 2017 Met Gala cochair of the \u201c Rei Kawakubo / Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the In-Between \u201d exhibition, Williams took to the red carpet in dressed-down Comme: a black moto jacket and plaid shirt from the label, paired with custom vintage jeans that read \u201cRei\u201d across one knee. His wife, Helen Lasichanh, paired her straight-off-the-Fall-2017-runway tomato-red onesie with a blonde topknot.\n\nThe last time that Williams \u201cgot happy\u201d at the Met was for the \u201cPunk: Chaos to Couture\u201d show, where he appeared dapperly attired in a checkered Lanvin suit and patent leather shoes. His eyes provided the surprise\u2014they were rimmed in eyeliner. Williams certainly likes to play with fashion. Who can forget the musician\u2019s meme-friendly vintage \u201cBuffalo Girls\u201d hat by punk provocateur Vivienne Westwood? His tastes range from street to super chic, and he\u2019s as likely to be seen in pieces from his Billionaire Boys Club line, as he is in Chanel. (William has credited Notorious B.I.G. with first introducing him to the brand.) With collaborations with the likes of Louis Vuitton, Moncler, Adidas, and CDG under his belt, it\u2019s safe to say that fashion loves Pharrell as much as Pharrell loves fashion.\n\nSee all of the celebrity looks from the Met Gala 2017 red carpet:\n\nListen to Pharrell\u2019s song \u201cHappy\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906im_/http://assets.vogue.com/photos/58584a9944b5d45318dc955c/master/w_104,c_limit/Laird-Borrelli-Persson.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906im_/http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/themes/vogue/images/logo_vogue.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906im_/http://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907bb59a018f9145cf63612/master/pass/social-tout-pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-best-dressed.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906im_/http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/10/2017-met-gala-article-banner-final.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906im_/http://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907bb59a018f9145cf63612/master/pass/social-tout-pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-best-dressed.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laird Borrelli-Persson"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906/http://www.vogue.com/article/pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-fashion-comme-ges-garcons-jeans", "title": "Pharrell Williams\u2019s 2017 Met Gala Look Includes Comme de Gar\u00e7ons", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2017", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906/http://www.vogue.com/article/pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-fashion-comme-ges-garcons-jeans", "title": "Pharrell Williams Wears Jeans to the Met Gala\u2014But in Tribute to Comme des Gar\u00e7ons", "description": "Pharrell Williams shows some love for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons on the Met Gala 2017 red carpet.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170505121906im_/http://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907bb59a018f9145cf63612/master/pass/social-tout-pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-best-dressed.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "www.vogue.com", "title": "Pharrell Williams\u2019s 2017 Met Gala Look Includes Comme de Gar\u00e7ons - Vogue", "image": {"src": "http://assets.vogue.com/photos/5907bb59a018f9145cf63612/master/pass/social-tout-pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-best-dressed.gif"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Pharrell Williams shows some love for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons on the Met Gala 2017 red carpet."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=http://www.vogue.com/article/pharrell-williams-met-gala-2017-red-carpet-fashion-comme-ges-garcons-jeans, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "keywords": "Celebrity Style,Runway,Met Gala 2017,Red Carpet,Pharrell Williams,mobileAppReadyTrue", "news_keywords": "Celebrity Style,Runway,Met Gala 2017,Red Carpet,Pharrell Williams,mobileAppReadyTrue", "description": "Pharrell Williams shows some love for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons on the Met Gala 2017 red carpet.", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vogue"}, "articleSection": "Fashion"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493722800.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
