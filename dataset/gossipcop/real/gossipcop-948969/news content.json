Chris and Peyton Lambton welcomed their son, Hayes Jennings, on Sunday, December 16. The newborn joins smitten big sister Lyla, 2. \u201cLyla James is in love with her baby brother,\u201d the couple tells Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cIt\u2019s adorable.\u201d\n\nPeyton, 35, who vied for Andy Baldwin\u2019s heart on season 10 of ABC\u2019s The Bachelor, announced in a July blog post that she and Chris were expanding their family. The pregnancy came as a total surprise to the reality star and the Bachelorette season 6 alum.\n\n\u201cLyla James was an IVF baby and we went through so much to bring her into this world,\u201d Peyton wrote at the time. \u201cI just assumed that was how we would create all of our babies . . . boy was I wrong.\u201d\n\nIn September, the TV personality suspected she was having a son. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the heat or my hormones, but salads have been my jam lately,\u201d Peyton shared on her website. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ate a single salad when I was pregnant with Lyla James. So maybe this is a boy?!?!\u201d\n\nPeyton had a rough first trimester and suffered from morning sickness. \u201cThis happened with Lyla James too, but I could lay in bed all day with her,\u201d she noted on her blog in August. \u201cThis time I had to suck it up and find a way to parent while trying not to puke everywhere! I do have to give a shout-out to my amazing husband because he really stepped up and allowed me to have full days in bed when I needed it.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who met through Bachelor friends in 2010, tied the knot in May 2012.\n\nWith reporting by Jen Peros\n\nFor access to all our exclusive celebrity videos and interviews \u2013 Subscribe on YouTube!\n\nFor the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Peyton-and-Chris-Lambton.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Peyton-and-Chris-Lambton.jpg?crop=0px%2C422px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Peyton-and-Chris-Lambton.jpg?crop=0px%2C422px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/bachelor-alum-peyton-lambton-gives-birth-to-second-child-with-husband-chris/", "title": "'Bachelor' Alum Peyton Lambton Gives Birth to Second Child With Husband Chris", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bachelor Nation\u2019s Chris and Peyton Lambton welcomed their second child together on Sunday, December 16, Us Weekly exclusively confirms \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bachelor Nation\u2019s Chris and Peyton Lambton Welcome Second Child: Pic", "description": "Bachelor Nation\u2019s Chris and Peyton Lambton welcomed their second child together on Sunday, December 16, Us Weekly exclusively confirms \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/bachelor-alum-peyton-lambton-gives-birth-to-second-child-with-husband-chris/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-12-18T17:08:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Peyton-and-Chris-Lambton.jpg?crop=0px%2C422px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Peyton-and-Chris-Lambton.jpg?crop=0px%2C422px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelorette", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-12-18T13:34:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-18T17:08:21+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bachelor Nation\u2019s Chris and Peyton Lambton welcomed their second child together on Sunday, December 16, Us Weekly exclusively confirms \u2014 find out more", "title": "Bachelor Nation\u2019s Chris and Peyton Lambton Welcome Second Child: Pic", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Peyton-and-Chris-Lambton.jpg?crop=0px%2C422px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545140078.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
