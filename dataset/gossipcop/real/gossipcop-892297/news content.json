A time of holiday lights, presents under the tree, and arguing with your extended family about what movie you\u2019re going to go see.\n\nThis year, theaters will be packed with everything from family-friendly comedies and sci-fi blockbusters to feel-good crowdpleasers and awards bait. Whether you\u2019re looking to kill a few hours after Christmas dinner or just trying to escape your weird cousins who are visiting, we\u2019ve rounded up all the biggest new releases in theaters and streaming.\n\nNEW RELEASES\n\nMolly\u2019s Game\n\nStarring: Jessica Chastain, Idris Elba, Kevin Costner\n\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cWith a gift as unique as Sorkin\u2019s, it was always only a matter of when \u2014 not if \u2014 he would try his hand at directing one of his own scripts. Still, who could\u2019ve predicted that he\u2019d be such a natural behind the camera the first time around? Aside from a few misdemeanor writerly indulgences, Sorkin\u2019s fast-and-funny new morality tale, Molly\u2019s Game, doesn\u2019t feel like a directorial debut. It feels like an assured story told by a seasoned pro. Sorkin grafts his signature staccato lines onto the true story of Molly Bloom \u2014 a former Olympic skier who would end up channeling her iron will into more illicit ventures. Namely, running one of the country\u2019s biggest and most exclusive underground poker games. That is, until the feds finally crashed the party. Sorkin, who\u2019s always seemed more comfortable with alpha male types, was smart (or exceedingly lucky) to cast Jessica Chastain as his heroine, Molly. The film is easily the best showcase she\u2019s had since Zero Dark Thirty.\u201d A-\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters Dec. 25 (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your cool older cousin who taught you how to play poker.\n\nAll the Money in the World\n\nStarring: Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg\n\nDirector: Ridley Scott\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say of course how [original star Kevin] Spacey would have filled the role without actually seeing him onscreen (aside from the fact that he did look odd in the heavy aging prosthetics shown in the initial trailers, like a refugee from a Dick Tracy villain camp circa 1990). But there\u2019s none of the cold Keyser S\u00f6ze snake in the 88-year-old Plummer\u2019s performance; he\u2019s pitiless, without question, but pitiable too: a lonely old man clinging to things \u2014 estates, objets, Old Master paintings \u2014 because he can\u2019t trust a human heart, least of all his own. It\u2019s already earned him a Golden Globe nomination (Williams received one as well, as did Scott, for best director), which may be the industry\u2019s way of recognizing an achievement in logistics as much as in quality filmmaking. At its best though, Money makes you forget all that and surrender to a story that might be almost too strange to believe, if it wasn\u2019t entirely true.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters Dec. 25 (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your grandpa who, unlike J. Paul Getty, would pay a lot of money for your ransom if you were kidnapped.\n\nPhantom Thread\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Vicky Krieps, Lesley Manville\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cNow that the movie is finally here, it can now called for what it actually is: the new Paul Thomas Anderson-Daniel Day-Lewis film that, despite all of the anticipation, is a little underwhelming. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 like all of Anderson\u2019s films (the best of which remain Boogie Nights and Magnolia), Phantom Thread is meticulously crafted, visually sumptuous, impeccably acted, and very, very directorly. But until the final act, this straight-jacketed character study is also pretty tame stuff \u2014 emotionally remote, a bit too studied, and far easier to admire than surrender to and swoon over. It seems to exist under glass.\u201d B\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters Dec. 25 (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your fashion-obsessed older sister.\n\nPitch Perfect 3\n\nStarring: Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow\n\nDirector: Trish Sie\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nEW review: \u201cAll things must come to an aca-end. And so after five years, three outings, and an uncountable number of pitch puns, the house that multipart harmonies built is signing off \u2014 and if its swan song sometimes feels more like a wild goose chase, plotwise (or maybe a day-drunk penguin), the sheer nutty charisma of its sprawling cast still carries the series out on a pretty sweet high note.\u201d B\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your old college friends you haven\u2019t seen in a while.\n\nThe Greatest Showman\n\nStarring: Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya\n\nDirector: Michael Gracey\n\nRating: PG\n\nEW review: \u201cFirst-time director Michael Gracey, working from a script by Jenny Bicks (Sex & the City) and Bill Condon (Chicago, Gods and Monsters, Dreamgirls), plunges ahead in a giddy rush, carving out ample opportunities for his stars to sing the soaring rock-opera compositions penned by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the gifted musical duo behind La La Land and Dear Evan Hansen. What he doesn\u2019t make much room for is subtlety; every emotion is signaled to the peanut gallery, every story beat landed with a foot stomp and a handclap.\u201d B\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your 12-year-old cousin who wants to be a Broadway star when she grows up.\n\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\n\nStarring: Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Kevin Hart, Jack Black\n\nDirector: Jake Kasdan\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nEW review: \u201cStop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: A group of high school kids representing different archetypes (the brain, the princess, the basket case, and so on) meet in detention and, a few hours later, discover that they\u2019re not so different after all. Now stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: A seemingly harmless game sucks its players into a magically perilous jungle world of wild flora and rampaging animals, ultimately leading to valuable life lessons. Congratulations, you\u2019ve not only seen 1985\u2019s The Breakfast Club and 1995\u2019s Jumanji, you\u2019ve also already seen the latest Hollywood intellectual-property retread/reboot no one knew they were asking for. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a film as busy as a mediocre video game and as familiar and by-the-numbers as a dozen other brand-recognition titles that have recently trundled off the Tinseltown widget assembly line.\u201d C\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your sibling, who was traumatized by the CG animals in the original 1995 movie.\n\nDownsizing\n\nStarring: Matt Damon, Christoph Waltz, Hong Chau\n\nDirector: Alexander Payne\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cDirector Alexander Payne (Nebraska, Election, About Schmidt) specializes in a kind of deadpan heartland absurdity, but he\u2019s never delved into anything nearly as fantastical as this. Though the little-people terrarium of Leisureland may not be what Paul had hoped, it\u2019s also where he learns to stop worrying and love the small, thanks to his hedonist neighbor (Christoph Waltz) and a left-field romance with Vietnamese dissident Ngoc (Hong Chau, bossy and funny and refreshingly oblivious to lip gloss). The result is a dadaist swirl of satire, pie-eyed whimsy, and speculative futurism \u2014 like Gulliver\u2019s Travels through the wrong end of a telescope.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your Alexander-Payne-loving cousin, who\u2019s watched Election a thousand times.\n\nHostiles\n\nStarring: Christian Bale, Rosamund Pike, Wes Studi\n\nDirector: Scott Cooper\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cShot in New Mexico and Colorado, Hostiles is visually stunning. And its themes of blind hatred and eventual understanding between the races is reminiscent of Dances With Wolves, minus the preachiness. Still, the biggest draw is watching Bale deliver another master class in invisible acting. Every gesture feels authentic. You immediately understand this spiritually spent man \u2014 for better and worse. Westerns can be a tough nut to crack, but Hostiles may be the finest example of the genre since Unforgiven. \u201d A\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your dad, who always complains about how nobody makes any good Westerns anymore.\n\nThe Post\n\nStarring: Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Sarah Paulson\n\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nEW review: \u201cSteven Spielberg\u2019s The Post is set in 1971, yet it couldn\u2019t be more about 2017 if it tried. There are period-specific sideburns, mustard-colored shirts, and a screen choked with cigarette smoke, but it\u2019s a timely wake-up call about speaking truth to power in the \u2018fake news\u2019 era.\n\nMovies, of course, take a long time to gestate, and when this rousing ink-stained procedural about The Washington Post\u2019s race to publish the Pentagon Papers was being written, the 2016 election wasn\u2019t yet over. Spielberg caught a lucky break \u2014 if you can call anything related to that election lucky. The message of the movie is so obvious it\u2019s a shame it needs repeating: namely, that an adversarial press is essential to democracy.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Anyone who likes Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks. (So, everyone.)\n\nSTILL IN THEATERS\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\n\nStarring: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Mark Hamill\n\nDirector: Rian Johnson\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nEW review: \u201cThere are a handful of truly spectacular moments in The Last Jedi\u2014some as visually sumptuous and others as emotionally poignant and raw as anything in the intergalactic ring cycle so far: The sight of Rebel X-wing fighters emerging from light speed and skidding to a halt; a kamikaze crash rendered in giddy, gasp-inducing super slo-motion; a vertiginous, ground-scraping dogfight on a salt-mining planet that kicks up plumes of velvet-cake red dust. These, along with a few touching reunions and farewells from beloved characters that some of us have known like family for 40 years, will go down as instant classics that will be catnip for fans young and old. That said, I\u2019d stop short of calling director Rian Johnson\u2019s undeniably impressive initiation into the Star Wars fold the masterpiece that some desperately want it to be. The film simply drags too much in the middle. Somewhere in the film\u2019s 152-minute running time is an amazing 90-minute movie.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your nerdy friends, who won\u2019t mind seeing it a second (or third) time.\n\nCoco\n\nStarring: Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Alanna Ubach, Renee Victor\n\nDirector: Lee Unkrich, Adrian Molina (co-director)\n\nRating: PG\n\nEW review: \u201cMamas don\u2019t let their babies grow up to be mariachis. That\u2019s one thing Miguel (voiced by newcomer Anthony Gonzalez) knows for sure: Ever since his great-great-grandfather abandoned the family decades ago to pursue la vida musical, every descendant has shunned both his tainted memory and any stray melody unwise enough to drift past a window. They are shoemakers now, not dreamers. But Miguel, a tenacious 12-year-old with a single dimple in his cheek and an unhushable song in his heart, can\u2019t help it; his fingers ache for a guitar. And like every hero on a quest, he will find one. Though unlike most \u2014 especially in the shiny world of Pixar, whose Technicolor critters, toy cowboys, and anthropomorphized race cars often seemed to come in every shade but brown \u2014 he is also proudly, unmistakably Mexican.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters everywhere (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your young nieces and nephews (who hopefully won\u2019t judge you if you get a little teary).\n\nFerdinand\n\nStarring: John Cena, Kate McKinnon, Gina Rodriguez\n\nDirector: Carlos Saldanha\n\nRating: PG\n\nEW review: \u201cMunro Leaf\u2019s children\u2019s book The Story of Ferdinand is a bona fide classic. With its charming drawings and kid-friendly prose, Ferdinand was an instant hit upon publication in 1936. (It also became politically controversial during the Spanish Civil War and World War II, thanks to its pacifist message, and Hitler famously banned it.) The story is simple: Ferdinand is a strong but peaceful bull who has no interest in bullfighting and would rather spend his days sitting under his favorite cork tree, smelling the flowers. Because of his seemingly fierce appearance, Ferdinand is taken to Madrid and put in the ring to face a matador \u2014 only he refuses to fight.\n\nWalt Disney released a short, animated adaptation in 1938, but Ferdinand is making his true big-screen debut now, with John Cena voicing the titular bull in an animated adaptation. Leaf\u2019s book is less than 800 words long, so understandably, director Carlos Saldanha had to add some padding to create a full-length feature. Unfortunately, Ferdinand buries the original story\u2019s message under frenetic action scenes and grating sidekicks, turning a classic tale into just another flat animated comedy.\u201d C+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your young nieces and nephews, when their parents could use a break.\n\nLady Bird\n\nStarring: Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Beanie Feldstein, Lucas Hedges, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Tracy Letts, Lois Smith\n\nDirector: Greta Gerwig\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cGerwig doesn\u2019t trap her protagonist in the oblivious underage bubble that most coming-of-age dramedies inhabit; Lady Bird\u2019s parents, played by Tracy Letts and Laurie Metcalf, are fully formed humans with their own deep flaws and vulnerabilities. Their messiness is hereditary but it\u2019s also a gift, the wind beneath their weird little Bird\u2019s wings.\u201d A-\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters now (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your mom, obviously.\n\nThe Shape of Water\n\nStarring: Sally Hawkins, Doug Jones, Michael Shannon\n\nDirector: Guillermo del Toro\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cIf this all sounds bizarre, well, it is. But it\u2019s also poignant, tender, funny, romantic, and flat-out breathtaking in its shoot-the-moon ambition. There\u2019s even a Busby Berkeley dance-fantasia number! If you\u2019re willing to go with this fishy fairy tale, The Shape of Water is a haunting sci-fi love story like nothing you\u2019ve ever seen before \u2014 or dreamed that you ever wanted to see. It\u2019s pure movie magic.\u201d A\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your significant other, because nothing says romance like a movie about a mute cleaning lady and her fish-monster beau.\n\nDarkest Hour\n\nStarring: Gary Oldman, Kristen Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn\n\nDirector: Joe Wright\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nEW review: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Oldman hasn\u2019t been this good for a very long time. To be even more honest, he\u2019s starred in a lot of junk in the past decade. But remember, this is the actor who played Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy and was so hypnotic (and often scary) in Prick Up Your Ears, State of Grace, JFK, The Professional, True Romance, Immortal Beloved, and The Contender. It\u2019s both a relief and revelation to see him get the chance to swing for the fences again.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your dad, who loves World War II history and loved Dunkirk.\n\nThe Disaster Artist\n\nStarring: James Franco, Dave Franco, Seth Rogen\n\nDirector: James Franco\n\nRating: R\n\nEW review: \u201cIsn\u2019t it better to fail spectacularly than to never try at all? Tommy Wiseau\u2019s 2003 magnum opus, The Room \u2014 an accidental cult classic once dubbed \u201cthe Citizen Kane of bad movies\u201d \u2014 was the hard-won sum of his Hollywood dreams; it was also possibly the best worst thing to happen to cinema since Ed Wood picked up a camera. And it feels only appropriate that James Franco, an actor and director for whom weirdness is next to godliness, would be the one to tell his story.\u201d B+\n\nWhere to watch: In theaters (buy tickets)\n\nWho to watch with: Your friend who thinks he has a great Tommy Wiseau impression.\n\nSTREAMING\n\nBright\n\nStarring: Will Smith, Joel Edgerton, Noomi Rapace\n\nDirector: David Ayer\n\nRating: Unrated\n\nEW review: \u201cGenre mashups can be fun! In theory, the idea of a gritty police drama set in a modern-day America where orcs, elves, and humans coexist could be enjoyable! As a general rule, for a genre mashup to succeed, a film has to get at least one of those genres right. Netflix\u2019s Bright, which bills itself as part buddy-cop movie, part lavish fantasy, does neither justice, resulting in lazy nonsense that\u2019s too silly to be good and too self-serious to be any fun.\u201d D+\n\nWhere to watch: Streaming on Netflix\n\nWho to watch with: On second thought, maybe you better put on Netflix\u2019s A Christmas Prince instead.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fnew-releases-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fnew-releases-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devan Coggan"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/22/movies-to-see-christmas-2017-in-theaters-streaming/", "title": "17 movies to see (or not) over Christmas 2017", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "17 movies to see (or not) over Christmas 2017", "og": {"title": "17 movies to see (or not) over Christmas 2017", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/movies/2017/12/22/movies-to-see-christmas-2017-in-theaters-streaming/", "description": "Ahh, Christmas.
