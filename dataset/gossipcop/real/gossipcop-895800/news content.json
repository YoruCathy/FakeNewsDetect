He was more fresh-faced and less bearded, but was already purveying his now ubiquitous, one-size-fits-all mix of folk, soul, rap and bantz, urging the railway passengers to sing along and \u201cmake a circle\u201d. In a staggeringly ironic comment to camera, he says: \u201cMy music doesn\u2019t really hit everyone, otherwise I\u2019d be a lucky man.\u201d\n\nEight years later, he is that lucky man \u2013 and then some \u2013 and the only real change is the size of the audience. A total of 200,000 people will see the creator of the fastest-selling album by a male artist ever (2017\u2019s \u00f7, AKA Divide) in Manchester alone, over four nights, on the northern leg of the UK\u2019s biggest ever solo tour. There are huge screens, a camera follows his grinning fizzog from the bowels of the stadium to the stage and there is a bloke on hand to pass him his pre-tuned acoustic guitars. But otherwise, not much has changed since St Pancras. \u201cIt\u2019s just me, this guitar and this loop pedal,\u201d explains the everybloke.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Zakary Walters\n\nGeezers with guitars (the choir-like noises from the loop pedal are the closest he gets to a backing band) don\u2019t generally headline stadiums, but the 27-year-old Suffolk-raised Yorkshireman has successfully charmed millions of arena-goers as effectively as he did the bystanders at St Pancras. For refuseniks who blame Sheeran (like Coldplay and Phil Collins before him) for everything that\u2019s wrong with music, the mystery is how he\u2019s done it with such ordinary material. Plenty of artists are bland. Plenty write catchy songs. Perhaps nobody else writes songs that are quite so blandly catchy, but he does spin relatable everyday tales into uplifting mainstream anthems.\n\nHere 20 of them feature over 90 minutes. Sheeran\u2019s scruffy charisma turns Castle on the Hill\u2019s market-town youth reminiscence into the first of many singalongs, and his slightly bemused, cheery grin remains gleefully in place during The A-Team\u2019s lyrics about a crack-addicted prostitute. Galway Girl may have been critically mauled as the musical equivalent of a fake Irish-themed pub, but it gets the joint jumping.\n\nAs banter inevitably flows, an anecdote about once having played Manchester to a single person reveals the herculean drive behind the chumminess: \u201cHe\u2019s now my lawyer. No matter how few people are in a crowd, I\u2019ve always given my best.\u201d He explains that \u201cparticipation is a big part\u201d \u2013 presumably even with a crowd of one \u2013 and well-worn routines such as getting the audience to scream are incontrovertibly effective.\n\nA mid-set wobble allows for toilet visits or perhaps an existential moment to ponder how pop became this boring, but as evening descends and volume increases, things liven up and some rawer edges are revealed. There\u2019s a lyrical hint of darkness (well, dusk) to Bloodstream, and Perfect (\u201cDancing in the dark, with you between my arms\u201d) arrives at the precise moment that the sun goes down and phones light up. Thinking Out Loud may be schmaltzy, but along with the wildly catchy grooves of Sing and the tropical house-ish Shape of You it rightfully generates a sea of swaying arms. Rising artists often claim to play pubs like they\u2019re in Wembley Stadium: Ed Sheeran plays a stadium-sized version of a pub gig, but, undeniably, it works.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bfa7cb89cfcf56eb7f24f3aa93a8d7cd2b63b5/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=464377efce7a733ab110b91766b7364a", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee441bbb2a40c703974af079a699726dce1d4894/1051_305_2844_1706/master/2844.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=5726841d41406d62776809aab8dcf111", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcf0924cf30b69b4df28672eeb0fe681fbeb9c67/444_466_2180_2724/master/2180.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=159ac109dddd78d733ae81985597a7f4", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Ed+Sheeran%2CMusic%2CPop+and+rock%2CCulture"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bfa7cb89cfcf56eb7f24f3aa93a8d7cd2b63b5/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=464377efce7a733ab110b91766b7364a", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Simpson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/ed-sheeran-review-etihad-stadium-manchester", "title": "Ed Sheeran review \u2013 bland everybloke brings the pub to the stadium", "meta_data": {"description": "The grinning megastar gets hands waving with no more than a guitar, some chummy bantz and his undeniably catchy hits", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Dave Simpson", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bfa7cb89cfcf56eb7f24f3aa93a8d7cd2b63b5/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=599b8462e8c5f44e73909ae229f8fa5e", "keywords": "Ed Sheeran,Music,Pop and rock,Culture", "news_keywords": "Ed Sheeran,Music,Pop and rock,Culture", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/ed-sheeran-review-etihad-stadium-manchester", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bfa7cb89cfcf56eb7f24f3aa93a8d7cd2b63b5/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=464377efce7a733ab110b91766b7364a", "description": "The grinning megastar gets hands waving with no more than a guitar, some chummy bantz and his undeniably catchy hits", "type": "article", "title": "Ed Sheeran review \u2013\u00a0bland everybloke brings the pub to the stadium", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davesimpson", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-05-25T10:39:15.000Z", "tag": "Ed Sheeran,Music,Pop and rock,Culture", "modified_time": "2020-03-26T12:45:19.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/may/25/ed-sheeran-review-etihad-stadium-manchester?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/may/25/ed-sheeran-review-etihad-stadium-manchester?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/25/ed-sheeran-review-etihad-stadium-manchester", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/may/25/ed-sheeran-review-etihad-stadium-manchester?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bfa7cb89cfcf56eb7f24f3aa93a8d7cd2b63b5/0_110_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&s=2dd6815b64aa5307602883f9a3b139f8", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527177600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
