Frankie made it to the finale, ultimately finishing in third place with pro dance partner Witney Carson, while Fisher took home the Mirrorball trophy alongside partner Lindsay Arnold.\n\nNow they two are returning to the ballroom to co-host the pint-sized version of the competition when Dancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts on Sunday, October 7.\n\n\u201cThe opening number of the premiere episode on Sunday, I think people are going to fall in love,\u201d Muniz told reporters on the red carpet after Dancing with the Stars last Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go, \u2018Oh, this is for real. They can dance.\u2019 I think it\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the age difference \u2014 the 12 celebrity kids range from 9 to 14 years old \u2014 the other variation is that Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, so the kids were out of school and so that many of our favorite pro dancers could serve as mentors, among them Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev. The judging panel also has fresh faces and is comprised of Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon.\n\n\u201cIt is a true black hole of love, warmth and genuinely rooting for each other,\u201d Fisher says of the DTWS family. \u201cThey\u2019ve built this community unlike anything that I\u2019ve ever seen and have all remained in each other\u2019s lives. As an extension of that, we naturally want to see the kids do well. You naturally want to root for them, especially when they are passionately working their butts off for it.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like to be back in the ballroom?\n\nJordan Fisher: I love it. We literally spent the last year doing season 25, and we did the tour together for four or five months, so this has really been our family for a year. But what\u2019s really cool is being on this side of it where you go, \u201cHey, we can\u2019t get eliminated, we\u2019re safe, we\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\nFrankie Muniz: Well, maybe you know next season they might say, \u201cFrankie you\u2019re out,\u201d but at least I\u2019ll be home.\n\nThe person who won deserved it, but were you surprised in anyway because there were a couple of competitors?\n\nJordan Fisher: There came a point in time in this season where Frankie and I would look at each other and we\u2019d go, \u201cIt could be any of them.\u201d\n\nFrankie Muniz: Any of them could be in the finale and could win. I think what\u2019s really cool about the show is it is hard to tell who\u2019s going to win. There isn\u2019t a frontrunner. Everyone\u2019s good in their own way, and even the development from week one to the end, it\u2019s insanity how much they improve in such a short time. I think people will like seeing that.\n\nHow did the kids do with the critiques from the judges?\n\nJordan Fisher: That was one of the things that really concerned me going into it, especially since I used to teach dance myself. I\u2019ve had kids in my life my whole life, I\u2019ve got a massive family, and there\u2019s a way you have to approach it, right? From a sense of honesty, love and nurture, we have, hopefully, helped foster a conducive environment for them where they can grow and feel like they\u2019ve actually gained something rather than just been beaten down.\n\nI feel like it\u2019s a little bit different with the adults. You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end. It was really beautifully done.\n\nWhat do you think about it being pre-taped?\n\nJordan Fisher: It\u2019s hard to say. I think season one, it was probably the safer way to go. There are a lot of things that you don\u2019t know what to expect, right, so you want to be able to cushion yourself with a little bit of a backend so you can adjust and make sure that everything happened the safest way possible. I think moving forward, it would be awesome to see it live because I think these kids can handle it.\n\nFrankie Muniz: I do hope that we can get the audience at home involved more with it going into the future, if we get to go again, but that all depends on if people tune in, so please tune in so we can do it again.\n\nWhen this season of DWTS ends, are you going to miss being the reigning champ?\n\nJordan Fisher: Every great thing has to come to an end at some point. It\u2019s the way that it goes. I\u2019ve got the trophy, I\u2019m very grateful for my experience, and I\u2019m so, so excited to see DeMarcus Ware with Lindsay. She\u2019s doing an incredible job with him.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s talked to you about this, but the way that he processes and learns is with numbers, He\u2019s great with numbers. He\u2019s a football player and that\u2019s what he does. So, Lindsay would get to five, six, seven, eight and go back to one, and he\u2019s like, \u201cNo, 9, 10, 11, 12, keep it going because I know that 20 is there and 40 is here and 65 is back there.\u201d It\u2019s an incredible thing for her to be able to adapt in that way. It\u2019s just a testament to how wonderful of a teacher she is.\n\nWhere do you have your Mirrorball trophy?\n\nJordan Fisher: It\u2019s in my bathroom right now. I\u2019m doing renovations on my house at the moment, so it is somewhere. It\u2019s wherever the builders have put it, and I\u2019m hoping that it\u2019s in a safe place. Yikes. I\u2019m literally home for only 48 hours because I\u2019m in New York working on a project right now, and I\u2019m not at my home, I\u2019m in a hotel here, which is kind of odd, and I\u2019m just hoping that it survives.\n\nDancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts Sunday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.", "images":
