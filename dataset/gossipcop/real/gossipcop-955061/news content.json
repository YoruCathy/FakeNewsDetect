{"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751/https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/12361-elle-macpherson-newbeauty/", "text": "by Maggie Bullock | Photographed by Gilles Bensimon | July 19, 2018\n\nTo the naked eye, it appears that remarkably little has changed about Elle Macpherson in the quarter-century since she was an 18-year-old Aussie surf junkie who started modeling to pay for law-school textbooks. Her legs are still infinite and impossibly lean, her hair still tosses like it\u2019s in the gust of a perpetual wind machine, and her smile still radiates the just-try-to-keepup-with-me tomboy energy that made her the sex symbol of her generation. But Macpherson is in fact human, she swears, and around the time she turned 50 in 2014, she was experiencing symptoms that will sound familiar to even non supermodels.\n\n\u201cWhat I noticed is that my skin got dry,\u201d she says. \u201cI started to put on weight around my waist and hips, which was never my thing before. My legs started to get heavy. I started to feel lethargic. I also didn\u2019t feel inspired. I wasn\u2019t sleeping. My whole energy felt heavy.\u201d\n\nNothing in particular had changed about her lifestyle, but everything that used to work\u2014 the diet and exercise that had kept her fit for decades\u2014just wasn\u2019t working anymore. On the recommendation of a friend who had recently enlisted London uber-nutritionist Simone Laubscher to help her weather a course of chemotherapy, Macpherson headed to Laubscher\u2019s clinic in London\u2019s Harley Street. She walked out with a suggestion to switch to a plant-based alkaline diet, and a jar of the doctor\u2019s custom-mixed powdered greens supplement. Within two weeks, her skin changed. \u201cWhat I\u2019d always thought were sunspots\u2014actually, they were sugar spots\u2014 started to clear, and my skin looked tighter, dewier and plumper. I started to lose weight, probably because my sugar cravings had subsided. My digestion improved. I felt more emotionally balanced.\u201d The change was so dramatic, \u201cit was like a light bulb went off,\u201d she says. \u201cI realized, this isn\u2019t a fixed state of being. I can change the way I feel.\u201d\n\nLong before the term multi-hyphenate had become the standard famous-person job description clich\u00e9, Macpherson was seizing opportunities to become not just Elle, The Body, but Elle, The Business. As early as the mid-80s, it occurred to her that if Sports Illustrated could make good money selling calendars fronted by her own tawny, sun-dappled image, so could she. Macpherson hired a crew, set up her own shoots and sold them to a publisher. Then, recognizing that regular folks might enjoy watching a famous model make her own calendar, looped in a local TV station to document the project. Voil\u00e0, free PR. \u201cIt was the kind of thing where I spent $60,000 and made a million,\u201d Macpherson says, then demurs, \u201cwell, not those numbers exactly,\u201d but you get the idea. \u201cIt was one of those experiences where I realized that if I take initiative, apply what I\u2019ve learned and take a risk, then it may pay off.\u201d By the time Macpherson had her green-diet epiphany, she was already a practiced businesswoman: Elle Macpherson Body,a global lingerie empire of high-end lacy underthings\u2014 among them, incidentally, really good bras for women of most sizes\u2014is sold everywhere from Net-a-Porter to Saks. True to form, her a-ha moment electrified not just a new lifestyle, but a new business plan. Enlisting Laubscher as a formulator for the brand, she souped up the nutritionist\u2019s miracle powder and launched the Super Elixir Greens, a blend of 45 plant-based ingredients that dissolve in water for an all-in-one daily health boost. Other beauty-from-within products followed, including the Nourishing Plant Protein powder (she blends the chocolate flavor with avocado and eats it with a spoon). The mother of two called us from home in Miami to talk about life as a wellness guru.\n\nYOU\u2019VE BECOME SUCH A VOCAL PROPONENT OF ALKALINITY. WHAT DO YOU DO BESIDES TAKING THE ELIXIR TO MAINTAIN YOUR PH LEVELS?\n\nIf I\u2019m really in my groove, I love a raw, plant-based diet. That\u2019s how I feel best. I eat grains, nuts, seeds, beans, vegetables, almond milk, hemp milk, chia seeds. I make my own granola in a dehydrator. Avocado, salads, juicing\u2014you know, beautiful, whole, natural foods. As far as animal products are concerned, I\u2019ll have a poached egg every now and then, some Parmesan cheese and goat cheese, but they\u2019re not staples of my diet.\n\nActually, WelleCo sells sticks that can test the pH of urine or saliva. You can test your saliva morning and night and see how well you\u2019re doing. If you haven\u2019t had your greens, or you\u2019re eating sugar, wheat or animal fats, you can tell a huge difference from one day to the next.\n\nWHAT IS YOUR DAY LIKE?\n\nI wake up around 5:00 or 5:30 and listen to a guided meditation or do some hands-on Reiki\u2014I learned how to do it on myself. I make sure I\u2019m not checking emails from the minute I wake up; I breathe and just prepare for the day for 10 or 20 minutes. Then I wake up my son Cy\u2014he\u2019s 14; my eldest, Flynn [age 20], is in college in Boston\u2014and make us breakfast. I have hot water and lemon instead of espresso now, and I\u2019ll put in a pinch of cayenne or some ginger, or a little bit of stevia if I want. Then I take two teaspoons of the Super Elixir in 500 milliliters of filtered water. I see that as almost like putting cream on my face. For breakfast, I\u2019ll maybe have a soaked chia seed pudding that I make using almond milk with a little green stevia, some ginger, cardamom, nutmeg, and cinnamon.\n\nWHAT ABOUT EXERCISE?\n\nI\u2019ve been through so many phases. I\u2019ve spun, I\u2019ve done boxing and I\u2019ve even had a workout video. But less strenuous exercise is sometimes better for our bodies\u2014at least that\u2019s been my experience. I do Vinyasa yoga or power yoga, or go for a swim, go paddle boarding or waterskiing, or take the dogsfor a walk. If I\u2019m lucky enough to be by the sea, I think walking in seawater is one of the best things I can do for my body. It tones the legs and the waist, it\u2019s great for minerals, and if you have any water retention, it\u2019s a great diuretic. I walk in about thigh-deep or knee-deep water for 40 minutes to an hour.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE REST OF YOUR DAILY SELF-CARE RITUAL?\n\nBefore or after I shower, I dry brush my body. You can watch how to do it on YouTube\u2014basically, it\u2019s circular movements toward your heart, from your fingertips and your toes. In the shower, I do about three cycles of switching hot and cold water. You can feel your body start tingling; it\u2019s so good for your lymphatics and circulatory system, and such an easy thing to do. Sometimes I\u2019ll use WelleCo\u2019s limited-edition salt scrub, a formula that I found in Japan when I was there a couple of years ago. I\u2019m a big scrub and moisturizer girl. It makes a huge difference in the texture of the skin, helps the circulatory system, sloughs off dry skin cells, and it\u2019s a great stimulus and detox. Then I slather on moisturizer. For my face, I use WelleCo\u2019s Organic Rose Geranium Cr\u00e9me; on my body, it\u2019s a French pharmaceutical called Bioderma\u2014it\u2019s simple and soaks in really well.\n\nANY RECENT BEAUTY DISCOVERIES WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?\n\nA new little brand called The Lost Explorer by David de Rothschild. They have a moisturizer, scrub, mist and spray. It\u2019s very consciously curated, natural and very considered. And I love the packaging. It\u2019s small, and I can travel with it.\n\nHOW DO YOU SAFELY MAINTAIN THE LOOK OF BEING TAN?\n\nForget about the look of a tan\u2014the immune system is very much boosted by sunshine. I try to lie outside for 20 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the afternoon. I close my eyes and raise my face to the sun so that the pineal gland in the front of my head is toward the sun. That just works wonders for your immune system.\n\nSUN?! DOES YOUR DERMATOLOGIST GIVE YOU A HARD TIME ABOUT IT?\n\nWell, we\u2019re talking 20 minutes at 9:00 in the morning. People always ask me, \u201cWhat do you regret?\u201d I believe the past is a wonderful teacher\u2014I regret nothing\u2014but I do wish I\u2019d worn more sunblock! Or looked after my skin when I was younger, because it really shows now. There\u2019s one sunblock I love called Invisible Zinc, which is more of a barrier to the sun than a chemical shield.\n\nDO YOU DO ANY PROFESSIONAL TREATMENTS TO TRY TO REVERSE SUN DAMAGE?\n\nWell, I can\u2019t do lasers because I live in the sun, which compounds the issue, so that\u2019s out of the question. But, I\u2019ve been using an infrared sauna at home for about a year and a half. I try to do it every day for an hour\u2014 I\u2019ll watch TV in there or do a meditation or a phone call. That\u2019s been phenomenal for the quality of my skin and the capacity of my body to detox and really function well. There\u2019s a great company here called Therasage; they sell a portable version where your head stays out, which is nice because it gets up to 140 to 170 degrees in there.\n\nI FEEL LIKE YOU\u2019RE GOING TO TELL ME YOU DON\u2019T WEAR ANY MAKEUP.\n\nI wear a little bit of RMS\u2019s organic concealer under my eyes or on any blemishes or freckles, and then a tiny little bit of translucent powder if I need it. I use Pat McGrath Skin Fetish 003 Illuminator\u2014it\u2019s just a sheer shine, so it brings out my bone structure\u2014on my eyes and lips. If I need a little contouring or some glow, I\u2019ll use the big Chanel bronzer.\n\nBUT NO COLOR?\n\nNo\u2014I think less is more anyway, and particularly as you mature. I can\u2019t wear foundation now without it really accentuating a whole bunch of stuff I don\u2019t want it to accentuate.\n\nYOU\u2019VE ALWAYS BEEN SO CONFIDENT IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA. HAS THAT CHANGED AS YOU\u2019VE GOTTEN OLDER?\n\nActually, I\u2019m much more confident now than I\u2019ve ever been, but I was quite uncomfortable in front of the camera for many years. I can see it when I look at my younger pictures, that \u201cI\u2019m so self-conscious, I can\u2019t even look in the camera because I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll see me, and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not good enough\u201d look. As time went on, I got more practiced and started to learn it as a skill\u2014how to make clothes look good and make my body look good\u2014from watching other people and studying photographers\u2019 work, and listening very closely to what the editors would say.\n\nYOU CERTAINLY LOOKED AT EASE IN ALL THOSE BIKINI SHOTS!\n\nIronically, I was more comfortable outdoors and in bathing suits because I grew up like that; it was a natural environment for me. Fashion wasn\u2019t a natural environment for me. I never thought modeling would be a lifelong career. It was a means to an end, but I started to see the value. I loved traveling, I picked up languages and I learned about art and music and literature\u2014it was just a wonderful education.\n\nYOU WERE SO EMBLEMATIC OF THIS ACTIVE, ATHLETIC IDEAL THAT REALLY CHANGED THE GAME IN THE \u201880S. COULD YOU FEEL THAT SHIFT HAPPENING AT THE TIME?\n\nNo, what I learned from that period was that it was very important to be me. When I started modeling, my physiognomy, my body type\u2014this sort of Amazonian, broad-shouldered, narrow-hipped, big-breasted, six-foot-tall Aussie girl\u2014wasn\u2019t in fashion. There was a huge movement toward girls being very androgynous and very slight. In the beginning, they used to bind my breasts with elastic so that the clothes wouldn\u2019t show the shape of the breast. I realized early on that I couldn\u2019t starve myself and shrink myself to try to be something I wasn\u2019t. So, it was when I managed to embrace my uniqueness and stand in my own truth of what I was, that I became more confident. That confidence was attractive, and people started booking me for that.\n\nIS THAT WHEN YOU THOUGHT, \u201cI\u2019VE MADE IT\u201d?\n\nI\u2019ve never really thought that; that\u2019s not my MO. Even when Time did the article that called me \u201cThe Body\u201d\u2014it was a cover in 1986\u2014I didn\u2019t even know it was out. It was on newsstands, and I was like, What? It didn\u2019t occur to me the impact it would have on the rest of my life. I didn\u2019t know they were doing the article; I didn\u2019t participate in it at all. Now, creating a business focused on wellness, which I believe so profoundly in, I\u2019m a cofounder, I work very closely with my CEO, I\u2019m the figurehead, the face-of, and I sit in my board meetings like any other shareholder of any other company. So perhaps not my proudest moment, but my most fulfilling moment is now.\n\nYOU MADE A GREAT BUSINESS OUT OF BEING THE BODY, BUT HOW DID IT FEEL TO BE CALLED THAT?\n\nOh, it\u2019s just a name [laughs]. I never saw it as demeaning; I don\u2019t judge myself like that. It\u2019s a bit like supermodel\u2014what does it mean? And anyway, inside the body there\u2019s a heart, and soul, so thank goodness for The Body.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/85203-skinfreakoutpng.png.204x150_q80_crop-smart.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/7155-ellemcphersonnewbeautyjpg.jpg.660x0_q80_crop-scale_upscale.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/75339-sephorapng.png.204x150_q80_crop-smart.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/74325-TightArms.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21004701&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://www.newbeauty.com/static/newbeauty/images/noavatar.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1572440699746061&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/13703-SmootherBlowout.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/8668-ExpiredBeautyProductsWhatToThrowAway.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/26656-shutterstock_569215900jpg.jpg.204x150_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newbeauty.com/tt-banner-left-v6.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.newbeauty.com/tt-banner-right-v6.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/7155-ellemcphersonnewbeautyjpg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/14407-birthcontrolherojpg.jpg.204x150_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.newbeauty.com/photos/64714-ellemcphersonnewbeautycoverjpg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/49269-ProductsFineHair.jpg.256x195_q80_crop-smart.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/59877-silktherapeutics-1png.png.300x300_q80_crop-smart_upscale.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/8470-texturesprayjpg.jpg.204x150_q80_crop-smart.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/7155-ellemcphersonnewbeautyjpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751/https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/12361-elle-macpherson-newbeauty/", "title": "Elle Macpherson Talks Entrepreneurial Instincts, Feel-Good Eating, and How to Live the Good Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Elle Macpherson shares her beauty secrets.", "og": {"title": "Elle Macpherson Talks Entrepreneurial Instincts, Feel-Good Eating, and How to Live the Good Life", "site_name": "NewBeauty", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751im_/https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/7155-ellemcphersonnewbeautyjpg.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728033751/https://www.newbeauty.com/blog/dailybeauty/12361-elle-macpherson-newbeauty/", "description": "From swimsuit bombshell to wellness guru, Elle Macpherson has always been more than The Body.", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 957932114216881}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewBeauty", "creator": "@NewBeauty", "title": "Elle Macpherson Talks Entrepreneurial Instincts, Feel-Good Eating, and How to Live the Good Life", "description": "<p>From swimsuit bombshell to wellness guru, Elle Macpherson has always been more than The Body.</p>", "image": {"src": "https://d53l9d6fqlxs2.cloudfront.net/photos/7155-ellemcphersonnewbeautyjpg.jpg"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531929600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
