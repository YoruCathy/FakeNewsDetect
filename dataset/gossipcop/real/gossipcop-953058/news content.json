Got your back baby!!/buen equipo ni una gota desperdiciada!! \ud83d\ude18 #escalciandovinoenpareia #sinmirar @spain,\" she captioned the impressive clip.\n\nGreat team , not a drop spilled!!

You've got nothing for each other,\" he explained. \"So make sure you have date night even if it's once in a blue moon, because most of the time you're just too tired and you'd actually prefer to sleep.\"\n\nRelated slideshow: Marvel superheroes, sidekicks, antiheroes and Avengers ranked:\n\nMarvel superheroes, sidekicks, antiheroes and Avengers ranked", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=e9fb45438f6d4880a2bd0f8963213df2&rnd=636676257985487382&rf=&tp=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmovies%252Fcelebrity%252Fwatch-chris-hemsworth-and-elsa-pataky-salsa-dance-in-spain-on-her-42nd-birthday%252Far-AAAj0Nc&di=2253&lng=en-us&cv.product=prime&pn=article&activityId=e9fb45438f6d4880a2bd0f8963213df2&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&st.dpt=movies-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=movies&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAk53B.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=612&y=986", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAk6Kq.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=1595&y=511", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjNi0.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/57/a49b8d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAjqRy.img?h=66&w=88&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&x=1142&y=1109", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://static-entertainment-wus-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/82/c22c7d.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=636676257985487382&c7=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmovies%252Fcelebrity%252Fwatch-chris-hemsworth-and-elsa-pataky-salsa-dance-in-spain-on-her-42nd-birthday%252Far-AAAj0Nc&c8=&c9=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZjjB.img?h=17&w=0&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f&f=png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZjjB.img?h=100&w=100&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=f&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAopNLw.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAyjAuh.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAzu2kj.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=1645&y=590", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfZ6og.img?h=16&w=16&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAsZMRM.img?h=72&w=96&m=6&q=60&u=t&o=t&l=f", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAjfwi.img?h=451&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=809&y=720", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=2253&pi=&ps=&su=http%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Fmovies%252Fcelebrity%252Fwatch-chris-hemsworth-and-elsa-pataky-salsa-dance-in-spain-on-her-42nd-birthday%252Far-AAAj0Nc&pageid=articlevnext&mkt=en-us&pn=article&pp=False&cv.product=prime&cv.partner=Wonderwall&cv.publcat=Whalerock%2BIndustries&st.dpt=movies-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636676257985487382&rf=&rid=e9fb45438f6d4880a2bd0f8963213df2&cvs=Browser&subcvs=movies&cv.entityId=AAAj0Nc&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=AA5HhRQ&ar=0&d.dgk=downlevel.pc&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=e9fb45438f6d4880a2bd0f8963213df2&pm=&pg.n=articlevnext&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&ex="], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638im_/http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAAjfwi.img?h=451&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=809&y=720", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180719193638/https://www.wonderwall.com/news/watch-chris-hemsworth-and-elsa-pataky-salsa-dance-spain-her-42nd-birthday-3015440.article", "title": "Watch Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky salsa dance in Spain on her 42nd birthday", "meta_data": {"application-name": "Watch Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky salsa dance in Spain on her 42nd birthday", "cq": "passed", "description": "The actor comedically showed off the moves he learned on Australia's 'Dancing With the Stars' years ago.", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
