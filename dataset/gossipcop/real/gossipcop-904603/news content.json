DeMille award for lifetime achievement at this year\u2019s Golden Globes. During her speech, Winfrey recalled watching Sidney Poitier win at the Golden Globes for 1964\u2019s Lilies of the Field and how it was the first time she saw a black man celebrated on television. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that at this moment, there are little girls watching as I become the first black woman to receive this award,\u201d Winfrey said.\n\nMaking a plea for a free press, Winfrey said, \u201cI want to say I value the press more than ever before as we try to navigate these complicated times. Which brings me to this: What I know for sure is that speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have. I\u2019m especially proud and inspired by all the women who felt strong enough and empowered enough to speak up and share their personal stories.\u201d\n\nMen and women at Sunday\u2019s Golden Globes showed remarkable solidarity in protesting sexual harassment and sexual assault in Hollywood and the world at large, promoting the new Time\u2019s Up initiative and also wearing black to express unity.\n\n\u201cThis year, we became the story. But it\u2019s not just a story affecting the entertainment industry, it\u2019s one that transcends any culture or workplace,\u201d Winfrey said, before noting that sexual misconduct affects women and men in industries that stretch beyond Hollywood.\n\nWinfrey then pivoted her speech by telling the story of Recy Taylor, who was raped by a group of white men in Alabama in 1944.\n\n\u201cRecy Taylor died 10 days ago. She lived too many years in a culture broken by brutally powerful men. Women were not believed,\u201d Winfrey said, before adding to the abusive men, \u201ctheir time is up.\u201d\n\nWinfrey closed her speech with a call for unity: \u201cI want all the girls watching to know a new day is on the horizon. And when that new day finally dawns, it will be because of a lot of magnificent women, many of whom are right here in this room tonight, and some pretty phenomenal men, fighting hard to make sure they are the leaders to take us to the time where nobody has to say \u2018me too\u2019 again.\u201d\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

And so I think wearing black in solidarity is one step. I think what Time\u2019s Up is doing with legal defense fund is a major step. It was very important to all of us that it not just be about the women of Hollywood, but to extend to the women of the world because there isn\u2019t a culture, a religion, a workplace, that hasn\u2019t been effected by it. And one of the reasons I wanted to tell Recy Taylor\u2019s story is because it\u2019s been going on for a very long time. There are so many women who\u2019ve endured so much and remained silent and kept going because there was no other recourse and now that we\u2019ve all joined as one voice, I think it feels like empowerment to those women who\u2019ve never had it.\u201d\n\nFor years, Winfrey was known as the queen of the daytime talk show with The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ran for 25 seasons from September 8, 1986, to May 25, 2011, while also scoring lead roles in critically acclaimed movies \u2014 many of which she also produced. In 1985, she costarred in Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Color Purple, a role for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. In 1998, she produced and starred in the movie adaptation of Toni Morrison\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, Beloved, and later in Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler and Ava DuVernay\u2019s Selma. She is also the chairman and CEO of the cable network, OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network, and founder of O, The Oprah Magazine.\n\nWinfrey\u2019s charitable endeavors include establishing The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa to provide education for girls from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nThe philanthropist returns to the big screen in March 2018 with the upcoming Disney adaptation of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s sci-fi novel A Wrinkle in Time, in which she costars alongside Mindy Kaling and Reese Witherspoon.\n\nWinfrey is the first black woman to earn the Cecil B.
