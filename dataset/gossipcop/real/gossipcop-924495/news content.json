(A \u201csprinkle\u201d is a lighter baby shower designed to celebrate the upcoming birth of a second, third or fourth child. Presents are not the point, as Mama already has the necessities!)\n\nEdmonds, 33, shared a series of photos from the party on Instagram. She captioned the Saturday, March 31, post: \u201cAn unforgettable day!\u201d\n\nGuests nibbled on blue macaroons and vanilla cupcakes and toasted the Bravo personality with non-alcoholic Ready to Pop bubbly. And all revelers went home knowing a little bit more about multiples! The dessert table featured a laminated sheet called Twinsies Trivia. Fun Fact: 22 percent of twins are left-handed!\n\nThe Edmonds boys will be riding in style. E! reported on Sunday, that their mom was gifted a Nuna Demi Grow double stroller. The system offers 23 different seat positions and features the brand\u2019s signature oversize UPF 50+ canopy for sunny days.\n\nEdmonds, who is also mom of 16-month-old daughter Aspen, was introduced as a full-time cast member on RHOC in season 10. But she announced in January that she is done with the reality show. In a lengthy blog post, the fan favorite revealed that filming the series takes a \u201cmassive emotional toll,\u201d as well as a physical one. The soon-to-be parent of three explained that she is choosing to focus on her family for the time being.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy decision to make either. Edmonds will miss her \u201csoul sisters\u201d Shannon Beador and Tamra Judge.\u201cThey have touched my heart and I would do anything for them and I know they feel the same way about me,\u201d she gushed at the time \u201cWhat a gift to have found that on RHOC! But I guess it\u2019s time for me to become an actual real housewife of sorts. Oh, the irony!\u201d", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-king-edmonds.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2100px%2C1188px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-king-edmonds.jpg?crop=160px%2C0px%2C1860px%2C976px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-king-edmonds.jpg?crop=160px%2C0px%2C1860px%2C976px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-meghan-edmonds-celebrates-baby-sprinkle-for-twins/", "title": "Pregnant Meghan Edmonds Celebrates Baby Sprinkle for Twins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Meghan King Edmonds, who is expecting twin boys, celebrated a baby sprinkle on Saturday, March 31 \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pregnant\u00a0Meghan Edmonds Celebrates Baby Sprinkle Ahead of Twins' Arrival", "description": "Meghan King Edmonds, who is expecting twin boys, celebrated a baby sprinkle on Saturday, March 31 \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-meghan-edmonds-celebrates-baby-sprinkle-for-twins/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-02T14:45:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-king-edmonds.jpg?crop=160px%2C0px%2C1860px%2C976px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-king-edmonds.jpg?crop=160px%2C0px%2C1860px%2C976px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-04-02T14:21:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-02T14:45:31+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Meghan King Edmonds, who is expecting twin boys, celebrated a baby sprinkle on Saturday, March 31 \u2014 get the details", "title": "Pregnant\u00a0Meghan Edmonds Celebrates Baby Sprinkle Ahead of Twins' Arrival", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/meghan-king-edmonds.jpg?crop=160px%2C0px%2C1860px%2C976px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522678886.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
