I can compete \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time. With that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I\u2019ve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe memory of last year\u2019s Open is one that I will carry with me, and Olympia and I look forward to coming back again. I appreciate the support and understanding of my fans and everyone at the Australian Open.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Open begins Jan. 15. Williams\u2019s victory last year was her seventh in Melbourne and her last Grand Slam victory before the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.\n\nThe Australian Open tweeted best wishes shortly after her announcement, saying in part: \"Good luck for the rest of 2018, Serena! We'll miss you\"\n\nAndy Murray pulled out of the event earlier Thursday, citing a hip injury. And Novak Djokovic, who has won in Melbourne six times, is undecided on whether he'll play.\n\nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez\n\nPHOTOS: SERENA WILLIAMS' GRAND SLAM TITLES", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda66f5f7f4f802e2b4d64931fd13d3873740205/c=934-264-4565-2315/local/-/media/2018/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636506918103294631-2018-01-04-Serena-Williams.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e42b3e3f9e6d0d26d33e41de814611a623f0c95d/c=0-269-2639-1760&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2017/12/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636498934117329254-USATSI-10386833.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda66f5f7f4f802e2b4d64931fd13d3873740205/c=934-264-4565-2315/local/-/media/2018/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636506918103294631-2018-01-04-Serena-Williams.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda66f5f7f4f802e2b4d64931fd13d3873740205/c=934-264-4565-2315/local/-/media/2018/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636506918103294631-2018-01-04-Serena-Williams.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2018/01/04/serena-williams-withdraws-australian-open/1006054001/", "title": "Serena Williams withdraws from Australian Open", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Serena Williams withdraws from Australian Open", "description": "Seven-time and defending champion says she isn't quite ready to return after giving birth to daughter in September.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2018/01/04/serena-williams-withdraws-australian-open/1006054001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda66f5f7f4f802e2b4d64931fd13d3873740205/c=934-264-4565-2315/local/-/media/2018/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636506918103294631-2018-01-04-Serena-Williams.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "A.J.
