That celebrity is Aubrey O\u2019Day who used to be in the singing group, Danity Kane. She has since made headlines for reportedly having an affair with Donald Trump Jr. while he was married after meeting him on Celebrity Apprentice. So what was her relationship like with Paul DelVecchio and did their relationship end on bad terms? Here is everything you need to know.\n\nPauly D and Aubrey O\u2019Day met on Famously Single\n\nIt only makes sense that the two reality stars met on a dating reality show. The two met in the show\u2019s first season and got pretty serious. There were rumors that they were engaged by the end of the show because O\u2019Day was seen wearing an engagement ring, but it was just a prank. The two still had a good time falling in love on the show.\n\n\u201cThe show is about all of us coming together,\u201d explained O\u2019Day according to E! News \u201cdating, learning through a dating coach how to go out there and approach people that are better suited for us and kind of get over the issues that we were having. And it ended up just like becoming like this chemistry happened within the house with a few of the cast-mates and Pauly and I were one of them.\u201d\n\nHe admitted this was his first relationship\n\nThe DJ opened up about learning from dating the singer. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much,\u201d he told E! News. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy because it was my first real relationship. I\u2019ve learned so much being in it \u2014 I\u2019ve learned don\u2019t assume anything. If you have a problem with your partner, don\u2019t assume. Just ask them and tell them how you feel, because most of the time it\u2019s not really what you think.\u201d\n\nThe two reportedly broke up in 2016\n\nThe first round of their relationship lasted less than a year. According to ET, the two broke up in the summer of 2016. But they then reunited and tried to make it work on reality tv.\n\nO\u2019Day said she tried Marriage Boot Camp a second time because she wanted a fresh perspective\n\nO\u2019Day previously was on Marriage Boot Camp with ex-boyfriend Travis Garland in Season 5. The reality show didn\u2019t work for them the first time so why did she go back to work on things with DelVecchio?\n\nThe singer told HollywoodLife, \u201cI was feeling suffocated, and losing my identity, and I was really hoping for a new environment, to get some fresh perspective.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know about her reported affair with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe Jersey Shore star was asked if her alleged previous affair with Donald Trump Jr. would be mentioned on Marriage Boot Camp. \u201cWe didn\u2019t address that at all. Yeah, I didn\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d he told Us Weekly. \u201cI guess [the news broke] after or something like that.\u201d\n\nThe two officially split in July 2017 reportedly because the DJ didn\u2019t want to get married\n\nThe couple officially called it quits and it was reportedly DelVecchio who ended things. \u201cAubrey was pressing Pauly for an engagement ring,\u201d a source told ET. \u201cPauly did not see marriage with Aubrey in his future.\u201d\n\nThe couple did previously talk about marriage. She told E! News, \u201cI want a ring like ASAP!\u201d He also said, \u201cShe\u2019s the one for me, so I\u2019m looking forward to the next steps and waiting for the right moment to make all that happen.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Day said \u2018it\u2019s disappointing\u2019 that the DJ has said unkind things about her\n\nNow that their relationship is over the two have talked about each other. But the singer hasn\u2019t been happy about everything her ex-boyfriend has said. \u201cLately, I\u2019ve seen some Google alerts pop up about some unkind things that he said about me, which is disappointing \u2019cause I thought he was a bigger person than that,\u201d she told Page Six. \u201cMy mistake!\u201d\n\nShe claimed there were rules in their relationship\n\nThe singer also described their relationship as being unhealthy. \u201cThere was no healthy dialogue,\u201d she told Us Weekly. \u201cThere was no progressive communication. There were rules and the rules needed to be followed and when they weren\u2019t, you were punished.\u201d\n\nRead more: Jen Harley Accuses \u2018Jersey Shore Family Vacation Part 2\u2019 of Editing Fight with Ronnie Ortiz-Magro\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paulydaubreyoday.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paulydaubreyoday.jpg?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/paulydaubreyoday.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jersey-shore-family-vacation-pauly-d-and-aubrey-o-day-romantic-past.html/", "title": "'Jersey Shore Family Vacation': Pauly D and Aubrey O'Day's Romantic Past", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/jersey-shore-family-vacation-pauly-d-and-aubrey-o-day-romantic-past.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Did you know Pauly D of 'Jersey Shore Family Vacation' used to date, Aubrey O'Day?
