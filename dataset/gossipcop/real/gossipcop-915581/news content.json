People on Twitter quickly began to ask \u201cWho is that random drunk girl?\u201d\n\nIf the video won\u2019t play, click here.\n\nEste shared the video to her Twitter and insisted that she was \u201cnot drunk, just living my truth\u201d. Mariana Diamandis replied \u201cOmg, you legend.\u201d\n\nThis morning, HAIM were interviewed by BBC Radio 1 and they used the opportunity to publicly apologise to Cheryl Cole for Este\u2019s behaviour and invite her to their upcoming concert.\n\nEste began the phonecall, while her sisters tried to contain their laughter in the background:\n\nCheryl. Hi. This is Este Haim calling. I\u2019m in a band called HAIM with my sisters. Wait! Before anything, congratulations on the baby. Big mazal. Um, I happened to be sitting behind you last night at the Brit Awards and had an amazing time.\n\nHowever, some people on the internet are claiming that I may or may not have been, I don\u2019t know, thumbing my nose, at the situation in front of me. That\u2019s an Americanism.\n\nShe then wanted to clarify that she has \u2018no beef\u2019 with Cheryl or Liam, before extending an invitation to one of HAIM\u2019s UK tour dates and telling Cheryl that she\u2019d soon be receiving Este\u2019s phone number via text. (BBC Radio 1)\n\nSource: Ian West\n\nLiam Gallagher attended the same Brits after-party as his 20-year-old daughter that he has never met.\n\nEarlier this week, Liam Gallagher admitted that he \u2018hasn\u2019t got round\u2019 to meeting his two daughters Molly and Gemma, who were both conceived during his affairs in the 1990s.\n\nHe told The Mirror \u201cI\u2019ve heard she\u2019s all right, though. She\u2019s doing all right. I never heard anything that she wanted to meet me.\u201d\n\nWell, they finally had the chance to hang out last night, after they ended up going to the same after party once the Brits were wrapped up. The pair of them both headed to the Warner Music and Ciroc after-party in Covent Garden. No word yet on whether they actually interacted with one another though.\n\nIn his interview with The Mirror, Liam said of his daughters \u201cI wish them well. If they ever need anything, give us a shout.\u201d (Metro)\n\nSource: Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment\n\nCheryl and Liam put some of those breakup rumours to rest last night.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t notice in that HAIM video above, Cheryl and Liam were busy telling Jack Whitehall what their safe word was. Liam also shared loads of the photos of the couple backstage hanging out and engaging in some PDAs.\n\nWhile Cheryl was at a charity event in Newcastle a day before the Brit Awards, Cheryl Cole was asked if the stories about their rumoured split are bothering her.\n\nShe replied:\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t bother me at all because my focus is solely on [motherhood]. I\u2019ve waited for seven years to finally be here and none of that happens. This is the most important part for me.\u201d (E!
