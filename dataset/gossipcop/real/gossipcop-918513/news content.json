The clause can be added to contracts for actors and others working on a movie, requiring that the movie\u2019s producers hire a diverse cast and crew. If the movie wasn\u2019t diverse, it would give the actor a legal reason to back out of the contract \u2014 meaning the rider could have a serious effect on all the hiring practices on a film.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jimmykimmel2018oscars.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Guillermo-del-Toro-Oscars-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-927307618-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-26-at-1.07.52-PM-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Daniel Kohn", "Brian Welk", "Ashley Boucher", "Steve Pond", "Ross A.
