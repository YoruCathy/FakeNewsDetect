When the host asked about the status of her split from the NBA star, La La said she did not plan to file for divorce just yet.\n\n\u201cNot right now, I\u2019m not,\u201d the 38-year-old said. \u201cYou know marriages are tough, and you know that. We all know that. It\u2019s filled with ups and downs. We are just going through a time right now.\u201d\n\nThe Puerto Rican actress, who tied the knot with Carmelo in 2010, said the most important thing for her was her 10-year-old son.\n\n\u2033[Carmelo] and I are the best of friends and our number one commitment is to our son, Kiyan,\u201d she continued. \u201cI would absolutely never say a bad thing about my husband. That\u2019s my son\u2019s father and he is an amazing dad. I could not ask for a better dad.\u201d\n\nIn April, TMZ reported that La La and Carmelo had split and were living apart and that the decision was allegedly amicable. Rumors that Carmelo had cheated also began to circulate shorty after.\n\nWilliams also asked La La to comment on the loving photo Carmelo shared via Instagram on Monday, in which he sent a birthday message to his estranged wife saying she was his \u201cearth.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Carmelo Anthony (@carmeloanthony) on Jun 25, 2017 at 9:53pm PDT\n\nWhen the host said the caption sounded like Carmelo wanted her back, the actress responded: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nAs far as whether there\u2019s still a chance to work things out, La La said she didn\u2019t know what would happen in the future but that what she and Carmelo have shared could not be erased.\n\n\u201cWe are the best of friends, I\u2019ve been with Melo since he was 19 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not with somebody for that long and it just goes out the window. I love him with all of my heart.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59552cc82100003700fc4aea.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d3cdd1700001600b065cf.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59552cc82100003700fc4aea.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/la-la-anthony-explains-why-she-hasnt-divorced-carmelo-anthony_n_59551be3e4b0da2c7321bfe1", "title": "La La Anthony On Why She Hasn't Divorced Carmelo Anthony", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "It's not over, yet.", "keywords": "Celebrities,sports,Carmelo Anthony,La La Anthony", "og": {"title": "La La Anthony On Why She Hasn't Divorced Carmelo Anthony", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59552cc82100003700fc4aea.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59552cc82100003700fc4aea.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/la-la-anthony-explains-why-she-hasnt-divorced-carmelo-anthony_n_59551be3e4b0da2c7321bfe1", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "It's not over, yet."}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,sports,Carmelo Anthony,La La Anthony", "section": "Latino Voices", "published_time": "2017-06-29 14:07:47 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-06-29 14:07:47 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "title": "La La Anthony On Why She Hasn't Divorced Carmelo Anthony", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59552cc82100003700fc4aea.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "It's not over, yet.", "creator": "CaritoJuliette"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59551be3e4b0da2c7321bfe1", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "latino-voices"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498759667.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
