But Netflix is here to expand our fascination with unsolved mysteries, corruption, and injustice with two new documentary shows that focus on different kinds of wrongdoing: food production crimes and corporate greed.\n\nMark your calendars: Netflix\u2019s Rotten and Dirty Money \u2014 which has an episode about Donald Trump\u2019s business dealings \u2014 hit the streaming platform in January.\n\nROTTEN\n\nRotten examines the scary underworld of global food production to \u201cexpose the corruption, waste and real dangers behind your everyday eating habits,\u201d according to a Netflix release:\n\nEpisodes explore everything from the rise of peanut allergies to New England fishery consolidation to an intriguing (and terrifying) scam known as \u201cHoneygate.\u201d The docuseries from the same people behind Anthony Bourdain Parts Unknown looks disgusting, shocking, and illuminating, all at the same time.\n\nDIRTY MONEY\n\nIn case the name didn\u2019t tip you off, the second new series, Dirty Money, investigates stories of scandal and corruption in the corporate world through the insightful lens of Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney and others:\n\nTrump\u2019s sketchy business background comes up in an episode called, \u201cThe Confidence Man.\u201d The episode profiles Trump Inc. and its rise from epic failures and scams to the Oval Office. Other episodes look at payday lenders ripping off Americans, HSBC\u2019s ties with Mexican drug cartels, and a $20 million maple syrup heist.\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to have more true crime TV in our lives. Look out for Rotten on Netflix on January 5th, and Dirty Money on January 26th.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2F14054712%2Fnet-e1513288051314.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072550/avatar-i-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2F14054712%2Fnet-e1513288051314.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gwendolyn Purdom"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/netflix-true-crime-dramas-2018/", "title": "Netflix is dropping two new true crime dramas in 2018 \u2014 and one of them involves Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "donald trump,netflix,true crime", "news_keywords": "donald trump,netflix,true crime", "description": "Corporate and food industry corruption get the true crime treatment in \"Dirty Money\" and \"Rotten,\" the latest original docuseries from Netflix.", "og": {"title": "Netflix is dropping two new true crime dramas in 2018 \u2014 and one of them involves Trump", "type": "article", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/netflix-true-crime-dramas-2018/", "description": "Also involved: an episode about stolen maple syrup.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2F14054712%2Fnet-e1513288051314.jpg", "width": 667, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/netflix-true-crime-dramas-2018/", "description": "Corporate and food industry corruption get the true crime treatment in \"Dirty Money\" and \"Rotten,\" the latest original docuseries from Netflix.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2F14054712%2Fnet-e1513288051314.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/reviews-coverage/tv-shows/netflix-true-crime-dramas-2018/", "title": "Netflix is dropping two new true crime dramas in 2018 \u2014 and one of them involves Trump", "description": "Also involved: an episode about stolen maple syrup.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F12%2F14054712%2Fnet-e1513288051314.jpg"}, "fb": {"pages": 209123339112078}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ot6W_7hvrM?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
