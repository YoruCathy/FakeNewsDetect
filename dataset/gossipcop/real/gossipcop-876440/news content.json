NETWORK\n\nThe show opens with a brief recap of last season: Brie gave birth and Nikki got engaged. Oh, and they said buzz words: WWE Universe and Bella Army. Yeah, I\u2019m trying not to demonstrate that I don\u2019t really wanna watch this; it\u2019s not exactly working. Also, I wanted John and Nikki to marry just so that she could divorce his psychopath ass and take half of his shit. I feel I deserve that for having seen two seasons of Total Bellas. After Nikki says Brie\u2019s vagina has healed, she adds that she gave birth through her belly. Then Nikki updates John Cena\u2019s life: \u201cJohn, he\u2019s been extremely busy this past year. Like, John\u2019s literally on fire.\u201d\n\nAnyhoo, John and Nikki are on a pier. John is wearing a loud, unfashionable suit jacket that is obviously the costume of someone trying to pretend to be a fancy rich person. Really, no fancy rich person would wear that. Yeah, it\u2019s on E! and I\u2019m going there, it\u2019s like the last frontier. Nikki is wearing something red. It clashes badly with John Cena\u2019s loud unfashionable suit jacket. Clearly, no one has a stylist. John Cena butchers a \u201cyou can\u2019t see me\u201d joke. Because Nikki will someday be Nikki Cena, ergo people will not be able to see her. I want this five minutes of my life back.\n\nOnto Brie and Bryan, the pretend environmentalists in another house in a different state. I doubt that Edward O. Wilson thinks you should have like five houses. So, everyone has a house in California now \u2013 yes, John and Nikki have a house in San Diego too. Birdie can supposedly say \u201cpapa.\u201d In general, baby\u2019s first word is usually dad or dada. Anyway, onto John and Nikki\u2019s new California house. John Cena\u2019s rug has arrived. Yes, this was a YouTube clip. John is disappointed that Nikki didn\u2019t tell him that the rug arrived. I guess maybe John should\u2019ve answered the door when the bell rang. Nikki is wearing Spanx because she ate pizza. Yes, girls, Nikki Bella has unhealthy attitudes about body and food, and do not look to her for advice \u2013 EVER. Yeah, I\u2019m old enough to be your mom, and I mean that.\n\nThere\u2019s a tour of this new house. It has fancy shit. Nikki calls John Cena \u201cLove,\u201d which is a thing that normal people in healthy relationships don\u2019t do. John plays the piano and talks about wainscoting. Brie and Bryan arrive and take their shoes off, you know, because they remember that John Cena is an asshole with way too many f\u2014ing rules because fancy shit is more important than people. Anyway, this was also a YouTube clip and, like an out of touch weirdo, John Cena says something in Chinese to the baby. Baby\u2019s first words are discussed again, yes, really. Seriously, like all other infants \u2013 it\u2019s probably gonna be dad. Then Nikki and Brie suggest that there should be a nursery, John Cena stares off into the distance and pretends that no one said that. Yes, this was also a YouTube clip. I think maybe they actually showed the whole show on YouTube on three different accounts like two minutes at a time.\n\nBack from the first commercial: Shameless Birdie Bee plug. Brie and Nikki are going to try on lingerie. Meanwhile Bryan and the creepy brother J.J. are on double date with the babies. It was Birdie\u2019s first carousel ride. At Brie and Bryan\u2019s San Diego house, Bryan admit to doing a baby\u2019s first thing without Brie. Bryan apparently missed the first crawl. I guess this is supposed to be a real plot point? Brie pulls out some Birdie Bee lingerie. She says she\u2019s been \u201cwearing a thong since middle school.\u201d Bryan says, \u201cThat\u2019s the trashiest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Next shameless plug: The place that makes the wine that the Bella Twins name is slapped on is bottling Chardonnay. Oh god, I have to type this: Nikki critiques Brie talking. So, then Nikki dares Brie to used a \u201cbig word\u201d in the meeting. She googles big words and comes up with \u201canomaly.\u201d Neither one of them actually knows what it means. Again kids, read a book and find a real role model.\n\nIn the mean time, supposedly John and Nikki are getting married in West Newbury, Mass. Weird, I wonder if that\u2019s where he married his first wife? Probably. It\u2019s probably convenient for his family and like no one else, which isn\u2019t a surprise, because empathy isn\u2019t really his thing. Nikki would rather be married in Napa or some place romantic. Since we all have the internet, we all know that the wedding that didn\u2019t happen was supposed to take place on Cinco de Mayo in Mexico. So, clearly, at some point in this season John Cena had to compromise\u2026 or he lost a bet. Anyway, commercial. They talk about the wedding, and where it should or shouldn\u2019t take place, then Nikki mentions \u201cDancing With The Stars,\u201d and Brie attempts to sneak in the use of the word \u201canomaly,\u201d which she uses wrong. That part of me that graduated from high school with a GPA of 4.33 feels sad.\n\nMoving along, Birdie is filmed in a pool. The mom films it so that Brie can watch it later. I have a feeling this isn\u2019t going to go over huge. No segue, the twins are in a vineyard talking about how Nikki and John should get married in a vineyard. But, OMG, you guys, it\u2019s not what John wants. On behalf of women: Screw John and his dipshitted wants. Nikki feels that if she confronts her emotionally abusive fiancee about where the wedding takes place, then he will childishly renege on getting married. Yes, John Cena is that kind of inflexible dick. If you need a reminder, then go to YouTube and find the WWE clip where Nikki cooks John dinner or the other clip where John\u2019s \u201cpower of attorney\u201d was a big hairy secret and they argued about it in an SUV. All the future John Cena tears (yeah, I watched the promo commercial) don\u2019t erase what I\u2019ve already seen. If reality TV is fake, I can\u2019t imagine why someone whose target demographic is women and children would choose to be such an ass.\n\nBack from commercial, Brie and Nikki drink wine. Brie brings up the wedding locale again. Nikki says that \u201cwedding planning has been a lot of fun\u201d in the most unconvincing tone of voice ever. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sacrifice it all because you\u2019re grateful that John proposed to you,\u201d this may be the smartest thing Brie Bella has said thus far. In a vehicle Brie and Nikki discuss Nikki having baby fever. Brie asks if she\u2019s broached the topic with John. John\u2019s response to having kids is \u201cabsolutely not.\u201d Even as a childless old woman (hey, 38 is ancient in WWE Diva years), I have no idea how much Nikki Bella loves fancy purses and designer shoes over something she appears to actually covet, and why if she\u2019s such an empowered woman \u2013 why she hasn\u2019t found a partner with the same life goals. Given my family\u2019s reproductive history, had I really wanted kids, then I wouldn\u2019t have spent five-plus years with someone who doesn\u2019t, not for all the shoes or purses in the world.\n\nBrie gets back and Bryan admits that he took Birdie swimming. Evidently they can\u2019t wait forever for the kid to swim for the first time. Yeah, I dunno, pretty sure the first time I swam I was like 3-4 years old, and my mom didn\u2019t miss it. I have a feeling my father was there too. Brie isn\u2019t happy about the recording. Moving along, there\u2019s a formal dinner at John & Nikki\u2019s house. We all dread John Cena\u2019s dumb rules. Anyway, Nikki makes a joke about giving a blow job to a candle (again little girls: NOT A ROLE MODEL), John Cena makes a fellatio reference, Nikki says she was trying to get him excited, John says: \u201cIt didn\u2019t work, I\u2019m dead inside.\u201d It\u2019s the truest thing John Cena has ever said!!!! Yeah, that was like 50 minutes into the show. Inevitably, Bryan will spill water on John Cena\u2019s loud and unfashionable costume of a person trying to manifest richness suit\u2026 too bad it wasn\u2019t something that would stain \u2013 like beet juice. Yes, someone should take that suit out behind a woodshed and shoot it like a rabid dog.\n\nOh no, Bryan spilled water \u2013 so, back to these rules. This is the clip from YouTube \u2013 so, supposedly there are no rules. I may not be happy for Bryan\u2019s hipster propensities, but I feel a small victory in that he showed up at \u201cformal dinner\u201d wearing a t-shirt under a suit jacket. Long live the proletariat! John has an awkward conversation with Brie and Bryan about going back to wrestling. John still hasn\u2019t figured out to talk to people instead of talking down to them. Somehow, we\u2019re back to talking about Nikki not having kids. In a cut-out, Nikki admits that she\u2019s lonely. They toast to \u201cthe moms.\u201d John Cena smiles. Nikki looks sad. They show random clips of the footage coming up on the rest of the season: Bryan\u2019s come back, the dissolution of Cena and Nikki, and the Women\u2019s Royal Rumble.\n\nNOW CATCH UP ON SARAH K\u2019S REPORTS FROM LAST SEASON HERE.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2019/01/PWTorchDailyCast2019_MMATalk.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c3ced3d59dc5a784592d6d34618f1913?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://i2.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2020/01/ROH_Logo_2020_3x2_600.png?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2017/12/WadeKellerHotline2017.jpg?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2016/10/TotalBellas_3x2_600.png?resize=600%2C381&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2019/08/SmackdownFox_WWELogo2019_600.png?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PWTorchLogo2016-text580tight.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f6c6ab59a75b01d0c90e3e3d0f50a527?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2017/12/WadeKellerHotline2017.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/03/WWE-logo-3x2_600.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MainEvent_3x2.jpg?resize=326%2C245&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2020/03/TorchCover597_3x2_600.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2020/03/BruceMitchellVIPMailbagPodcast2020.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2019/01/WKPWP_Blue_Spreaker.png?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c496dd1e57a7221d62f20a33aabe0547?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-includes/images/rss.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2018/06/OnTheCanvas.jpg?resize=80%2C60&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2016/10/TotalBellas_3x2_600.png?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ebf0f3783deb1e63029861d1845a13ba?s=24&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.pwtorch.com/site/wp-content/uploads/post/2016/10/TotalBellas_3x2_600.png?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryan Metro", "Kevin", "Bob Rimpnerton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.pwtorch.com/site/2018/05/20/5-20-total-bellas-review-sarah-k-s-full-rundown-and-analysis-of-all-the-drama-with-nikki-cena-brie-bryan-including-lingerie-shoot-big-words-babies/", "title": "5/20 TOTAL BELLAS REVIEW: Sarah K.\u2019s full rundown and analysis of all the drama with Nikki & Cena, Brie & Bryan including lingerie shoot, big words, babies -", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5/20 TOTAL BELLAS REVIEW: Sarah K.\u2019s full rundown and analysis of all the drama with Nikki & Cena, Brie & Bryan including lingerie shoot, big words, babies -", "description": "TOTAL BELLAS (episode one) MAY 20, 2018 AIRED ON E!
