It\u2019s off-season for her work as a sideline reporter for Fox\u2019s NFL coverage, and she\u2019s between days filming Dancing with the Stars, which she has been cohosting since 2014. Erin, 39, is determined to keep working double duty in sports and entertainment, just like Strahan, the NFL star turned sports analyst turned television host, who, she says, \"paved the way\" for her. On one hand, sports is Erin\u2019s greatest passion. \"I\u2019m a super-big tomboy,\" says the Florida native, dressed down in jeans, a summery plaid shirt, and white slip-on sneakers. But as a woman reporting on the field, she says, she\u2019s conscious of the extra scrutiny she faces: \"Is she being too silly? Is she being too sexy? Does she really know the game?\" Dancing with the Stars allows her to let loose a bit. \"The balance for me,\" she says, \"is really important.\"\n\nIn fact, considering the public and private battles she\u2019s had to overcome in the past few years, Erin\u2019s life balance is more important than ever, too. After winning a terrifying stalking case in early 2016, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, which she treated through surgeries this past fall. So now, as she finishes planning her wedding to NHL broadcaster and former player Jarret Stoll, she welcomes good stuff on the horizon: the wedding this summer and a brand-new puppy to get their future family started right.\n\nI heard Jarret has been doing a lot of the wedding planning, but what\u2019s been your favorite part of your big-day prep?\n\nHe loves to plan a party\u2014I mean, the guy even helped me with the freakin\u2019 calligraphy the other day. What a gem. The dress part of the wedding I appreciate because we\u2019re really going for it.\n\nIs there anything new on your healthy-eating list these days?\n\nI\u2019ve really been obsessed with bone broth. I was in New York a couple of months ago, and this gentleman who was doing my hair had this gorgeous skin, and he\u2019s like, \"I gotta tell you, I\u2019m really obsessed with bone broth,\" and I\u2019m like, \"Shut up.\" I just drank some before I came here, with turmeric, ginger, and carrots in it\u2014it\u2019s like a beverage you\u2019re drinking with your meal.\n\nYou\u2019ve talked about loving Orangetheory workouts. What do you do if you can\u2019t get to the studio?\n\nI try to emulate the program with intervals on a treadmill. I\u2019m a walker, not a runner, so I just do, like, 4.0 incline and 4.0 speed, and I\u2019m on it for a minute. Then, for the next 30 minutes, I do 6.0 incline, 4.3 speed. Then for a minute, I go 8, and you go back and forth with your intervals. And then I try to do weights so I feel like I\u2019m getting a full-body workout.\n\nRELATED: 5 Things to Know About Your First Orangetheory Class\n\nImage zoom\n\nErin's wearing (red one-piece above): Norma Kamali Gold Stud Super Low Back Mio ($605; normakamali.com). Green one-piece in top photo: Adriana Degreas Bonsai Green Gingko Swimsuit ($395; avenue32.com).\n\nWhat is your relationship with your body today, compared with when you were younger?\n\nI feel better. It\u2019s crazy\u2014back in the day, I would crush Chicken McNuggets and french fries, and that would be my meal. But I handled weight a little differently then: I didn\u2019t have the muscle tone. Now I\u2019m addicted to working out; it just makes me feel better. And my man can always tell when I\u2019ve done a workout, because I\u2019m like, \"Good mooorning!\" I try to say to people who hate working out, \"It sucks going. I\u2019m always in a crappy mood when I go. But when I walk out, I\u2019m like C\u00e9line Dion: My heart will go on!\"\n\nDoes Dancing with the Stars affect how you stay fit at all?\n\nNot really. I work with former professional athletes, and they\u2019re really good at working out. Though when I first started sideline reporting, I gained the freshman 15\u2014because guys like to eat. When we\u2019re a table of 15, I\u2019m the only female, and they\u2019re ordering sliced sirloin for an appetizer, I\u2019m like, \"Heck yeah, I\u2019m having some of this.\" But then I\u2019m like, \"Why are my pants not fitting?!\" I just love eating, and I like having a cocktail, and I like having a scoop of ice cream. I know it\u2019s all about portion control, so if I\u2019m going to eat, I\u2019m going to work out.\n\nWhat\u2019s always in your daily health routine?\n\nSunscreen. I grew up in Florida, and I absolutely fried my skin\u2014I was the chick who was lying out on the driveway. Now I know I\u2019m pale, but I don\u2019t wanna look like I\u2019m 75 years old next year! So I always make sure that I\u2019m putting on SPF 45 every day. And by the way, melanoma is a big deal in my family\u2014my grandfather died from it.\n\nRELATED: Erin Andrews Opens Up About Finding Her Calm After a Tough Year\n\nAnd cancer prevention has been a priority for you since your cervical cancer diagnosis. Did you make any lifestyle changes as a result?\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s made me hypersensitive to other things to get checked for. And I remember one of the oncologists said to me when I was going back to work, \"It\u2019s really important for you to get some sleep and not stress out.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \"Uhh...I\u2019m in Green Bay on Sunday and on the ballroom floor Monday\u2014stress and not sleeping is kind of the way of life.\" But I\u2019m really trying to be better about taking deep breaths. I\u2019m trying meditation.\n\nYou were diagnosed not long after you wrapped up your trial. What is up with life\u2019s timing?\n\nMy dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009, when [the stalker videos] first came out\u2014and then I got diagnosed right after my trial, so there\u2019s a little part of me that does agree that stress does a lot to your body. I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t in my body before, but that does kind of weigh on me. There\u2019s no research saying stress brings this on, but come on, you\u2019ve heard enough about how much your body reacts. [And there I was] trying to act like nothing was wrong with me at work.\n\nImage zoom\n\nErin's wearing: Evarae Seona Metal Detail Plunge One Piece in White/Gold ($299; evarae.com).\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone at work? What was your thinking behind keeping your diagnosis a secret?\n\nWorking with a bunch of men, I didn\u2019t wanna be like, \"Sooo, they think I have cervical cancer,\" and they\u2019d be like, \"Where\u2019s your cervix?\" But I\u2019d also come off this huge trial that was kind of the focus of the summer, and I don\u2019t want to be the girl that always has the problems at the table\u2014\"And now I have cancer!\" I also think that I didn\u2019t want to believe it was that big a deal, so we kept it quiet. But the wait was horrible.\n\nHow did you get through it?\n\nI did my first surgery on a Tuesday because I had Dancing on Monday, and I was doing a sit-down interview on Friday in Green Bay, so I had to take a red-eye on Thursday. And literally an hour before I needed to be in the car, we got the call from my doctor that the margins were not clear and she was recommending a hysterectomy. I was having a meltdown on my couch. I\u2019m screaming and crying, my parents were on the phone, my boyfriend was arguing with the doctor\u2014and I wasn\u2019t even engaged yet, we weren\u2019t even talking about having kids yet! So we decided we\u2019re going to an oncologist, see what they said, then make a decision who I was gonna go with. Then we made the decision to do another surgery\u2014and then if that surgery didn\u2019t work, we were probably dealing with, \"What\u2019s the next step? Is it gonna be radiation? Am I gonna get a hysterectomy?\" It was awful. I got the news, I did the surgery, they had to cut more of my cervix out, and then I went to New York that weekend, and I did the game. At Dancing with the Stars that Monday, I was in my dressing room when the phone rang and [the doctor] said, \"You\u2019re good. We got it.\" I was like, \u201cOh my God,\u201d crying\u2014while trying on a ballroom dress. The waiting was so hard.\n\nWhat helped you get through that tough time?\n\nJust talking to my friends. It teaches you a lot about who is willing to do anything and show up. We had a really crazy moment when we were going in for the second surgery. Our friend went into labor the night before my surgery, and she ended up being three floors down. After I was done, my boyfriend and I lay in her [hospital] room, and we were all laughing because my girlfriend just had a baby, so she was in a diaper; I had just had surgery, so I was in a diaper, and her baby was in a diaper. We were like, \"Babe, you\u2019re the only one not in a diaper!\"\n\nImage zoom\n\nErin's wearing: Leah Shlaer The Colette Studded One-Piece ($255; leahshlaer.com).\n\nDid anything else beneficial come from that experience?\n\nIf anything, it was a huge step for my relationship with my boyfriend at the time. Because you don\u2019t know if a guy is going to want to sit in with an oncologist and see, \"OK, so this is your cervix, and this is your uterus, and we are cutting out this part\u2026\" We hadn\u2019t even been discussing marriage. We hadn\u2019t discussed babies! It really puts things on the fast track for you\u2014because you have an oncologist saying to you, \"We highly recommend that you guys do your embryos right now, freeze them.\" I\u2019m like, \"Hi, hon. I love you. I hope we\u2019re spending our lives together.\" And he was amazing.\n\nSo what did you do? Did you end up freezing your embryos?\n\nI had actually frozen my eggs before all this a couple of years back, just because it was all the rage. But it definitely took a serious turn for us. I\u2019m not young, we don\u2019t know when we\u2019re gonna have a baby, we don\u2019t know if this is going to come back. One thing I love my future husband for is that our oncologist said the smart thing to do would be to have some insurance waiting\u2014so we have frozen embryos because we\u2019ve taken the steps. If we need \u2019em, we need \u2019em; and if we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t. We just wanna be smart. But it\u2019s crazy, because these waiting rooms are packed!\n\nSo true! I\u2019ve done IVF, too, and I found the minute you start talking about it, other women come out of the woodwork.\n\nWe have so many friends who have done it. And instead of being embarrassed about it, look at how incredible it is that we had an oncologist say to us, \"There is an option,\u201d in case it comes back. And I\u2019m really lucky, because I\u2019ve had all his support through it. We don\u2019t know what the future entails. We actually had to push this photo shoot because I was in the middle of [the IVF cycle]. I\u2019m doing all these [IVF] shots and in these bathing suits, and I was like, \"Yay, look at my pin marks!\" [Pulls up her shirtsleeves to show the needle pricks and bruises on her arms]\n\nThat first shot, especially, is so horrible. Did you get used to it?\n\nI\u2019d like to say I get used to it, but I\u2019m in the bathroom, playing Walt Disney World Pandora to have something light on, and I stuck myself really hard one time and I nailed a blood vessel, and I started screaming! My man was in the other room watching Seinfeld, and I said, \"Dammit.\" He\u2019s like, \"I love you!\" And I was like, \"Yeah, you better!\" We went from football to everything that happened to freezing embryos\u2014mixing hormones and wedding planning.\n\nImage zoom James White\n\nErin's wearing: Solid & Striped The Tilda Top and Bottom ($88 each; solidandstriped.com).\n\nWhat do you and Jarret bond over most? Is it sports?\n\nNot really. As much as I am a sports fanatic, we are both very silly. He is a lot more patient and chilled out than I am. We both love the beach, and we\u2019re getting a new dog\u2014it\u2019s our first child, so we\u2019re very excited. He\u2019s a golden retriever; we\u2019re naming him Howard.\n\nYou\u2019ve said it\u2019s possible to mix a demanding career and kids. What does that mean to you?\n\nFor me, it\u2019s having the career, having the family, and having the happiness. I grew up in the South. People were getting married at 21; I had my first major job at 21, and I was missing everybody\u2019s weddings because I was doing football games and baseball games. I had never been to Europe until two years ago\u2014I\u2019ve gone to all the sports cities, but I\u2019d never had a life for myself. I want to continue doing more, but it\u2019s going to be shaped toward how I want to have this family and how I do want to have kids. I think it\u2019s possible that I\u2019ll be able to have a kid and be able to do this for a living. We\u2019re just gonna have to figure out how.", "images":
