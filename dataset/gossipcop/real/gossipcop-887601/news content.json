The bulk of Ryder\u2019s wealth can be attributed to her acting. Her most recent role as the mother in the popular Netflix series \u201cStranger Things\u201d is sure to fatten her bank account.\n\nRyder had a fairly unconventional upbringing. Timothy Leary and Allen Ginsberg were family friends, and her family raised her to be distrustful of the government and the press. After being bullied in school, she was home-schooled and later took acting classes at the American Conservatory Theater.\n\nShe scored her first role in the movie \u201cLucas,\u201d but it was her role as Lydia Deetz in Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d that gained her major recognition. Ryder has also had roles in the movies \u201cMermaids\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands.\u201d\n\nRyder took some years off from acting following her arrest for shoplifting in 2001, but she resumed her career in 2010 when she appeared as an aging ballerina in \u201cBlack Swan.\u201d\n\nYou can use Bankrate\u2019s net worth calculator to see how you compare with Winona Ryder\u2019s wealth.\n\nWhat she\u2019s up to now\n\nRyder\u2019s acting schedule is busy.
