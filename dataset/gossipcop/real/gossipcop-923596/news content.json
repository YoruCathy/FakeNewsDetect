Kelly\u2019s ex-girlfriend accuses the R&B singer and alleged sexual predator of \u201ctraining\u201d a 14-year-old girl to be a sex slave, the Guardian reports.\n\nThis is the latest of many accusations against R. Kelly, whose alleged sex crimes first came under major public scrutiny months before the current #MeToo movement. The second half of 2017 saw a number of explosive investigations into his alleged abuse \u2014 one about a \u201ccult\u201d he runs that preys on young women, one about the singer\u2019s inner circle, and another about the alleged physical and emotional abuse that former girlfriend Kitti Jones suffered while she was with the R&B singer. During this time, there was an additional woman who accused R. Kelly of grooming her to be a sex slave when she was 16.\n\nJones is the woman behind the most recent allegation. The Guardian reports that in the documentary, Jones says that the R&B singer introduced her to an unnamed young \u201csex slave\u201d sometime between 2011 and 2013.\n\n\u201cI was introduced to one of the girls, that he told me he \u2018trained\u2019 since she was 14, those were his words,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw that she was dressed like me, that she was saying the things I\u2019d say and her mannerisms were like mine. That\u2019s when it clicked in my head that he had been grooming me to become one of his pets. He calls them his pets.\u201d\n\nJones also said that Kelly forced the young girl, whom he referred to as his \u201cfucking pet,\u201d to crawl around the floor and perform oral sex on him.\n\nWhile Kelly did not comment to either the BBC or the Guardian, the R&B singer has vehemently denied all allegations against him in the past. The BBC Three documentary is scheduled to air tomorrow, March 28.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/27/27-r-kelly.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/27/27-r-kelly.w330.h330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/03/27/27-r-kelly.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Arnold"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/r-kellys-ex-says-he-trained-a-girl-to-be-his-sex-slave.html", "title": "R.
