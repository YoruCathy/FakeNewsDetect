Jill Zarin has discovered a less extreme way to get a face lift. She swears by her liquid face lift procedures and a little botox, now and then, mostly for the neck, forehead and between the eyes area. This liquid facelift is done with injections of Restylane, injected into the jaw and sides of her face.

It definitely seems to be working for Jill.\n\nJill Zarin is also an actress and has appeared in several television sitcoms, such as, The Bonnie Hunt Show, White Collar, and the Spin Crowd.
