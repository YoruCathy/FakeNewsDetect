She's just appeared in a \u200bpodcast interview with Marc Maron and has left nothing to imagination.\n\nJennifer Lawrence gave a surprise review of an Oscar contender on Marc Maron's WTF podcast, and did not hold back: https://t.co/h1SZmZTTI7 \u2014 Vogue Magazine (@voguemagazine) February 26, 2018\n\nWhen asked about her past romances in particular, the 27-year-old was comfortable enough to give us all the deets... Well, almost all!\n\n\n\n\n\nShe began recalling her first meeting with ex-boyfriend Darren Aronofsky for his film, Mother!.\n\n\u201cHe flew in, pitched me, left,\u201d Lawrence said, adding, \u201cThe whole thing was probably an hour and a half, and then I was like, \u2018He\u2019s hot.'\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember I was holding my dog and I shut the door and when the door shut I went, \u2018Pippy, that\u2019s called sexual tension.\u2019 He played hard to get for like nine months, maybe longer, which just killed me,\" she continued.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter confessing she was in love with him for two years, Maron then asked how the love just went away. Lawrence admitted it doesn't, revealing, \u201cI still love him very much.\"\n\nThe conversation quickly turned to other ex-flames, or ones that were just rumored. The biggest and most controversial rumored romance she faced was with former co-star Chris Pratt. Many believed she was having an \u200baffair with him when they did the movie Passengers back in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI never had an affair with Chris Pratt on Passengers. That\u2019s a good one\u201d she said, when asked about the crazy gossip she's heard about herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, they got a divorce like two years later and everybody was like, [shouting] \u2018Jennifer Lawrence!\u2019 And I was like, \u2018What the \u2026 what, I\u2019m in Montreal two years later,'\" she concluded.\n\nThank you for clearing it all up, JLaw!", "images":
