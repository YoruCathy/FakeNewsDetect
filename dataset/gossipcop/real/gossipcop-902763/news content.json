According to People, the event took place at the Cyrus\u2019s Franklin, Tennessee, home, which was transformed for the big day. Proud mom Tish Cyrus took to Instagram to share some family photos from her daughter's wedding. She posted one photo alongside her husband Billy Ray Cyrus and their daughter Miley standing at what appears to be the altar\u2014AKA the fireplace\u2014covered in an archway of roses and baby\u2019s breath. \u201cThis makes my heart so happy,\u201d she captioned it, alongside a fluttering heart emoji. Tish also posted a solo shot of just Miley and her dad, showing off Miley's stunning wild flower bouquet.\n\nBetween the mother-of-the-bride's photos and the bride's own posting, fans can almost get a 360-degree look at Miley's gorgeous Vivienne Westwood gown. According to USA Today, the \u201cNothing Breaks Like A Heart\u201d singer wore the The Long Cocotte Dress from the designer's made to order line. The off-the-shoulder frock was finished in a ivory silk satin and reportedly costs $8,600.\n\nDespite the price tag on Miley's dress, the evening looked pretty relaxed. People points out Tish even changed into jeans after the ceremony. (E! News reports the entire wedding likely cost the couple around $17,500.)\n\nThe groom opted for a more casual look as well, pairing his black tux with white sneakers, which is apparently just what Miley likes. Under a photo of Miley and Hemsworth kissing, a commenter wrote, \u201cCongratulations you married the hottest man on Hollywood,\u201d and the singer responded saying \u201cI knooooowwwww right,\u201d further confirming the two did indeed tie the knot.\n\nIf that comment wasn't enough, another post from the bride reveals Hemsworth's new accessory\u2014his wedding band!\n\nAccording to more posts from family and friends, everyone close to the couple was in attendance.

In addition to the flower arch, the home was decorated with a beautiful archway of pastel colored balloons. And with the holidays right around the corner, there was also a festive Christmas tree on display.\n\nVroom Vroom Balloon reposted McBride's photo announcing that they created the beautiful installation. \"Love this gorgeous photo of @stylesofstella and @braisonccyrus under the massive pastel balloon installation we created for @mileycyrus & @liamhemsworth this past weekend,\" the company wrote in the caption. \"All balloons used were custom colors and 100% organic, plus the addition of floral, which made for one of our most magical installations yet.\"\n\nAccording to People, the decorations also included rose gold \"Mr. & Mrs.\" balloons and a decorated entry table, which was seen in a now- deleted Instagram post by the company. It was reportedly covered with candles, a sign-in book, an oversized balloon with their wedding date and two photos of Cyrus and Hemsworth. Another now-deleted photo showed off the reception area where two long tables were surrounded by string lights. Floral centerpieces decorated the tables and warm blankets were set on the chairs for each of their guests.\n\n\u201cShe wanted something very pastel and sweet,\u201d Vroom Vroom Balloon owner Sunny Becks told People. \u201cShe was doing something different than her typical, really bright-colored way of doing things. She had a really specific vision of something very charming. They were amazing to work with.\u201d\n\nThe rest of their wedding night was reportedly full of fun entertainment. Hemsworth did a \"shotski\" with his brothers, according to a clip by the couple's friend Conrad Carr, and the bride made a dance floor for herself in front of the Christmas tree.
