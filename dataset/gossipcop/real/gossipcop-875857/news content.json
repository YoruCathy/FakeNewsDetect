The timing, certainly, is interesting, since Perry only just released the video for her own alleged Swift diss track \"Swish Swish\".\n\nLess than an hour after \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dropped, Nicki Minaj tweeted the simple message: \"N**** sit down.

It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair did seem to make amends, performing together at the VMAs; that said, Minaj did just feature on Perry's \"Swish Swish\".\n\nSwift wiped clean her social media pages last week, before building up hype for her new album Reputation through a series of video snippets of snakes.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-look-what-you-made-me-do-be-humble-reputation-album-release-date-single-a7912216.html", "title": "Look What You Made Me Do: Nicki Minaj tweets 'be humble' after Taylor Swift drops new single", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-look-what-you-made-me-do-be-humble-reputation-album-release-date-single-a7912216.html", "title": "Nicki Minaj tweeted a subtle message to Taylor Swift about her new single", "description": "Swift's latest release has been the centre of intense discussion as to who the song might be directed toward", "updated_time": "2017-08-25T12:13:57+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/7912216"}, "description": "Taylor Swift's new single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" has caused some pretty divisive reactions amongst music fans.\u00a0 Though that's less, perhaps, to do with its actual musical content - which uses an interpolation from Right Said Fred's 1991 hit \"I'm Too Sexy\" - and more to do with who the song may supposedly be about.", "keywords": "Taylor Swift, News, Music, Culture", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "Taylor Swift", "published_time": "2017-08-25T09:51:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-25T12:13:57+01:00", "section": "News", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 391, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 6, "external_link_count": 1}, "twitter": {"title": "Nicki Minaj tweeted a subtle message to Taylor Swift about her new s\u2026", "description": "Taylor Swift's new single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" has caused some pretty divisive reactions amongst music fans.\u00a0 Though that's less, perhaps, to do with its actual musical content - which uses an", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503651060.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
