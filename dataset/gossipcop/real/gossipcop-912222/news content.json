Sarah Silverman received a hilarious gift from Kate Beckinsale after revealing that she had ended her relationship with Michael Sheen.\n\nBeckinsale, who dated the Passengers actor in the \u201890s, gave Silverman blue and white M&Ms with a photo of Silverman kissing Sheen on the cheek to help her through the breakup. \u201cBeen ending every night with a microwaved bowl of personalized m&ms given to me by the very thoughtful and very cruel @katebeckinsale to remind me that I\u2019m alone in this world. So very alone,\u201d Silverman wrote along with an Instagram photo of the sweet treats on Wednesday, February 7.\n\nThe comedienne added: \u201cTHANKS, KATE. Seriously they are so good esp. melted which is why the microwave.\u201d\n\nBeckinsale, 44, shares 19-year-old daughter Lily Mo Sheen with the actor, but the exes remain close friends. She\u2019s also established a friendship with Silverman, 47, through the years.\n\nAs previously reported, Silverman announced on Monday, February 5, that she and Sheen, 49, split after nearly four years of dating. \u201cThe great @michaelsheen & I consciously uncoupled over Christmas. I mean, not \u2018over Christmas\u2019 \u2014 like that wasn\u2019t the fight that ended it,\u201d Silverman tweeted. \u201cNo fight. We just live in different countries & it got hard. Felt we should just tell y\u2019all so u stop askin, \u2018How\u2019s Michael/How\u2019s Sarah?\u2019\u201d\n\nHours later, she joked about accidentally revealing their breakup on his birthday. \u201cThe joke here is I just realized I posted our breakup tweet on his actual birthday and I can\u2019t believe what a dick I am,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cCan u believe it?? He said I wasn\u2019t THOUGHTFUL,\u201d she continued. \u201cJerk\u2026 Anyway, Happy Birthday, Michael\u2026\u201d\n\nUs Weekly first confirmed in February 2014 that they were a couple. Prior to her relationship with Sheen, Silverman dated Jimmy Kimmel for five years. Sheen, meanwhile, dated Beckinsale from 1995 to 2003 and actress Rachel McAdams from 2010 to 2013.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/527875594_michael-sheen-kate-beckinsale-sarah-silverman-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/527875594_michael-sheen-kate-beckinsale-sarah-silverman-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/527875594_michael-sheen-kate-beckinsale-sarah-silverman-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-beckinsale-teases-sarah-silverman-about-michael-sheen-split/", "title": "Kate Beckinsale Teases Sarah Silverman About Michael Sheen Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kate Beckinsale sent Sarah Silverman a hilarious gift after the comedian announced her split from Michael Sheen \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Beckinsale Teases Sarah Silverman About Michael Sheen Split", "description": "Kate Beckinsale sent Sarah Silverman a hilarious gift after the comedian announced her split from Michael Sheen \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kate-beckinsale-teases-sarah-silverman-about-michael-sheen-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T20:57:35+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/527875594_michael-sheen-kate-beckinsale-sarah-silverman-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/527875594_michael-sheen-kate-beckinsale-sarah-silverman-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-07T17:19:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T20:57:35+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kate Beckinsale sent Sarah Silverman a hilarious gift after the comedian announced her split from Michael Sheen \u2014 details", "title": "Kate Beckinsale Teases Sarah Silverman About Michael Sheen Split", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/527875594_michael-sheen-kate-beckinsale-sarah-silverman-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518023981.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
