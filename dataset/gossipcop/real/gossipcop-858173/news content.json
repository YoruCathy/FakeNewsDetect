In terms of sheer size, however, the longest word to be found in Britain is the Welsh place name Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. For obvious reasons, it's usually abbreviated to Llanfair PG.\n\nThe 20-volume historical Oxford English Dictionary includes other very long words, most of which are highly technical. These include:\n\notorhinolaryngological - 22 letters\n\nimmunoelectrophoretically - 25 letters\n\npsychophysicotherapeutics - 25 letters\n\nthyroparathyroidectomized - 25 letters\n\npneumoencephalographically - 26 letters\n\nradioimmunoelectrophoresis - 26 letters\n\npsychoneuroendocrinological - 27 letters\n\n- hepaticocholangiogastrostomy - 28 letters\n\n- spectrophotofluorometrically - 28 letters\n\n- pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism - 30 letters\n\nPeople sometimes ask whether a DNA string can be considered as the longest English word, given that they can run to many thousands of letters. The answer is no: they're regarded as chemical names rather than genuine words in the sense of meaningful items of vocabulary. The same is true of the formal names of chemical compounds. These can be almost unlimited in length (for example, aminoheptafluorocyclotetraphosphonitrile, (40 letters) and many contain numerals, Roman and Greek letters, and other symbols, as well as ordinary letters. We don't tend to regard these terms as proper 'words'.\n\nSee other Vocabulary Questions.Take a look at: What Is The Longest One-syllable English Word?\n\nOr you may be interested in: What Is The Longest English Word Containing No Letter More Than Once?", "images": ["https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/assets/oup/logos/svg/lexico-logo-0c6251cf3d967d224d89038c50ebbb008c1dc05830dc25a674fb7dcdbe0ea7d5.svg", "data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=", "https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/assets/oup/svg/hamburger-menu-594799c23e03196ed910c5798976a15b1779b55f9c9824608c69cf0ff6191ee8.svg", "https://track.lexico.com/main.gif?ab=0&cb=96819655&dc=Desktop&ev=p&pn=lexico&rf=&st=lexico", "https://www.lexico.com/lexico-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://www.lexico.com/lexico-logo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.lexico.com/explore/what-is-the-longest-english-word", "title": "What Is The Longest English Word?", "meta_data": {"description": "It's a question that creeps up on us all at some stage.
