Now, new court documents reportedly reveal what the star\u2019s late mother left her after her passing.\n\nCarrie Fisher, Lourd\u2019s mother, died in December 2016. It was previously reported that the late \u201cStar Wars\u201d actress left her daughter a slew of owned assets including bank accounts, a 2016 Tesla S, ownership of several LLCs and a life insurance policy. This doesn\u2019t even cover Fisher\u2019s various jewelry items, artwork and collectables.\n\nNow, according to new documents obtained by People, fans have a slightly better idea of how much the \u201cScream Queens\u201d star will inherit from her mother\u2019s estate. The outlet alleges that Lourd will receive at least $7 million in various inheritence from her late mom. Additionally, the 25-year-old actress is going to inherit the rights to her mother\u2019s very popular public image and likeness. This means all proceeds from Fisher\u2019s books and other trademarks and copyrights now go right to Lourd.\n\nRecently, \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d actor John Boyega opened up about the upcoming film and how it became an unexpected homage to the late actress. Fisher was reportedly going to have a big role in \u201cStar Wars\u201d parts eight and nine, but those plans had to be changed when she died in 2016.\n\n\u201cI just feel like [\u2018The Last Jedi\u2019] pays homage to them in general,\u201d he said of Fisher and co-star Mark Hamil\u2019s characters to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cBut unfortunately, now that she\u2019s passed, it does have a deeper meaning.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ronnie-wood-mick-jagger-keith-richards-rolling-stones.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/lourdfisher.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20110019543582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/lourdfisher.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/lourdfisher.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/billie-lourd-to-inherit-hefty-sum-from-carrie-fishers-estate", "title": "Billie Lourd to inherit hefty sum from Carrie Fisher's estate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Billie Lourd has been working hard to get used to life without her grandmother and mother around.
