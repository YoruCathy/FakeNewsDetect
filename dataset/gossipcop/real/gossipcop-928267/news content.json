Abrams is bringing someone brand new into the fold: filmmaker Victoria Mahoney.

Mahoney is herself already an established filmmaker who has spent the past few years working inside the television space, including stints on DuVernay\u2019s \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d plus \u201cGypsy,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d and more. She just completed directing a pilot for CBS entitled \u201cRed Line,\u201d which was executive produced by DuVernay and fellow heavy-hitter Greg Berlanti.

Last year, Kennedy drew ire after a Variety interview during which she told the trade that although finding a female director for one of their features was a priority, the studio \u201cwant[s] to make sure that when we bring a female director in to do \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 they\u2019re set up for success\u2026They\u2019re gigantic films, and you can\u2019t come into them with essentially no experience.\u201d\n\nShe also added that, because of the perceived lack of female filmmakers with blockbuster experience believed to be essential to making a \u201cStar Wars\u201d film, they were actively looking for appropriate talent. Kennedy said at the time, \u201cWe want to really start to focus in on people we would love to work with and see what kinds of things they\u2019re doing to progress up that ladder now, and then pull them in when the time is right.\u201d\n\n\u201cStar Wars: Episode IX\u201d is currently slated to open on December 20, 2019.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
