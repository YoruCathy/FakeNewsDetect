We offer you two words: Time's Up.\n\n\"We say time's up for pay inequality, time's up for discrimination, time's up for harassment, of any kind. And time's up for the abuse of power.\"\n\nLeonard Cohen and the late Carrie Fisher were awarded posthumously, with Fisher's memoir The Princess Diarist named the best spoken word album.\n\nImage: Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna attended the ceremony together\n\n:: Main winners\n\nAlbum of the year: Bruno Mars, 24K Magic\n\nRecord of the year: Bruno Mars, 24K Magic\n\nSong of the year: Bruno Mars, That's What I Like\n\nBest new artist: Alessia Cara\n\nBest pop album: Ed Sheeran, Divide\n\nBest rock album: The War On Drugs, A Deeper Understanding\n\nBest R&B album: Bruno Mars, 24K Magic\n\nBest rap album: Kendrick Lamar Damn", "images": ["https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/1600x900/skynews-bruno-mars-grammys_4217231.jpg?20180129071405", "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/768x432/skynews-elton-john-grammys_4217271.jpg?20180129084602", "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/768x432/skynews-kesha-grammys_4217274.jpg?20180129084847", "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/768x432/skynews-bruno-mars-grammys_4217231.jpg?20180129071405", "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/768x432/skynews-rihanna-kendrick-lamar_4217233.jpg?20180129072138", "https://news.sky.com/resources/sky-news-logo.png?v=1?bypass-service-worker", "https://news.sky.com/resources/sky-spectrum-logo.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035677&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/768x432/skynews-jay-z-beyonce_4217232.jpg?20180129072003"], "top_img": "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/1600x900/skynews-bruno-mars-grammys_4217231.jpg?20180129071405", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://news.sky.com/story/grammy-awards-2018-jay-z-misses-out-as-bruno-mars-wins-big-11227336", "title": "Grammy Awards 2018: Jay-Z misses out as Bruno Mars wins big", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=316391924", "description": "Jay-Z was expecting to shine at the Grammys, but the rap star left empty handed despite receiving eight nominations.", "robots": "NOODP,INDEX,FOLLOW", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@skynews", "title": "Grammy Awards 2018: Jay-Z misses out as Bruno Mars wins big", "description": "Jay-Z was expecting to shine at the Grammys, but the rap star left empty handed despite receiving eight nominations.", "image": {"identifier": "https://e3.365dm.com/18/01/768x432/skynews-bruno-mars-grammys_4217231.jpg?20180129071405", "alt": "NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 28: Recording artist Bruno Mars, winner of the Record of the Year award for &#39;24K Magic,&#39; Album Of The Year award for &#39;24K Magic,&#39; Song of the Year award for &#39;That&#39;s What I Like,&#39; Best R&B Performance award for &#39;That&#39;s What I Like,&#39; and Best R&B Album album for &#39;24K Magic,&#39; poses in the press room during the 60th Annual GRAMMY Awards at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 2018 in New York City.
