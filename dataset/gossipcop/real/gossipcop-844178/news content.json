(Oliver is currently separated from April and the calf for their safety.) \u201cDad & Baby meet!\u201d the tweet read.\n\nThe zoo owner, Jordan Patch, told Good Morning America on Monday, April 17, that it\u2019s rare for male giraffes to help with their newborns\u2019 upbringing. \u201cOliver \u2014 usually males have no part in raising of the young \u2014 [but] he\u2019s actually been quite inquisitive and getting nose to nose with baby,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating some very cute moments.\u201d\n\nAs fans all over the world saw via livestream, April the giraffe gave birth to her fourth calf on Saturday, April 15, after 16 months of pregnancy.
