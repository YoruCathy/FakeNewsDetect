The actor's daughter, Heaven, looks cute in a sparkly dress, while her little brother, Kenzo, is adorably asleep in his parents' arms.\n\n\"Happy holidays!? the Harts\u2665\ufe0f xO.?,\" Hart captioned the pic.\n\nThe comedian shared another pic of himself with his sons on Friday, writing, \"#Generations #Harts #MyGuys #DopePic #HappyHolidays #livelovelaugh.\"\n\nHart's sweet photos come just one day after he admitted to cheating on his wife while she was pregnant with Kenzo.\n\n\"I'm guilty,\" he confessed on Power 105.1 FM's The Breakfast Club on Thursday. \"Regardless of how it happened and what was involved, the s**t that I can't talk about, I'm guilty. I'm wrong.\"\n\n\"It's beyond irresponsible,\" he continued. \"There\u2019s no way around it. The best way to do is just address it, right on. That's Kevin Hart in his dumbest moment. That's not the finest hour of my life. With that being said, you make your bed, you lay in it. You can't say, 'What were you thinking?' Because you weren't thinking.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKevin Hart Admits He's 'Guilty' of Cheating on Wife Eniko Parrish While She Was Pregnant\n\nKevin Hart and Eniko Parrish Make First Red Carpet Appearance Since Birth of Their Son\n\nKevin Hart Shares Adorable Snap of Baby Kenzo's First Photoshoot", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-12/kevin_hart_wift_890660708.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=DOxvkRd1", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/kevin_hart_wift_890660708.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=326ES3vR", "https://www.etonline.com/themes/custom/et/img/watch-now.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-04/screen_shot_2020-04-18_at_8.23.51_pm.png?h=15457932&itok=UZv8IvJp", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2020-03/300vk.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=a49clbwF"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/kevin_hart_wift_890660708.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=326ES3vR", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kevin-harts-family-christmas-card-looks-just-movie-poster-92819", "title": "Kevin Hart's Family Christmas Card Looks Just Like a Movie Poster", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "title": "Kevin Hart's Family Christmas Card Looks Just Like a Movie Poster | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kevin-harts-family-christmas-card-looks-just-movie-poster-92819", "title": "Kevin Hart's Family Christmas Card Looks Just Like a Movie Poster", "description": "The actor's matching outfits with his sons are too cute!", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/kevin_hart_wift_890660708.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=326ES3vR", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "robots": "index", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actor's matching outfits with his sons are too cute!", "title": "Kevin Hart's Family Christmas Card Looks Just Like a Movie Poster", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kevin-harts-family-christmas-card-looks-just-movie-poster-92819", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-12/kevin_hart_wift_890660708.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=326ES3vR"}, "description": "The actor's matching outfits with his sons are too cute!", "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "keywords": "News, Kevin Hart, Eniko Parrish", "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
