Our children\u2019s lives depend on it.\u201d\n\nRead: Tim Mullaney: After the Florida school shooting, let\u2019s listen to the students and ban assault weapons\n\nOprah Winfrey later matched the Clooneys\u2019 donation. \u201cGeorge and Amal, I couldn\u2019t agree with you more,\u201d she said in a tweet. \u201cThese inspiring young people remind me of the Freedom Riders of the 60s who also said we\u2019ve had ENOUGH and our voices will be heard.\u201d\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, also announced a $500,000 matching donation. \u201cKate and I applaud their efforts to take a stand for the benefit of this and future generations.

We will be marching for everyone we lost at the Newtown Sandy Hook shooting, at Columbine, at Virginia Tech, and San Bernardino, Orlando at the Pulse shooting and at Las Vegas. That is only the beginning. And March 24th, things are going to change.\u201d", "images": ["https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/google-play.png", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-IC758_parasi_ZU_20200320183347.jpg", "https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2017/02/09/Photos/ZQ/MW-FF590_cloone_20170209171451_ZQ.jpg?uuid=2d5a57f2-ef15-11e6-b4e1-001cc448aede", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/app-store.svg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-FF590_cloone_ZG_20170209171451.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-FF590_cloone_ZG_20170209171451.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Murphy"], "canonical_link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oprah-matches-clooneys-pledge-to-donate-500000-for-march-against-gun-violence-2018-02-20", "title": "Oprah matches Clooneys\u2019 pledge to donate $500,000 for march against gun violence", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Oprah matches Clooneys\u2019 pledge to donate $500,000 for march against gun violence", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oprah-matches-clooneys-pledge-to-donate-500000-for-march-against-gun-violence-2018-02-20", "description": "A number of Hollywood heavyweights, including George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, announced Tuesday hefty donations to help fund the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-FF590_cloone_ZG_20170209171451.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "page.site": "marketwatch", "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@marketwatch", "id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "A number of Hollywood heavyweights, including George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, announced Tuesday hefty donations to help fund the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d...", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-FF590_cloone_ZG_20170209171451.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "theme-color": "#2e2e2f", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "googlebot-news": "index", "article.doctype": 103, "cXenseParse": {"wsj-doctype": 103, "wsj-product": "MarketWatch.com"}, "article.id": "96084FA6-1698-11E8-B502-A2EEA165B9FE", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422,app-argument=mwatch://article?id=96084FA6-1698-11E8-B502-A2EEA165B9FE", "article.section": "Entertainment", "author": "Mike Murphy", "description": "A number of Hollywood heavyweights, including George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, announced Tuesday hefty donations to help fund the \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d...", "article.template": "Normal", "keywords": "article_normal,political,general news", "news_keywords": "article_normal,political,general news", "parsely-link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oprah-matches-clooneys-pledge-to-donate-500000-for-march-against-gun-violence-2018-02-20", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Oprah matches Clooneys\u2019 pledge to donate $500,000 for march against gun violence", "parsely-section": "Entertainment", "parsely-post-id": "96084FA6-1698-11E8-B502-A2EEA165B9FE", "parsely-tags": "PageType: Article, Template: Normal, ArticleId: 96084FA6-1698-11E8-B502-A2EEA165B9FE, DocType: 103, Subject: Political/General News, Subsection: Entertainment", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-02-20T20:33:00-05:00", "parsely-author": "Mike Murphy"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519056000.0, "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com", "summary": ""}
