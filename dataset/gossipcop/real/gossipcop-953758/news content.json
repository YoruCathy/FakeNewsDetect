Some people -- including some of her famous pals -- praised the star for her svelte physique, while others called her out and questioned why she felt the need to share the skin-baring snap.\n\n\"Same,\" Amy Schumer commented. \"This body is giving us life!!\" her best friend, Simon Huck, posted. \"That's hot,\" Paris Hilton said.\n\nOthers weren't as friendly.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" one user wrote. \"This lady really loves attention. This is not normal.\"\n\nSee the photo in the gallery below:\n\n\n\n140 PHOTOS Kim Kardashian's sexiest Instagrams of 2018 See Gallery Kim Kardashian's sexiest Instagrams of 2018 Fittings\ud83e\uddda\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Good Morning \u260e\ufe0f Bts from my @KKWbeauty Cherry Blossom shoot!

I\u2019m on Day 9 of my Shake It Baby program from @flattummyco and I\u2019m actually feeling so good. We had a massive Christmas this year and between my Mom's party, Christmas and New Years\u2026 I felt like it was impossible to fit in my regular work outs and eat healthy. But this program is giving me a kick in the right direction that I need. These meal replacement shakes are so good and it\u2019s helping me get my tummy back to flat in the new year. The results I\u2019m seeing and feeling are amazing and I\u2019m so excited for the next few weeks. Because they\u2019re all about getting women back on track\u2026 they\u2019ve got a 20% off sale going on right now if you want to start 2018 off right\u2026 trust me, you\u2019re going to want to check them out. \ud83d\udead @mertalas @macpiggott Yep, then I made myself a smoothie Dark hair for the new year?

What point really, showing off a body that is not made of anything but plastic,\" someone else sounded off. \"And for what for strangers to look at? Save it for your man instead. It's really sad and that's a call for desperate need of attention. You have three beautiful kids and a man that loves you. Be aware of your choices. You should be ashamed.\"\n\nSomeone else noted that it was \"time to unfollow Kim.\"\n\nOf course, Kardashian has made a career out of exhibiting polarizing behavior, especially on social media where she tends to share her most boundary-pushing content. Judging from her past habits, she likely won't react to the criticism that she received for the photo that she posted on Friday -- she can't be bothered!\n\nSee more photos of Kim Kardashian in 2018:\n\n\n\n68 PHOTOS Kim Kardashian out and about in 2018 See Gallery Kim Kardashian out and about in 2018 SANTA MONICA, CA - NOVEMBER 11: 2018 E!
