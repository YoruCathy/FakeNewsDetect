It was filmed six days before he took his own life on July 20.\n\nApple dedicated the episode to \"the memory of Chester,\" stating they received \"the blessing of Chester's family and his bandmates\" to share it.\n\nRelated: Celebrities react to Chester Bennington's death\n\nThroughout the episode, the band and actor/comedian Ken Jeong, sang along to angsty Linkin Park hits like In the End and Numb as the Dr. Ken star added embellishments in shriek form (\"I can't feel anything!\")\n\nThey also covered other artists material. Bennington was buoyant as he did his best Andre 3000 on Outkast's Hey Ya. The group also pulled over so Jeong could make his case for why he should be Linkin Park's official resident dancer \u2014 \"fly girl, if you will.\"\n\nBennington also taught Jeong how to \"scream-sing\" and, according to the scream-singing master himself, the Community star was a \"natural.\"\n\nBennington also talked about his kids.\n\n\"I just want my kinds to find something that they're passionate about,\" he said. \"I just want them to find whatever it is.\"\n\nLater in the episode, Jeong roped the group into a hilarious dance session on the sidewalk and a karaoke party in another vehicle.\n\nBennington seemed happy and full of life, always the first one to join in (and go full-out) on the goofy activities.\n\nThe episode was taped on July 14, 2017, 6 days before Bennington's death.\n\nWatch the full episode in the video above.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecab22bf9a194eb666a460297d7e1c7e22418c3f/c=0-39-1235-737/local/-/media/2017/08/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636390312692917344-AP-Music-Cornell-and-Bennington-Tribute.jpg?width=660&height=374&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecab22bf9a194eb666a460297d7e1c7e22418c3f/c=0-39-1235-737/local/-/media/2017/08/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636390312692917344-AP-Music-Cornell-and-Bennington-Tribute.jpg?width=1235&height=698&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecab22bf9a194eb666a460297d7e1c7e22418c3f/c=0-39-1235-737/local/-/media/2017/08/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636390312692917344-AP-Music-Cornell-and-Bennington-Tribute.jpg?width=1235&height=698&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/10/12/watch-chester-bennington-carpool-karaoke-episode-filmed-before-he-took-his-life/758558001/", "title": "Watch Chester Bennington in Linkin Park's 'Carpool Karaoke' episode", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Watch Chester Bennington in Linkin Park's 'Carpool Karaoke' episode", "description": "The episode was taped 6 days before Bennington's\u00a0suicide in July.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/10/12/watch-chester-bennington-carpool-karaoke-episode-filmed-before-he-took-his-life/758558001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecab22bf9a194eb666a460297d7e1c7e22418c3f/c=0-39-1235-737/local/-/media/2017/08/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636390312692917344-AP-Music-Cornell-and-Bennington-Tribute.jpg?width=1235&height=698&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1235, "height": 698}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sara M Moniuszko", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The episode was taped 6 days before Bennington's\u00a0suicide in July.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ecab22bf9a194eb666a460297d7e1c7e22418c3f/c=0-39-1235-737/local/-/media/2017/08/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636390312692917344-AP-Music-Cornell-and-Bennington-Tribute.jpg?width=1235&height=617&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Watch Chester Bennington in Linkin Park's 'Carpool Karaoke' episode", "description": "The episode was taped 6 days before Bennington's\u00a0suicide in July."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507737600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
