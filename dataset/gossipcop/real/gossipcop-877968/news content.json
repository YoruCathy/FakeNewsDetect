Just ask his older brother Alexander.\n\nThe younger Skarsg\u00e5rd made his big debut at at the Hollywood premiere of Andy Muschietti's It, in which he portrays the creepy sewer-dwelling Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and his older brothers Alexander, 41, and Gustaf, 36, were there to cheer him on. Just look how proud they are of their little bro.\n\nROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThey are presenting him to the Hollywood elite as if he's the heir to the Skarsg\u00e5rd throne. (Sorry, Valter. You're still my underrated fave.)\n\nJB Lacroix/ WireImage/ Getty Images\n\nBut Alexander, whom you probably know from True Blood or Tarzan or Big Little Lies, also took the opportunity to try and \"scare\" his baby brother on the red carpet. After all, as the oldest Skarsg\u00e5rd (there are six of them), it is his duty to terrorize his younger siblings, especially at fancy Hollywood functions.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nBill, on the other hand, looks completely unfazed by his brother's antics.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nIsn't that right, Bill?\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nYep. He's totally used to this.\n\nJB Lacroix/ WireImage/ Getty Images\n\nThis is just an average Tuesday for Bill.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nTotally normal. (Let's take a second to recognize Gustaf for his unwavering support in the wake of his older brother's nonsense.)\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nWhen you grow up in the Skarsg\u00e5rd household, you develop an immunity to jump scares and public humiliation. Then again, when you grow up in the Skarsg\u00e5rd household, you're also guaranteed to be at least 6'4\" and look like this:\n\nBarry King/Getty Images\n\nSeems like a fair trade-off.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nOK, but can we cast Alexander as the grown-up Bill Denbrough in the It sequel? Pretty please?", "images": ["https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:247463?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843170460-1504702105.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843174642-1504702078.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843185856-1504702082.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:247463?width=385&height=217&quality=.05&format=jpg", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843138462-1504702108.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843191562-1504702090.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843228082-1504702086.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843125992-1504702070.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843194904-1504702102.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843228354-1504702074.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1", "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-843191588-1504702098.jpg?quality=.8&height=1&width=1"], "top_img": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:247463?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Crystal Bell"], "canonical_link": "http://www.mtv.com/news/3034557/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere/", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The It Premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": 320, "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtv.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "call_config": "{\"omniture\":{\"pageName\":\"/news/3034557/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere/\",\"channel\":\"news\",\"events\":\"event16, event18\",\"prop1\":\"\",\"prop8\":\"It\",\"prop9\":\"Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd,Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd,Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd\",\"prop11\":\"\",\"prop12\":\"Movies\",\"prop14\":\"\",\"prop15\":\"no-franchise\",\"prop18\":\"Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The It Premiere [Movies]\",\"prop19\":\"09.06.2017\",\"prop20\":\"Crystal Bell\",\"prop21\":\"ALLTRAFFIC:MTV\",\"prop28\":\"News article\",\"prop38\":\"mtv.com\",\"prop44\":null,\"prop55\":\"news:News\",\"prop65\":\"News Article\",\"eVar6\":\"It\",\"eVar9\":\"/news/3034557/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere/\",\"eVar10\":\"ALLTRAFFIC:MTV\",\"eVar68\":\"no-franchise\",\"hier1\":\"/news/3034557/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere/\"}}"}, "og": {"site_name": "MTV News", "image": {"identifier": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:247463?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "author": "Crystal Bell", "type": "article", "description": "You can't scare Pennywise the Dancing Clown!!!", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The It Premiere", "url": "http://www.mtv.com/news/3034557/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere/"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:articles.mtv.com:3034557"}, "thumbnail": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:247463?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:247463?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "You can't scare Pennywise the Dancing Clown!!!", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The It Premiere", "url": "http://www.mtv.com/news/3034557/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere/"}, "author": "Crystal Bell", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/crystalbell11"}, "fb": {"app_id": 122150691493, "admins": "unset"}, "asset_url": "http://www.mtv.com/news", "expression": "shownav", "description": "You can't scare Pennywise the Dancing Clown!!!"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.com", "summary": ""}
