Alcohol just stopped working for me,\u201d she says.\n\nAs the holidays drew near, the reality star, who was previously married to Count Alexandre de Lesseps \u2014 with whom she shares two children, son Noel and daughter Victoria \u2014 decided to celebrate in Palm Beach, a somewhat dubious choice given it was the location of her wedding just one year earlier.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t put my finger on why I was feeling so anxious and why I was drinking more,\u201d de Lesseps says of returning to the scene of her failed nuptials. \u201cIt makes sense now.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 23, she was arrested for disorderly intoxication after she ended up in the wrong hotel room at the Colony Hotel and clashed with officers who arrived on the scene. She was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant; she\u2019s due in court April 13 and faces possible jail time if convicted.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann de Lesseps Brings PEOPLE Inside Her \u2018Eclectic\u2019 Kitchen\n\nFollowing her arrest, de Lesseps entered a treatment facility and began focusing on her personal well-being.

Will I drink again? I don\u2019t know. I miss good red wine.
