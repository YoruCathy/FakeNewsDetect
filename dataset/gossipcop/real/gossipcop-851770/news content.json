McCarthy was absent entirely from the show\u2019s cold open, and chose to focus on an apolitical topic, Mother\u2019s Day, during her first sketch of the evening. McCarthy also defied expectations by largely ignoring the fact that this is her fifth time hosting Saturday Night Live. The show has a history of making a big deal of a host\u2019s induction into the Five-Timer\u2019s Club\u2014but, perhaps because McCarthy made such fuss over almost getting there last year, S.N.L. decided to take a pass on bringing it up in the monologue.\n\nMcCarthy did, however, acknowledge some show history when she took an unsuspecting mom from the audience on a backstage tour that included cameos from a pantsless Alec Baldwin, as well as Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds (or, as McCarthy calls them, \u201cthe Livelys\u201d). But the real star of that tour was the llama McCarthy encountered in the hallway. For more on why that particular animal is so significant, you can go here. Suffice to say, that wasn\u2019t McCarthy\u2019s first llama rodeo.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591610edd95e9642026115fc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/sean-spicer-meme-agony.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db92758d77134d68d3bb6a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss03.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db915e8a2fdf64645fe020/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss02.png", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54db9137816608815fd00dca/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/saturday-night-live-anniversary-ss01.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58988e659d7a7cd341e5b817/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/sean-spicer-snl-melissa-mccarthy.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917da5af9384520b86c8928/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/melissa-mccarthy-snl-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917d3892bac0f42fb1f12ed/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/paul-ryan-snk-melissa-mccarthy.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58caf47855c69a50ab88e733/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/LLAMAGIF.gif"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917da5af9384520b86c8928/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/melissa-mccarthy-snl-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso", "Julie Mille", "Tina Nguye"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/melissa-mccarthy-snl-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Crash Melissa McCarthy\u2019s", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "With a special cameo from a pantsless Alec Baldwin and the backstage llama.", "id": "5917cef32bac0f42fb1f12eb", "keywords": "television,snl,saturday night live,melissa mccarthy,alec baldwin", "news_keywords": "television,snl,saturday night live,melissa mccarthy,alec baldwin", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5917cef32bac0f42fb1f12eb", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"With a special cameo from a pantsless Alec Baldwin and the backstage llama.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917da5af9384520b86c8928/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/melissa-mccarthy-snl-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917da5af9384520b86c8928/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/melissa-mccarthy-snl-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "With a special cameo from a pantsless Alec Baldwin and the backstage llama.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917da5af9384520b86c8928/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/melissa-mccarthy-snl-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Crash Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Monologue", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/melissa-mccarthy-snl-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "With a special cameo from a pantsless Alec Baldwin and the backstage llama.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5917da5af9384520b86c8928/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/melissa-mccarthy-snl-ryan-reynolds-blake-lively.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds Crash Melissa McCarthy\u2019s Monologue"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nnUPsNuqgIQ"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
