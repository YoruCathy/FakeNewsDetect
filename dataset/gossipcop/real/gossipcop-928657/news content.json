Twenty-two people were killed and more than 800 injured.\n\nGrande said: \u201cMusic is supposed to be the safest thing in the world. I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s still so heavy on my heart every single day. I wish there was more that I could fix. You think with time it\u2019ll become easier to talk about. Or you\u2019ll make peace with it. But every day I wait for that peace to come and it\u2019s still very painful.\u201d\n\nScooter Braun, Grande\u2019s manager, discussed the immediate aftermath of the bombing. Grande had flown back to her grandmother\u2019s house in Florida when he asked her to stage a tribute concert for the victims: \u201cShe looked at me like I was insane. She said, \u2018I can never sing these songs again. I can\u2019t put on these outfits. Don\u2019t put me in this position.\u2019\u201d They cancelled the rest of the tour, but two days later Grande agreed to do the concert, telling Braun: \u201cIf I don\u2019t do something, these people died in vain.\u201d\n\nThe concert, One Love Manchester, was held on 4 June 2017 and featured performers including Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Coldplay and Liam Gallagher. More than 55,000 fans attended. Grande told Time of the importance of staging the concert: \u201cThe last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won.\u201d\n\nThe profile also revealed that Grande and members of her crew got bee tattoos in tribute to the Manchester worker bee, a motif adopted during the Industrial Revolution. A bee appears at the end of the video for No Tears Left to Cry, Grande\u2019s comeback single.\n\nThe singer\u2019s fourth album, Sweetener, is expected to arrive later this summer and feature production from Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Pharrell Williams.", "images": ["https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdaW8WsU8AENIf0.jpg",
