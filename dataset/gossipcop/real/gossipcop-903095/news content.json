As a Washington Post report noted, in the fall of 2016, far-right talk-show host Alex Jones \u201crepeatedly suggested that Clinton was involved in a child sex ring and that her campaign chairman, John Podesta, indulged in satanic rituals. \u2026 Over the next couple of days, the wild accusations against Clinton gradually merged with a new raft of allegations stemming from WikiLeaks\u2019 release of Podesta\u2019s emails. Those emails showed that Podesta occasionally dined at Comet Ping Pong.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn December 2016, Edgar Maddison Welch, a man who believed the viral Internet rumor, opened fire in the restaurant in Washington. Welch has since pleaded guilty and apologized for his actions, as has Jones, who posted a video on his Infowars website that said neither Comet Ping Pong nor its owner had anything to do with human trafficking.\n\nPizzagate believers claim that many high-profile Democrats and the Hollywood elite are secret members of this society. Teigen, an outspoken critic of President Trump and his administration, often shares her opinions on social media and has been blocked by the president on Twitter.\n\nThe images that sparked Crokin\u2019s accusations are of baby Luna showing off her Halloween looks, which included a hot dog and \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d costume. On Snapchat, the social media platform on which she shared the pictures, Teigen\u2019s username contains a pizza emoji. Crokin claimed the emoji, along with the Alice costume, proved a link between Teigen and the secret society, as some believers claim the Lewis Carroll novel makes connections to pedophilia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cChrissy Teigen\u2019s daughter dressed as a hot dog, Alice in Wonderland & a pineapple but note the [pizza] emoji! #followthewhiterabbit #Qanon #TheStorm,\u201d Crokin tweeted, along with images of Luna.\n\nTeigen fired back at the claims, retweeting the thread while adding: \u201cAlright. I debated saying something about this but I\u2019m pretty disturbed over here. The fact that there are people with these\u2026thoughts\u2026is really scary.\u201d\n\nTeigen complained in a follow-up tweet about Twitter\u2019s verification of Crokin. \u201cThank you, Twitter, for verifying somebody who is esentially accusing me (with pictures of my daughter) of child abuse and pedophilia to their 50,000 followers,\u201d Teigen wrote.\n\nAD\n\nThank you, Twitter, for verifying somebody who is esentially accusing me (with pictures of my daughter) of child abuse and pedophilia to their 50,000 followers. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) December 30, 2017\n\nCrokin responded: \u201cChrissy you run in circle with people who rape, torture & traffic kids. This is a fact, I expose sex trafficking for a living.\u201d Teigen\u2019s response? \u201cAnyone know any good lawyers?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA few hours later, Crokin tweeted that Teigen\u2019s efforts to delegitimize her accuser had proved somewhat successful: Twitter employed its controversial policy of removing an account verification. \u201cTwitter just unverified my account thanks to Chrissy Teigen,\u201d Crokin said. \u201cThat\u2019s OK cuz I care more about saving kids than I do about a blue checkmark!\u201d\n\nTeigen\u2019s husband, singer John Legend, chimed in late Saturday night, with a tweet directed at Crokin: \u201cYou need to take my family\u2019s name out of your mouth before you get sued.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nYou need to take my family\u2019s name out of your mouth before you get sued. https://t.co/bPTwiBAs97 \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) December 31, 2017\n\nThough Teigen and Legend appear to have since moved on \u2014 Teigen tweeted Sunday night that she\u2019d \u201cmuted, blocked, and gone private to let these people further dig their holes while leaving me in peace\u201d \u2014 their experience prompted support from another Clinton: Chelsea.\n\n\u201cChrissy, sending you & beautiful Luna a huge hug,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt is awful & never ok when people threaten or demean any child.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nClinton claimed she has been the target of many human trafficking claims since the Pizzagate conspiracy took off. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the Twitter accounts who\u2019ve threatened Charlotte with #FGM [female genital mutilation],\u201d Clinton said, referring to her toddler daughter. \u201cWhile I never bother to report threats against me, I now report every one against her.\u201d\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yr7AWjHWZyukNFNOF6OSkuVwllc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NUVF2F6SYA26NE476GZ6OUHKQM.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O2HDBGRGJM2OZAIW62K4EOIE3U.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/b884f3d2-9773-4528-93b9-fd83f73999f5.png&w=90&h=90"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yr7AWjHWZyukNFNOF6OSkuVwllc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NUVF2F6SYA26NE476GZ6OUHKQM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Polus", "Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/01/01/chrissy-teigen-fights-back-after-twitter-user-drags-model-into-the-false-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen fights back after Twitter user drags her into the false \u2018Pizzagate\u2019 conspiracy theory", "meta_data": {"description": "The outspoken Trump critic found herself the target of a discredited anti-Clinton, child sex ring claim.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2018/01/01/chrissy-teigen-fights-back-after-twitter-user-drags-model-into-the-false-pizzagate-conspiracy-theory/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Yr7AWjHWZyukNFNOF6OSkuVwllc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NUVF2F6SYA26NE476GZ6OUHKQM.jpg", "title": "Chrissy Teigen fights back after Twitter user drags her into the false \u2018Pizzagate\u2019 conspiracy theory", "description": "The outspoken Trump critic found herself the target of a discredited anti-Clinton, child sex ring claim."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chrissy Teigen fights back after Twitter user drags her into the false \u2018Pizzagate\u2019 conspiracy theory", "description": "The outspoken Trump critic found herself the target of a discredited anti-Clinton, child sex ring claim."}, "last_updated_date": "2019-04-26T21:36:47.289Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514736000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
