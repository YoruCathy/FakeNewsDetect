Judge James Burke reminds them that to convict, they must be sure of the defendant's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt and must reach unanimous verdicts on each count. If they cannot, the judge may be forced to declare a mistrial.\n\nJudge Burke warns lead defence lawyer Donna Rotunno not to talk to the press after an opinion piece she wrote for Newsweek drew the ire of prosecutors.\n\n24 February 2020\n\nAfter five days of deliberation, the jury finds Weinstein guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape.\n\nThe 67-year-old is convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013.\n\nHe is acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault, charges that could have seen him jailed for life.\n\nThough cleared of the most serious charges made against him, the producer still faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction.\n\nJudge James Burke orders Weinstein to be held in custody and schedules a sentencing hearing for 11 March.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
