Seeds of an impending feud were planted at the beginning of the season, and now that we\u2019re at Week 3, it\u2019s revving up. It\u2019s unclear exactly why they hate each other so much, but the enmity is real, and it\u2019s reality television gold.\n\nDuring a group date, male model Jordan claims to have gotten more than 4,000 matches on Tinder during 2017. He also says that every woman he swipes right on also swipes right on him \u2015 hence the 100 percent swipe-to-match rate. (HuffPost reached out to Tinder to fact check these claims but did not hear back.)\n\nI am ashamed to admit that I was one of Jordan from #theBachlorette \u2018s 4000 tinder matches \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Cassie Livingston (@heyitscassie13) June 12, 2018\n\nDavid continues to needle Jordan about his Tinder habits until the Wilhemina model cracks and delivers a monologue of epic proportions.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m a joke. I\u2019m a Wilhemina model,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what that means. I have an image. If you\u2019re trying to tear down my image and my three-year contract ... it\u2019s actually pretty serious. It\u2019s something some people consider the top.... If you\u2019re trying to wreck my image, you\u2019ll never succeed. Because, do you know why? Because my image is me.\u201d\n\nHuffPost\u2019s Emma Gray chatted all about Jordan and David with actress and \u201cBachelor\u201d fan Erin Darke on the \u201cHere to Make Friends\u201d podcast:\n\nGray: So Jordan makes a few claims on this group date. One, he claims he got a notification from Tinder that he got 4,000 matches in 2017. My colleague Maxwell is emailing Tinder to fact-check these claims. (Update: We did not hear back from Tinder.) But I\u2019ve never heard of such a notification. Maybe it does exist, and I guess if you\u2019re swiping on tons of people every day of the year, it wouldn\u2019t be that hard to get 4,000 matches. You\u2019d have to get 10-12 matches a day.\n\nDarke: But you\u2019re talking about every day.\n\nGray: And Jordan says he didn\u2019t [use Tinder] every day. He also says he\u2019s very selective.\n\nDarke: There\u2019s no way you get 4,000 matches if you\u2019re very selective. Those things are in opposition.\n\nGray: But there\u2019s an even more wild claim that Jordan makes. David is just needling him and he says, \u201cWhat do you think your match percentage is, Jordan?\u201d And Jordan says, \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has online-dated knows that\u2019s a wild claim. The algorithm [of Tinder and similar apps] intentionally serves you people who haven\u2019t matched you mixed in with people who have. Because it\u2019s a game! I don\u2019t believe anyone has a perfect swipe-to-match rate. Unless you\u2019ve only swiped on one person.\n\nDarke: But apparently Jordan\u2019s swiped on 4,000! Also, what a weird thing to bring up on a date, and then to brag about and then to lie about!\n\nGray: And then, of course, David is just a little shit-stirrer. I know a lot of people are kind of down on David, but I\u2019m still sort of into him. I feel like I know people like him.\n\nDarke: I also feel like if I was stuck in a house with literally nothing to do with Jordan for weeks, it would be really hard not to play with him.\n\nGray: Yeah. It\u2019s not the kindest way to act, but... And I do think [Jordan] will ultimately be David\u2019s undoing. But, for now, I\u2019m enjoying it.\n\nDarke: I am, too. It makes for great TV.\n\nGray: David\u2019s also so transparent. He goes to Becca and says, \u201cI\u2019m not one to throw people under the bus, but...\u201d\n\nDarke: \u201cI don\u2019t throw people under the bus, but there is a bus coming and Jordan has a date with it.\u201d\n\nGray: And then Becca, who obviously is not into Jordan, just goes up to him and is like, \u201cJordan, 4,000 matches, eh?\u201d And Jordan just becomes enraged. Meanwhile, Wills has fully burrowed into the couch by that point.\n\nDarke: He was trying to make himself a part of the furniture.\n\nGray: But Jordan talks to Becca and explains that he\u2019s like a golden retriever as a partner. He\u2019s loyal, he\u2019s dependable and he loves a good girls\u2019 day! I mean... good qualities.\n\nDarke: But I also feel like he had a weird pause in that speech. First he said, \u201cI cook, I clean, I am a golden retriever.\u201d And then there was a pause. And then he was like, \u201cI\u2019m loyal.\u201d I was watching it wondering if he thinks cooking and cleaning are golden retriever qualities?\n\nGray: He grew up with a very intelligent golden retriever.\n\nDarke: Oh, I enjoy him so much.\n\nFor more on \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d listen to \u201cHere to Make Friends\u201d:\n\nDo people love \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d or do they love to hate these shows? It\u2019s unclear. But at \u201cHere to Make Friends,\u201d we both love and love to hate them \u2014 and we love to snarkily dissect each episode in vivid detail.
