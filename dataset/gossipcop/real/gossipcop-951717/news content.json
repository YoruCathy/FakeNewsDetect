Are they not?' And that's true in the reverse, as well. If you are -- if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there's trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, 'Oh, you've had to go through this in public.' The public isn\u2019t what\u2019s hard. What\u2019s hard is going through it.\"\n\nGarner and Affleck tied the knot in 2005, ultimately separating in 2015. The 45-year-old actor has since moved on with Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, but he and Garner remain amicable for their children.\n\n\"Our kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck,\" the brunette beauty said of Affleck last month on Instagram. \"#happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.\"\n\nHear more in the video below, and watch Garner's full CBS Sunday Morning interview on Sunday, July 15 at 9 a.m. ET/PT on CBS.\n\nJennifer Garner Pays Tribute to Ben Affleck With Sweet Father's Day Message This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
