There's some things that y'all might not wanna do, but it got to get done. I just can't do what you want me to do. I just can't. A woman should praise the man \u2014 the king.\"\n\nSteven Lawton Getty Images\n\nHe then continued: \"If you holding it down for your woman I feel like the woman should praise. And a man should praise the queen. But you know, my way of praising is called, 'How was dinner?', 'You like the house you living in? You like all them clothes you getting? I'm taking care of your family, I'm taking care of my family\u2026' You know, I'm putting in the work.\"\n\nNow Wood, who plays Dolores in HBO's sci-fi hit, has joined the conversation on Twitter.\n\nThe actress, who came out as bisexual six years ago, responded to Khaled by telling him: \"You're seriously missing out man. Take it from someone who has pride and thoroughly enjoys pleasuring women. You should grow up.\"\n\nCheck out a few more disgruntled tweets below;\n\nSo DJ Khaled says he doesn\u2019t go down on his chick, and now everything is a lie cause how can you be THE BEST if you\u2019re not eatin the cooch!!! \u2014 Flawless Baguettes (@WizKidFro) May 5, 2018\n\nI didn\u2019t want DJ Khaled down there anyway \u2014 PENNYWILD (@PennyWildMusic) May 5, 2018\n\nI could never be DJ Khaled\u2019s wife, as much as I complain about not getting my choocha ate out now on a regular...gworl...sksnsjksnejsk I know id definitely be going THROUGH IT if I was her \u2014 \u0262\u1d0f\u0280\u026a\u029f\u029f\u1d00 \u0262\u0280\u026a\u1d18 \u1d04\u1d0f\u1d0f\u1d04\u029c\u026a\u1d07 (@COMMANDAINQUEEF) May 5, 2018\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
