From there, Medley blew up, mocking de Lesseps for her headline-making arrest and trip to rehab.\n\nFurther insults came at the RHONY season 10 reunion, when Medley asserted that de Lesseps only sought treatment to avoid jail time and that she had become \u201cconfused between fame and infamy\u201d after her cabaret took off.\n\nRELATED: RHONY\u2019s Dorinda Medley Predicted Luann de Lesseps\u2019 Relapse: \u2018She\u2019ll Be Drinking in 3 Months\u2019\n\nThough it\u2019s been months, de Lesseps remains upset with Medley\u2019s words. \u201cWhat she said hurts still,\u201d the mother of two explained. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to process it and get over it right now.

I love Dorinda,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a long time.

But I will say, my cabaret, to me, is everything. I\u2019ve found my calling in my life and if that makes them uncomfortable, that is too bad for them. That\u2019s all I can say.
