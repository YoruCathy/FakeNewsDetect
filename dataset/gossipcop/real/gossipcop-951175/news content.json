If you want to make the most of your day at the shore, you'll round up the crew for a game of beach volleyball and Frisbee, and bring yummy eats for a barbecue lunch. You\u2019ll also need to pack a cute pair of sunnies, beach towel, quality sunscreen, and witty beach captions for Instagram in your tote.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not taking a refreshing dip in the sea, you could be relaxing in a cabana or getting cozy in a hammock while taking sun-kissed selfies with your besties. You could also be sippin' a pi\u00f1a colada at a beach bar with your SO, and want to capture the moment with a little video so you can remember the day forever.\n\nThat\u2019s where this list of clever beach quotes comes into play. In order to post those sunny selfies, Boomerangs of the waves crashing on the sand, and plandids of you showing off your beach outfit of the day, you'll need some epic captions.\n\nYour followers will appreciate a punny beach caption over a line they've seen over and over again. Coming up with something that\u2019ll make your friends laugh out loud can be pretty time consuming. It\u2019s also totally not chill to spend most of your time at the beach staring at your phone, but that's where this list comes into play. Forget having to come up with a caption on your own and taking time away from soaking up those beautiful rays. Instead, use any of these 50 beach quotes that are totally mermaid for your snaps.\n\nShutterstock\n\n1. \"If there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a wave.\"\n\n2. \"You haddock me at hello.\"\n\n3. \"That little sun of a beach.\"\n\n4. \"Sea you on the next wave.\"\n\n5. \"B.E.A.C.H. \u2014 best escape anyone could have. \"\n\n6. \"Feelin\u2019 just beachy.\u201d\n\n7. \"Tastes like summer.\u201d\n\n8. \"Party like a lobstar.\"\n\n9. \"I\u2019ve got 99 problems, but a beach ain\u2019t one.\"\n\n10. \"Life is a beach, I\u2019m just playing in the sand.\" \u2014 Lil Wayne, \"Right Above It\"\n\n11. \"I\u2019m feeling fintastic.
