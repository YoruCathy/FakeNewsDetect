{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/carrie-underwood-post-fall-photo-profile", "text": "Carrie Underwood is back in the music studio \u2014 and on social media \u2014 after injuring herself in a fall, and she's providing a rare glimpse of herself to prove it.The singer took to Twitter and Instagram to share a black and white photo of herself facing sideways, hard at work on new music, marking one of the few times the world has seen her face this year. The singer fell down the steps of her Nashville home in November, which resulted in a broken wrist and a facial injury that required 40 stitches. Since the fall, Underwood has largely stayed off of social media, and in the last six months, has only shared a few carefully composed shots of her face \u2014 seemingly not yet ready to reveal herself post-injury.\n\nIn January, Underwood opened up about how she was feeling in the wake of the fall and her medical treatment. \"There is also another part of the story that I haven't been ready to talk about since I have still been living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up. It's crazy how a freak random accident can change your life,\" she wrote in a letter to her fan club, People reported. \"In addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I\u2019ll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood\u2019s husband] Mike [Fisher] that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in.\" She later shared that she was recovering well, but \"not quite looking the same.\"\n\nIn addition to the partial selfies she's shared, Underwood also appeared in a video for her new song, \"The Champion,\" which has lyrics that hit seriously close to home. \"I am invincible, unbreakable / Unstoppable, unshakeable / They knock me down, I get up again / I am the champion,\" she sings alongside Ludacris on the track. Sounds about right, doesn't it?\n\nRead more about Carrie Underwood:\n\nNow, learn how to pull off red eye shadow:\n\nDon't forget to follow Allure on Instagram and Twitter.", "images": ["https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-header.95d6522119a7e0c0674f96017a219339528c048d.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac519a9424f773b2007db6c/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/carrie-underwood-face-after-stitches.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5e84c19041364700089bfefe/master/h_180%2Cc_limit/laura-mercier-translucent-loose-setting-powder-gwp.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Weiner", "Zoe Weine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/carrie-underwood-post-fall-photo-profile", "title": "Carrie Underwood Posts Photo of Her Face 5 Months After Stitches", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Zoe Weiner", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Former \"American Idol\" star Carrie Underwood shared a photo of herself in the music studio five months after her serious fall and facial injury.", "id": "5ac519a02f24d3056a978698", "keywords": "skin,carrie underwood,snd,selfie", "news_keywords": "skin,carrie underwood,snd,selfie", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ac519a02f24d3056a978698", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Former \\\"American Idol\\\" star Carrie Underwood shared a photo of herself in the music studio five months after her serious fall and facial injury.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac519a9424f773b2007db6c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/carrie-underwood-face-after-stitches.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac519a9424f773b2007db6c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/carrie-underwood-face-after-stitches.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She had a fall in November that necessitated 40 facial stitches.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Carrie Underwood Just Shared a New Photo of Herself Five Months After Getting Facial Stitches", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/carrie-underwood-post-fall-photo-profile"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "She had a fall in November that necessitated 40 facial stitches.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Carrie Underwood Just Shared a New Photo of Herself Five Months After Getting Facial Stitches"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
