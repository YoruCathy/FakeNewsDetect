This isn\u2019t the first time the two have made fans wonder about their relationship; the IRL Nancy and Jonathan, who had crushes on each other in the show, have been rumored to be dating since early 2017, but still haven\u2019t confirmed it.\n\nOver the weekend, photographers snapped Charlie and Natalia holding hands on a leisurely stroll together in Paris. They shared a pair of earbuds and were also spotted with Charlie\u2019s arm comfortably around Natalia\u2019s shoulders. A cozy autumn walk around Paris is looking pretty good right now.\n\nHolding hands obviously does not equal relationship, but fans are still thrilled about a possible pairing between the two stars.\n\nSince the Stranger Things cast has faced so much publicity lately, we totally understand why Charlie and Natalia would want to keep a prospective romance quiet, and it\u2019s totally their right to do so. Either way, a vacation in Paris doesn't sound too bad!\n\nRelated: \u201cStranger Things\u201d Actor Charlie Heaton Has a Lookalike In Harry Styles", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01f1c904c1421ac8c7d1d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01dfdea61c46262fc68aba/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/E005_C001_0117JE_001.025810.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01f1c904c1421ac8c7d1d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kara Nesvig", "Kara Nesvi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/stranger-things-co-stars-spark-dating-rumors", "title": "Stranger Things Co-Stars Spark More Dating Rumors in Paris", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Kara Nesvig", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "After being photographed in Paris over the weekend, fans are freaking out over \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 co-stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer\u2019s IRL romance.", "id": "5a01ce0ea61c46262fc68ab7", "keywords": "culture,stranger things,natalia dyer,charlie heaton", "news_keywords": "culture,stranger things,natalia dyer,charlie heaton", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a01ce0ea61c46262fc68ab7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After being photographed in Paris over the weekend, fans are freaking out over \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 co-stars Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer\u2019s IRL romance.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01e04ba61c46262fc68abc/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-680115394.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01e04ba61c46262fc68abc/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-680115394.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Same.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01f1c904c1421ac8c7d1d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Fans Can\u2019t Deal With How Cute This IRL Couple Is", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/stranger-things-co-stars-spark-dating-rumors"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Same.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a01f1c904c1421ac8c7d1d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Fans Can\u2019t Deal With How Cute This IRL Couple Is"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
