Venezuelan video director Daniel Dur\u00e1n led the stars and many background dancers through a story of heartache with a honey blonde Lopez at the center of the drama.\n\nJennifer Lopez will join the 2018 Billboard Latin Music Awards with a \u201cspecial performance\" on April 26 at 8 pm from Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe Billboard Latin Music Awards are the culmination of the Billboard Latin Music Conference, which takes place April 23- 26 at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The conference will feature panel and Q&A sessions with stars like Maluma, Ozuna, Bad Bunny, Man\u00e1, Pitbull, Christian Nodal and Steve Aoki.
