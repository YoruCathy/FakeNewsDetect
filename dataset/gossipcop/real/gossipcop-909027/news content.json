It\u2019s not easy to get adolescents excited about visiting a dusty old art museum, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2018s blockbuster Michelangelo exhibition might just have found a way tailor-made to lure at least one special teen. On Thursday morning, Michelangelo, the legendary teenage ninja turtle, visited the Met\u2019s show dedicated to his Renaissance namesake: \u201cMichelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer.\u201d\n\nThe museum tweeted about his visit early Thursday morning. Despite being a trained ninja, his entrance was anything but stealthy: Appearing in full costume, complete with signature orange mask, Mikey threw his arms up with joy as he entered the show, which has been hailed as \u201can art historical tour de force\u201d by the New York Times.\n\nThis morning we welcomed Michelangelo, one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (@TMNT) at The Met. Our celebrity guest came to see the work of an artist who happens to share his name. https://t.co/jUPJhto7Xr #MetMichelangelo pic.twitter.com/YS7T5xZv9a \u2014 The Met (@metmuseum) January 25, 2018\n\nThe once-in-a-lifetime exhibition has been a smash success for the Met, attracting half a million visitors as of this week, with an average of 7,000 art lovers swarming the exhibition every day, according to an announcement from the museum. That puts it on track to be one of the institution\u2019s top 10 most-visited shows ever before it closes on February 12.\n\nThough \u201cMichelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer\u201d wouldn\u2019t seem to need the extra push, the appearance of the hero is a clever ploy to draw in young fans via a little Turtle Power.\n\nThe Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles originated as a 1984 comic book by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, centering on crime-fighting turtles who happen to be named after artists: Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and, of course, Michelangelo. Trained in martial arts, the pizza-loving humanoid reptiles burst from their home in New York\u2019s subways to fight adversaries ranging from small-time crooks to space aliens.\n\nFrom its origins, the comic book has grown into cartoons, video games, food tie-ins, tons of merchandise, and six feature films. The latest, the Michael Bay-produced reboot Out of the Shadows (2016), grossed some $245.6 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nThursday\u2019s appearance marks their first-known appearance at a major New York art museum.\n\nSee more photos of the collision of the two Michelangelos, below:\n\nFollow artnet News on Facebook:", "images": ["https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-17-1024x683.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-e1516906006340.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2017/05/08michelangelo-superJumbo-256x256.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2016/11/news-logo.png", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2015/06/BrianBoucher_circ-256x256.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/JeTaimeCliff_2_101-150x150.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2017/11/sistine-chapel-michelangelo-256x256.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/GettyImages-910165442-1024x682.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2017/12/6.-Michelangelo_Studies-for-the-Libyan-Sibyl_MMA-256x256.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/25DZANNIVERSARYSHOW2018_19th_14_SCALE-e1516909953544-150x150.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-1024x683.jpg", "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-15-1024x683.jpg"], "top_img": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-e1516906006340.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Boucher", "Https", "News.Artnet.Com App News-Upload"], "canonical_link": "https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/metropolitan-museum-michelangelo-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-1207334", "title": "Michelangelo Meets Michelangelo: The Famed Ninja Turtle Visits the Met\u2019s Renaissance Blockbuster", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Michelangelo, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle known for his love of pizza, visited the Met Museum's blockbuster Michelangelo exhibition.", "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "michelangelo, metropolitan museum teenage mutant ninja turtles, metropolitan museum of art, teenage mutant ninja turtles", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Michelangelo Meets Michelangelo: The Famed Ninja Turtle Visits the Met's Renaissance Blockbuster | artnet News", "description": "Michelangelo, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle known for his love of pizza, visited the Met Museum's blockbuster Michelangelo exhibition.", "url": "https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/metropolitan-museum-michelangelo-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtle-1207334", "site_name": "artnet News", "updated_time": "2018-07-05T14:50:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-e1516906006340.jpg", "width": 1600, "height": 1067}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/brianboucher", "section": "On View", "published_time": "2018-01-25T15:09:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-05T14:50:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "Michelangelo, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle known for his love of pizza, visited the Met Museum's blockbuster Michelangelo exhibition.", "title": "Michelangelo Meets Michelangelo: The Famed Ninja Turtle Visits the Met's Renaissance Blockbuster | artnet News", "image": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-e1516906006340.jpg", "creator": "@briankboucher"}, "sailthru.date": "2018-01-25 15:09:23", "sailthru.title": "Michelangelo Meets Michelangelo: The Famed Ninja Turtle Visits the Met\u2019s Renaissance Blockbuster", "sailthru.tags": "michelangelo, metropolitan museum teenage mutant ninja turtles, metropolitan museum of art, teenage mutant ninja turtles", "sailthru.author": "Brian Boucher", "sailthru.description": "Known for his nunchucks and his love of pizza, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle has also apparently developed a taste for art.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-1280x600.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2018/01/TMNT_Michelangelo-10-e1516906006340-434x434.jpg", "sailthru.expire_date": "2018-02-24T15:09:23+00:00", "sailthru.author.image": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2015/06/BrianBoucher_circ-96x96.jpg", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2017/04/news-logo-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516892963.0, "source": "https://news.artnet.com", "summary": ""}
