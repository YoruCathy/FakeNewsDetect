I bought toys for my dog Dora \u2014 toys I could barely pick up. I paid for my housekeeper and a full-time driver I couldn\u2019t take anywhere. And after you\u2019ve binged every available Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon series (old AND new), the next logical activity? Online shopping, of course! (Well, for me anyway.) As a result, my phone is now home to every brand and retail app on the planet, each at the ready for swiping and shopping-cart-filling aplenty. This sounds almost ridiculous as I type it. I consider myself to be a smart person. Smart people don\u2019t spend money recklessly. There are very few things I consider hard to admit, but this is one of them. Always being independent and being on my own has been a point of pride for me. And like eating too many sweets when you\u2019re on a strict diet, there is a deep shame in spending this way. I\u2019m a grown-up, but surgery, sadness, and immobility had me acting like a child: stomping my feet like Veruca Salt. I want what I want when I want it, dammit!", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/bea/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1923924/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg"], "top_img": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/bea/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1923924/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Williams", "Erin Corbett", "Marshall Bright", "Whizy Kim", "Elizabeth Buxton", "Stacy London On Going Broke And Breakups"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/02/188983/stacy-london-managing-money-heartbreak", "title": "Stacy London On Her Year Of Going Broke", "meta_data": {"title": "Stacy London On Going Broke And Breakups", "description": "For me, 2017 was a financial, physical, emotional shit show.
