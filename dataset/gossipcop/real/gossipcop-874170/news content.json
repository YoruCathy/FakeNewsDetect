News for the Reunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore airing Aug. 20, Snooki reveals the two got into a fight the last time they saw each other. \u201cHe was an a--hole. But Mike was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to do a reunion with the cast, are you down?\u2019 You can\u2019t pass that up. You gotta go,\u201d she said.\n\nWith their first time back together in nearly half a decade, it doesn\u2019t take long for the two to descend into some awkward territory when Polizzi remembers to take her birth control \u2014 except, she gets her days mixed up. \u201cNo, today is Friday,\u201d Sorrentino reminds her as she realizes her error.\n\n\u201cOh s--t! Then I took an extra pill out,\u201d she complains. \u201cOh my God! I\u2019m gonna lose the pill and I\u2019m gonna have a baby.\u201d In an interview segment for the series, Sorrentino says his co-star has not changed one bit and fans will realize, he\u2019s right. Cheekily, Polizzi says she will have to hide her pills somewhere, quipping, \u201cWhere did you used to hide your pills?\u201d\n\nWith a cut to his interview, Sorrentino scoffs that \u201cshe has no filter.\u201d Back in the car, Polizzi reminiscences with her co-star about a time that he might not have wanted to recall. \u201cRemember you drank so much that your penis was out and you didn\u2019t even know it?\" she said. \u201cHow many women do you think you\u2019ve slept with?\u201d", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"], "top_img": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2017/08/19/nicole-snooki-polizzi-mike-situation-sorrentino-mtv-reunion/", "title": "Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi Creates an Awkward Situation for Mike Sorrentino on 'Reunion Road Trip'", "meta_data": {"description": "It\u2019s not a Jersey Shore reunion without an awkward moment between Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino and co-star, Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi.The pair spent a lot of time together during their six seasons on the MTV series, but the two have actually not kept in touch for the last five years, [...]", "keywords": "Jersey Shore,MTV,Mike The Situation Sorrentino,Snooki", "news_keywords": "Jersey Shore,MTV,Mike The Situation Sorrentino,Snooki", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@PopCulture", "creator": "@PopCulture", "title": "Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi Creates an Awkward Situation for Mike Sorrentino on 'Reunion Road Trip'", "description": "It\u2019s not a Jersey Shore reunion without an awkward moment between Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d [...]", "image": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png"}, "og": {"title": "Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi Creates an Awkward Situation for Mike Sorrentino on 'Reunion Road Trip'", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2017/08/19/nicole-snooki-polizzi-mike-situation-sorrentino-mtv-reunion/", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.popculture.com/2017/05/default-1.png", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Reality TV", "description": "It\u2019s not a Jersey Shore reunion without an awkward moment between Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503072000.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
