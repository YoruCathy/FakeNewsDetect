Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is speaking her mind about sister Kourtney\u2019s phone addiction in a promo for the Sunday, March 4, finale episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nIn the clip, the two sisters \u2014 along with middle sis Kim \u2014 are aboard a boat during their trip to San Francisco\u2019s Alcatraz prison when the 33-year-old Strong Looks Better Naked author loses her patience with her oldest sibling.\n\n\u201cWhat the f\u2014k are you here for?\u201d Khlo\u00e9 fumes as she calls Kourtney out for taking a phone call. \u201cYou\u2019re like a waste of space in my meter right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at everything,\u201d the 38-year-old reality star responds, which ultimately just sets Khlo\u00e9 off even more. \u201cYou\u2019re annoying as f\u2013k now when we\u2019re together,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 replies. \u201cThis is what you do, you\u2019re on your phone the whole time. You\u2019re just not present.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kourtney tries to defend herself asking, \u201cI had a 10 minute conversation with Sarah and that\u2019s offensive?\u201d To which both of her sisters respond, \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 \u2014 who is pregnant with her first child \u2014 continues to rant: \u201cYes, because we\u2019re only here once. When are we ever gonna go back to Alcatraz? You know what, actually, I\u2019m not doing this today,\u201d the reality star says between banter with Kourtney. \u201cBecause last time in Costa Rica I looked crazy because I\u2019m always complaining to get you guys to have fun. I\u2019m not going to be crazy \u2014 you be the f\u2014cking b\u2014ch you [are].\u201d\n\nAnd Kourtney ended the bickering with a low blow: \u201cF\u2014ck you, you whore. You pregnant whore.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Us Weekly broke the news in September 2017 that Khlo\u00e9 is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson \u2014 a baby boy \u2014 this spring. She later confirmed her pregnancy in a sweet Instagram post in December 2017.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E!
