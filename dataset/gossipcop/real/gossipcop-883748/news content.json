That would be coffee. Saturday, Sept. 29, is National Coffee Day, and in celebration of the most important day of the year, I\u2019ve rounded up the best caffeine-infused beauty products from Birchbox to wake you up and keep you going. Ingesting coffee does one thing for your insides, but on your skin? That\u2019s a whole other (wonderful) story.\n\n\u201cCoffee is useful in skincare because it\u2019s rich in antioxidants that protect the skin, as well as caffeine to help the body get rid of excess fluid,\u201d Dr. Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Elite Daily. \u201cApplying caffeine topically may improve the appearance of both cellulite and undereye puffiness, and by helping constrict blood vessels, it flushes away excess fluid that accumulates which makes the fat look more prominent,\u201d he says.\n\nNot only is coffee an anti-inflammatory, explains Zeichner, but it can help reduce redness, while antioxidants prevent skin damage from free radicals. \u201cTopically applied, caffeine may help protect against some skin cancers at the molecular level,\u201d he says.\n\nCheck out these Birchbox faves for caffeine-infused picks that won\u2019t have you yawning. I promise.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nORIGINS GinZing\u2122 Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer ($29.50, birchbox.com)\n\nAn oil-free moisturizer infused with panax-ginseng and coffee beans, the Origins GinZing gel will boost your skin\u2019s radiance and hydration each morning. This pick is one of Origin\u2019s best sellers and is light, but hydrating enough, for cooler fall temperatures.\n\nKiehl\u2019s Eye Fuel ($22.50, birchbox.com)\n\nLike food for your undereyes, the Kiehl\u2019s Eye Fuel will hide all traces of a hangover or a restless night's sleep. The cooling cream contains caffeine and Vitamin B3 to instantly reduce puffiness and dark circles.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules ($112, birchbox.com)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by their size\u2014these ampoules are stronger than they appear. Each ampoule contains ChronoluxAI technology to help reduce visible irritation and soothe stressed out skin. Unlike other coffee-infused products that you slather on in the AM, Estee Lauder suggests applying this formula in the PM, after your serum and before your moisturizer.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nClarins Detox Booster ($39, birchbox.com)\n\nThis green juice for the skin helps bring your complexion back to life. Enriched with green coffee extract, a plant from tropical Africa and rich in caffeine, this booster should not be used alone\u2014mix in 3-5 drops with your favorite moisturizer, serum or mask or foundation.\n\nARROW REVITALIZE Undereye Brightening Serum ($18, birchbox.com)\n\nThis undereye makeup pen not only conceals dark circles and puffiness, but the ginseng and caffeine-infused formula works to instantly soothe puffy bags. Bonus: the product comes in two shades, including light/medium and medium/deep.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\nJUARA Coffee & Creme Skin Smoothing Body Ritual ($58, birchbox.com)\n\nReinvigorate your body with this two-step skincare system, including a body scrub and body moisturizer. Infused with Indonesian coffee beans and candlenut oil, you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re actually in your shower and not the trendy coffee shop down the street.\n\nCourtesy of Birchbox\n\n100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream ($26, birchbox.com)\n\nNot only does this pick contain caffeine from coffee beans, but it also uses green tea to de-puff undereyes while increasing circulation. It\u2019s formulated with natural and organic ingredients, like antioixdants and rosehip oil, for a gentle yet effective treatment.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/e9bf8bff-e681-443d-92b6-c5de7de75e5d-origins-ginzing-energy-boosting-moisturizer.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15353773&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/48415a25-4450-4cf7-b1c6-6181c0a0a339-clarins_booster-detox.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/7fc4bef3-00d5-4909-8b45-220f63a38f76-kiehls-eye-fuel_pd_1500x1500.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/5d3e21dc-8adf-4be6-be2c-8417becca33f-estee-lauder_advanced-night-repair-ampoules_pd_1500x1500.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/e9bf8bff-e681-443d-92b6-c5de7de75e5d-origins-ginzing-energy-boosting-moisturizer.jpg?w=1020&h=574&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/9/79f3095e-d74b-4d50-be3a-75d3eb6b740e-getty-1214948542.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/7cda8c50-3775-43b3-b8a5-5adf660efc7d-origins-ginzing-energy-boosting-moisturizer.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/7570e9cc-2725-4d38-9a66-8b89fc4027f0-arrow_revitalize-undereye-brightening-serum_pd-open.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=100478526961130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/4/7/79fb1f66-67fd-4116-8341-bdd162f09227-screen-shot-2020-04-07-at-23200-pm.png?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2020/4/14/3c02d00a-e78a-4a0f-b130-e6307f730fc0-getty-1186835564.jpg?w=120&h=120&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/08c38871-05ad-4978-a0f0-950556049846-100pure_coffeebeancaffeineeyecream_900x900.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.elitedaily.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/07ac7749-9bfd-4eef-b0cd-8f9981f5dcf9-coffeescrub-ingredt.jpg?w=610&fit=max&auto=format%2Ccompress&cs=srgb&q=70"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/26/e9bf8bff-e681-443d-92b6-c5de7de75e5d-origins-ginzing-energy-boosting-moisturizer.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/celebrate-national-coffee-day-with-caffeine-infused-beauty-from-birchbox-12060247", "title": "Celebrate National Coffee Day With Caffeine-Infused Beauty From Birchbox", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@elitedaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "url": "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/celebrate-national-coffee-day-with-caffeine-infused-beauty-from-birchbox-12060247", "type": "article", "title": "Birchbox Created A Caffeine Beauty Box In Honor Of National Coffee Day & It's A Total Wakeup", "description": "There are thousands of religions in world that humans devote their whole lives to, but the one religion that almost everyone subscribes to?
