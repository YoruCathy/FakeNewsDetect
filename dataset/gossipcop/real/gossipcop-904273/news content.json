The posts were a part of the Time's Up initiative, which is drawing awareness to the battle against systemic sexual harassment. As previously reported, celebs in favor of the movement will wear black to the event.\n\n\"Wondering #WhyWeWearBlack ?!?!?! Because we stand with YOU!\" Washington shared on Sunday. \"We stand in solidarity. Together we can end harassment, discrimination & abuse. And create safety, inclusion, equity & parity! FOR ALL PEOPLE. ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. We are a women led campaign but we are standing for ALL marginalized people. STAND WITH US. Wear black today.\"\n\nJudd echoed Washington's sentiment:\n\n\"Today, we wear black,\" she wrote. \"Why? Nearly 1/2 of men think women are well represented in leadership roles and 1/3 of women think women are well represented in leadership roles. The *reality* is, only 1 in 10 senior leaders are women. #TimesUp #WhyWeWearBlack\"\n\n\"Wearing black today in solidarity with the men and women asking for respect and equality across industry lines,\" Ruffalo announced in a video posted to Twitter. \"Let's bring a stop to sexual harassment in the workplace. Join us in wearing black and saying #TimesUp.\"\n\nWearing black today in solidarity with the men and women asking for respect and equality across industry lines.
