The actress-slash-dancer recently launched her own beauty channel on YouTube and has since divulged all sorts of secrets\u2014everything from her 3-concealer hack to the body oil she calls \u201cheaven in a bottle.\u201d Next up? Dewan\u2019s revealing the secret to thick, enviable brows\u2014that last all day and also look thick, yet natural.\n\nBecause, as she shares in this video on her YouTube channel, \u201cI really think brows frame a face,\u201d she says. \u201cI have nothing on the face, maybe a little bit of concealer, but if the brows are good, the face is framed and I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d To start this all off Dewan uses a spoolie to brush her brow hairs up and out, moving them away from her eyes so that they take up more space on the brow bone.\n\nThen, she uses a waxy pencil (her choice: the Anastasia\u2019s Brow Definer Pencil), making tiny dashes on the on the tops of brows to strengthen the line, while still looking natural. She continues brushing the hairs up with the spoolie to help blend the pencil line with the hairs. While she used to do the same on the bottom edges of the arches, she stopped because it made the lines look too harsh.\n\nTo finish, she holds the look together with an inexpensive drugstore find: the $6 Maybelline\u2019s Great Lash Clear Mascara. \u201cI love this stuff,\u201d admits Dewan. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a brow gel, but it\u2019s clear mascara and it works just as good. Let me tell you, this stuff stays all day.\u201d She sweeps the formula against the hair grain and up so that the arches look full and thick.\n\nOr you know, in her words, like \u201cBrooke Shields natural brows.\u201d She definitely makes a strong case for embracing the bold eyebrow. Easy makeup look, achieved\u2014all for the price of a latte. Yes, please.\n\nThese are 5 tricks to naturally gorgeous eyebrows. And this is the scientific reason why thick eyebrows are so trendy.", "images": ["https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/plant-paradox-diet-getty-HoxtonTom-Merton-600x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/WG-Plusfactor-Cookbook-April-150x150.png", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/themes/wellgood-2016/assets/img/spacer.gif", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EditCoverFX-092bw-e1576182266766-150x150.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1192882801-sized.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1753-Estee-CCA-Branded-Feature-1400px-v2.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jenna-dewan-brows.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lentil-balls-vegan-snack-attack-607x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/MitoQ_CCA3_Branded-Feature-1400px-2-609x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/GettyImages-455115875-599x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Stocksy_txp8d0248cbaYQ200_Small_1389457-forgot-my-bra-600x400.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1709-Kroger_CWU2-Feature_1400px.jpg", "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/themes/wellgood-2016/assets/img/made-in-ny.png"], "top_img": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jenna-dewan-brows.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wellandgood.com/good-looks/jenna-dewan-drugstore-eyebrow-hack/", "title": "Jenna Dewan's $6 natural eyebrow hack", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/favicon-194x194.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"pages": 91915774693}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@iamwellandgood", "site": "@iamwellandgood", "title": "Jenna Dewan's $6 natural eyebrow hack | Well+Good", "description": "On her YouTube channel, the actress-slash-dancer reveals her go-to hack for thick brows\u2014and it's not a brow gel, but rather a drugstore staple that won't break the bank.", "image": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jenna-dewan-brows.jpg"}, "description": "On her YouTube channel, the actress-slash-dancer reveals her go-to hack for thick brows\u2014and it's not a brow gel, but rather a drugstore staple that won't break the bank.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jenna Dewan's $6 natural eyebrow hack | Well+Good", "description": "On her YouTube channel, the actress-slash-dancer reveals her go-to hack for thick brows\u2014and it's not a brow gel, but rather a drugstore staple that won't break the bank.", "url": "https://www.wellandgood.com/good-looks/jenna-dewan-drugstore-eyebrow-hack/", "site_name": "Well+Good", "updated_time": "2020-01-24T13:40:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jenna-dewan-brows.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jenna-dewan-brows.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/iamwellandgood", "tag": "news", "section": "Good Looks", "published_time": "2018-06-27T21:56:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-01-24T13:40:48+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "pocket-site-verification": "e5ab52bbadc2281f4803a907a07a48"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530136565.0, "source": "https://www.wellandgood.com", "summary": ""}
