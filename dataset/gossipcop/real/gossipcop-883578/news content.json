And he lets her!\" she wrote. \"It's so messed up, diary.\"\n\n9/26/2017, 9 pm:\n\nDear diary, I'm still thinking about how Miss Piggy walks all over Kermit. And he lets her! It's so messed up, diary. \u2014 Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) September 27, 2017\n\nNever one to take an insult lying down, Miss Piggy clapped back: \"@lilireinhart Tell your diary that moi has moved on from walking over the frog.

Sprouse (@colesprouse) September 27, 2017\n\nFor anyone wondering what the situation is between Miss Piggy and Kermit, the couple tied the knot during 1984 flick The Muppets Take Manhattan, before announcing their heartbreaking seperation back in 2015.\n\nKermit hasn't responded to reports that Miss Piggy is moving on with Cole - and while Cole himself hasn't made it clear where his heart truly lies, it looks like we could potentially be witnessing the birth of 2017's biggest power couple.", "images": ["http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/09/29/misspiggynav.jpg?itok=Auih4577", "data:image/gif;base64,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", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/all/themes/vimn/common/images/logos/mtv.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/09/29/misspiggynav.jpg?itok=Auih4577", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/lili-reinhart/news/lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouse-are-in-a-public-love-triangle-with-miss-piggy", "title": "Lili Reinhart And Cole Sprouse Are In A Public Love Triangle With Miss Piggy", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/lili-reinhart/news/lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouse-are-in-a-public-love-triangle-with-miss-piggy", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/09/29/misspiggynav.jpg?itok=Auih4577", "description": "Who will win Cole's heart?", "title": "Lili Reinhart And Cole Sprouse Are In A Public Love Triangle With Miss Piggy | MTV UK"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lili Reinhart And Cole Sprouse Are In A Public Love Triangle With Miss Piggy | MTV UK", "description": "Who will win Cole's heart?", "url": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/lili-reinhart/news/lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouse-are-in-a-public-love-triangle-with-miss-piggy", "image": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/09/29/misspiggynav.jpg?itok=Auih4577", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow,NOODP", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "vimn": {"entity_type": "node", "entity_uuid": "6bf917d2-cfc5-4731-859c-900bc0963e72"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/09/29/misspiggynav.jpg?itok=hYaYPxGF", "description": "Who will win Cole's heart?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.co.uk", "summary": ""}
