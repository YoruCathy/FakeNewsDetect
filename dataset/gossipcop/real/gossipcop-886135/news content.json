Two of his clients, actors Dustin Hoffman and Brett Ratner, were also accused of sexual misconduct earlier this month.\n\nVenit has been suspended from William Morris Endeavor, according to ABC News. The agency could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\nAD\n\nOn Oct. 10, Crews wrote a long thread on Twitter and said that the Weinstein news had given him PTSD, as he was groped by a \u201chigh level Hollywood executive\u201d during an event last year he attended with his wife.\n\nThis whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nMy wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates. (2/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nJumping back I said What are you doing?! My wife saw everything n we looked at him like he was crazy. He just grinned like a jerk. (3/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nI was going to kick his ass right then\u2014 but I thought twice about how the whole thing would appear. (4/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\n\u201c240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho\u201d would be the headline the next day. (5/cont.) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nHopefully, me coming forward with my story will deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless. (16/end) \u2014 terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017\n\nCrews was at the packed party last year with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews, when Venit began staring at him, making \u201covertly sexual\u201d moves with his tongue, he told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking like, \u2018Is this a joke?\u2019 I mean I don\u2019t understand, it was actually so bizarre,\u201d Crews said. \u201cHe comes over to me. I stick my hand out and he literally takes his hand and puts it and squeezes my genitals. And I jump back like, \u2018Hey! Hey!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s still licking his tongue out and all this stuff, and I go, \u2018Dude, what are you doing? What are you doing?\u2019 And then he comes back again! And he just won\u2019t stop,\u201d Crews said.\n\nAD\n\nCrews said he then pushed Venit away from him, and Venit bumped into other partygoers. Venit then began laughing and giggling, Crews said.\n\n\u201cI have never felt more emasculated, more objectified,\u201d Crews said. \u201cI wake up every morning wondering, \u2018Did this really happen?\u2019 \u201d\n\nCrews said he was concerned about his wife during the incident, and positioned himself between her and Venit so that Venit wouldn\u2019t approach her. Afterward, Crews said he was filled with rage, and felt like he \u201ccould punch a hole in his head.\u201d When he and his wife got in the car to drive home, Crews said he \u201calmost ripped the steering wheel off.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCrews said his wife calmed him down, and was proud of him for not resorting to violence. As an African American man, Crews said, he is aware that, had he physically confronted Venit, he would \u201cimmediately be seen as a thug.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCrews said he understands why many victims don\u2019t come forward. They\u2019re up against powerful people in Hollywood and fear people won\u2019t believe their stories, and that their careers will suffer as a result, he said.\n\nIn the fallout of claims, which range from sexual misconduct to rape, some have resigned and others have been fired. Kevin Spacey in late October was accused of making sexual advances on a minor, and he has since been banished from the last season of the Netflix original series \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d He has also been cut from the finished production of director Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cAll the Money in the World,\u201d replaced by actor Christopher Plummer. Such a last-minute recasting in a finished movie is unprecedented.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this month, the New York Times published five women\u2019s allegations of sexual misconduct against comedian Louis C.K. Less than 24 hours later, the release of his new movie, \u201cI Love You, Daddy,\u201d was canceled. Netflix announced it would not produce the comedian\u2019s planned comedy special. FX announced it would end its relationship with him, cutting its deal with him and removing him as the executive producer of four shows.\n\nAD\n\nCrews himself said he put the incident in the back of his mind until the Weinstein allegations, which encouraged him to tweet in October about what happened. He filed a police report earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI will not be shamed. I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong,\u201d he told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rryfcIxe3ZeRrE3rbY6RmPU7sRI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X7BH2VN6YA3IXPMAAXEMWEANOM.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/9f474f9f-0c3d-4798-8ae2-c6d23673e21b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZLVX5LSP2E6GZAPCV7PWRXIKD4.jpg&w=150"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rryfcIxe3ZeRrE3rbY6RmPU7sRI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X7BH2VN6YA3IXPMAAXEMWEANOM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marwa Eltagouri", "General Assignment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/11/15/i-will-not-be-shamed-actor-terry-crews-details-his-alleged-sexual-assault/", "title": "\u2018I will not be shamed\u2019: Actor Terry Crews details his alleged sexual assault", "meta_data": {"description": "Crews names the Hollywood executive who allegedly sexually assaulted him at a party.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/11/15/i-will-not-be-shamed-actor-terry-crews-details-his-alleged-sexual-assault/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rryfcIxe3ZeRrE3rbY6RmPU7sRI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X7BH2VN6YA3IXPMAAXEMWEANOM.jpg", "title": "\u2018I will not be shamed\u2019: Actor Terry Crews details his alleged sexual assault", "description": "Crews names the Hollywood executive who allegedly sexually assaulted him at a party."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018I will not be shamed\u2019: Actor Terry Crews details his alleged sexual assault", "description": "Crews names the Hollywood executive who allegedly sexually assaulted him at a party."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-26T00:27:49.451Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510675200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
