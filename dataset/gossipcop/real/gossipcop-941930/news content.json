The singer-turned-actress is on the cover of People this month, where she spoke about her own mother, who identifies as a lesbian, as well as her two gay brothers.\n\n\u201cNobody is hiding who they are,\u201d Moore tells the magazine. \u201cThere are no secrets in our lives. I love and support my mom and my brothers with my whole heart. And nothing makes me happier than seeing anybody live their authentic self, and to choose love. If anyone can find love, I support it, I salute you and I celebrate that.\u201d\n\nSo much going on in this photo: My Dad and brother's faux surprise facial expressions, the matching polka dots, the hair all around, etc\u2026..I could go on. #TBT #awkwardfamilyphotos #priceless A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Jan 15, 2015 at 4:11pm PST\n\nMoore, who recently got engaged to musician Taylor Goldsmith, first talked about her not-so-traditional family with the site Byrdie last year, when she shared that her mother left her father for a woman. But now that This Is Us is a bonafide Emmy-nominated hit, she\u2019s asked more often about her own family, whom she admits she can feel protective over.\n\n#tbt to simpler times and shorter hemlines. A post shared by Mandy Moore (@mandymooremm) on Dec 8, 2016 at 12:39pm PST\n\n\u201cI definitely won\u2019t stand for [intolerance],\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut I feel like we\u2019re at a time in our culture when we\u2019re able to have a much more open dialogue. I\u2019m encouraged and excited that eventually we\u2019re going to get to a point where none of this matters. Sexual preference or orientation just won\u2019t factor in anymore. I think we\u2019re inching closer to that.\u201d\n\nMoore\u2019s brother Scott lives in L.A. with his partner Ryan and used to work at the Los Angeles LGBT Center. Scott is now a podcast personality on AfterBuzz TV where he hosted the Looking after-show.\n\nFacebook\n\nMoore\u2019s mom, Stacy, is still with her partner, professional tennis player Claudette Laliberte.\n\nFacebook\n\nWhen Stacy first left Moore\u2019s father in 2008, The National Enquirer spread rumors that Moore felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d and was at odds with her mother. Stacy herself told the Enquirer, \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s business why we\u2019re together.\u201d\n\nLast month, Stacy attended Mandy\u2019s engagement party and was spotted in an Instagram story telling her daughter how proud she was: \u201cI got a lot of congratulations from friends and such, and I said, \u2019You know what, two wonderful people make two wonderful people.\u2019 And that\u2019s the best I can say. I\u2019m just so happy.\u201d\n\nMandy Moore/Facebook", "images": ["http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-105894032-1509462997-1509462999.jpg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/922120_10200587155434992_491840004_o-1509463829-1509463832.jpg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:255610?quality=0.8&format=jpg&height=495&width=660", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stacy-claudette-1509465076-1509465077.jpg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:255610?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12107281_10153574070413444_3834948844313042836_n-1509465127-1509465127.jpg?quality=0.85&format=jpg&width=480"], "top_img": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:255610?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Trish Bendix"], "canonical_link": "http://www.newnownext.com/mandy-moore-lesbian-mom-gay-brothers/10/2017/", "title": "\u201cThis is Us\u201d Star Mandy Moore On Her Lesbian Mom And Gay Brothers: \u201cThere Are No Secrets In Our Lives\u201d", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "reporting": {"beacon_url": "http://mb.mtvnservices.com/data/collect/v1/mb.gif", "beacon_topic": "newnownext"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:546357"}, "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "title": "\"This is Us\" Star Mandy Moore On Her Lesbian Mom And Gay Brothers: \"There Are No Secrets In Our Lives\"", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/mandy-moore-lesbian-mom-gay-brothers/10/2017/", "image": {"identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:255610?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "width": 1440, "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "\"I love and support my mom and my brothers with my whole heart.\""}, "sm4": {"author": "Trish Bendix", "type": "Post"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1774721959458948}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I love and support my mom and my brothers with my whole heart.\"", "title": "\u201cThis is Us\u201d Star Mandy Moore On Her Lesbian Mom And Gay Brothers: \u201cThere Are No Secrets In Our Lives\u201d", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:logotv.com:255610?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/mandy-moore-lesbian-mom-gay-brothers/10/2017/", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "I love and support my mom and my brothers with my whole heart.", "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:s3.amazonaws.com/articles.newnownext.com-production/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/moore-family-fb-1509463875-1509463876-300x225.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.newnownext.com", "summary": ""}
