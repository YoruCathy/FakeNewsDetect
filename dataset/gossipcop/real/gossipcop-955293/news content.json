'\"If you don\u2019t like it, you can [switch].\"'\n\nThe star recently took the campaigns shots for his mother\u2019s new Reebok collection.\n\nOver the weekend Victoria posted a series of images shot by her son with the caption: \u2018Love seeing my Merch Collection through @BrooklynBeckham eyes\u2019.\n\n\n\nBeckham\u2019s big break in fashion came at the age of 16 when he first snapped photos for a Burberry fragrance campaign.\n\nThis is only the beginning for Brooklyn.", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/fan-bedroom-hot-1532527017.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-1532592588.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.998xw:1.00xh;0.00163xw,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.998xw:1.00xh;0.00163xw,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a22556991/brooklyn-beckham-photographs-game-of-thrones-sophie-turner/", "title": "Brooklyn Beckham Photographs 'Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner Sitting On The Toilet", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Brooklyn Beckham Sings In Behind-The-Scenes Video Of Sophie Turner Photo Shoot", "description": "Check out those vocal skills", "url": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a22556991/brooklyn-beckham-photographs-game-of-thrones-sophie-turner/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.998xw:1.00xh;0.00163xw,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-08-10 11:01:53", "published_time": "2018-08-10 10:59:00", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.998xw:1.00xh;0.00163xw,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Brooklyn Beckham Photographs 'Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner Sitting On The Toilet", "description": "It's not your normal meeting place, granted", "keywords": "Brooklyn Beckham, Sophie Turner, 1883 magazine, photography, victoria beckham, game of thrones", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.500xw:1.00xh;0.202xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture", "sailthru.date": "2018-08-10T10:59:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.998xw:1.00xh;0.00163xw,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-09-53-48-1532595508.jpg?crop=0.500xw:1.00xh;0.202xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Brooklyn Beckham Sings In Behind-The-Scenes Video Of Sophie Turner Photo Shoot", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533869940.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
