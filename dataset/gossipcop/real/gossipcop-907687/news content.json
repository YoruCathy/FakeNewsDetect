But of course now is the time for listening, and that\u2019s what we are all trying to do.\u201d\n\nFive women accused Franco, who is nominated at Sunday\u2019s ceremony for outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role for his movie The Disaster Artist, of sexually exploitative behavior earlier this month.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: See the Standout Outfits from the SAG Awards 2018\n\nLast week, Franco skipped the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards, where he won the award for best actor in a comedy.

The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate. But I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long. So I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way.\u201d\n\nThe 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on both TNT and TBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi", "Mia Mcniece"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "title": "James Franco Attends 2018 SAG Awards After Allegations of Sexually Inappropriate Behavior", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Awards Shows,James Franco,Movie News,News,SAG Awards,Screen Actors Guild Awards", "news_keywords": "Awards Shows,James Franco,Movie News,News,SAG Awards,Screen Actors Guild Awards", "description": "The event marked his first public appearance since five women accused James Franco of\u00a0sexually exploitative behavior\u00a0earlier this month", "og": {"title": "James Franco Attends 2018 SAG Awards After Allegations of Sexually Inappropriate Behavior", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "description": "James Franco&nbsp;was spotted at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Sunday \u2014 his first public appearance in the wake of allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior.&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "description": "The event marked his first public appearance since five women accused James Franco of\u00a0sexually exploitative behavior\u00a0earlier this month", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/movies/sag-awards-2018-james-franco-attends/", "title": "James Franco Attends 2018 SAG Awards After Allegations of Sexually Inappropriate Behavior", "description": "The event marked his first public appearance since five women accused James Franco of\u00a0sexually exploitative behavior\u00a0earlier this month", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F01%2Fjames-franco8-1.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
