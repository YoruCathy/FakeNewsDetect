These groups do amazing work and need our support. Every day for the next 14 days I will highlight a group I'm supporting, and encourage you to do the same! \u2014 Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) May 9, 2018\n\nMurphy added that he will announce each charity on social media over the next two weeks, in order to help promote each's work supporting transgender people and the larger LGBT community.\n\nThe first announced is the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, which \"works to guarantee that all people are free to self-determine gender identity and expression, regardless of income or race, and without facing harassment, discrimination or violence.\"\n\nThe Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

Showing his commitment, Murphy then retweeted The Advocate's editor-in-chief, Lucas Grindley, after he highlighted the work of Extraordinary Families, an LGBT-inclusive nonprofit that supports foster and adopted children.\n\nCocreated by Murphy and Steven Canals, Pose is set in 1987, and centers on trans women in New York City's ballroom scene. The show has cast the most transgender actors as series regulars in television history: MJ Rodriguez, Indya Moore, Dominique Jackson, Hailie Sahar, and Angelica Ross. The series also features the talents of Billy Porter, Evan Peters, Kate Mara, and James Van Der Beek.\n\nPose premieres June 3 on FX.
