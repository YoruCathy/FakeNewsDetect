The tiff escalated and ended with Priestley being hauled out of the party by security after he hurled a jab Weinstein's way.\n\nThe drama was dragged into the spotlight on Monday after Mira Sorvino tweeted her reaction to the confirmation that Weinstein had blacklisted her for rebuffing his advances, telling director Peter Jackson not to hire her or fellow actress Ashley Judd. \"There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure,\" she wrote.\n\nIn response to her tweet, actress Tara Strong speculated that perhaps Priestley had been blacklisted by the producer as well after he punched him in the face. Priestley replied that it probably was not true, as he did not work with Weinstein, but, for our reading pleasure, he recounted the details of their encounter 22 years ago.\n\n\"Harvey told me I had to leave... I was leaving when he grabbed me by the arm and said 'what are you doing?'\" tweeted Priestley. \"I said 'you told me leave, I\u2019m leaving.'\"\n\nPriestley continued that there was a bit more back-and-forth drama about whether or not Weinstein had told the actor to leave, and then things got heated and Weinstein got punched.\n\nSome drama is truly timeless.\n\nRead the full exchange below.\n\nJust seeing this after I awoke, I burst out crying. There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I\u2019m just heartsick https://t.co/ljK9NqICbm \u2014 Mira Sorvino (@MiraSorvino) December 15, 2017\n\nIDK about that @tarastrong... I know I never worked for Miramax... and boy was my team HORRIFIED when they heard about what I had done! Harvey was powerful, my team STRONGLY ADVISED me to write him an apology the next day... \u2014 Jason Priestley (@Jason_Priestley) December 17, 2017\n\nOf course there is more to the story... \u201895 Golden Globes... at the Miramax Party... Harvey told me I had to leave... I was leaving when he grabbed me by the arm and said \u201c what are you doing?\u201d I said \u201c you told me leave, I\u2019m leaving\u201d \u2014 Jason Priestley (@Jason_Priestley) December 15, 2017\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say you had to leave\u201d he replied. \u201cYou just told me to leave... right over there\u201d I tell him once again. Getting heated now. He then grabs me tighter and says \u201cwhy don\u2019t we go outside and talk about this\u201d. That was all I needed to hear, \u2014 Jason Priestley (@Jason_Priestley) December 15, 2017", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/jason_priestley_and_harvey_weinstein_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2017/12/jason_priestley_and_harvey_weinstein_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/jason_priestley_and_harvey_weinstein_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jason-priestley-says-he-punched-harvey-weinstein-face-1995-1068866", "title": "Jason Priestley Says He Punched Harvey Weinstein in the Face in 1995", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Here's some drama that's aged well.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jason-priestley-says-he-punched-harvey-weinstein-face-1995-1068866", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Jason Priestley Says He Punched Harvey Weinstein in the Face in 1995", "description": "Here's some drama that's aged well.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/12/jason_priestley_and_harvey_weinstein_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Jason Priestley Says He Punched Harvey Weinstein in the Face in 1995", "description": "Here's some drama that's aged well.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jason-priestley-says-he-punched-harvey-weinstein-face-1995-1068866", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/12/jason_priestley_and_harvey_weinstein_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Jason Priestley Says He Punched Harvey Weinstein in the Face in 1995", "sailthru.description": "Here's some drama that's aged well.", "sailthru.author": "Sam Reed", "sailthru.vertical": "Style", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-18 11:54:11", "sailthru.tags": "Style,nsfs,Style News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513569251.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
