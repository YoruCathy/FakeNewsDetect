The episode was followed by a Q&A with This Is Us castmembers Ventimiglia, Mandy Moore, Justin Hartley, Chris Sullivan, Chrissy Metz, Susan Kelechi Watson and Ron Cephas Jones as well as recently promoted Season 2 showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger.\n\nWhile Jack and Rebecca didn\u2019t eternally breakup forever, we saw a different kind of split between the Pearsons, with Rebecca saying it was time for them to take a rest. Jack stumbled drunk into her club performance and punched her ex-boyfriend and fellow band member Ben (Sam Trammell). Rebecca returned home heartbroken, the singing career she\u2019d been trying to reboot in shambles \u2013 not just because of Jack, but Ben also made a pass at her. A fight broke out between Jack and Rebecca and she was none too happy about Jack\u2019s alcoholism returning just as she was trying to pursue her lifelong dream.\n\nIn regards to how audiences will still have to wait to see Jack\u2019s death, Sullivan joked to Metz, \u201cWe could stretch this out like the Neil Patrick Harris show and call it How You Killed Your Father,\u201d a reference to Metz\u2019s younger Kate Pearson confessing that she was an integral part of her father\u2019s death. The actress also added that in Season 2 \u201cwe might be hearing wedding bells soon\u201d between Kate and her boyfriend Toby.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on how he lived, that\u2019s the most important lesson than anything,\u201d chimed in Ventimiglia.\n\nAnother big reveal at the end of tonight\u2019s episode is that Sterling K. Brown\u2019s Randall Pearson tells his wife Beth (Watson), that he wants to adopt a kid. But, he hasn\u2019t even told her he quit his job yet. \u201cI think she\u2019s OK with him quitting his job,\u201d said Watson, \u201cbut I think her supporting him with the adoption might be an issue.\u201d That is especially after she had the pregnancy scare earlier in the season.\n\nRon Cephas Jones, who plays Randall\u2019s deceased father William, then dropped a heavy hint: \u201cShe might have to go out in the workforce while Randall stays home.\u201d\n\nWith This Is Us known as the show that makes America cry on Tuesday night, Berger and Aptaker say that they\u2019ve spoken with This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman about lightening things up a bit in Season 2. \u201cIt\u2019s always beautiful when there\u2019s birthday parties and people are enjoying each other. We want to find a balance,\u201d said Berger.\n\nJim Smeal/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nBerger mentioned that Fogelman had been building up toward this season finale, with hints of the emotional breakup hinted earlier in the season.\n\n\u201cWe knew a fight was coming, Dan cornered us and excitedly said, \u2018I just wrote six pages!'\u201d Moore added. Prepping for the scene, she mentioned that she and Ventimiglia got together with the finale\u2019s director and series EP Ken Olin to hammer out the choreography of the scene so that it didn\u2019t take up a lot of head space on the day of the shoot.\n\nIn \u201cMoonshadow\u201d we see an earlier, shady side of Jack post Vietnam. Ventimiglia said that Fogelman told him before the finale, \u201c\u2018People are going to hate you!
