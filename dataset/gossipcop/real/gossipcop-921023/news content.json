However, due to good behavior, her initial release date of June 21 has been moved up. Her new date is now projected to be May 25, which \u201cincludes credit for good conduct time that may be earned throughout the remainder of her sentence,\u201d the bureau told Us Weekly on Friday, March 16.\n\nUs Weekly caught up with former mentee of Miller\u2019s, Nia Sioux, at the Midnight Sun premiere on Thursday, March 15, who dished on leaving her former Dance Moms life behind. \u201cProbably not,\u201d Sioux told Us about the possibility of reconnecting with Miller post-jail. \u201cNever say never, but I\u2019ve pretty much distanced myself for a while.\u201d\n\nThe 16-year-old dancer did, however, reveal that she \u201creally learned so much from\u201d Miller. She added: \u201cI think one thing that I take from working with her is I learned how to deal with difficult people, with different types of people.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the reality star was also sentenced for not reporting the $120,000 worth of Australian currency that she had brought into the United States. Along with prison time, she was fined $40,000 along with a $120,000 judgment, and ordered to two years of supervised release.\n\nIn December 2017, Us Weekly exclusively confirmed that the Abby Lee Dance Company owner had completed a prison Release Preparation Program as well as received a certificate in personal finance.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/abbie-lee-miller.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/abbie-lee-miller.jpg?crop=154px%2C55px%2C1772px%2C929px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/abbie-lee-miller.jpg?crop=154px%2C55px%2C1772px%2C929px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/abby-lee-miller-may-get-out-of-prison-early/", "title": "Abby Lee Miller May Get Out of Prison Early", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Abby Lee Miller has a new projected release date from prison, almost one full month prior to her original date, according to the Bureau of Prisons on Friday, March 16 \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Abby Lee Miller May Get Out of Prison Early", "description": "Abby Lee Miller has a new projected release date from prison, almost one full month prior to her original date, according to the Bureau of Prisons on Friday, March 16 \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/abby-lee-miller-may-get-out-of-prison-early/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-16T20:50:27+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/abbie-lee-miller.jpg?crop=154px%2C55px%2C1772px%2C929px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/abbie-lee-miller.jpg?crop=154px%2C55px%2C1772px%2C929px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-16T20:39:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-16T20:50:27+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Abby Lee Miller has a new projected release date from prison, almost one full month prior to her original date, according to the Bureau of Prisons on Friday, March 16 \u2014 details", "title": "Abby Lee Miller May Get Out of Prison Early", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/abbie-lee-miller.jpg?crop=154px%2C55px%2C1772px%2C929px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521232777.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
