Kevin Smith has given an update to fans on his health progress after he suffered a massive heart attack on Sunday.\n\nSmith tweeted to his fans on Wednesday to let them know that he is now out of the hospital, recovering back at home, and \u201cfeeling good,\u201d adding that he\u2019s turned vegetarian, presumably in a bid to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nThe 47-year-old writer/actor/director wrote: \u201cHome again, home again, jiggety-jig! Home is where the heart is and the heart is feeling good! It\u2019s actually getting more blood flow and oxygen than it has in a long time. So I am ALERT, to say the least! Thank you for all the kind words, folks - from Vegetarian Kev, Day 2!\u201d\n\nSmith had been scheduled to perform two shows at Glendale's Alex Theatre, one at 6 p.m. and another at 9, on Sunday, when he suffered a heart attack in between them, forcing him to cancel his show.\n\n\u201cAfter the first show this evening, I had a massive heart attack. The Doctor who saved my life told me I had 100% blockage of my LAD artery (aka \u201cthe Widow-Maker\u201d),\u201d Smith tweeted on Monday, while noting that had he not cancelled his shows, he would have died.\n\nThe Clerks director has been nothing but direct with his fans ever since he revealed the shocking news. On Tuesday, he posted a Facebook Live video, in which he spoke openly to fans for nearly 20 minutes as he recounted the details of his ordeal.\n\nSmith told fans that he never in a \u201cmillion years thought it was a heart attack,\u201d adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t piece together I was having a heart attack \u2026 even though my chest was heavy and even though my father died at the age of 67 died of a massive heart attack.\u201d\n\nHere's hoping Smith continues to get better, and keeps up with that diet.", "images": ["https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680_hero/public/wire/legacy/Kevin-Smith-Excited.jpg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/modules/custom/syfy_social/plugins/wysiwyg/social/images/social_loading.png", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/hamburger--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/close--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/watch--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/search--black.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/default-contributor.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/wire/legacy/Kevin-Smith-Excited.jpg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/icons/SYFYWire_Logo.svg", "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/themes/wired/assets/images/loading-spinner.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.syfy.com/sites/syfy/files/styles/1200x680/public/wire/legacy/Kevin-Smith-Excited.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["George Stark"], "canonical_link": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/kevin-smith-recovering-from-massive-heart-attack-at-home", "title": "Kevin Smith 'Feeling good!' and back home recovering after that massive heart attack", "meta_data": {"post_type": "syfywire_article", "fb": {"app_id": 795894437245434}, "drupal_parsely_version": "0.1", "description": "The comic book author tweeted his fans on Wednesday to let them know that he is now out of the hospital and recovering back at home and \u201cfeeling good\u201d, adding that he\u2019s turned vegetarian, presumably in a bid to maintain a healthy lifestyle.", "keywords": "kevin smith, kevin smith heart attack, clerks", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "SYFY WIRE", "url": "https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/kevin-smith-recovering-from-massive-heart-attack-at-home", "type": "article", "title": "Kevin Smith 'Feeling good!' and back home recovering after that massive heart attack", "description": "He\u2019s on the mend!
