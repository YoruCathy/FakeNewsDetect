But in Friday\u2019s episode, White Josh (David Hull), Nathaniel (Scott Michael Foster), and Josh Chan (Vincent Rodriguez III) perform a Magic Mike\u2013inspired send-up that pushes the joke to its funniest end yet. It\u2019s called \u201cFit Hot Guys Have Problems Too\u201d and it hits the sweet spot of funny, sexy, and sad.\n\nIn the episode, White Josh and Nathaniel form an unlikely pair after commiserating together over their recent breakups. In the spirit of bro-ing out, they decide to work out and then hit a gay club. \u201cWhiJo takes Nathaniel to a gay club because he\u2019s like, \u2018Gay bars are overrun with women from bachelorette parties appropriating gay culture for their own amusement!\u2019\u201d said David Hull, the actor who plays White Josh. Soon enough, they\u2019re jumping onstage and ripping off their shirts, determined to convince the world that it\u2019s a lot harder to be hot, fit, and handsome than it looks.\n\n\u201cIt used to be called \u2018Hot White Guys Have Problems Too,\u2019 which is obviously funny, but they decided to add Vinnie to it, so he comes in for the last chorus,\u201d Hull said. \u201cIt\u2019s now \u2018Fit Hot Guys Have Problems Too,\u2019 about how no one understands our struggle.\u201d\n\nThe production took place on location at a club in Hollywood that Scott Michael Foster said could only be described as a \u201cgoth bar.\u201d \u201cThere were chains everywhere, open books suspended on filament wires hanging from the ceiling, and evil shit everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI never understood it, but apparently it\u2019s a thing.\u201d The CXG crew packed the club with around 150 background actors and sent Hull, Foster, and Rodriguez to a spray tanner beforehand. \u201cWe just go to a stranger\u2019s house. She says, \u2018Jump in the shower and take your clothes off, I\u2019ll be in in a second and do as you\u2019re told!\u2019\u201d Hull said. \u201cI guess people are doing that all the time in this town. I gotta say, it looked great!\u201d\n\nEven though the shoot only took half a day, the trio took a lot longer getting their abs camera-ready. \u201cThey knew that they wanted to do a strip number from the beginning of the season, so they were like, \u2018Just know you\u2019re going to be shirtless and maybe pantless in episode nine,\u2019\u201d said Foster. \u201cI basically had about 12 weeks.\u201d That meant diets, trainers, and sadly for David Hull, cutting out most of his snacking.\n\nFor Vincent Rodriguez III, it was also a callback to his past as a go-go boy, working bars in Chicago and Provincetown while he was doing theater productions. \u201cI wasn\u2019t making that much money at the time. I had like five other jobs to help survive and pay my bills,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bartender, and I did the bartending episode. I\u2019ve been a go-go boy, and now I\u2019m doing a go-go boy episode. Art imitates life.\u201d\n\nUnlike Josh Chan, though, Rodriguez wasn\u2019t quite as successful a dancer. In P-town, he worked at a bar where he was paid only in tips. \u201cI think my lowest night was three hours of switching boxes with another dancer and I made two dollars. I\u2019ve been there, I\u2019ve done that,\u201d he said. \u201cThankfully [Josh] is better at it than I. He obviously made more money doing it. It wasn\u2019t something for me in my real life that I wanted to pursue. It was a way to make ends meet and basically pay for my art.\u201d\n\nBack on the CXG set, once it was all said and stripped away, showrunner Aline Brosh McKenna had pizza waiting for each actor when they wrapped for lunch. Foster also got a pack of Arrogant Bastard ale, and Rodriguez found a gift basket filled with chips, candy, and cookies waiting for him in his trailer. \u201cI said I would love to have a pizza waiting for me in my trailer the minute that scene ends. Because I had to shoot the rest of the day, but I had my clothes on, you know?\u201d said Foster. \u201cSo I had pizza at lunch, and then when we were done with the day I cracked a beer and it felt great.\u201d\n\nThat just leaves one question: Are they still hitting the gym after getting stripper bods? \u201cI\u2019ve gained a lot of weight since then,\u201d said Foster. \u201cI know Vinnie went hard and kept it up, which is good for him, but I was like, you know what? That\u2019s done. I want my pizza and my beer back. So I\u2019ve got my winter body in full swing.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/01/10/10-crazy-ex-girlfirend.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/301/897/ae47c6b103c2154007817f8408f36d2967-10-crazy-ex-girlfirend.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/301/897/ae47c6b103c2154007817f8408f36d2967-10-crazy-ex-girlfirend.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["E.
