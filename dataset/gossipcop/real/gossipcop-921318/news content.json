News. \u2018A lot can happen and it\u2019s important to unburden yourself with the things you just don\u2019t need anymore.\u2019\n\nBrendan added that he is also \u2018hopeful\u2019 (Picture: REX)\n\nHe added: \u2018I can go forward now and I feel good that I was inspired by others with courage and I was able to speak what I needed to say and it\u2019s a new time. It\u2019s a new era and I think some change that\u2019s good is going to come about. I\u2019m optimistic. I\u2019m hopeful.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, the Mummy actor claimed that Philip had left him feeling \u2018ill\u2019 after the alleged incident.\n\nHe told GQ magazine: \u2018His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.\u2019\n\nInitially overcome with fear, Fraser alleges he was eventually able to remove Berk\u2019s hand.\n\nHe said: \u2018I felt ill. I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry.\n\n\u2018I felt like someone had thrown invisible paint on me.\u2019\n\nFraser says Berk assaulted him (Photo: Michael Tran/FilmMagic)\n\nFraser said he rushed out of the hotel and passed a police officer on his way, but admitted he could not bring himself to report it.\n\nThe actor considered going public with the assault at the time, but decided against it as he did not want it to become \u2018part of [his] narrative\u2019.\n\nFraser\u2019s reps later wrote a letter to the HFPA demanding an apology for Berk\u2019s behaviour.\n\nBerk admitted he did write a letter to Fraser following the incident but insisted: \u2018My apology admitted no wrongdoing, the usual \u201cIf I\u2019ve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologise\u201d.\u2019\n\nHe also described Fraser\u2019s version of events as a \u2018fabrication\u2019.\n\nFraser starred in The Mummy with Rachel Weisz (Photo: YouTube)\n\nA hugely popular actor in the 1990s and the 2000s, Fraser has had a smaller public profile in recent years and said the incident with Berk made him become more reclusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFraser is not the first male actor to accuse a Hollywood heavyweight of sexual assault.\n\nBrooklyn Nine Nine actor Terry Crews filed a lawsuit against Adam Venit, the head of William Morris Endeavor\u2019s motion picture group after claiming Venit groped him at an industry event in 2006.\n\nVenit was given a 30-day suspension from WME after the accusations, which he strongly denies.\n\nGiving a statement to Metro.co.uk, the HFPA said they condemn all forms of sexual harassment and are currently investigating the claims.\n\n\u2018The HFPA stands firmly against sexual harassment and the type of behavior described in this article. Over the years we\u2019ve continued a positive working relationship with Brendan, which includes announcing Golden Globe nominees, attending the ceremony and participating in press conferences,\u2019 it read.\n\n\u2018This report includes alleged information that the HFPA was previously unaware of and at this time we are investigating further details surrounding the incident.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
