These cracks deepened at the dinner party which resulted in Jonathan exchanging numbers with Scarlett; the duo spent the night texting. At the first commitment ceremony, Cheryl claimed she did not wish to continue with Jonathan as \"he seemed more interested in someone else\". The duo called it quits at the commitment ceremony. Jonathan is now dating someone else.\n\nMichael & Scarlett [ edit ]\n\nThings started unraveling for the couple when Michael told Scarlett he would not move to meet her halfway between their current states. Since he was \"established\", and he thought because she was less tied down, she could move to him. From that point on they only saw each other as friends and nothing was going to happen as Scarlett was not Michael's dream girl. After the first commitment ceremony, the couple decided to go their different ways and later that night it came out that Scarlett and Jonathan (Cheryl's husband) had sent text messages to each other for hours the night before.\n\nNadia & Anthony [ edit ]\n\nAs of the last Commitment Ceremony, they decided to stay together. Anthony said that Nadia would have to move in order for him to provide for them both as he was in a \"niche market\". Nadia turned up to the reunion dinner alone, and when asked where Anthony was she confided that he had dumped her the day after filming had ended saying that \"his feelings weren't progressing\".\n\nSimon & Alene [ edit ]\n\nAs of the Final Commitment Ceremony before the Final Decision they had both decided to stay and said that they told everyone they had feelings for each other. They had decided to stay committed to each other after the experiment. They have since separated.\n\nAndy & Vanessa [ edit ]\n\nAt the Final Commitment Ceremony before the Final Decision they decided to stay, though the fact they may have to do have to have a long-distance relationship for a while before they decide what happens may be contentious in the long run. Despite this the couple have decided to stay together after the experiment. Andy and Vanessa subsequently broke up because of the difference in communication styles.\n\nLauren & Andrew [ edit ]\n\nOn the wedding night Lauren disappeared leaving Andrew unaware of her whereabouts. After a confrontation meeting, Lauren said she wanted to try again, but Andrew decided that he did not wish to continue the experiment with Lauren.[32] Andrew has since re-entered the experiment with hair salon manager Cheryl. A friend of Lauren's has since done an interview in which she said the reason Lauren ran away is because when she went out to a club with Andrew he started abusing a club bouncer who would not let them in because it was past 1:00 am.\n\nJohn & Deborah [ edit ]\n\nUpon meeting, Deborah initially expressed disappointment that John was not a Polynesian man or \"someone with culture\". As the series progressed, John and Deborah seemed to get on each other's nerves because John was simply everything she hated. During the honeymoon in Samoa they ended up sleeping in separate beds, and John removed his wedding ring which caused further tension between them. At the commitment ceremony Deborah wanted to give it another try so they ended up staying. The next day, however, John left the experiment saying: \"They wouldn't be anything but friends and that's not what he was there for\".\n\nMichelle & Jesse [ edit ]\n\nAs of the Final Commitment Ceremony they are still together, despite Michelle's doubts as to whether she sees Jesse more as a friend than her husband. In their Vow Renewal ceremony, Jesse told Michelle he wants to stay in the relationship, but Michelle revealed to him that she wants him in her life forever, but not as her partner; they are now broken up.[33]\n\nSharon & Nick [ edit ]\n\nAs of the Final Commitment Ceremony they have decided to stay, Nick even going so far as to say, \"That he would go anywhere as long as Sharon was by his side.\" Although the original plan was for Nick to move to Perth because of Sharon's cleaning business, Nick got news that his father has a medical condition so he is unable to leave his family as they would need his help. They have since broken up. Nick has renewed his membership at the strip club.\n\nCheryl & Andrew [ edit ]\n\nAfter Cheryl left the experiment following the Jonathan and Scarlett texting scandal, she spoke to the \"experts\" and asked if they could set up a date between Andrew and herself. They went on two dates before deciding they would re-enter the experiment together as an unmarried couple. This caused controversy around the table at the dinner party as she was at the dinner the week prior with Jonathan. Even though the couple originally had some sparks, they were thrown into the deep end of the experiment having to jump right into the home stays. Tensions began to rise when Andrew met Cheryl's abrasive father for the first time and it did not go well. Andrew felt Cheryl did not have his back against her bullying dad. He chose to leave while Cheryl chose to stay to see if the relationship could be salvaged.\n\nWhen the couples all had a family get together Cheryl and Andrew were put into an intense boot camp to see if John the expert could overhaul the bond they had. They decided to give it another go, but when the boys and girls night came about Andrew spent most of the night bagging out and putting down Cheryl, even going as far to say that his runaway bride, Lauren, \"was way more fun\". Some of the boys took offense to this, namely Sean and Simon, and even silently Andy. Sean and Susan told Cheryl about it the next day but when Cheryl confronted Andrew about it he got snarky and condescending, even going so far as to start mimicking Cheryl. Andrew and Cheryl chose to leave the experiment at the Final Commitment Ceremony after the video of the boys night was shown to the girls.\n\nSeason 5 (2018) [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2017, the season was renewed for a fifth season which began airing on 29 January 2018.[34] On 11 October 2017, the fifth season was officially confirmed at Nine's upfronts and again includes 11 couples like the previous season.

During the week Cyrell had a physical altercation with Martha, over a rumour that Nic had felt Jessika up under the table at the dinner party. This resulted in Cyrell and Nic spending the rest of the week in separate apartments. Together, they came together at the dinner party when Jessika pulled Nic aside to tell him that she found him attractive, this is met with rejection from Nic and he went back and sat with Cyrell. During the commitment ceremony, Cyrell again apologised for her behaviour towards Martha, but Nic decided to leave. Ultimately, Cyrell decided to stay so they are obliged to be together for at least another week. However, after Nic's shortened homestay with Cyrell, due to her brother kicking Nic out, and Cyrell blowing Jess' affair with Dan in the open to save Mick, they ultimately left the experiment during the 6th Commitment Ceremony, but on good terms. By the time of the final session, Cyrell was dating Eden Dally, runner up of Love Island Australia.[45]\n\n\n\nJessika & Mick\n\nJessika Power & Mick wed in episode 2 and have been together all the way until the current commitment ceremony, despite Jessika's flirting and kissing other men, and her lack of interest towards Mick. In the most recent episodes she has decided to stay in the experiment, much to the chagrin of Mick, in order to spend more time with Dan. He was also trapped because the \"Two Leaves set you free\" rule no longer applies. After the 6th ceremony, however, because Mick and Tamara no longer have the desire to stay in the experiment at all, he was granted early exit, while Jessika and Dan re-enter as a newly formed couple.\n\n\n\nDino & Melissa\n\nDino and Melissa have very different personalities. Particularly at the beginning, they had trouble communicating, often feeling as if they were each speaking different languages. Their relationship grew stronger during their trip in Gold Coast, however Dino admitted to recording Melissa's private conversation with her sister which caused a rift in the relationship. They both decided to leave the experiment after the phone issue came up.\n\nMark & Ning\n\nThis couple put barriers up as they have either been through something major previously or haven't had a strong intimate relationship prior. So they both needed their walls to be broken down in order for any sort of affection & trust to form. Ning also finds Mark's application of commando style of talking when they were in a gym disrespectful because Ning is not a customer, and is never a fan of exercising. However, both decided to stay in the 2nd re-commitment ceremony, and the \"experts\" put ultimatums to Ning that she can no longer threaten to leave, or pre-pack her bags during the week, which, at first, saved the relationship. However, they had little to no intimacy and when Jessika said that Mark would hang out with other girls at the end of the experiment, which saw Ning inconsolable and the walls back up. At the Final Vows, Ning saw that there was a future with Mark, but Mark saw otherwise, stating he \"Haven't found it with you\", which saw her shocked and saddened.\n\n\n\nMike & Heidi\n\nHeidi likes to talk about things in depth with Mike, who had previously never been in love. Both are confident people and they have a strong physical connection. However, Mike's tendency to give advice to people makes Heidi, who dwells on issues and has a needy personality, extremely uncomfortable. This came to a head at the third dinner party. John made Heidi attempt to provide advice for her hypothetical friend for role reversal, which helped them stay in the experiment. While the \"experts\" constantly criticize Heidi for sabotaging the relationship, Mike's selfish tendencies are mostly left unresolved. It came to a head in the final week, when Mike took Heidi on a talk sailboat again, when Heidi is not only prone to seasickness, but is also petrified of heights. But at the Final Vows, while they commit to each other, they have broken up by the time they were at reunion.\n\n\n\nSam & Elizabeth\n\nSam skipped out on the honeymoon and Elizabeth went missing for a period thereafter. The couple does not communicate well. Sam has always been upfront about having no attraction to Elizabeth whatsoever. While Elizabeth keeps cutting off Sam mid-sentence and seemingly starting arguments, Sam has barely any patience left and has been exhibiting a strange attitude in which he calls her crazy. Sam, who battled with chicken pox, found out after the fact that Elizabeth has been unwell and stayed in a hospital for week 2, while he only stayed on for the sake of fostering a relationship with Ines. They ended up having a secret affair that was exposed by events the rest of the group witnessed. Sam continued to lie about the extent of the relationship until the end of the experiment for them. Since Sam cannot commit to Ines, their affair was also over.\n\n\n\nLauren & Matthew\n\nMatthew began the experiment as the show's inexperienced virgin. Lauren felt a lot of responsibility to give Matthew a good experience. Ultimately, Lauren wanted Matthew to be physically more passionate and sexually adventurous with her. He didn't feel the urge to be a dominant partner in the bedroom, and concluded to himself that it must be because he is not attracted to Lauren. The couple received no counselling on the matter and their marriage deteriorated dramatically within a day. They were the first couple of the season to leave. It is later revealed on Morning Show that he has found a new girlfriend who shares more of his values.[46] This coincided with NZ airing of the episode when he broke up with Lauren.[47]\n\n\n\nBronson & Ines\n\nInes didn't seem attracted to Bronson from the beginning, although Bronson was patient and giving her time to build a relationship. It became clear they were not getting along, so the \"experts\" put them in separate rooms. Ines apparently was attracted to Sam, and professed to being attracted to him. She said she stayed in the experiment merely to stay close to Sam. Ines then pursued an affair with Sam, and spent the night with him while Elizabeth was away due to an unspecified illness. Bronson was left completely in the dark until Sam blew the cover wide open at the third commitment ceremony. Ines continued to lie about the affair until the end of the experiment, which upset Cyrell enough to confront her. On 26 March 2019, it was revealed that Ines Ba\u0161i\u0107 was sent to court for drink driving and has been charged.[48]\n\n\n\nMichael & Martha\n\nMartha had uprooted and started her career in Bondi, Sydney, when she was originally bred in Melbourne. Her guarded attitude also made it difficult for the relationship with Michael to progress. Michael's good-guy image initially threw Martha off as being as disingenuous as her personality. And throughout the whole experiment, Martha has also helped Jess stray knowing that it helps her camera time. When they returned to Michael's school, where he teaches PE, she realizes that he is a genuinely nice person. At the week before Final Vow, Martha's reluctance to return to Melbourne eventually convinced Michael to also address the logistical and her attitude issues and not commit to the relationship, but he eventually recommitted and is willing to move to Bondi.\n\n\n\nSusie & Billy\n\nOne of two \u201cintruder\u201d couples, Susie & Billy met & wed in Sydney in episode 18. Susie is a solo mother of Hungarian descent, but her disapproval of Billy's sensitive and gentlemanly ways, turned him into a victim of bullying. Though they chose to stay after the first week, the issue remains unresolved in their second week, when the couple returns to Billy's hometown. It still wasn't resolved a week later, which saw Billy walk out on her in the second day of the wife's homestay, where he walked out on his lunch with her friends. These events was enough for both of them to leave the experiment at the 6th Commitment Ceremony. Susie later revealed on Instagram that she is in a relationship with Todd Carney.\n\n\n\nDan & Tamara\n\nOne of two \u201cintruder\u201d couples, Dan & Tamara met and wed in Sydney in episode 18. Dan is a single father, and Tamara lost her mother. Their honeymoon coincided with the three-year anniversary of her mother's passing. At a recent dinner party, Dan was hit on by Jessika, and they engaged in kissing and deciding to stay in the experiment in order to spend more time together.\n\n\n\nDan & Jessika\n\n\n\nDan's grand entrance into the experiment as an intruder caught the eye of Jessika, the \"wife\" of contestant Mick Gould. Dan reciprocated his feelings for Jess and their feelings blossomed. Over the following weeks, Jess and Dan rendezvoused numerous times, including sneaking away for brief periods of time at the Dinner parties, to exchange their feelings and a passionate kiss. Days before the week 8 commitment ceremony, Dan told Jess that they needed to tell the group how they felt. The commitment ceremony saw Mick Gould devastated, not because of the pair becoming an item, but because of the betrayal, mistrust and a blatant waste of his time. Tamara, Dan's \"wife\" also expressed her feelings for the situation, explaining that even though she felt up until this point that her and Dan were friends, she was shattered that he wasn't honest with her from the start.\n\n\n\nDan and Jessika requested that they be allowed to stay in the experiment by re-entering as a couple; and with much deliberation of the \"experts\" and expressed dismay of the other contestants, were allowed to stay, with expert John Aitken advising the pair that they should spend the following week really seriously investigating whether their blossoming relationship will work in the real world.\n\n\n\nDespite their shared interests and physical attraction, their biggest obstacle, other than opinions of other couples and their respective families (families of the couples have a shared lunch in the couples' apartments), is the distance between them outside the experiment, as Dan (Gold Coast, QLD, same state as Mick (Gympie, QLD) and Jessika (Perth, WA) are from opposite ends of Australia. By the time they were at the reunion, Jess has already moved to Gold Coast. However, the night after the reunion dinner party, Dan found out about Jess and Nic's secret meeting. They have since separated.\n\nSeason 7 (2020) [ edit ]\n\nIn the first episode, the first two couples (Poppy & Luke, Cathy & Josh) met and wed in Bilpin and Wyong Creek.

This was before the first commitment ceremony and the first dinner party. Although some evidence has come out that Poppy may not have been happy with the editing and the way that they have both been portrayed.\n\n\n\nJosh & Cathy\n\n\n\nIt seemed that Josh and Cathy might have been the \"IT' couple of the season, the first few weeks the couple went from strength to strength, though that seemed to end after a dinner party when Cathy was being frank with Josh about her jealousy (to do with him talking with Hayley), though she said that it was irrational, he decided that if she had trust issues then he might as well write Leave. Though they seemed to get over it, this seemed to be a difference in the next few weeks, especially after Josh threw Cathy under the bus with his mum during the \"Meet the Parents week\" and again during the \"Groom\u2019s homestay\".\n\n\n\nAmanda & Tash\n\nAmanda & Tash are the first female same-sex couple on the series since gay marriage was recognised in Australia. After some initial chemistry at the wedding, Tash realised that she had moved too fast and tried to put on the brakes, much to the chagrin of Amanda. After the honeymoon, the girls moved into an apartment and immediately they had an argument about Tash's lack of intimacy. Tash moved into a different apartment and went into the dinner party separately from Amanda, but it seemed that they were mending the relationship when they both decided to stay in the first commitment ceremony. They have both since aired their differences and decided to go their separate ways by leaving at the second commitment ceremony.\n\n\n\nNatasha & Mikey\n\n\n\nNatasha and Mikey seemed to have fun during Intimacy Week, though a comment that Natasha said to Michael at the dinner party involving Mikey offended him and for the next commitment ceremony, Mikey wrote leave. Natasha wrote stay which meant that they had another week to try to rebuild their relationship. At the end of the week the couple decided to leave the experiment as friends, the \"experts\" also seemed to commend the couple on the grown-up decision that they had made.\n\n\n\nHayley & David\n\n\n\nHayley and David seemed to have a rocky start during the honeymoon, but it all came to a head at the first commitment ceremony, when they yelled and screamed on the couch, though it seems during intimacy week that they decided to follow the \"experts\"\u2019 comments about moving forward and letting go of the past. It seems that they managed to go from zero to 100. After the decent week that they had, there was an incident where Hayley went out with Michael, Chris and Vanessa, between Michael and Hayley that David found out about later that night. To get revenge, he took Hayley's toothbrush and used it to clean the toilet (while filming it) and sent it to one of the boys.[50][51] They have since left after the \"experts\" vetoed Hayley's stay saying that they are \"not in the main point of the experiment\".\n\n\n\nVanessa & Chris\n\n\n\nVanessa is very self-conscious of her skin due to her acne. Chris is very laid-back and chill. Although the pair cruised through the first two weeks of the experiment, they ran into some problems. Vanessa felt like Chris was not attracted to her as he showed her no affection. When their parents and friends came to visit the pair, Vanessa realized she could no longer stay in the experiment with someone who didn't give her what she wanted, so she left the experiment, making Chris have to leave, too. Chris later said in a confessional that he was attracted to Vanessa. It was rumoured that the pair were kicked off the experiment due to Vanessa threatening Nine Network over the working conditions in the show as well as Vanessa's mental status. Neither rumour has been confirmed or denied.\n\n\n\nConnie & Jonethen\n\n\n\nConnie and Jonethen has a shy start to the honeymoon, both physically attracted to each other but both hesitant to finally make the first kiss a reality.\n\nAfter moving in together, Connie develops a problem with Jonethen's mobile phone and Instagram usage. She chose to implement a \u2018no phones rule\u2019 between them during Intimacy week to try and curb his usage.\n\nThe couple begin to have some communication issues, where Jonethen begins to give Connie mixed signals of his feelings towards her. Jonethen says that he is \u2018not attracted to Connie but finds her attractive\u2019, and that she ticks a lot of boxes \u201con paper\u201d to him.\n\nConnie chooses to \u2018leave\u2019 as a result, but Jonethen desires to \u2018stay\u2019, thinking the stay at home weeks will help get some feelings moving.\n\nJonethen has since said \u2018leave\u2019 three times in a row in the last weeks of the experiment and Connie continues to stay, with a glimmer of hope.\n\n\n\nAleks & Ivan\n\n\n\nIvan and Aleks seemed to go from strength to strength, but it seemed all too much after it came out that she had dinner with another person outside of the experiment. It seems that the gentleman was the owner of the restaurant that Aleks went to with a girlfriend. They both left the dinner party early and slept in separate rooms. It seems that they exited the experiment before the next commitment ceremony, without saying goodbye to everyone. At the reunion dinner party, both stated that they were together despite the fact that they had broken up. During their final talk with the experts, they said that they loved each other and couldn't live without each other. After the episode air, Aleks took to Instagram to state that her and Aleks had amicably broken up sometime in February.\n\n\n\nMishel & Steve\n\n\n\nMishel and Steve seemed to have one of the best honeymoons of the lot, though it seems the relationship fell short during the move in for Intimacy Week. During the dinner party, Steve seemed to show his true colours when he spent the entire end of the night shutting down Mishel, to which others of the group came to her defence. During the commitment ceremony, Mishel decided to write leave while Steve decided to stay. The \"experts\" have told them that they need to be more intimate with each other, but the end of the dinner parties they seemed like they were going to write leave but, they have both decided to stay.\n\n\n\nStacey & Michael\n\n\n\nStacey and Michael got off to a rocky start on their wedding day since Stacey stated she wasn't attracted to Michael physically. She was cold to him all evening until she learned Michael was wealthy. During their honeymoon, Michael went out for drinks late at night and left Stacey alone. When morning came, Michael had left to go for a run with the guys he had gone for drinks with. This led to a fight between the two that was then resolved and the two were intimate for the first time. A couple of weeks later, there was a cheating scandal between Michael and Hayley. Hayley said that the two had kissed and that there were witnesses to this. The witnesses, Chris and Vanessa, had left the experiment before the allegations came out, so this debacle was not easily resolved. Everyone seemed to believe Hayley since she seemed to be feeling guilty about what had transpired. Stacey, however, refused to believe Hayley because there was no proof of it happening. Michael said that he does not remember kissing Hayley, but then apologized to Stacey as he was not 100% sure of what had happened that night. In the next week, the two had rekindled again and had even told one another they loved each other. The two were becoming closer and closer as the weeks went on. At the guys' reunion party, Ivan had stated that he knew something that could break the two up, but was going to refrain from saying anything as it was not his truth to tell. At the final commitment ceremony, where every participant of the season was present, Vanessa told everyone that Mikey (her then-\"husband\") and Stacey had a one-night-stand. Stacey seemed shocked by the allegations and began stating that they were not true. Mikey then went on to bring proof of messages that the two had shared which lightly alluded to the two coupling up. These allegations were backed up by Aleks and Ivan since the one-night-stand had happened at their apartment. Stacey was visibly shocked at the allegations and said that Mikey had to be obsessed with her because she had not hooked up with him. Michael then told the camera that if she had cheated and told the truth then he could forgive her, but if she was lying, then he could not. The two are now broken up, seemingly from Stacey's cheating allegation. Micheal and KC are officially in a relationship after filming of the MAFS reunion.\n\nElizabeth & Seb\n\n\n\nElizabeth is back again for another season of MAFS. This season, she is paired up with Seb. The couple is very attracted and intimate towards one another. However, it seems that Liz's parents think that Seb lacks career direction and ambition as he had quit two university degrees in their second year and hadn't chosen a set career path. As a result, they fear that Seb cannot support Liz financially. Liz's high regard for her parents\u2019 opinions cause her to remain hopeful that they will begin approving of Seb, fearing she couldn't live with a partner her parents disapproved of.\n\nDespite this, they are still intimate with each other and enjoy each other's company.\n\nKC & Drew\n\n\n\nThere seems to be some early disdain but they managed to turn a leaf, and they have decided to restart the relationship to see if they can get off on the right foot with each other. KC and Micheal are officially in a relationship after filming of the MAFS reunion.\n\n\n\nViewership [ edit ]\n\nSeason ratings [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired Preliminary Consolidated Season premiere Season finale Average viewers Average rank Average viewers Average rank 1 6 18 May 2015 22 June 2015 1.115 #4 1.195 #3 2 7 4 April 2016 27 April 2016 0.915 #7 0.999 #6 3 8 29 August 2016 13 September 2016 0.880 #7 0.970 #5 4 29 30 January 2017 3 April 2017 1.081 #3 1.186 #2 5 32 29 January 2018 21 March 2018 1.223 #1 1.328 #1 6 41 28 January 2019 8 April 2019 1.323 #1 1.432 #1 7 36 3 February 2020 5 April 2020\n\nSeason 1 (2015) [ edit ]\n\nNo. Title Air date Overnight ratings Consolidated ratings Total\n\nviewers Ref(s) Viewers Rank Viewers Rank 1 Episode 1 18 May 2015 1,134,000 5 65,000 2 1,199,000 [52][53] 2 Episode 2 25 May 2015 1,103,000 4 77,000 2 1,180,000 [54][55] 3 Episode 3 1 June 2015 1,116,000 3 84,000 3 1,200,000 [56][57] 4 Episode 4 8 June 2015 971,000 7 99,000 6 1,070,000 [58][59] 5 Episode 5 15 June 2015 1,079,000 3 85,000 2 1,164,000 [60][61] 6 Episode 6 22 June 2015 1,290,000 1 71,000 1 1,361,000 [62][63]\n\nSeason 2 (2016) [ edit ]\n\nNo. Title Air date Overnight ratings Consolidated ratings Total\n\nviewers Ref(s) Viewers Rank Viewers Rank 1 Episode 1 4 April 2016 771,000 13 86,000 9 857,000 [64][65] 2 Episode 2 5 April 2016 905,000 6 91,000 5 996,000 [66][67] 3 Episode 3 11 April 2016 874,000 8 62,000 7 936,000 [68][69] 4 Episode 4 12 April 2016 880,000 8 85,000 6 965,000 [70][71] 5 Episode 5 18 April 2016 899,000 6 122,000 7 1,021,000 [72][73] 6 Episode 6 19 April 2016 831,000 9 93,000 8 924,000 [74][75] 7 Finale 27 April 2016 1,048,000 4 66,000 2 1,114,000 [76][77] 7 Finale -

Channel 9 admitted that participants would not actually marry. A spokesman said \"In order to comply with the Australian Marriage Act (1961) which requires one month and one day notification, a marriage in law was not conducted. Each participant embarked on a commitment ceremony with a wedding celebrant with all due intention to commit fully to this union for the duration of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, they are given the option to continue with the relationship or go their separate ways\".[370]\n\nSecond season participant Simone Lee Brennan described the program as \"never [being] portrayed to its full authenticity,\" suggesting the man she had been paired with, Xavier Forsberg, had been recruited by producers and was seeking a sports-presenting role, rather than an applicant also looking for a relationship.[371]\n\nIn the sixth season, the \"experts\" had to decide on a controversial request from Jessika Power to stay in the experiment with Dan Webb. The couple asked to stay in the experiment as another couple by leaving their \"spouses\" from the initial phases of the experiment. Controversy surrounded the \"experts\" who allowed the couple to stay in the experiment, even though there was evidence and admission that they were cheating on their spouses. An online petition garnered thousands of votes to have the show cancelled.[43]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nBroadcasters [ edit ]\n\nIn Belgium the show is broadcast as Blind getrouwd - Australia and runs every weekday on a Flemish channel called Vitaya.\n\nIn Spain, the show is broadcast as Casados a ciegas and runs every weekday from 6:15 pm for three hours each day on TEN.[372]\n\nIn New Zealand, the show is broadcast on Three and screens Sunday 7pm - 8.30pm, Monday 7.30 - 9.05pm, Tuesday 7.30pm - 9.05pm and Wednesday 7.30pm - 9.05pm.
