When I tell you I'm Bridget Jones in an Essex girl it's finally confirmed. Best and worse moment for me.\"\n\n\"Guys it's OK I'm alive I've always said I'm like Bridget Jones.\"\n\nFans posted supportive messages and comments on social media, including Professor Green.\n\nHe shared a picture of Collins on Instagram and wrote: \"You fell on stage, I fell off one. You are my spirit animal, now, forever and always.\"\n\nRita Ora also shared a message of support on the Newsbeat Twitter feed.\n\nCheck out all the videos and photos from Radio 1's Teen Awards as well as all the backstage interviews.\n\nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat", "images": ["http://static.bbci.co.uk/frameworks/barlesque/5.0.0/orb/4/img/bbc-blocks-dark.png", "http://stats.bbc.co.uk/o.gif?~RS~s~RS~News~RS~t~RS~HighWeb_Story~RS~i~RS~41718536~RS~p~RS~102337~RS~a~RS~Domestic~RS~u~RS~/newsbeat/41718536~RS~r~RS~0~RS~q~RS~0~RS~z~RS~2539~RS~", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/mcs/media/images/53670000/jpg/_53670292_miss_elliot.jpg", "https://sa.bbc.co.uk/bbc/bbc/s?name=frameworks.barlesque.orb.webservice.json.page&ml_name=webmodule&ml_version=-1&blq_js_enabled=0&blq_s=4d&blq_r=2.7&blq_v=default&blq_e=pal&pal_route=webserviceapi&app_type=responsive&language=en-GB&pal_webapp=barlesque&prod_name=frameworks&app_name=frameworks", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/3301/production/_85975031_selena.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/11B0/production/_89782540_dogtoyfight.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17986528&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1711C/production/_98429449_pa_collins.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/AA35/production/_83937534_gettyimages-470374415.jpg", "http://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name=", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/780/cpsprodpb/10890/production/_97782776_gettyimages-844373656.jpg", "http://static.bbci.co.uk/frameworks/barlesque/5.0.0/orb/4/img/orb-search-dark.png", "http://news.files.bbci.co.uk/newsbeat/newsbeat-composition/313/sprites/BBC_Newsbeat_Small.gif", "http://news.files.bbci.co.uk/newsbeat/newsbeat-composition/313/sprites/BBC_Newsbeat_Large.gif"], "top_img": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1711C/production/_98429449_pa_collins.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Gemma Collins 'feels like Bridget Jones' after falling at the Radio 1 Teen Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 100004154058350}, "description": "Exclusive music news, big interviews, entertainment, social media trends and video from the news people at BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra.", "theme-color": "#000", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=999362879", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "BBC Newsbeat", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BBCNewsbeat", "creator": "@BBCNews", "domain": "www.bbc.co.uk", "title": "Gemma Collins 'feels like Bridget Jones' after falling at the Radio 1 Teen Awards", "description": "Gemma Collins has joked that she felt like Bridget Jones after slipping and falling through a trapdoor on stage at the Radio 1 Teen Awards.", "image": {"src": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1711C/production/_98429449_pa_collins.jpg"}}, "og": {"title": "Gemma Collins 'feels like Bridget Jones' after falling at the Radio 1 Teen Awards", "type": "article", "description": "Gemma Collins has joked that she felt like Bridget Jones after slipping and falling through a trapdoor on stage at the Radio 1 Teen Awards.", "image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1711C/production/_98429449_pa_collins.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.bbc.co.uk", "summary": ""}
