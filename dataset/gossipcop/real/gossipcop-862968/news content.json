In one picture, she swings her daughter by the arms. In another, she pats her on the head while holding her infant son Theodore.\n\nMuch has been made of Ivanka Trump\u2019s picture-perfect aesthetics - and apparently that extends to her kids, too.\n\nTrump and Kushner\u2019s brood was also singled out for their cute looks, when they appeared in public during the recent Jewish holiday of Shavuot. The dynamic is reminiscent of the Kennedy White House - when young Jack, Jr. and Caroline lived in the executive mansion.\n\nSome have questioned whether Ivanka is oversharing images of her children \u2014 and potentially exposing them to unwanted scrutiny.\n\nContact Daniel J.
