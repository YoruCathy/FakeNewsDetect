It recounted the experiences she had with Kercher while the two were living together in Perugia, Italy.\n\n\u201cWhen I look back on my memories of Meredith, what I find are beautiful, banal moments we shared in the weeks we lived side-by-side,\u201d Knox wrote.\n\nKnox recounted the times she and Kercher would carry groceries back to their apartment, drink espressos and watch television.\n\n\u201cAnd I remember the last time I saw her, ten years ago today, slinging her purse over her shoulder and waving goodbye to me on her way out to meet up with her British friends,\u201d Knox wrote.\n\nKnox\u2019s letter then took a dark turn when she mentioned her friend\u2019s brutal murder.\n\nITALY\u2019S HIGHEST COURT ACQUITS AMANDA KNOX OF KILLING ROOMMATE\n\n\u201cMy memories of Meredith are buried beneath the horrific autopsy photos and crime scene footage I saw, the slurs I was called, the death threats I received (and still receive), the false accusations I fought, the years of wrongful imprisonment I endured, the multiple trials and slanderous headlines that juxtaposed our names and faces, unfairly interlocking her death with my identity,\u201d Knox wrote.\n\nOn Nov. 2, 2007 Kercher, 21, was found murdered in the apartment she shared with Knox and two other students. Her throat was slashed and she had been sexually assaulted.\n\nKnox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were arrested a few days later along with Rude Guede, an Ivory Coast native raised in Perugia. Guede was convicted of murder in a separate trial and is serving a 16-year sentence.\n\nKnox, dubbed Foxy Knoxy by the international media, and Sollecito were convicted, acquitted, and convicted in three different highly publicized trials. Knox was found guilty in 2009 but acquitted and freed in 2011 after spending nearly four years in prison.\n\nKnox returned to her hometown of Seattle following the acquittal but was then tried and convicted in absentia and ordered a new appeals trial in 2014. In 2015, Italy\u2019s highest court acquitted Knox of murder, ending the drawn-out legal saga.\n\nAMANDA KNOX\u2019S EX-BOYFRIEND SUING JUDGES AND JURY OVER WRONGFUL CONVICTION\n\nKnox noted in her tribute that some people believe she \u201chas no right to mourn Meredith.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey believe that I had something to do with her murder \u2013 I didn't \u2013 or that Meredith has been forgotten in the wake of my own struggle for justice \u2013 she hasn't,\u201d Knox said.\n\nKnox concluded that Kercher\u2019s murder changed her life because \u201cinnocent people suffer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all driven to do something about it\u2014to speak out against unrepentant killers or incompetent and cruel prosecutors\u2014even though no one can ever give Meredith back her life, or me the years of life I lost to wrongful imprisonment,\u201d Knox wrote.\n\n\u201cI hate it that my memories of her are buried beneath the years of suffering Raffaele and I endured in the wake of her murder. And it\u2019s depressing to know that mourning her comes at the price of being criticized for anything I say or don\u2019t say today. But most depressing of all is that Meredith isn\u2019t here, when she deserves to be. She is painfully missed by everyone who loved her. I miss her, and I\u2019m grateful for the memories of our time together,\u201d Knox concluded.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/young-knox.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/746869b9-amanda-knox.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/rafael.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/270/152/rts1qimg.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/270/152/f13eb90d-image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-news-first.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/OKCBombing041920.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/e019f283-laura-kelly.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/746869b9-amanda-knox.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/746869b9-amanda-knox.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/amanda-knox-pens-tribute-to-meredith-kercher-on-10th-anniversary-of-her-gruesome-death", "title": "Amanda Knox pens tribute to Meredith Kercher on 10th anniversary of her gruesome death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Amanda Knox penned a tribute to her roommate Meredith Kercher on the tenth anniversary of her brutal murder in Italy.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "us", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Amanda Knox pens tribute to Meredith Kercher on 10th anniversary of her gruesome death", "dcterms.abstract": "Amanda Knox penned a tribute to her roommate Meredith Kercher on the tenth anniversary of her brutal murder in Italy.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Amanda Knox penned a tribute to her roommate Meredith Kercher on the tenth anniversary of her brutal murder in Italy.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:5d294047-5ade-5ffc-8908-07b4308d97a9", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-11-03", "dcterms.created": "2017-11-03T08:39:25-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-11-03T11:39:16-04:00", "og": {"title": "Amanda Knox pens tribute to Meredith Kercher on 10th anniversary of her gruesome death", "description": "Amanda Knox penned a tribute to her roommate Meredith Kercher on the tenth anniversary of her brutal murder in Italy.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/746869b9-amanda-knox.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/amanda-knox-pens-tribute-to-meredith-kercher-on-10th-anniversary-of-her-gruesome-death", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Amanda Knox pens tribute to Meredith Kercher on 10th anniversary of her gruesome death", "description": "Amanda Knox penned a tribute to her roommate Meredith Kercher on the tenth anniversary of her brutal murder in Italy.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/746869b9-amanda-knox.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/amanda-knox-pens-tribute-to-meredith-kercher-on-10th-anniversary-of-her-gruesome-death"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/Crime,/FOX NEWS/US,/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Europe", "classification-isa": "crime,us,europe"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
