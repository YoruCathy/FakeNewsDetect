I hope you are too, can't wait to see you, can't wait to see them,\" the singer added.\n\nThe 51-date tour starts in America in May before finishing up in New Zealand in November.\n\nBoth Charli and Camila will perform every night of the tour.\n\nMinutes after the news was out, Charli XCX, well known for her cheeky lyrics and antics, volunteered to be the \"bad influence\" during the get together.\n\nHowever, if Camila Cabello's reaction is anything to go by, there'll be as much play as work involved.\n\n\"On every level, this is a dream come true,\" Camila wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"As a fan, I'm going to be singing every song at the top of my lungs. As a friend, it's a GIANT SLEEPOVER.\"\n\nJoining Taylor Swift on tour should only increase Camila Cabello's status as one of the planet's rising stars.\n\nAfter splitting from Fifth Harmony in December 2016, her self-titled album - Camila - was released in January 2018.\n\nIt featured the hits Havana and Never Be the Same.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Camila Cabello at the 2018 BRIT Awards in London\n\nTickets for Taylor Swift's Reputation Tour were already in super high demand, so much so she was forced to add extra dates.\n\nBut the 28-year-old still has some way to go to top her 2015 effort, The 1989 Tour.\n\nIt was one of the highest-grossing tours of that year with worldwide ticket sales estimated at more than $250m (\u00a3187m).\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Taylor Swift and Ryan Tedder perform onstage during The 1989 World Tour\n\nThe tour will also be remembered for Taylor Swift regularly brining out celebs - often from the city or area where the concert was being held.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Taylor Swift is joined onstage by actor Matt LeBlanc, comedian Chris Rock and actor Sean O'Pry\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Taylor Swift and Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Kobe Bryant\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/770A/production/_100247403_gettyimages-484816746-1.jpg", "https://a1.api.bbc.co.uk/hit.xiti?&col=1&from=p&ptag=js&s=598253&p=newsbeat::news.newsbeat.story.43256308.page&x1=[urn:bbc:cps:edb0941b-b8fe-f841-a8a0-6273cb560ef6]&x2=[responsive]&x3=[bbc_website]&x4=[en]&x7=[article]&x8=[reverb-1.4.0-nojs]&x11=[NEWS_GNL]&x12=[NEWS]", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/770A/production/_100247403_gettyimages-484816746-1.jpg", "https://ssc.api.bbc.com/?c1=2&c2=19293874&ns_site=bbc&name="], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/770A/production/_100247403_gettyimages-484816746-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43256308", "title": "Taylor Swift says Camila Cabello and Charli XCX will tour with her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 51-date tour starts in America in May before finishing up in New Zealand in November.", "x-country": "hk", "x-audience": "Asia", "CPS_AUDIENCE": "Asia", "CPS_CHANGEQUEUEID": 117043336, "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift reveals tour support acts", "type": "article", "description": "The 51-date tour starts in America in May before finishing up in New Zealand in November.", "site_name": "BBC News", "locale": "en_GB", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-43256308", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/770A/production/_100247403_gettyimages-484816746-1.jpg", "alt": "BBC News.
