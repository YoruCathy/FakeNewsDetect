Chelsea Houska's baby daddy was arrested in the early hours of Memorial Day for allegedly violating a stalking protection order against him and he is expected in court today, May 29.\n\nAccording to the inmate listing report obtained by Radar Online, Adam was charged with \"violation of a stalking protection order,\" \"violation of protection or no contact order,\" and \u201cnon-support of a minor child.\" However, it is unclear who specifically the charges pertain to.\n\nTwo years ago, his ex-girlfriend Brooke Beaton filed a restraining order against him, and he has been in trouble in the past for reportedly stalking her. Last year, Adam was arrested for domestic violence against his ex-girlfriend Stasia Huber. He was arrested again weeks later for violating a no-contact order. \"While under the influence of drugs, alcohol, and steroids, he fractured my forearm, locked me in the house saying I couldn\u2019t leave, smashed my phone and once he realized what he had done, he broke down crying and took me to the ER,\" Stasia claimed in court documents. \"We broke up for a while after that.\"\n\nMore recently, Adam lost custody of his daughter Aubree and a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to make several child support payments to his second baby mama Taylor Halbur. Despite a judge denying visitation with Aubree, Adam came over while his eight-year-old daughter was with her grandparents \u2014 and Chelsea was furious.\n\n\"Chelsea let his parents have her for a couple of hours. It wasn't their time to have her,\" a source told Radar Online. \"[Chelsea is] livid and won't do that anymore. These grandparents haven't learned a d\u2013n thing. [One] can definitely tell where Adam gets the rules and law don't apply to him attitude.\"\n\nLove Teen Mom?
