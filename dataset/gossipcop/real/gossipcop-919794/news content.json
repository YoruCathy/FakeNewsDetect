The star recently tried her hand at singing in a hilarious new segment for Live with Kelly and Ryan where she tried her hand at becoming the next Carrie Underwood or Kelly Clarkson.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Today\u2019s Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford after they auditioned for The Voice, E! News reported that Ripa headed to the American Idol audition room to show off her vocal skills in a new clip, performing for judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Katy Perry.\n\nThe hilarious clip shows Ripa giving her best singing performance for the trio as she joked before heading into the room, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve mentally prepared for what I have to offer\u201d after claiming on the March 9 episode of Live that she has \u201cthe voice of an angel.\u201d\n\nAfter getting a pep talk from her Live co-host, who\u2019s also presented American Idol since it first began back in 2002, Ripa made her way to audition and even asked Lionel to hold up her lyrics on a huge board so she didn\u2019t forget the words.\n\nThe star then launched into a unique performance of Peggy Lee\u2019s \u201cWhy Don\u2019t You Do Right?\u201d as the judges watched on.\n\nFollowing her audition, Katy told Kelly that she thought her performance was \u201cdifferent\u201d as Lionel awkwardly complimented the host on how she connected with the words of the song.\n\nOther comments from the new trio of judges included describing Ripa\u2019s audition as \u201cspecial,\u201d \u201cspunky,\u201d and \u201cinteresting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to describe it, so I\u2019m just going to leave it at that,\u201d Katy then told Kelly after seeing her American Idol Season 16 audition.\n\nFeatured image credit: Michael Loccisano Getty Images\n\nBut while it\u2019s safe to say that her American Idol audition inspired some mixed and confused reactions, Kelly did in fact land herself a golden ticket as the judges uttered the show\u2019s infamous line by telling the star that she was \u201cgoing to Hollywood.\u201d Ryan \u2013 who Kelly recently defended amid an allegation of sexual misconduct \u2013 then celebrated his co-host\u2019s big win with the crew outside the audition room.\n\nBut while Ripa probably won\u2019t be taking her singing career much further despite making it through to the next round, the morning host has made no secret of her love of the competition show in the past.\n\nBack in May 2017, Ripa urged Seacrest to return as the show\u2019s host after it was announced that the series would be returning to TV after leaving Fox in 2016.\n\nSpeaking about the series\u2019 much-anticipated return before it was confirmed that Ryan would be taking back his hosting duties, Variety reported that Kelly joked on Live with Kelly and Ryan that she went into seclusion after it was announced that the show had been canceled because she was such a fan.\n\nShe then urged Ryan to return to the show shortly before ABC confirmed that the star would be back to his former role.\n\nAmerican Idol is set to debut its very first season on ABC, its 16th season overall, on March 11.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04740ca59ff3a7ed6178872d42206b16?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kelly-Ripa-auditions-for-American-Idol-ahead-of-Season-16.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Watch-Kelly-Ripa-Hilariously-Audition-For-American-Idol.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Hutchinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4820883/watch-kelly-ripa-hilariously-audition-for-american-idol/", "title": "Watch Kelly Ripa Hilariously Audition For \u2018American Idol\u2019", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ys3SzShSCNc?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
