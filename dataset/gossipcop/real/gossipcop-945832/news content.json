Power of the \u2026\u201c\n\nAnd we\u2019re cutting it off right there due to Kristin\u2019s, um, colorful language.\n\nOh my goodness, does K-Cav swear like a boss \u2014 a mob boss \u2014 in this episode. At times she drops the f-bomb with more frequency than Joe Pesci in a Scorsese film.\n\nThe steady shower of expletives turns into a thunderstorm on the morning after the store\u2019s grand opening party, when Kristin discovers social media director Shannon has made some grievous errors on the website.\n\nShe calls store manager Brittainy and says: \u201cI\u2019m about to lose my f\u2014ing mind. \u2026 F\u2014ing A. \u2026 Everything is f\u2014ing hitting the fan!\u201d\n\nWhen Kristin arrives at the store and asks about a problem with a link, Shannon says, \u201cI don\u2019t have the link if I don\u2019t know the link.\u201d\n\nKristin: \u201cWell then ask someone for the f\u2014ing link!\u201d\n\nAnd then:\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a f\u2014ing collection launch, this was a whole new line! \u2026 It got completely f\u2014-ed. \u2026 That s\u2014 can\u2019t keep happening \u2014 DON\u2019T ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME SHANNON, this is f\u2014ing real, this is all real! So don\u2019t roll your eyes at me, this is a big f\u2014ing deal.\u201d\n\nShannon starts to cry.\n\nK-Cav: \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re crying, I\u2019m glad you give a f\u2014. This is my whole f\u2014ing world right now. And it got f\u2014ed this morning.\u201d\n\nLike. A. Boss.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to the Grand Opening bash.\n\n\u201cI think the store looks great!\u201d says Reagan, the sunny office assistant. \u201cMy balloons look amazing.\u201d\n\nNo argument here. Excellent balloon work, Reagan.\n\nOf course there\u2019s drama, starting with the caterer failing to show up because she thought the party was the next day. Call me cynical, but that seems a little contrived. Are we to believe someone given the plum assignment of catering a party for a famous reality TV star \u2014 a party where the cameras will be rolling \u2014 would somehow get the date wrong?\n\nAnyhoo. The hastily assembled makeshift buffet includes fruit and munchies \u2014 and to the horror of Shannon, \u201cGrocery store sushi. \u2026 It\u2019s so ratchet.\u201d\n\nGrocery Store Sushi: excellent name for a band.\n\nRatchet: slang for \u201cwretched.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the tension between store manager Brittainy and her commitment-phobic, musician boyfriend, Jon, who shows up wearing sunglasses and sporting an attitude. Jon gets tired of waiting for the food to arrive (curse you, forgetful caterer!) and tells Brittainy he\u2019s going across the street to get some pizza.\n\nBrittainy: \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me on the night I worked so hard for?!\u201d\n\nJon: \u201cI\u2019m just starving. I\u2019ve seen you once in the last hour.\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s because she\u2019s a little bit busy BEING THE MANAGER OF THE STORE.\n\nDude. Take off the sunglasses, stop whining like an impatient 7-year-old waiting on dinner and support your girlfriend.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nOther stuff happens on this jam-packed episode. This one guy named, hold on, Mike \u2014 yep, that\u2019s his name, Mike \u2014 proposes to K-Cav\u2019s friend Taylor.\n\nK-Cav\u2019s friend Kelly lets us know \u201cThe Canadian\u201d is no longer in the picture.\n\nBest of luck to everyone.\n\nAs usual, breakout star J-Cut comes through with the sarcasm and the comic relief.\n\n\u2022 Jay tells Kristin the next time Shannon messes up, \u201cSuspend [her] for a week.\u201d\n\nKristin says she can\u2019t go without a social media person because \u201cInstagram is a full-time job.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to STOP,\u201d says Jay. \u201cYou need to STOP.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kristin is in the kitchen, unloading the dishwasher. Jay munches on a snack and says, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust unloading the dishwasher,\u201d says Kristin.\n\nCome on Jay. Make the obvious read. This is the same problem you often had when you were the Bears\u2019 QB.\n\n\u2022 Jay sports a goofy stocking cap and cheap-looking sunglasses while driving Kristin to their new home in the country.\n\nKristin: \u201cWhat [brand] are your sunglasses?\u201d\n\nJay: \u201cAwesome.\u201d\n\nKristin: \u201cAre they?\u201d\n\nJay: \u201cI\u2019m not [entering] a contest of beauty. [They\u2019re] functional.\u201d\n\n\u2022 When we get to the country house, the E! graphic says: \u201cKRISTIN\u2019S NEW HOME.\u201d\n\nSorry Jay.\n\nTo Kristin\u2019s delight, there\u2019s a chandelier in the chicken coop. She calls it the coolest thing she\u2019s ever seen and tells Jay, \u201cLook, they\u2019re going to be so happy in here!\u201d\n\nWell. If they were talking, animated chickens in a Pixar short, perhaps the chandelier would come into play. Not so sure how much impact it will have on actual chickens.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nWe wrap up the season with K-Cav (in fashionable white pants, ankle-high leather boots, white T-shirt and an oversized camouflage shirt that looks to be from the Jay Cutler line of Early Retirement Casual Clothing) taking a hammer to the kitchen tiles, ripping up the hideous carpet in the basement and breaking apart drywall while Jay looks on, arms crossed, smiling and doing, well, nothing.\n\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d says Kristin, before uttering one last expletive.\n\nNo doubt the house renovation will be a central plot point next year \u2014 and yes, next year is happening, as the folks at E! remind us with a closing title card saying: \u201cCongrats, Kristin! \u2018VERY CAVALLARI,\u2019 SEASON 2, COMING 2019.\u201d\n\nOf course we\u2019ll be bleeping there, you crazy bleeping bleeps.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671708/wotw04_18_20greatblueheron.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WD_XrRvmg3OmNpiQ39sdhuWmuSE=/0x3:1194x628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16115194/screen_shot_2018_08_27_at_8_47_57_am_e1535377958673.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66666475/Screen_Shot_2020_04_17_at_2.41.04_AM.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671665/1188137827.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NN7dxpCXFpXAe73ZwvvP-DgjWNA=/0x0:1194x630/1200x800/filters:focal(502x220:692x410)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/63550835/screen_shot_2018_08_27_at_8_47_57_am_e1535377958673.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671857/more_flashing_lights.0.jpeg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671859/SneedKelly041920.0.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671714/dear_abby_12880069_e1420416724734_655.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WD_XrRvmg3OmNpiQ39sdhuWmuSE=/0x3:1194x628/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16115194/screen_shot_2018_08_27_at_8_47_57_am_e1535377958673.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Richard Roeper", "Sun-Times Staff", "Sun-Times Wire", "Abigail Van Buren", "Dale Bowman", "Patrick Finley", "Aug"], "canonical_link": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/8/27/18398665/curses-on-very-cavallari-kristin-lets-f-bombs-fly-after-store-snafus", "title": "Curses!
