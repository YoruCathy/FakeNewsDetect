Two boys on the nicked moped had jumped a red light and smashed into a car. Tom must have been walking down the road. He went off like a shot in pursuit and looked furious. If the kid had been dumb enough to resist, I reckon Tom would have given him a good hiding.\"\n\nThe witness added that Hardy \"clearly isn't a man you mess with,\" describing the teenager that Hardy stopped at a bus stop and patted down as \"wrecked and in shock.\"\n\n\"I asked Tom what happened, and he told me he chased him through my back garden and caught him around the block, but the route was like an assault course,\" the witness said.\n\nThe two 16 year olds who stole the moped sustained injuries.\n\nBoth were arrested but have since been released.\n\nA spokesperson for Hardy has not yet responded to TooFab's request for comment.\n\nPhotos", "images": ["https://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/elite-daily-logo-1.png", "https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/skeleton.svg", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/04/25/tom-hardy-1200x630.jpg", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rsss-justjared-logo-cut-v2.gif", "https://ssl-cdn-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2019/04/06/cdl-260x30-for-tmz3-1.png", "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2018/12/19/newsletter-logo-v2-1.png", "https://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png"], "top_img": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/04/25/tom-hardy-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toofab Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://toofab.com/2017/04/25/tom-hardy-becomes-real-life-hero-when-he-caught-the-c-t-who-stole-a-moped/", "title": "Tom Hardy Becomes Real-Life Hero When He 'Caught the C--t' Who Stole a Moped", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "twitter": {"toofab": 116547240, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@toofab", "title": "Tom Hardy Becomes Real-Life Hero When He 'Caught the C--t' Who Stole a Moped", "description": "Tom Hardy is pretty much a real-life superhero.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/04/25/tom-hardy-1200x630.jpg"}, "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "description": "Tom Hardy is pretty much a real-life superhero.", "robots": "index,follow", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"url": "https://toofab.com/2017/04/25/tom-hardy-becomes-real-life-hero-when-he-caught-the-c-t-who-stole-a-moped/", "site_name": "toofab", "type": "article", "title": "Tom Hardy Becomes Real-Life Hero When He 'Caught the C--t' Who Stole a Moped", "description": "Tom Hardy is pretty much a real-life superhero.", "image": "https://toofab.akamaized.net/2017/04/25/tom-hardy-480x360.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116046798441464, "pages": 324392354652}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TooFab"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493049600.0, "source": "http://toofab.com", "summary": ""}
