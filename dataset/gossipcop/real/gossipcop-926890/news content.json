I can't walk through a Las Vegas casino without someone yelling 'Yeah-Yeah!'\"\n\nReleased in 1993, The Sandlot was set in 1962 and followed the summer of a group of neighborhood kids who played a never-ending baseball game and went head-to-head with the legend of a dog named \"The Beast.\" The film became impactful for successful future athletes and was even recreated by the New York Yankees, who paid homage to the unforgettable Babe Ruth scene in the movie.\n\n\"The film was made with the same amount of love that people have for it, and it was the greatest summer of our lives,\" Evans says.\n\n\"It made a big impact on a lot of people's lives,\" Guiry says.\n\n'The Sandlot' at 20: Diamonds are forever\n\n5 baseball movies to binge-watch during the MLB post-season", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67cb723a33b82c7fa74bda9d580fc343a8918c2d/c=44-0-755-400/local/-/media/2015/11/11/USATODAY/usatsports/the-sandlot-podcast-hey-do-you-remember.jpg?width=711&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5769111857001_5769110344001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67cb723a33b82c7fa74bda9d580fc343a8918c2d/c=44-0-755-400/local/-/media/2015/11/11/USATODAY/usatsports/the-sandlot-podcast-hey-do-you-remember.jpg?width=711&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/04/12/sandlot-cast-reunites-after-25-years/510629002/", "title": "'The Sandlot' cast reunites on the baseball diamond for 25th anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "'The Sandlot' cast reunites on the baseball diamond for 25th anniversary", "description": "The cast of 'The Sandlot' reunited on NBC's 'Today' to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/04/12/sandlot-cast-reunites-after-25-years/510629002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67cb723a33b82c7fa74bda9d580fc343a8918c2d/c=44-0-755-400/local/-/media/2015/11/11/USATODAY/usatsports/the-sandlot-podcast-hey-do-you-remember.jpg?width=711&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 711, "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Anika Reed", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The cast of 'The Sandlot' reunited on NBC's 'Today' to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67cb723a33b82c7fa74bda9d580fc343a8918c2d/c=44-0-755-400/local/-/media/2015/11/11/USATODAY/usatsports/the-sandlot-podcast-hey-do-you-remember.jpg?width=711&height=355&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "'The Sandlot' cast reunites on the baseball diamond for 25th anniversary", "description": "The cast of 'The Sandlot' reunited on NBC's 'Today' to celebrate the film's 25th anniversary."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523462400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
