Miley Cyrus isn't about to stand for that, and she voiced her opinion on the matter via Instagram comments.\n\nOne of Miley's fan accounts posted this picture a day ago, of Selena and Miley at an event together.\n\nAnd Miley commented on the picture more than once, writing \"Well what that d*ck head said (if it\u2019s true) is f*king false and total bull sh*t.\" In another comment, she wrote, \u201cShe fine as f*ck.\u201d\n\nHere's a screenshot of the comments, because obviously receipts are important:\n\nInstagram @MileyOfficially\n\nStefano has a long history of feuding with celebrities, including Miley. Last summer, Miley's brother Braison modeled in a Dolce & Gabbana show. After the fact, Miley posted a picture of him on the runway saying how proud she was, but also criticizing the company's politics. Stefano commented on her Instagram saying they'd never work with Braison again because of her critique. PopCrazy made the correlation earlier this week.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Gabbana\u2019s first time lashing out at a former Disney star. Last year, he ignited a feud with Miley Cyrus that led to him banning her and her brother, Braison Cyrus from working with D&G again. pic.twitter.com/6NTowPwiEp \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) June 13, 2018\n\nFYI, Stefano hasn't apologized for his comments about Selena, but has gone on Instagram to further reinforce and bully Selena by posting stories making fun of fans asking him to apologize.\n\n\n\nMiley and Selena grew up together on the Disney Channel, so to speak, while Miley starred in Hannah Montana and Selena was on Wizards of Waverly Place. There were rumors that the two actresses didn't like each other, but Selena cleared the air in an interview with W Magazine in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe never feuded. We both liked the same guy when we were 16,\u201d Gomez told W, speaking about their mutual ex Nick Jonas. \u201cIt was just a Hilary Duff\u2013Lindsay Lohan thing: \u2018Oh, my God, we like the same boy!\u2019 We are now completely settled in our own lives.\u201d\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Baty", "Emma Baty Is The Associate Entertainment Editor At Cosmopolitan Who Focuses On Movies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a21562891/miley-cyrus-defends-selena-gomez-dolce-and-gabbana-stefano-ugly/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Defends Selena Gomez After Dolce & Gabbana Designer Calls Her Ugly", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Miley Cyrus Defends Selena Gomez After Dolce & Gabbana Designer Calls Her Ugly", "description": "\"She fine as f*ck.\"", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a21562891/miley-cyrus-defends-selena-gomez-dolce-and-gabbana-stefano-ugly/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-06-15 04:34:37", "published_time": "2018-06-15 04:34:00", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Miley Cyrus Defends Selena Gomez After 'Ugly' Comments  - Stefano Gabbana Selena Gomez", "description": "\"She fine as f*ck.\"", "keywords": "selena gomez, miley cyrus, stefano gabbana, selena gomez ugly, dolce & gabbana, d and g, stefano gabbana ugly comment, selena ugly", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-15T16:34:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/miley-selena-1529079082.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Miley Cyrus Defends Selena Gomez After Dolce & Gabbana Designer Calls Her Ugly", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529008440.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
