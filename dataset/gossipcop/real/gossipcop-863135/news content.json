Blue Ivy and her newly-welcomed siblings will be living large at the rental this summer, especially with a \"kiddie-friendly wading pool.\"\n\nThe first thing guests see when entering the lavish 10 bedroom and 14 bathroom home, is a foyer fit for Queen Bey, decked in colored tiles, golden fixtures and a wrought iron staircase.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nThere are plenty of living rooms to lounge in, including this one with open-air waterfront views. The cream-colored couches and antique accessories make for a modern take on a classic home.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nPlus, the baby grand piano is a necessary fixture for a family of music royalty.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nExquisite paintings and chandeliers hang in rib vault hallways, like this one, which leads to a dreamy garden overlooking the beach\u2014manicured hedges and fountain included.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nWhen the kids are hungry, they'll probably have a meal in this all-white kitchen, where the wooden details on the cabinets balance with the marble countertops for a rustic charm. In the next room over, the Carters might enjoy a sitting around the table in front of a floor-to-ceiling window, where they can look out on the blue tides while having breakfast.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nIn the $54.5 million estate, dinner for the family of five won't be an issue. Their dining room seats 10, leaving room for multiple guests.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nOutside, the 16,107-square-foot La Villa Contenta has more sitting areas for relaxation, work and watching the tots play. The home includes lounge space in and out of the sun, a large lawn perfect for a jungle gym and much more.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cara Zimmerman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a10224058/beyonce-jay-z-malibu-rental/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z Have Bought a 400k A Month Rental In Malibu", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9's Twins Are Already Living More Extravagantly Than You", "description": "Take a look inside the Carters' $400,000/month Malibu estate.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a10224058/beyonce-jay-z-malibu-rental/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2017-07-18 05:09:34", "published_time": "2017-06-26 09:40:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z Have Bought a 400k A Month Rental In Malibu - Jay Z And Beyonce\u00e9 Buy A Malibu Villa", "description": "The twins get to call 'La Villa Contenta\u2019 their new\u00a0waterfront home.", "keywords": "celebrity, home, news", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.499xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest,beyonce twins,blue ivy carter,home", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-26T21:40:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.499xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Beyonc\u00e9's Twins Are Already Living More Extravagantly Than You", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498441200.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
