The title comes from the name of the firehouse at the center of the story.\n\nThe 10-episode spinoff, picked up straight to series, is set in Seattle and focuses on firefighters from the captain down the ranks to the newest recruit in their personal and professional lives. The castmembers are expected to be introduced in an episode of the flagship series this season. The firefighter series will be the second spinoff to come out of Grey's Anatomy following Kate Walsh starrer Private Practice. The latter ran for six seasons and wrapped its run in 2013.\n\nFrom Shonda Rhimes and her Shondaland partner Betsy Beers, Station 19 is penned by Grey's Anatomy alum Stacy McKee, who serves as showrunner. She also exec produces the ABC Studios drama, alongside producing director Barclay. Grey's star Ellen Pompeo recently added a co-exec producer credit on the spinoff as well.\n\nJaina Lee Ortiz (Rosewood) leads a cast that includes Grey's Anatomy regular Jason George, who will segue to the spinoff this season; Grey Damon (Friday Night Lights); Miguel Sandoval (Bad Judge); Okieriete Onaodowan (Hamilton); Danielle Savre (Too Close to Home); Jay Hayden (The Catch); Barrett Doss (Iron Fist); and Alberto Frezza (Dead of Summer).\n\nDelays in show titles are not uncommon; Grey's Anatomy did not have a title right away, while Scandal was not that show's original name, either.\n\nAs for what to expect from the spinoff, McKee said it exists in the same universe as Grey's \u2014 the joke is that Fire Station 19 is three blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. The showrunner called the spinoff \"Grey's adjacent\" and said there was \"a lot of potential for cross-pollination,\" noting that they would be excited to have crossover with the characters or places from the flagship in \"small ways or big ways.\"\n\nStation 19 premieres March 22 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/01/greg_berlanti_sharon_horgan_alex_kurtzman_and_dwayne_johnson_-_getty_-_h_2020.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/04/lesley_goldberg_0.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/03/mrs._america_-_publicity_still_1-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", "Lesley.Goldberg Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-firefighter-spinoff-title-station-19-1078408", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy' Firefighter Spinoff (Finally) Gets a Title", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The Shonda Rhimes-produced offshoot will premiere March 22.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-firefighter-spinoff-title-station-19-1078408", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy' Firefighter Spinoff (Finally) Gets a Title", "description": "The Shonda Rhimes-produced offshoot will premiere March 22.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy' Firefighter Spinoff (Finally) Gets a Title", "description": "The Shonda Rhimes-produced offshoot will premiere March 22.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/greys-anatomy-firefighter-spinoff-title-station-19-1078408", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "'Grey's Anatomy' Firefighter Spinoff (Finally) Gets a Title", "sailthru.description": "The Shonda Rhimes-produced offshoot will premiere March 22.", "sailthru.author": "Lesley Goldberg", "sailthru.channel": "Live Feed", "sailthru.vertical": "Live Feed", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-25 12:14:28", "sailthru.tags": "Live Feed, Television, Grey&#39;s Anatomy"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516853668.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
