He also claims there are \"untrue\" scenes that portray Brown as not loving Bobbi Kristina.\n\nIn the suit, Brown claims the production used information they obtained while working with him on his 2004 reality show,\"Being Bobby Brown,\" and used it in the film without his permission.\n\nBrown claims the casting call for the movie described him as \"a hard drug user\" who \"devolves into violence and abuse towards his wife.\"\n\nBrown is suing for libel and slander and is seeking damages in excess of a million dollars. He is also looking to block the release of the film, due to air on TV One on October 8.\n\nA rep for TV One had no comment.", "images": ["https://theblast.com/static/theblast/logo.svg", "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//dXhXMXN0OUpKUnlXSFJFSzAybFAuanBn.jpg"], "top_img": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//dXhXMXN0OUpKUnlXSFJFSzAybFAuanBn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff", "Jeff Mazzeo", "Jacob Highley", "Ryan Naumann"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/bobby-brown-lawsuit", "title": "Bobby Brown Sues to Stop Upcoming Bobbi Kristina Biopic", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#f60", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bobby Brown Sues Over Upcoming Bobbi Kristina Biopic", "url": "https://theblast.com/c/bobby-brown-lawsuit", "site_name": "The Blast", "description": "Bobby Brown claims an upcoming TV movie about the life of his daughter is filled with lies and he's filed a lawsuit seeking over $1,000,000 in damages.", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//dXhXMXN0OUpKUnlXSFJFSzAybFAuanBn.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2018-11-28T08:18:29.000+00:00"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2019-06-10T23:33:24.000+00:00", "published_time": "2018-11-28T08:18:29.000+00:00", "section": "The Law", "tag": "Bobbi Kristina", "publisher": "https://facebook.com/theblastnews"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBlastNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bobby Brown Sues Over Upcoming Bobbi Kristina Biopic", "description": "Bobby Brown claims an upcoming TV movie about the life of his daughter is filled with lies and he's filed a lawsuit seeking over $1,000,000 in damages.", "image": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//dXhXMXN0OUpKUnlXSFJFSzAybFAuanBn.jpg"}, "description": "Bobby Brown claims an upcoming TV movie about the life of his daughter is filled with lies and he's filed a lawsuit seeking over $1,000,000 in damages.", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/theblast/icon-270.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "4ade90087d8ddeecef93bced91147809"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543393109.0, "source": "https://theblast.com", "summary": ""}
