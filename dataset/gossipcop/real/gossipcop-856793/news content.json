Either way, it\u2019s double standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutlaw King\u201d director David McKenzie griped to Metro about the hype around Pine\u2019s penis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a man getting clean in a cold [lake] \u2014 you don\u2019t do that with your clothes on,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s microseconds. It\u2019s ridiculous all the fuss about it.\u201d\n\nPine previously said his nearly-nude scene in \u201cWonder Woman\u201d inspired him to work out.\n\n\u201cI was excited,\u201d he said of playing a naked Steve Trevor in the hit DC film. \u201cI was like, \u2018All right, man. Now the gauntlet is thrown. I\u2019ve got something to prep for.\u2019 It\u2019s a 40-foot screen. If people are laughing at you doing push-ups on the set on the day, I don\u2019t really care, because I\u2019m going to be in Slovakia. I\u2019ve got to prep for the Slovakians.\u201d\n\nHe also said he didn\u2019t mind being \u201cobjectified\u201d by audiences of the Gal Gadot star vehicle.\n\n\u201cIt was fun to be objectified for a day,\u201d Pine told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d in May 2017. \u201cI was thinking this happens to women so, so much, it\u2019s about time. While that was fun, I think it\u2019s the most compassionate I\u2019ve felt toward women on what they may feel being sidelined or made to feel less important.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chris-pine-naked-wonder-woman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chris-pine-naked-wonder-woman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/chris-pine-naked-wonder-woman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/10/19/chris-pine-doesnt-get-the-hype-about-his-nude-scenes/", "title": "Chris Pine doesn\u2019t get the hype about his nude scenes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
