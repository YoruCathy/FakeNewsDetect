(Photo by Jenny Anderson/WireImage)\n\nWhile vacationing in Italy, Jillian Michaels claims a yacht crew member tried to extort her through an \u201caggressive and threatening\u201d exchange.\n\nThe fitness star opened up on Facebook saying she had chartered a boat for 12 days for $60k, but when she arrived on Tuesday, the boat was rusted and damaged.\n\nThe 43-year-old trainer said the crew demanded extra money for fuel because the \u201cgas cash had been drained by mobsters in Capri,\u201d writes the Daily Mail.\n\nIn a video sent to the Daily Mail, Michaels is seen arguing with a crew member and is insisting the interaction be filmed. She claims she is being scammed and held hostage.\n\nMichaels found the boat through an online company and was traveling with friends, family members and her daughter.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail in an email that she and the group are \u201cdoing okay\u201d and she is \u201ctruly unclear of how far these individuals will go as I was physically intimidated and threatened in emails.\u201d\n\nShe warns others to investigate as much as possible beforehand and if anything happens, contact the U.S. Embassy American Citizen Services.", "images": ["https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Michaels-08-08-17-e1502205794554-1.jpg?fit=1439%2C498", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-113209829-e1586993484387.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/claire-danes-leonardo-dicaprio_SIMP.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hero-36.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/91338370_580352575898176_8121486165844939986_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=9YwJpRhcs_kAX8PL5aa&_nc_ht=scontent.xx&oh=f5de8062d4745be01e3a7a5258f84751&oe=5EA388E3", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Science_Coffee-01_Edit.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hero-35.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/portillos_italian_beef_anna_rupprecht_V3.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/heropow.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/entireworldtotes.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gangsta_knit.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Andy-Hunter-Bookshop.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Michaels-08-08-17-e1502205794554-1.jpg?resize=1200,415", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/nbts.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tundra_Hero_Toyota_Crewmax_2020.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/themes/insidehook-theme/media/dist/assets/img/site/ih-social-logo.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=381165108746682&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/HOME_104_F037F-e1586984397835.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/airlineseats.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hero4.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/greats.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/suzannehanover_universalpictures_edit_720.jpg?resize=720%2C480", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bucks-lakers.jpg?resize=750%2C500", "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Settlers-of-Catan-Tabletop-Simulator.jpg?resize=750%2C500"], "top_img": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Michaels-08-08-17-e1502205794554-1.jpg?resize=1200,415", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Gibian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insidehook.com/article/travel/jillian-michaels-claims-yacht-crew-tried-extort", "title": "Jillian Michaels Claims Yacht Crew Tried to Extort Her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "While vacationing in Italy, Jillian Michaels claims a yacht crew member tried to extort her through an \"aggressive and threatening\" exchange.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jillian Michaels Claims Yacht Crew Tried to Extort Her -
