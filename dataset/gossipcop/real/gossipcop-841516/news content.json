It\u2019s you boy Chris Pratt/Coming back with an episode of What\u2019s My Snack? Last chapter/You ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019/What\u2019s my snack? It\u2019s a carrot cake muffin/I\u2019ll be stuffin\u2019 this muff up in my grill/Look at the carrot cake crumbs I spill/I don\u2019t even like it, but I\u2019m eatin\u2019 it still/\u2019Cause I\u2019m sitting her within\u2019 away to nothin\u2019/Uh-oh, eating carrot cake muffin.\u201d\n\nPratt is currently on a strict diet for filming so when he finally took a bite of his snack he said: \u201cOoh, it\u2019s so good! More like What\u2019s My Crack? That\u2019s good!\u201d\n\nThen his guilty smile appeared.\n\n\u201cCan I be honest with you,\u201d Pratt asked the camera. \u201cThis is my snack for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nPratt kept his humor alive in his caption that went with his video: \u201cIt is said that when you fast you have visions. It goes back to the Bible and probably before. It\u2019s a spiritual experience to say the least. I\u2019m not fasting per se, but I am definitely at the point in this diet where I\u2019ve began metabolizing my own brain for energy. Not to brag. If your body gets so hungry you start eating your own brain matter for energy, keep going! You\u2019re almost there! It means the love handles are next! And then you will be complete. You will have arrived at the destination. And forever you will be happy. Just kidding.\u201d\n\nAnd then things got serious. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Not worth it. Go get some Doritos or skittles. Both of which have Starlord\u2019s face on them right now!!!\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-fox-b-w.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2016/10/19/tour-300x250-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/03/08/0308-jurassic-480x360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/shonda-rimes-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://warnerbros.112.2o7.net/b/ss/wbrostoofab/1/JS-1.5.1--NS/s1491547092?AQB=1&ce=UTF-8&ns=warnerbros&pageName=articles%3Aarticle%3A%3Achris-pratt-raps-whats-my-snack-and-its-the-best-thing-youll-watch-today-video&c1=Toofab.us&v1=Toofab.us&c2=article&v2=article&c3=articles&v3=articles&events=event6&AQE=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-luna-easter-bunny-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/01/03/0103-pratt-main-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/the-rock-fallon-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/don-rickles-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-404979h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/icons/svg/comments.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2016/12/21/1221-pratt-main-480x360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/05/chris-pratt-rap-video-instagram-1200x630.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/02/20/0220-ridley-teaser-480x360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/jimmy-kimmel-girls-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/toofab-logo-white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/gettyimages-664888098-src-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-asset-lainey-gossip-bw-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://assets.toofab.com/toofab.com/main/default/img/newsletter/newsletter-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/03/01/0301-pratt-main-480x360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000013&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/jimmy-fallon-daughter-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/05/chris-pratt-rap-video-instagram-810x960.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/cache/images/feedlogo2.v2014_05_09_134122.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-gossipgirl-bw.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/noah-meyers-colbert-kendall-jenner-pepsi-split-300x250-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/sean-spicer-kindergartner-trevor-noah-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/01/03/0103-pratt-main-480x360.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/scarlett-johannson-women-in-the-world-810x960-1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/05/chris-pratt-rap-video-instagram-810x610.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-rss-thestir-logo-cut-v2-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/06/caitlyn-khloe-kuwtk-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/http://ll-media.tmz.com/2013/04/26/partner-asset-us-magazine-logo2-cut-v2-1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2016/12/21/1221-lawrence-main-480x360.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054im_/https://media.toofab.com/2017/04/05/chris-pratt-rap-video-instagram-1200x630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Brodsky"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170407064054/http://toofab.com/2017/04/05/chris-pratt-raps-whats-my-snack-and-its-the-best-thing-youll-watch-today-video/", "title": "Chris Pratt Raps 'What's My Snack?'
