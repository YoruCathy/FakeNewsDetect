Danielle Maltby opened up about her history with Wells Adams and gushed over his new relationship with Sarah Hyland.\n\n\u201cOh, of course we are [still friends]. I\u2019m so happy for him,\u201d Maltby exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, December 4. \u201cI\u2019ve met Sarah. Sarah is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor alum also revealed what makes Adams and Hyland, 27, such a dynamic duo. \u201cThey bounce off of each other so well, like they really bring out the best of each other,\u201d she shared. \u201cLike they\u2019re both so funny and amp each other up so much. And the smile that Wells gets on his face is unreal. It\u2019s so cute. It really is so cute.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the Nashville-based nurse and the Your Favorite Thing podcast host sent Bachelor Nation fans into a frenzy when they shared a passionate kiss on Bachelor in Paradise this summer right before Maltby left the show. After the episode aired, the pair explained on Adams\u2019 podcast that, although they had briefly dated several years ago, they are just really good friends.\n\nMaltby told Us there is no awkwardness between herself and the Modern Family star, who has been dating Adams for several months. \u201cNo, she\u2019s really awesome,\u201d the reality star noted, adding that the couple seem really serious. \u201cThey spend a lot of time together. Any time Sarah comes to town she\u2019s like, \u2018Danielle!\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018Sarah, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u2019 It\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\nAs for her own love life post-Paradise? \u201cI\u2019m not [seeing anyone],\u201d Maltby revealed. \u201cSo if you know of any men, send them my way!\u201d\n\nAdams has also spoken to Us about his steamy smooch with Maltby. \u201cI think it\u2019s very flattering that that people are so interested in our little relationship considering it was 15 seconds at the end of an episode,\u201d he exclusively told Us at the 7th annual American Humane Dog Hero Awards in September. \u201cI think ABC did a good job of compounding the interest by not addressing it at the after-show. We are just friends now. If things progress romantically, we\u2019re going to take our time with that and not worry about the show or anything like that trying to make us something that we\u2019re not ready to be. I knew I always wanted to make out with her because she\u2019s gorgeous and awesome and one of my friends. But she\u2019s not part of my friend group, she\u2019s part of my inner circle of friends. So in Nashville I think that was just too weird.\u201d\n\nUs broke the news in October that Adams and Hyland are seeing each other. \u201cThey have been dating a while now,\u201d an insider added to Us in November of the seemingly inseparable couple, who confirmed their relationship at Brandi Cyrus\u2018 Halloween party. \u201cIt is getting more serious as time passes. They really like each other.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-lakers.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/833812996_danielle-maltby-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/833812996_danielle-maltby-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1129px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/833812996_danielle-maltby-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/danielle-maltby-reacts-to-wells-adams-sarah-hyland-dating/", "title": "Danielle Maltby Reacts to Wells Adams, Sarah Hyland Dating", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Danielle Maltby gushed over Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland\u2019s relationship during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly and revealed what makes them work as a couple \u2014 details!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Bachelor\u2019s Danielle Maltby: \u2018I\u2019m So Happy\u2019 for Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland", "description": "Danielle Maltby gushed over Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland\u2019s relationship during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly and revealed what makes them work as a couple \u2014 details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/danielle-maltby-reacts-to-wells-adams-sarah-hyland-dating/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:12:33+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/833812996_danielle-maltby-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/833812996_danielle-maltby-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-12-05T18:57:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:12:33+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Danielle Maltby gushed over Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland\u2019s relationship during an exclusive interview with Us Weekly and revealed what makes them work as a couple \u2014 details!", "title": "The Bachelor\u2019s Danielle Maltby: \u2018I\u2019m So Happy\u2019 for Wells Adams and Sarah Hyland", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/833812996_danielle-maltby-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512500231.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
