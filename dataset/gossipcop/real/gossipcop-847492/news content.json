We're just not sure a wad of snipped dreads is a fitting substitute.\n\nGetty Images\n\nOriginal post, 5/1: Jaden Smith is carrying his hair on the Met Gala red carpet. That is what's happening right at this moment.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIf you'll recall, Jaden chopped off his blond dreadlocks early in April, in preparation for his role opposite Cara Delevingne in the teen drama Life in a Year. His dad, Will Smith, did the honors. It was an iconic moment.\n\nBut as it turns out, the hair lives. The hair travels with Jaden. See the way he's carrying it like a purse or maybe a mascot? The Met Gala may have peaked too early this year.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Dibdin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a9589284/jaden-smith-hair-met-gala-red-carpet/", "title": "Why Jaden Smith Brought His Own Hair To The Met Gala Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Why Jaden Smith Brought His Own Hair To The Met Gala Red Carpet", "description": "There's actually a heartwarming explanation.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a9589284/jaden-smith-hair-met-gala-red-carpet/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-03-28 09:22:51", "published_time": "2017-05-02 02:30:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Why Jaden Smith Brought His Own Hair To The Met Gala Red Carpet", "description": "Jaden Smith is carrying his hair as an accessory on the Met Gala red carpet.", "keywords": "met gala, jaden smith, met gala red carpet, met gala 2017", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.258xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-02T14:30:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hbz-jaden-hair-met-1493752816.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.258xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Why Jaden Smith Brought His Own Hair To The Met Gala Red Carpet", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493663400.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
