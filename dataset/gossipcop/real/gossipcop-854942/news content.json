{"url": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1141016/beyonce-quotes-about-motherhood/", "text": "From the outside looking in, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles Carter is probably the least relatable celebrity mom of all \u2014 what with her family vacations on private yachts in Europe and her $7,560 maternity attire. But when you strip Queen Bey of her beauty, fame and unparalleled talent, you get a regular-ish 30-something mama who\u2019s like the rest of us: loving of her kids, amazed by the miracle of pregnancy and childbirth, and overwhelmed by the joy of raising children.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most inspiring quotes about motherhood. The mom of three has talked at length over the years about her miscarriages, healthy pregnancies, giving birth and being a mom to oldest daughter Blue and twins Rumi and Sir, and her thoughts on all of the above are surprisingly relatable, even though her lifestyle is anything but.\n\nRead Bey\u2019s most touching quotes about the family she and husband Jay-Z have built together, and prepare to be inspired (OK, probably a little bit jealous, too).\n\n1. When she shared the heartbreaking details of her miscarriage\n\nIn the star\u2019s 2013 HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream, Bey opened up for the first time about the pregnancy she lost before the 2012 birth of daughter Blue.\n\n\u201cAbout two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time. And I heard the heartbeat, which was the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI flew back to New York to get my checkup \u2014 and no heartbeat. Literally the week before I went to the doctor, everything was fine, but there was no heartbeat.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the Grammy winner put her feelings into her music: \u201cI went into the studio and wrote the saddest song I\u2019ve ever written in my life. And it was actually the first song I wrote for my album. And it was the best form of therapy for me, because it was the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever been through.\u201d\n\n2. When she explained why she wanted to open up about her loss\n\nWhen Oprah interviewed Bey later in 2013, she explained why it was so important for her to talk publicly about her miscarriage.\n\n\u201cThere are so many couples that go through that and it was a big part of my story. It\u2019s one of the reasons I did not share I was pregnant the second time [with Blue], because you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. And that was hard, because all of my family and my friends knew and we celebrated. It was hard,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 said.\n\n3. When she got emotional about her mother/daughter bond with Blue Ivy\n\nIn the same Oprah interview, Bey shared that she felt a bond with her little girl almost immediately.\n\n\u201cMy daughter introduced me to myself,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, my mother and I are so close, and I always prayed that I would have that type of relationship with my daughter. And she\u2019s still a baby, but the connection I had with her when I was giving birth was something that I\u2019ve never felt before.\u201d\n\n4. When she called pregnancy \u201cthe most beautiful experience of my life\u201d\n\nIn Life Is But a Dream, the stunning star also discussed the beauty of carrying her daughter, Blue.\n\n\u201c[It was] the most beautiful experience of my life. It was amazing. I felt like God was giving me a chance to assist in a miracle. You\u2019re playing a part in a much bigger show. And that\u2019s what life is. It\u2019s the greatest show on Earth,\u201d she said.\n\n5. When she was so thankful she got to experience a healthy pregnancy\n\n\u201cPregnancy is the most incredible gift anyone can have and I\u2019m so happy I\u2019m a woman,\u201d the star told E! News in a 2011 interview. \u201cMen, I feel bad, they don\u2019t get to experience this. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\n6. When she understood the struggle working moms face\n\nYes, even superstars realize it\u2019s not easy for everyday mamas to balance our careers with our families.\n\n\u201cI have so much admiration for women who are mothers, who balance family and work,\u201d the \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d singer told Cosmopolitan UK in 2011. \u201cI see them and I have this word in my head \u2014 respect. I also look to learn. I see these women and I think, \u2018Yes, it can be balanced, it can all work out.\u2019 I do believe that it\u2019s possible to have it all \u2014 work, a career, babies. It\u2019s all a question of being very organized. That\u2019s what I\u2019m getting my head around.\u201d\n\n7. When she shared the benefits of breastfeeding\n\nIn 2012, when Bey was crowned People magazine\u2019s Most Beautiful Woman, she revealed she lost the baby weight by breastfeeding \u2014 she nursed Blue Ivy for 10 weeks \u2014 and encouraged other mamas to do the same.\n\n\u201cI lost most of my weight from breastfeeding and I encourage women to do it. It\u2019s just so good for the baby and good for yourself,\u201d she said.\n\n8. When she hit the nail on the head about how motherhood has changed her\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 said she found a newfound purpose after becoming a mother.\n\n\u201cIt just gives you purpose, and all of the things that my self-esteem was associated with, it\u2019s all completely different,\u201d she told Anderson Cooper in 2012. \u201cI realized why I was born and more than anything all of the things I want to pass onto my child, and the best way of doing that is not by preaching or telling her but showing her by example.\u201d\n\n9. When she admitted she and Jay-Z love changing diapers\n\nIn the same interview, Bey confessed that not even Mr. and Mrs. Carter are above diaper duty.\n\n\u201cActually, [Jay-Z] is very good. We both [change diapers]. I love changing diapers, I love it. I love every moment of it, it\u2019s so beautiful. I love it all,\u201d she said.\n\n10. When she got real about what was going through her mind during labor\n\nBey got super-philosophical in her 2013 Vogue interview, in which she revealed how she mentally got through labor with Blue.\n\n\u201cI felt like when I was having contractions, I envisioned my child pushing through a very heavy door. And I imagined this tiny infant doing all the work, so I couldn\u2019t think about my own pain\u2026 We were talking. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt a communication.\u201d\n\n11. When she asserted that giving birth was her greatest accomplishment\n\nThe star told Garage magazine in 2016 that her proudest moment had nothing to do with her career.\n\n\u201cOut of everything I\u2019ve accomplished, my proudest moment, hands down, was when I gave birth to my daughter Blue,\u201d she said.\n\n12. When she said being called Mama is the best thing ever\n\n\u201cI just adore being a mother, hearing [Blue Ivy] say \u2018Mama\u2019 and call me when she needs something,\u201d she told Shape in 2013. \u201cIt makes me feel like I have a real purpose here.\u201d\n\n13. When she said family is more important than everything\n\nThis sweet confession came via the singer\u2019s \u201cSelf-titled\u201d YouTube series, in which she discussed her 2013 self-titled album.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of awards, and I have a lot of these things. And they\u2019re amazing, and I worked my ass off. I worked harder than probably everybody I know to get those things. But nothing feels like my child saying, \u2018Mommy!\u2019 Nothing feels like when I look my husband in the eyes.\u201d\n\n14. When she understood the simple joy of waking up every day to your kid\n\n\u201cWhen I wake up in the morning, the best thing in the world is seeing her face,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told the NFL Network\u2019s Super Bowl Live show in 2013. \u201cShe\u2019s starting to talk. It\u2019s just such a beautiful time in my life to have a child and every day see something new and see her learn something new.\u201d\n\n15. When she accepted her post-baby body\n\nQueen Bey told Vogue in 2013 that she had \u201cno shame\u201d about her post-baby body.\n\n\u201cI just feel my body means something completely different. I feel a lot more confident about it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven being heavier, thinner, whatever. I feel a lot more like a woman. More feminine, more sensual. And no shame.\u201d\n\n16. When she confessed she wanted her kids to have normal childhoods\n\nBefore the twins were born, Beyonc\u00e9 told Good Morning America in 2013 that she wanted more kids \u2014 and she hoped they could live as normal lives as possible despite the fame and fortune.\n\n\u201cI would like more children. I think my daughter needs some company. I definitely love being big sister,\u201d she said. \u201cI am very protective. I just want to make sure that she can have a healthy, safe, normal life. In the back of my mind, she\u2019s my priority. And life is completely different now. I feel really, really just lucky that I can still do what I love, and now have a way bigger meaning. And that\u2019s to be her mother.\u201d\n\n17. When she announced she was pregnant with twins\n\nThe most-liked Instagram photo of all time was Beyonce\u2019s February 2017 post in which she revealed she was expecting twins.\n\n\u201cWe would like to share our love and happiness,\u201d she wrote in a caption. \u201cWe have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.\u201d\n\n18. When she got real about her unplanned C-section\n\nThough her first labor and delivery seemed pretty blissful, the second was anything but, and Bey revealed in her September 2018 Vogue cover story that she had to have an emergency C-section with the twins.\n\n\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month. My health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section,\u201d she said.\n\n19. When she gave herself time to recover the second time around\n\nThree months after Beyonc\u00e9 had Blue, she was back to performing. But after the birth of Rumi and Sir, she realized how important it was to give her body time to recover, she said in the same Vogue interview.\n\n\u201cAfter the birth of my first child, I believed in the things society said about how my body should look. I put pressure on myself to lose all the baby weight in three months, and scheduled a small tour to assure I would do it. Looking back, that was crazy,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI needed time to heal, to recover,\u201d she added. \u201cDuring my recovery, I gave myself self-love and self-care, and I embraced being curvier. I accepted what my body wanted to be\u2026 I was patient with myself and enjoyed my fuller curves. My kids and husband did, too.\u201d\n\n20. When she really proved she\u2019s just like us because she too has a post-baby \u201cFUPA\u201d\n\n\n\nBut perhaps our favorite part of the Vogue interview was Bey accepting her body\u2019s imperfections \u2014 and admitting she\u2019s got a \u201cmommy pouch\u201d and a FUPA (look it up) like the rest of us.\n\n\u201cTo this day my arms, shoulders, breasts and thighs are fuller. I have a little mommy pouch, and I\u2019m in no rush to get rid of it. I think it\u2019s real,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told the magazine. \u201cWhenever I\u2019m ready to get a six-pack, I will go into beast zone and work my ass off until I have it. But right now, my little FUPA and I feel like we are meant to be.\u201d\n\n21. When she got real about ger life-threatening pregnancy\n\nIn her 2019 Netflix documentary, Homecoming, Bey opened up about how her difficult pregnancy with her twins almost cost her and one of her baby\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cMy body went through more than I knew it could. I was 218 pounds the day I gave birth. I had an extremely difficult pregnancy. I had high blood pressure. I developed toxemia, preeclampsia, and in the womb, one of my babies\u2019 heart beats paused a few times, so I needed to get an emergency C-section,\u201d she said.\n\n22. When she didn\u2019t feel the same career-wise after her twins\u2019 birth\n\nAfter her twins\u2019 birth in 2017, Bey didn\u2019t feel the same career-wise. In Homecoming, the singer opened up about how she felt less motivated to push herself in her career because of her newborn, which proved difficult when she was rehearsing non-stop for her Coachella 2018 performance.\n\n\u201cMy mind was not there,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mind wanted to be with my children. People don\u2019t see the sacrifice. I would dance and go off to the trailer and breastfeed the babies. The days I could I would bring the children.\u201d\n\nA version of this story was originally published in September 2018.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lizzo_togetherathome.jpg?quality=98&w=330#038;ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/models-who-dont-age-rex-ftr-1.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vanessa-kobe-bryant-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kenneth-Armando.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylorswift_01-e1587277738854.png?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kobe-Gianna-Bryant.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.sheknows.com&path=%2Fentertainment%2Farticles%2F1141016%2Fbeyonce-quotes-about-motherhood%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1141016", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Reese-Witherspoon-2013-arrest.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oopswev7gzjagndcr6sc.png", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/best-hangboards.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/melissa-mccarthy-mark-wahlber-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vanessa-kobe-bryant-anniversary-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=150&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oopswev7gzjagndcr6sc.png?w=695&h=391&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oopswev7gzjagndcr6sc.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Haley Longman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1141016/beyonce-quotes-about-motherhood/", "title": "Best Beyonce Motherhood Quotes About Her Twins, Kids, Pregnancies \u2013 SheKnows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 remains totally relatable and honest with these select quotes about being a mother to her kids, Blue Ivy, Rumi and Sir Carter.", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "author": "Haley Longman", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9's Quotes About Motherhood Are Everything", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1141016/beyonce-quotes-about-motherhood/", "description": "Here are 20 examples that will inspire you.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oopswev7gzjagndcr6sc.png", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Beyonce in front of black and gold background"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-06-05T14:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-06-05T15:01:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Beyonc\u00e9's Quotes About Motherhood Are Everything"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/oopswev7gzjagndcr6sc.png?w=1024", "alt": "Beyonce in front of black and gold background"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SheKnows", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9's Quotes About Motherhood Are Everything", "description": "Here are 20 examples that will inspire you."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-sk-favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/EhEnhNU3gVM?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8E3XEdEXpvc?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cIv1z6n3Xxo?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fB8qvx0HOlI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1559745900.0, "source": "https://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
