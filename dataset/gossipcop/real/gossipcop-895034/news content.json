For help, we called up Mark Marino, a professor at the University of Southern California who teaches a writing class that uses selfies as a way to explore identity, to see if there was some set of criteria that could justify Ms. Hilton\u2019s claim.\n\nThe professor was dubious.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d he said, dissolving into laughter as he came to terms with what was being asked. \u201cThe argument is that nobody had ever taken and posted their picture before this?\u201d\n\nHe pointed toward Robert Cornelius, who in 1839 took a picture that has been cited as the first selfie. But Cornelius ran into the frame. Could it be argued that a selfie must be taken using a hand-held camera?\n\nSadly for Ms. Hilton, there is a photo of several gentlemen holding up a box camera in the familiar selfie position in 1920.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/us/21xp-selfie/21xp-selfie-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/us/21xp-selfie/21xp-selfie-facebookJumbo.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/us/21xp-selfie/21xp-selfie-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonah Engel Bromwich"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/style/paris-hilton-selfie.html", "title": "Paris Hilton Said She Invented the Selfie.
