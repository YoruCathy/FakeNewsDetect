The third season was won by Fantasia Barrino , who defeated Diana DeGarmo by an approximate margin of 2% (1.3 million votes); the vote total (65 million votes) was the highest recorded vote total in the show's history until the May 23, 2007 finale of American Idol 6. This season also featured Academy Award-winning actress and Grammy Award-winning singer Jennifer Hudson\n\nThe third season is the only season where both the winner and the runner-up ended up in the bottom 2 or 3 prior to the finale. It is the first season to have a finale with two female contestants(season 12 is the second) while the second, seventh, and eighth seasons had a finale with two male contestants.\n\nContents show]\n\nAuditions Edit\n\nAuditions were held in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Atlanta, and Honolulu.\n\nThe early part of the season became well-known for the introduction of William Hung, a University of California, Berkeley student, who became popular following his rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\". His performance as well as his attitude facing judge Simon Cowell's criticisms (which was a stark contrast to other contestants' confrontational, angry reactions) made him instantly popular, and landed him a record deal with Koch Records.\n\nDuring the audition round in Houston, Texas, auditioner Jonathan Rey threw a cup of water at Simon, who moments earlier commented that he was terrible and \"there's not a song in the world you could sing.\" Security quickly escorted Jonathan out, and Houston police questioned him, but released him after Simon decided against pressing assault charges on him. The entire incident was caught on tape and was broadcast.\n\nHollywood rounds contestant Taryn Southern later appeared on the Project My World series and wrote and performed the 2007 \"Hott4Hill\" viral video.\n\nHollywood Edit\n\nThere were 117 contestants in the first Hollywood round which was held at the Pasadena Civic Center in Pasadena, California. The contestants first came onto the stage in groups but each performed solo and talked briefly about themselves. Simon Cowell was not impressed with their performances. They were also asked to write original lyrics and melody for one of ten song titles given and perform their song the next day. After their performance, they were divided into four groups and one groups is eliminated. In the next round, the remaining 87 contestants performed in groups in three. The girls and boys were separate and they were each given 3 different songs to choose - Girls with The Supremes' You Can't Hurry Love, Vonda Shepard's \"Tell Him\", Candi Staton's Young Hearts Run Free, the boys with Billy Joel's Tell Her About It, Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up, The Drifters's Up on the Roof. 30 contestants were cut and 57 then advanced to the next stage where they performed solo. The contestants were then divided into 3 group and placed in separate rooms, with one group sent home. 32 contestants remained for the semi-finals. Hollywood rounds contestant Taryn Southern later appeared on the Project My World series and wrote and performed the 2007 \"Hott4Hill\" viral video.\n\nThe contestants who reached this stage were referred to in the show as the Top 32 finalists. This is the first time that two contestants who previously tried out for American Idol (Matthew Metzger and Lisa Leuschner) made it to the top 3 of their semifinals group. Both contestants were eliminated during Hollywood round in the previous season. George Huff replaced Donnie Williams in Semifinal Round 4 after Williams was disqualified following a DUI arrest. Unlike previous seasons, this season the contestants performed in front of a small studio audience, with orchestra accompaniment on backing tape.
