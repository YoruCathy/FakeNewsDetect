There are going to be stories circulating, and you have to brace yourself for this.\u201d\n\nThough Faris, 40, didn\u2019t think it would bother her, as Pratt, 38, had worked with Aubrey Plaza on \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d and Bryce Dallas Howard in \u201cJurassic World,\u201d the \u201cMom\u201d actress noted how the \u201cfalse rumors\u201d made her feel \u201cinsecure.\u201d\n\n\u201cJennifer and I are really friendly, and she was apologetic even though she didn\u2019t need to be, because she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d Faris described. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome, but of course it\u2019s hurtful and also embarrassing when people are saying your husband is cheating on you, even if it\u2019s patently untrue. You still feel, and look, like a fool.\u201d\n\nFollowing a Star magazine report from 2015, Faris said she felt \u201cblindsided\u201d by rumors of Pratt\u2019s infidelity.\n\n\u201cWe have an incredible relationship, it has been weirdly stinging,\u201d Faris told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cThis has been blindsiding to us.\u201d\n\nDespite their united front, Faris and Pratt announced in August they were legally separating.\n\n\u201cWe tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed,\u201d the former pair posted on Facebook. \u201cOur son has two parents who love him very much, and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward.\u201d\n\nFaris and Pratt, who share 5-year-old son Jack, have since gone their separate ways. The \u201cScary Movie\u201d heroine has been spotted with cinematographer Michael Barrett.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/anna-faris1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/anna-faris1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/anna-faris1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/25/anna-faris-addresses-j-law-chris-pratt-cheating-rumors/", "title": "Anna Faris addresses J.Law, Chris Pratt cheating rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
