Doesn't Marvel have enough feel-good minority shows everyone supports but doesn't watch?\" Deadpool says. \"I mean, I think our show woulda been funny. I just wanted a place to be honest. And I guess that place is Freeform.\"\n\nWhile speaking with ET last August, Stephen said that the animated Deadpool series would include \u201csome ideas that are too crazy for Atlanta.
