(Photo: Ellen DeGeneres via Instagram)\n\nEllen DeGeneres is on the trip of a lifetime.\n\nFor her 60th birthday, the talk show host\u2019s wife, Portia de Rossi, surprised her with her own gorilla conservation center in Rwanda, which will be called the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, because DeGeneres is both an animal lover and a superfan of the late Fossey. So the couple has traveled to Africa together \u2014 you may have noticed that DeGeneres has guest hosts on her show \u2014 to see the site of the future campus and hang with gorillas and giraffes along the way.\n\nDeGeneres said she\u2019s been waiting her whole life to make the trek. She\u2019s said that the person she\u2019d most like to interview would be the Gorillas in the Mist author, who died in 1985. She\u2019s also said that as a kid, she read every word of a 1970 National Geographic cover story on Fossey that detailed her research camp in the Virunga Mountains of Rwanda.\n\nI\u2019ve waited my whole life to make this trip. pic.twitter.com/J2GNciu9Oy \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) May 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was thrilled to touch down in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce there, she got to sit at her hero\u2019s desk, a moving moment for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was more excited to spend time with the gorillas, watching them play and make gorilla noises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t begin to describe what this experience was like, or how much it means to me,\u201d DeGeneres wrote. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful.\u201d (Make sure you play this too because there are more great gorilla noises.)\n\n\n\n\n\nHer smile kinda says it all.\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Rossi was safari ready with her threads.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of our favorite photos that De Rossi shared (so far), though, was of DeGeneres taking a \u201ccoffee break\u201d during their safari. So casual!\n\n\n\n\n\nThe women hiked with the Fossey Fund CEO, Tara Stoinski, in their gorilla T-shirts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeGeneres and De Rossi also met with the president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, because this facility is a big deal. It will cost an estimated $10 million to complete; so far, the duo has raised about $8 million, including a mega donation of $4 million that Ashton Kutcher announced would be coming from tech company Ripple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey talked about gorilla conservation:\n\nVideo: President Kagame meets with Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi. pic.twitter.com/x3xepPnvv2 \u2014 Presidency | Rwanda (@UrugwiroVillage) May 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThe couple\u2019s African adventures began in Kenya, where they also got up close and personal with animals \u2014 that time, giraffes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was some flirting going on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey stayed at Giraffe Manor in Nairobi.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not sure we\u2019d be able to order either, with all that was going on.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re not saying this tops DeGeneres\u2019s infamous Oscars selfie, but it\u2019s close. (What can we say, we love giraffes.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Gorilla Fund website, DeGeneres\u2019s campus \u2014 which will feature 50,000 square feet of building space and a living lab on the grounds \u2014 will allow the organization to \u201cexpand our science, research, and conservation activities; enhance our educational and community programs; and engage people from Rwanda and the world to join the effort on behalf of wild gorillas.\u201d Depending on fundraising, the goal is to open the facility by 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0dwXRK33jMQRsH6_QIQJ4A--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO2ZpPWZpbGw7dz04NDtoPTg0O2lsPXBsYW5l/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-17/711f88c0-b37f-11e7-8353-c582c6383d28_oath_suzybyrne_03_7589.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lr5twXwhRHgmYM7CobKsRQ--~B/aD01OTg7dz00ODU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a0fc9a0f575ec40f34a95c1e3e63af65", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kW11AUiE44jtPXFjL96r1g--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NDg1O2g9NTk4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a0fc9a0f575ec40f34a95c1e3e63af65"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lr5twXwhRHgmYM7CobKsRQ--~B/aD01OTg7dz00ODU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a0fc9a0f575ec40f34a95c1e3e63af65", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Byrne", "Editor", "Yahoo Entertainment"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-spends-times-gorillas-giraffes-portia-life-changing-trip-africa-202748100.html", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres spends time with gorillas, giraffes, and Portia during life-changing trip to Africa", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#6e329d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_frontpage_en-US_s_f_w_bestfit_frontpage.png", "msvalidate.01": "A9862C0E6E1BE95BCE0BF3D0298FD58B", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#400090", "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "site": "@YahooEnt", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "For her 60th birthday, the talk show host's wife, Portia de Rossi, surprised her with her own gorilla conservation center in Rwanda, which will be called the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, because DeGeneres is both an animal lover and a superfan of the late Fossey.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lr5twXwhRHgmYM7CobKsRQ--~B/aD01OTg7dz00ODU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a0fc9a0f575ec40f34a95c1e3e63af65", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lr5twXwhRHgmYM7CobKsRQ--~B/aD01OTg7dz00ODU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a0fc9a0f575ec40f34a95c1e3e63af65"}, "title": "Ellen DeGeneres spends time with gorillas, giraffes, and Portia during life-changing trip to Africa"}, "application-name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Ellen DeGeneres, Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, Portia de Rossi, Dian Fossey, De Rossi, Rwanda", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=304158842,app-argument=yahoo://article/view?uuid=31e8ee55-b992-3abd-ba22-2e5274f464e9&src=web", "description": "For her 60th birthday, the talk show host's wife, Portia de Rossi, surprised her with her own gorilla conservation center in Rwanda, which will be called the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, because DeGeneres is both an animal lover and a superfan of the late Fossey.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lr5twXwhRHgmYM7CobKsRQ--~B/aD01OTg7dz00ODU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a0fc9a0f575ec40f34a95c1e3e63af65", "description": "For her 60th birthday, the talk show host's wife, Portia de Rossi, surprised her with her own gorilla conservation center in Rwanda, which will be called the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, because DeGeneres is both an animal lover and a superfan of the late Fossey.", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres spends time with gorillas, giraffes, and Portia during life-changing trip to Africa", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ellen-degeneres-spends-times-gorillas-giraffes-portia-life-changing-trip-africa-202748100.html"}, "fb": {"pages": 73756409831, "app_id": 458584288257241}, "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=31e8ee55-b992-3abd-ba22-2e5274f464e9&src=web"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=31e8ee55-b992-3abd-ba22-2e5274f464e9&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527884868.0, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
