As it turns out, though, they aren't the only ones.\n\nSpeaking at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem (via Variety), Fox TV group chair Gary Newman says Buffy is always on the studio's mind. \"I think if you look in our library, Buffy is probably the most ripe show we have for bringing back,\" he says.\n\nStill, just because the studio wants to do it doesn't mean it'll go ahead and give the green light without the approval of creator Joss Whedon. \"It's something we talk about frequently, and Joss Whedon is really one of the greatest creators we ever worked with. When Joss decides it's time, we'll do it,\" Newman explains. \"And until Joss decides it's time, it won't happen.\"\n\nHow big a role Whedon would play in any sort of revival or reboot is anyone's guess, but it's reassuring to know that the studio wouldn't move forward with it unless he signed on. Of course, given that Whedon recently left his role as writer and director of a potential Batgirl movie, perhaps a return to the small screen is in his future.\n\nWhy wait for a Buffy reboot or a revival with the original cast, though? Technically the story didn't conclude with the end of the series. In 2007, a continuation comic book was released and remains ongoing. Season 12, the fifth sequel series, is due to be released in June.", "images": ["https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/1578/15789737/3362818-buffythevampireslayer.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1664416907029093&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_large/1585/15855271/3655734-3652086-49746632758_b638804711_h.jpg", "https://dw.cbsi.com/clear/c.gif?ptid=6036&ednm=%7Bedition%7D&ursuid=%7Bursuid%7D&regSilo=2&rsid=cbsigamespotsite&prodtypid=8&pagetype=news_article&assetguid=1100-6457375&assettitle=Fox+Wants+A+Buffy+The+Vampire+Slayer+Revival+But+Not+Without+Joss+Whedon&assettype=Article&author%5B0%5D=gs-2100-15789737&topicbrcrm=News%7CNews+Article&sid=6&ts=1587300165", "https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/1578/15789737/3362817-buffythevampireslayer.jpg", "https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_large/43/434805/3657352-feature_gng_ep03_20200416_site.jpg", "https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_large/1554/15543289/3657059-1_1zs1fssqlmwezzfuxjmv8q.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/1578/15789737/3362817-buffythevampireslayer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris E.
