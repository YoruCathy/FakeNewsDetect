You just feel rotten and you\u2019re not allowed to say why,\u201d she explained to host Fallon. \u201cI was filming quite a lot and just inadvertently falling asleep all the time. It was just embarrassing.\u201d\n\nRevealing she \u201cface planted\u201d onto a crocheted bag in between takes, Danes noted that she had a rude awakening when it was time for her close up.\n\n\u201cI have this crocheted indentation all on the side of my face. It looked like I had third degree burns,\u201d she said of the marks. \u201cThey were massaging my face. They had to get out the blow dryer. I halted production for a good half an hour. I felt like an idiot.\u201d\n\nThese days, she\u2019s in the \u201ccruisy second trimester.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets a little excited when I have a chocolate bar. It\u2019s moving and kicking,\u201d she said of her second child. \u201cI love that part. It\u2019s like a fireworks show every so often. It\u2019s really cool and a little creepy. It is, it\u2019s like an alien being in there, cohabitating, yeah, AirBNB.\u201d\n\nDanes announced her second pregnancy during Howard Stern\u2019s SiriusXM show on Wednesday after being asked about the love scenes on Homeland, which airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Showtime.\n\nThe actress and her husband, Hugh Dancy, are already parents to 5-year-old son Cyrus.\n\nFor more from the couple, watch the clip below!\n\n'Homeland' Star Claire Danes Reveals 7 Secrets You Didn't Know About Her (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
