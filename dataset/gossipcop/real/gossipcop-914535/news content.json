She said she would put her powers to use to figure out what is going on between one-time inseparable besties Swift and Kloss.\n\n\"I\u2019d like to know what\u2019s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift, that\u2019s the honest to God truth,\" she said, according to People. She added that trying figure out \"what happened\" is \"keeping me up at night.\"\n\nIn case you need a refresher, rumors of a fallout between Swift and Kloss have been swirling for a while. Here's the evidence fans have pointed to as proof that the two aren't on good terms:\n\nExhibit A: Taylor leaves Karlie's name off her Junior Jewels shirt in her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video.\n\nYouTube\n\nThe shirt did feature the names of several of Swift's current squad, including Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran, Gigi Hadid, Lena Dunham, Martha Hunt, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds.\n\nExhibit B: Karlie captions an Instagram \"Swish Swish.\"\n\nThe post was a video of Karlie dribbling a basketball for a Love magazine shoot. The \"swish swish\" caption (which many interpreted to be a reference to the Katy Perry diss track widely believed to be about Taylor) drew so much criticism that Karlie changed it to \"nothing but net.\"\n\nExhibit C: Karlie hangs out with Katy Perry.\n\nIn early February, TMZ published photos of Katy and Karlie grabbing dinner with mutual friends and since it's apparently impossible to be friends with both Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, this was taken as damning evidence of a rift.\n\nAll Jennifer Lawrence needs is a little real-life spy training\u2014or a chance to interview Taylor or Karlie while subbing in for a late night host, maybe\u2014to get to the bottom of this.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts", "Kayleigh Roberts Is The Weekend Editor At Marie Claire", "Covering Celebrity", "Entertainment News", "Actual Royals Like Kate Middleton", "Meghan Markle To Hollywood Royalty", "Like Katie Holmes", "Chrissy Teigen."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a18222714/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-rumored-feud/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Says Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss' Rumored Feud Is \"Keeping Her Up at Night\"", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Says Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss' Rumored Feud Is \"Keeping Her Up at Night\"", "description": "She is INVESTED.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a18222714/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-rumored-feud/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-03-19 05:03:14", "published_time": "2018-02-18 05:16:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2020", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Worried About Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss - Jennifer Lawrence Wonders If Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss Are Still Friends", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence says Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss' rumored feud is keeping her up at night.", "keywords": "jennifer lawrence, taylor swift, karlie kloss, katy perry, taylor swift karlie kloss feud, are taylor swift and karlie kloss still friends", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,celebrities", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-18T17:16:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jennifer-lawrence-taylor-swift-karlie-kloss-1518972496.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Jennifer Lawrence Says Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss' Rumored Feud Is \"Keeping Her Up at Night\"", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518902160.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
