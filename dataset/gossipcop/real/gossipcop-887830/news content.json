While delicious, those lattes aren't quite as eye-catching as the Unicorn Frappe, the neon concoction of the spring.\n\nNever fear, Starbs isn't letting a season go by without giving you something to 'gram. Halloween's creepiest drink, the Vampire Frappuccino, is officially back in at least four countries. Sadly, the bloody-looking treat hasn't been spotted in the U.S. yet, but the U.K., Singapore, Norway and Sweden all have it in stores, E! Online reports.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, the drink starts with mocha sauce, then layers a mocha frappe with strawberry puree to create a blood effect. Most also have whipped cream and more \"blood\" drizzled on top.\n\nSingapore's stores are offering two slightly different versions this year: Mr. and Mrs. Vampire Frappuccino. The Mr. version has chocolatey cereal layered on top, while the Mrs. has a pump of vanilla syrup added.\n\nFor the first time ever, Mr and Mrs #VampireFrappuccino makes a special daytime appearance. \ud83c\udf83 Click link in bio for more info.

Last year, American Starbucks' locations brought back the Frappula a few days before Halloween, but only for a few days. And since the ingredients are available year round, you can technically order it any time you want. Just ask nicely, or the barista's fangs might come out.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/57e43fa5a1e30593008b4c91?width=150&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Flager"], "canonical_link": "http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a56187/vampire-frappucino-starbucks/", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "date": "2017-10-19", "news_keywords": "Contributor, Food, Delish, Starbucks, Frappuccino, Halloween, Dessert, Food Contributor, Madison Flager", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "author": "Madison Flager", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Food", "og": {"title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10", "image": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-19", "sailthru.tags": "Contributor, Food, Delish, Starbucks, Frappuccino, Halloween, Dessert, Food Contributor, Madison Flager", "sailthru.description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "sailthru.author": "Madison Flager", "sailthru.verticals": "food", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"bi8-lazy-load": "control", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "variant", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "control"}, "viking-id": "59e8d70a2f2d9241008b46b8", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508342400.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
