Television.\n\n2 Broke Girls has run its course at CBS.\n\nThe network has canceled the comedy after six seasons.\n\nOn the bubble for the first time, the Warner Bros. Television-produced multicam starring Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs was left off of CBS' 16-show renewal in March. The Michael Patrick King effort, while a critical punching bag, had been a sturdy performer for CBS. In its sixth season, the restaurant comedy averaged a 1.9 among adults 18-49 and 7 million total viewers. Sources say a short 13-episode order had been discussed for the series, which had been used on Mondays and Thursdays, but ultimately the network's lack of an ownership proved to be its demise.\n\nNetwork ownership has proven to be one of the biggest storylines this upfront season as broadcasters look to have a financial stake in programming amid dwindling ratings and ad dollars.\n\nDennings posted a note from herself and Behrs on social media late Friday about the cancelation: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a wonderful 6 seasons as Max and Caroline and we thank all of you for watching and enjoying it along with us. We are so proud of our time on 2 Broke Girls and of all the things this experience has given us, the most treasured is our lifelong friendship.\u201d\n\nThe decision to cancel 2 Broke Girls comes as CBS has a pretty stocked comedy inventory. The network has already handed out series orders for three new half-hours, including two produced by WBTV. Among them: a straight-to-series pickup for Big Bang Theory prequel Young Sheldon that is expected to air behind the flagship on Thursdays.\n\nKeep track of all the broadcast renewals, cancelations and series pickups with THR's handy scorecard.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2015/11/106887_d01448b_-_h_2015.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2015/11/106887_d01448b_-_h_2015.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/01/greg_berlanti_sharon_horgan_alex_kurtzman_and_dwayne_johnson_-_getty_-_h_2020.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/04/lesley_goldberg_0.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2020/03/mrs._america_-_publicity_still_1-_h_2020_.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/blogicon_livefeed-black2.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2015/11/106887_d01448b_-_h_2015.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", "Lesley.Goldberg Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/2-broke-girls-canceled-at-cbs-six-seasons-1003476", "title": "'2 Broke Girls' Canceled at CBS After Six Seasons", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The news comes after the network picked up two other shows from independent producers Warner Bros.
