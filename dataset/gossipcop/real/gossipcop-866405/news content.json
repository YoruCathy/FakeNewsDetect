He will be replaced by longtime show veteran Matt Vogel.\n\nThe spokesperson did not immediately comment on the reason for the switch.\n\nWhitmire, who first joined the Muppets in 1978, had served as the man behind the frog since the death of show creator Jim Henson in 1990. And as NPR's Rose Friedman notes, Whitmire wasn't just a one-Muppet man: He has also played Bert's best pal Ernie, Rizzo the Rat and Beaker, among other characters.\n\nThat said, Vogel has plenty of experience as well. He has voiced Sergeant Floyd Pepper, and The Associated Press notes that during his career he has also stepped into the roles of Big Bird and Count von Count.", "images": ["https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/24/undefined_sq-63f9f4b46bb9031d67f9785b66818f4befbab8bc.jpg?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/04/18/colindwyer_sq-e28a2355d0bdaccf437566c357a0ef6342442bc2-s100-c85.jpeg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-dark.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/07/11/ap_17192366363139_wide-233fb694553e1fd0ac3a16c4319ee8e3f6b437d7.jpg?s=1400", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesun_sq-4a03b35e7e5adfa446aec374523a578d54dc9bf5-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/07/06/screen-shot-2017-07-06-at-8.43.07-am_sq-41edbd790ba68906ca7f248e8544c54f25bd2973-s100-c15.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/morning-edition.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/up-first.jpg?version=2", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/07/11/ap_17192366363139_wide-233fb694553e1fd0ac3a16c4319ee8e3f6b437d7-s1100-c15.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/branding/sections/thetwo-way/branding_icon-aec8943f7fba654246d504d81ae2999f30b3106f.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/17/coronavirus_daily_final__sq-2aca96317281db7f8671e5bf24e68fb77b66bbed.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/02/21/invisibiliapodcasttile-3000x3000_sq-3cea16f264a5ecd812496bd930d38c4f54102d6e.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-light.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/09/trh_podcast-tile_sq-c05fb259465d433a5cf8a21248b8fa209a6b7690.png?s=100", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/all-things-considered.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesat_sq-cbde87a2fa31b01047441e6f34d2769b0287bcd4-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-logo.svg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/fresh-air.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/03/17/meet-julia---season-47-of-sesame-street---photo-credit-zach-hyman-6-_sq-90a9a5d351ae52247113fde38fac71e0af6914e5-s100-c15.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/07/11/ap_17192366363139_wide-233fb694553e1fd0ac3a16c4319ee8e3f6b437d7.jpg?s=1400", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Dwyer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/11/536656568/after-27-years-kermit-the-frog-is-getting-a-new-voice", "title": "After 27 Years, Kermit The Frog Is Getting A New Voice", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "1VqzbDm4ukeFVHOoq5LjIKA2fVKZD-EYv8cXZhKXSfU", "robots": "noarchive,index,follow", "Rating": "General", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "date": "2017-07-11", "description": "Puppeteer Steve Whitmire has voiced the iconic star of the Muppets since 1990, when he took over after show creator Jim Henson's death.
