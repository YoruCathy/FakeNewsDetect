Pipe in one hand, book in another, dressed all black save for an elegant red scarf, he slams a table and shames the Impressionists gathered around him: \u201cThey call themselves artists but behave like bureaucrats,\u201d he huffs after a theatrical exit. \u201cEach of them is a little tyrant.\u201d\n\nFrom a few tables away, another painter, Vincent van Gogh, watches in awe. He runs into the street after Gauguin like a puppy dog.\n\nWithin a year, a reluctant Gauguin would move in with van Gogh in a small town in the south of France, in the hope of fostering an artists\u2019 retreat away from stifling Paris. Eight emotionally turbulent weeks later, van Gogh would lop off his left ear with a razor, distraught that his dearest friend planned to leave him for good. He enclosed the bloody cartilage in wrapping marked \u201cremember me,\u201d intending to have it delivered to Gauguin by a frightened brothel madam as a bizarre mea culpa. The two never spoke again.\n\nOr so the last two years of Vincent van Gogh\u2019s life unspool in Julian Schnabel\u2019s At Eternity\u2019s Gate, itself a kind of lush, post-Impressionistic memoir of the Dutchman\u2019s tormented time in Arles, France. (Not to mention artistically fruitful time: Van Gogh churned out 200 paintings and 100 watercolors and sketches before the ear fiasco landed him in an insane asylum.)\n\nIsaac plays Gauguin like an irresistibly bad boyfriend, a bemused air of condescension at times wafting straight into the audience: \u201cWhy\u2019re you being so dramatic?\u201d he scoffs directly into the camera, inflicting a first-person sensation of van Gogh\u2019s insult and pain.\n\nYet in the painter\u2019s artistic restlessness, Isaac, 39, sees himself: \u201cThat desire to want to do something new, to want to push the boundaries, to not just settle for the same old thing and get so caught up with the minutia of what everyone thinks is fashionable in the moment.\u201d He talks about \u201cstaying true to your own idea of what\u2019s great.\u201d He talks about \u201cfinding something honest.\u201d\n\nFrom another actor, the sentiment might border on banal. But Oscar Isaac\u2014Guatemalan-born, Juilliard-trained and, in his four years since breaking through as film\u2019s most promising new leading man, christened superlatives from \u201cthis generation\u2019s Al Pacino\u201d to the \u201cbest dang actor of his generation\u201d\u2014might really have reason to mean what he says. He\u2019s crawling out the other end of a life-altering two years, one that\u2019s encompassed personal highs, like getting married and becoming a father, and an acutely painful low: losing a parent.\n\nHe basked in another Star Wars premiere, mined Hamlet for every dimension of human experience, and weathered the worst notices of his career with Life Itself. Through it all, he says, he\u2019s spent a lot of time in his head\u2014reevaluating who he is, what he wants, and what matters most.\n\nRight now, he\u2019s aiming for a year-long break from work, his first in a decade, after wrapping next December\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IX. \u201cI\u2019m excited to, like Gauguin, kind of step away from the whole thing for a bit and focus on things that are a bit more real and that matter to me,\u201d he says.\n\nUntil then, he\u2019s just trying \u201cto keep moving forward as positively as I can,\u201d easing into an altered reality. \u201cYou\u2019re just never the same,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cOn a cellular level, you\u2019re a completely different person.\u201d\n\nWhen we talk, Isaac is in New York for one day to promote and attend the New York Film Festival premiere of At Eternity\u2019s Gate. Then it\u2019s back on a plane to London, where Pinewood Studios and Star Wars await.\n\nEpisode IX, the last of Disney\u2019s new Skywalker trilogy, will see Isaac reprise the role of dashing Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whose close relationship with Carrie Fisher\u2019s General Leia evokes joy but also melancholy after Fisher\u2019s untimely passing.\n\nEach film was planned in part as a celebration and send-off to each of the original trilogy\u2019s most beloved heroes: in The Force Awakens, Han Solo (Harrison Ford); in The Last Jedi, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill); Fisher, meanwhile, had hoped to save Leia\u2019s spotlight for last but passed unexpectedly long before filming began. Director J.J. Abrams, returning to close the trilogy he opened with Episode VII, has since said that unseen footage of Fisher from that previous film will ensure the General appears, however briefly.\n\nFor his part, Isaac promises the still-untitled ninth film will pay appropriate homage to Leia\u2014and to Fisher\u2019s sense of fun. \u201cThe story deals with that quite a bit,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to be on the set and to be speaking of Leia and having Carrie not be around. There\u2019s definitely some pain in that.\u201d Still, he says, compared to the first two installments, \u201cthere\u2019s a looseness and an energy to the way that we\u2019re shooting this that feels very different.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really fun being back with J.J., with all of us working in a really close way. I just feel like there\u2019s an element of almost senioritis, you know?\u201d he laughs. \u201cSince everything just feels way looser and people aren\u2019t taking it quite as seriously, but still just having a lot of fun. I think that that energy is gonna translate to a really great movie.\u201d\n\nFisher\u2019s absence is felt keenly on set, Isaac says. As if to reassure us both, however, he reiterates: \u201cIt deals with the amazing character that Carrie created in a really beautiful way.\u201d\n\nTwo months after Fisher\u2019s death, Isaac\u2019s mother, Eugenia, passed away after an illness. A month after that, the actor married his girlfriend, the Danish documentarian Elvira Lind. Another month later, the couple welcomed their first son, named Eugene to honor the little boy\u2019s grandmother. Work offered a way for a reeling Isaac to process.\n\nThere was his earth-shaking run at Hamlet, in which Isaac starred as the titular prince in mourning at New York\u2019s Public Theater. And then there was writer-director Dan Fogelman\u2019s Life Itself, a film met with reviews that near-unanimously recoiled from its \u201ccheesy,\u201d \u201coverwrought\u201d structure, filled with what one critic called the genuine emotion of \u201ca damage-control ExxonMobil commercial.\u201d\n\nThe reaction surprised Isaac. \u201cI thought it was some of my strongest work,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially at that moment in my life. This guy is dealing with grief and, for me, it was a really honest way of trying to understand those emotions and to create a character who was also going through just incomprehensible grief.\u201d He\u2019s proud of the performance\u2014and, in a strange way, heartened by the sour critical response.\n\n\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says brightly, \u201cthere was something really comforting about it.\u201d That the work \u201cfor me, meant something and for others, didn\u2019t at all, it just made the whole thing not matter so much in a great way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was able to explore something and come out the other end and feel like I grew as an actor,\u201d he explains. \u201cThat matters to me a lot. And the response to that, you know, it\u2019s interesting of course, but it was a great example for me of how it really doesn\u2019t dictate how I then feel about what I did.\u201d\n\nHe thinks for a moment of performances and projects that, conversely, embarrassed him\u2014ones that to his shock, boasted \u201creally great notices\u201d in the end. \u201cYou just never know, you know? It\u2019s completely out of my control.\u201d\n\nIsaac is an encouraging listener in conversation, doling out interested yeahs and uh-huhs, and often warm, self-deprecating laughter. When I broach a particularly personal subject, he seems to sit up\u2014somehow, suddenly more present. It\u2019s about his last name.\n\n\u00d3scar Isaac Hern\u00e1ndez Estrada dropped both surnames before enrolling at Juilliard in 2001. He\u2019d run into several \u00d3scar Hern\u00e1ndezes at auditions by that point, and taken note of the stereotypes casting directors seemed to have in mind for them\u2014gangsters, drug dealers, and the like. So he made a change, not unlike many actors do.\n\n\u201c I think for a lot of immigrants, the idea is that you don\u2019t always just want to be thought of as other. \u201d\n\nWhether \u00d3scar Hern\u00e1ndez might have had a crack at the astonishingly diverse roles Oscar Isaac has inhabited, we\u2019ll never know. But given Hollywood\u2019s limiting tendencies, it is less likely he\u2019d have played an English king for Ridley Scott in 2010\u2019s Robin Hood, four years before his breakthrough role as a cantankerous folk singer in Joel and Ethan Coen\u2019s Inside Llewyn Davis. He was an Armenian genocide survivor in last year\u2019s The Promise, an Israeli secret agent in August\u2019s Operation Finale, and now, he\u2019s the Frenchman Paul Gauguin.\n\nStar Wars\u2019 Poe Dameron, meanwhile, or the mysterious tech billionaire in Alex Garland\u2019s Ex Machina, or the army commando in his second Garland mind-twist, Annihilation, specify no ethnicities at all. It\u2019s the dream: to be hailed as a great actor, period. Not a \u201cgreat Latino actor\u201d first. To be seen for your talent, and as \u201cother\u201d rarely at all.\n\nThere\u2019s a crawl space between those distinctions, though, where another anxiety lives. The one that makes you wonder: Am I \u201crepresenting\u201d as loudly as I should? Am I obliged to at all? If I don\u2019t, what does that make me? Isaac listens attentively. Then for several unbroken minutes, talks it out with himself.\n\nHe rewinds to yesterday, when he boarded a plane from London on which an air steward addressed him repeatedly as \u201cse\u00f1or,\u201d unbidden. \u201cIt was just a little weird. So I started calling him \u2018se\u00f1or\u2019 as well. I was like, thank you, se\u00f1or!\u201d Isaac recalls, cracking up. \u201cBut then at the same time, I had that thought. I was like, but no, I should really, you know, be proud of being a se\u00f1or, I guess?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think for a lot of immigrants, the idea is that you don\u2019t always just want to be thought of as other. Like, I don\u2019t want him to be just calling me \u2018se\u00f1or.\u2019 Why?\u201d he asks, more of the steward than himself. \u201cBecause I look like I do, so I\u2019m not a mystery anymore? It did bring up all those kinds of questions.\u201d\n\nHe grew up in the United States, he explains; his family came over from Guatemala City when Isaac was 5 months old. \u201cI\u2019m most definitely Latino. That\u2019s who I am. But at the same time, for an actor it\u2019s like, I want to be hired not because of what I can represent, but because of what I can create, how I can transform, and the power of what I create.\u201d\n\nStill, Isaac exists in the year 2018 with the rest of us. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd I know that we live in a politically charged time. There\u2019s so much terrible language, particularly right now, being used against Latinos as a kind of political weapon.\u201d He recognizes, too, the necessity \u201cfor people to see people that look like them, because that\u2019s a very inspiring thing.\u201d\n\nAs a kid, Isaac looked up to Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1, the Puerto Rican-born actor and Broadway star whose breakthrough movie role came as Gomez Addams of the \u201990s Addams Family films. \u201cBut I looked up to him particularly because he was a Latino that wasn\u2019t being pigeonholed just in Latino parts,\u201d Isaac adds.\n\n\u201cI do think there is a separation between the artist and the art form, between a craftsperson and the craft.\u201d For himself, he calls it \u201cthat double thing,\u201d as apt a term as any for that peculiar tension: \u201cLike yes, I am who I am, I came from where I come from. But my interest isn\u2019t just in showing people stuff about myself, because I don\u2019t find me to be all that interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is more interesting to me is the work that I\u2019m able to do, and all that time that I spent learning how to do Shakespeare and how to break down plays and try to create a character and do accents,\u201d he says. \u201cThat, for me, is what\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s always that \u201cdouble thing\u201d\u2014reconciling two pulls and finding a way not to get torn up. He wants American Latinos \u201cto know, to be proud that there is someone from there that is out and doing work and being recognized not just for being a Latino that\u2019s been able to do that.\u201d On the other hand, he\u2019s \u201cjust like any artist who\u2019s out there doing something. I feel like that\u2019s\u2026\u201d He pauses. \u201cThat\u2019s also something to be proud of, you know?\u201d\n\nIsaac\u2019s focus lands on me again. \u201cAnd I think for you too, you\u2019re a writer and that\u2019s what you do. You\u2019re a journalist. Your identity is also part of that, but I think that you want the work to stand on its own, too.\u201d\n\nHis older sister, Nicole, is \u201can incredible scientist. She\u2019s at the forefront of climate change and particularly how it affects Latino communities and low-income areas. And she is a Latina scientist, but she\u2019s a scientist, you know? She\u2019s a great scientist without the qualifier of where she\u2019s from. And that\u2019s also very important.\u201d\n\nPaul Gauguin\u2019s life after van Gogh\u2019s death by gunshot at 37 revealed more repugnant depths than his dick-ish insensitivity.\n\nHe defected from Paris again, this time to the South Pacific, determined to break from the staid art scene once and for all. He \u201cmarried\u201d three adolescent brides, two of them 14 years old and the other 13, infecting each girl with syphilis and settling into a private compound he dubbed Maison de Jouir, or \u201cHouse of Orgasms.\u201d \u201cPretty gnarly, nasty stuff,\u201d Isaac concedes, though he withholds judgment of the man in his performance onscreen.\n\nTo do so might have made his Gauguin\u2014alluring, haughty, insufferable, brilliant\u2014\u201cnot quite as complex.\u201d Opposite Willem Dafoe\u2019s divinely wounded depiction of van Gogh, however, he found room to play. \u201cIt was interesting to ask, well, what\u2019s the kind of person that would feel that he\u2019s entitled to do those kinds of things?\u201d The man onscreen is an asshole, to be sure, but hardly paints the word \u201csociopath\u201d onto a canvas. He\u2019s simply human: \u201cI think that anyone has at least the capacity to do\u201d what Gauguin did, Isaac reasons.\n\nThe actor has had more than one reason to think on a person\u2019s capacity to do terrible things in the last year. Two men he\u2019s worked with\u2014his Show Me a Hero director, Paul Haggis, and X-Men: Apocalypse helmer Bryan Singer\u2014were both accused of sexual assault in the last year, part of a torrent of unmasked misconduct Hollywood\u2019s Me Too movement brought to national attention.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing,\u201d Isaac says, \u201cbecause you get offered jobs all the time and, I guess, what\u2019s required now? What kind of background checks can someone do beforehand? There isn\u2019t a ton.\u201d (Just ask Olivia Munn.) \u201cEspecially as an actor, to make sure that the people you\u2019re working with, surrounding yourself with, haven\u2019t done something in their past that I guess will make you seem somehow like you\u2019re propping up bad behavior.\u201d\n\nCarefully, he expresses reservations about the phenomenon of the last year. \u201cPeople don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re getting justice through any kind of legal system, so they take it to the streets,\u201d he ventures. \u201cIt\u2019s basically street justice. You have no other option. And what happens when you take it to the streets is that damage occurs, and sometimes people get taken down, things get destroyed that you feel like maybe shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut some of it had to happen, and hopefully now there\u2019ll be more of a system in place to take these things seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seems like it is starting to happen more, but then you see things like, how can this person get away with it? How can that person? It just boggles the mind.\u201d\n\nHe pulls back again, remembering what\u2019s out of his control.\n\nTomorrow, he\u2019ll be back in an X-Wing suit, as Poe struggles to accept the same truth. In a year, he\u2019ll be home in New York with his wife and young son, focusing on matters more \u201creal\u201d than Hollywood, its artists, and its art. Whatever he chooses whenever he returns, he\u2019ll be ready\u2014for the critics, the questions, for this new reality.\n\n\u201cAll I can do is just do what means something to me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to find something honest.\u201d One expects he will.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1491366997/author/Melissa-Leon.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1542694242/181116-leon-oscar-isaac-tease_hzbfvn", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1542694242/181116-leon-oscar-isaac-tease_hzbfvn"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1542694242/181116-leon-oscar-isaac-tease_hzbfvn", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Leon", "Entertainment Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/oscar-isaac-on-the-pain-of-losing-carrie-fisher-and-anti-latino-hysteria-in-the-age-of-trump", "title": "Oscar Isaac on the \u2018Pain\u2019 of Losing Carrie Fisher and Anti-Latino Hysteria in the Age of Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Oscar Isaac on the \u2018Pain\u2019 of Losing Carrie Fisher and Anti-Latino Hysteria in the Age of Trump", "keywords": "Art, Carrie Fisher, Star Wars, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Vincent van Gogh, J.J.
