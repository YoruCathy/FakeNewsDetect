It was so hard to keep my mouth shut,\u201d Rice said. \u201cBut, then I got another surprise when I went in for my first ultrasound at 12 weeks and the baby didn\u2019t have a heartbeat, so no more baby and I had a miscarriage, so that was really hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think for the first time in my entire life, I felt sorrow. I had felt grief before. I felt loss,\u201d said the reality star, who married boyfriend Landon Patterson in May 2015. \u201cThis was an experience that I didn\u2019t know what this feeling was.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Sarah Rice\n\n\u201cLandon was the one who said\u2026 you felt grief, this is sorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain it away. Okay well, there\u2019s something chromosomally abnormal with the baby so your body does what it\u2019s supposed to do, which is terminate the pregnancy so that you can only have healthy babies.\u201d\n\nAlthough she understands that the miscarriage was her body\u2019s natural response, she said her emotional responses were not in tune with her body at all.\n\nRELATED: Jenni \u2018JWoww\u2019 Farley Reveals She Had a Miscarriage in 2011: \u2018I Couldn\u2019t Handle Life\u2019\n\n\u201cYour body doesn\u2019t communicate that to your emotional side at all. What was really traumatizing for me was that the baby stopped growing at about nine weeks and I didn\u2019t find out \u2019til 12 weeks and so, I felt like a coffin and then that I was, like, loving and romanticizing something that had been dead inside me,\u201d she said. \u201cThey said my mind wasn\u2019t convinced that I wasn\u2019t pregnant, but my body was.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Not once. This really is the last taboo of what we\u2019re not able to just talk about,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, God I have to talk about this. This was so much more upsetting than I thought it was going to be.\u201d\n\nWhile it took her time to overcome her trauma from losing her child, as well as the procedure she underwent, Rice said, \u201cThere is a light at the end of the tunnel \u2026 I feel better.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

In the latest episode of the @braincandypodcast, I share our story. It wasn\u2019t easy, but I hope it lets other women out there know they are not alone.\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fsarah-rice-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fsarah-rice-landon.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fsarah-rice-landon.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/the-challenge-sarah-rice-suffered-miscarriage/", "title": "The Challenge's Sarah Rice Reveals She Suffered a Miscarriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Babies,Miscarriages,News,The Challenge,TV,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Babies,Miscarriages,News,The Challenge,TV,TV Watch", "description": "\"There is a light at the end of the tunnel,\" Sarah Rice said", "og": {"title": "The Challenge's Sarah Rice Reveals She Suffered a Miscarriage: 'I Felt Like a Coffin'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/the-challenge-sarah-rice-suffered-miscarriage/", "description": "The Challenge\u2018s Sarah Rice is opening up about her devastating miscarriage.
