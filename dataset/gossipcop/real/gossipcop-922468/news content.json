According to Daily Mail, the actor was photographed with two of her six children, Zahara, 13 and Knox, 9, at Whole Foods in Los Angeles. Besides being a welcome glimpse of the star, it also gave us some insight into what she and her family eat.\n\nMore: Blue Apron Is About to Take Their Service in an Exciting New Direction\n\nMuch like the rest of us, Jolie didn\u2019t seem to go especially wild at Whole Foods and stuck with a lot of the basics. Oatmeal, veggies and some snacks. Maybe she\u2019s heard the store referred to as \u201cwhole paycheck\u201d too and didn\u2019t want to end up dropping the well-earned tens of millions she\u2019s probably raking in for Maleficent 2 on an assortment of organic marmalades (she made a hot $20 million for the first film.)\n\nMore: McDonald\u2019s Knows We Love Caramel So Much, They Debuted New Turtle Drinks\n\nUnlike the rest of us, Jolie looked chic as heck, wearing all black with a loosely-fitted trench coat (is this the secret to essentially wearing a robe in public? Because if so, we are all about it) and pants, and some very cool Fendi sunglasses. She was also dressed in stiletto boots, which is not how we\u2019d typically refer to our grocery-shopping slippers.\n\nMore: Starbucks Is Conjuring Up a Magical New Frappuccino\n\nHere\u2019s the list of everything the photographer was able to spot in Jolie\u2019s cart:\n\n365 plain oatmeal\n\nNature\u2019s Path maple-brown sugar oatmeal\n\nBrussels sprouts\n\n365 applesauce\n\nDoes this seem like the cart of a busy mom who just needs some staples in the house for when her kids get hungry? Totally. But if we were her, next time, we\u2019d live a little and splurge on some chips and guac.", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/trader-joes-frozen-food.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/knot-tying-tool-e1586643810720.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/qqlpxoxotwwc9e24unv6.jpeg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.sheknows.com&path=%2Ffood-and-recipes%2Farticles%2F1138793%2Fwhat-angelina-jolie-buys-at-whole-foods%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1138793", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/miley-cyrus-liam-chris-hemsworth-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ina-garten-pantry-recipes.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/vdqdaabfibqecdonixen.jpeg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-86143102.jpg?quality=98&w=330#038;ssl=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/healthy-choice-recall-frozen-food.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/giada-de-laurentiis.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/qqlpxoxotwwc9e24unv6.jpeg?w=695&h=391&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chrissy-teigen-1-1.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/lady-gaga-super-bowl.jpg?quality=98&w=330", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starbucks-cinderella-latte.jpg?w=445&h=250&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/qqlpxoxotwwc9e24unv6.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colleen Stinchcombe"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/food-and-recipes/articles/1138793/what-angelina-jolie-buys-at-whole-foods/", "title": "Here\u2019s What Angelina Jolie Gets on a Run to Whole Foods \u2013 SheKnows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Angelina Jolie is just like us when she shops at Whole Foods.", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "author": "Colleen_Stinchcombe", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "A peek at what's in Angelina Jolie's Whole Foods cart", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/food-and-recipes/articles/1138793/what-angelina-jolie-buys-at-whole-foods/", "description": "Angelina Jolie is just like us when she shops at Whole Foods.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/qqlpxoxotwwc9e24unv6.jpeg", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-23T14:10:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-10T00:19:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "A peek at what's in Angelina Jolie's Whole Foods cart"}, "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/qqlpxoxotwwc9e24unv6.jpeg?w=1024", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SheKnows", "creator": "@castinchcombe", "title": "A peek at what's in Angelina Jolie's Whole Foods cart", "description": "Angelina Jolie is just like us when she shops at Whole Foods."}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/cropped-sk-favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521814200.0, "source": "https://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
