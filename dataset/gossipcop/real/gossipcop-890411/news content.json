But I don't, like, squirm away initially, because I'm like, 'What's going on?' And then he lays down on top of me,\" Rapp said in a BuzzFeed article published Sunday.\n\nSpacey, who said he doesn't remember the incident, nonetheless apologized for his \"deeply inappropriate drunken behavior\" in a post on Twitter later that night. In his tweet, he also revealed that he has \"loved and had romantic encounters with men\" and that he chooses \"now to live as a gay man.\"\n\nDespite his apology, which was widely criticized for his coming out under these circumstances, the producers of his Netflix show \"House of Cards\" announced today that they were suspending production on the show.\n\n\"MRC and Netflix have decided to suspend production on HOUSE OF CARDS season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew,\" Netflix and Media Rights Capital, the studio that created \"House of Cards\" with the streaming service, said in a joint statement.\n\nOn Monday, the producers said they were meeting with the cast and crew to \"ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported,\" adding that \"Spacey is not working on the set at this time.\"\n\nNetflix also confirmed to ABC News that the upcoming season 6 would be the series' last. A Netflix representative confirmed to ABC News that the decision to end the show after season six was made before the scandal broke.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/kevin-spacey-awards-gty-ps-171031_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/kevin-spacey-awards-gty-ps-171031_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Luchina Fisher", "October", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kevin-spacey-receive-international-emmy-allegation-sexual-advance/story?id=50832824", "title": "Kevin Spacey will not receive international Emmy after allegation of sexual advance on 14-year-old", "meta_data": {"description": "The International Academy made the announcement Monday night.", "keywords": "kevin spacey, emmy, sexual misconduct", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
