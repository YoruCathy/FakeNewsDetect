Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, and Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an adorable photo of the couple from their wedding day.\n\n\u201cSeven years ago today \u2013 thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding anniversary!,\u201d the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible.\n\nThe royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom\u2019s father, Prince Charles. The car was decorated by William\u2019s best man, his brother Prince Harry and it was adorned with red heart balloons, balloons with their initials and a license plate with the words \u201cJU5T WED.\u201d\n\nThe pair received quite the anniversary present this year \u2014 they welcomed their third child less than a week ago. The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis Arthur Charles in London on Monday, April 23. The baby, who is fifth in line to the British throne, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. They are also the parents of Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2.\n\nAs previously reported, William, 35, will act as his little brother\u2019s best man when Harry, 33, weds Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle on May 19. Us Weekly exclusively revealed in December 2017 that Harry had asked his older brother to be his best man and Kensington Palace confirmed it on Thursday, April 26.\n\n\u201cPrince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor on May 19th.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cPrince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.\u201d\n\nWilliam will have his own shot at decorating the Suits alum and Harry\u2019s wedding car and revealing embarrassing secrets about his brother during his speech at the reception. \u201cIt feels great. I\u2019m thrilled and delighted obviously. Revenge is sweet. I\u2019ll be looking forward to it,\u201d William joked at the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London on Thursday.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-william-kate-anniversary.jpg?crop=127px%2C105px%2C1789px%2C1012px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-william-kate-anniversary.jpg?crop=230px%2C113px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-william-kate-anniversary.jpg?crop=230px%2C113px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/duchess-kate-prince-william-celebrate-7th-anniversary-with-cute-pic/", "title": "Duchess Kate, Prince William Celebrate 7th Anniversary With Cute Pic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh anniversary on Sunday, April 29 with an adorable photo from their wedding day \u2014 see the pic", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Duchess Kate and Prince William Celebrate 7th Anniversary With Cute Pic", "description": "Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh anniversary on Sunday, April 29 with an adorable photo from their wedding day \u2014 see the pic", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/duchess-kate-prince-william-celebrate-7th-anniversary-with-cute-pic/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-30T18:44:23+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-william-kate-anniversary.jpg?crop=230px%2C113px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-william-kate-anniversary.jpg?crop=230px%2C113px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Royals", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-04-29T17:43:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-30T18:44:23+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh anniversary on Sunday, April 29 with an adorable photo from their wedding day \u2014 see the pic", "title": "Duchess Kate and Prince William Celebrate 7th Anniversary With Cute Pic", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-william-kate-anniversary.jpg?crop=230px%2C113px%2C1661px%2C871px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525023814.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
