The film requires her to go nude \u2015 a first for the actress, and something she said \u201cscared the hell out of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to do the movie without nudity but realized it just wouldn\u2019t be right to put the character through something that I, myself, am not willing to go through,\u201d Lawrence told Vanity Fair for the March edition cover story.\n\nBut her decision was that much more difficult in light of a photo hack back in August 2014 that targeted her and other celebrities like Kate Upton, and leaked intimate photos of them on the internet.\n\nVanity Fair Jennifer Lawrence covers Vanity Fair's March 2018 issue.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear was that people would say, \u2018Oh, how can you complain about the hack if you\u2019re going to get nude anyway?\u2019\u201d Lawrence said.\n\nThe photo hacker has since been sentenced to 18 months in prison for using fraudulent email addresses to gain access to various iCloud and Gmail accounts.\n\nLawrence previously described the photo-hack experience as being \u201cgang-banged by the f**king planet.\u201d But going nude in \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d she said, was about feeling empowered on her own terms.\n\n\u201cOne is my choice,\u201d she explained to Vanity Fair. \u201cI got something back that was taken from me, and it also felt normal.\u201d\n\nKarwai Tang via Getty Images Jennifer Lawrence attends the European Premiere of \"Red Sparrow.\"\n\nThe spy film reunited Lawrence with \u201cHunger Games\u201d director Francis Lawrence, who she said helped her adjust to some potentially uncomfortable moments on set.\n\n\u201cHe looked me right in the eyes like I had clothes on and then all of a sudden I was like, \u2018Oh, O.K., it\u2019s just like I have clothes on,\u2019\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cEverybody here is professional. You\u2019re still at work. One look just made me comfortable. It didn\u2019t make me feel naked.\u201d\n\nStill, Lawrence admitted there was something icky about baring it all in front of a crew she\u2019s worked with since the first installment in the dystopian \u201cHunger Games\u201d trilogy.\n\n\u201cThey all knew me since I was a baby,\u201d Lawrence said, adding that she teased crew members after filming wrapped, telling them, \u201cI hope you guys feel creepy.\u201d\n\nDave J Hogan via Getty Images Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Lawrence attend a \"Red Sparrow\" photocall.\n\nThe role also required her to get in ballerina-ready physical condition and undergo months of serious training to make the dancing scenes look believable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered what it would take to get me to really diet, to really be hungry, because I\u2019ve never done it for a movie,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cFor \u2018Hunger Games,\u2019 they told me to lose weight, and then I discovered Jack in the Box. \u2018Red Sparrow\u2019 was the first time that I was really hungry, and disciplined. I can\u2019t be in character as an ex-ballerina and not feel like an ex-ballerina.\u201d\n\nLawrence previously opened up about being told to stand in a nude photo lineup for an audition early in her career to shame her into losing weight. But her days of dieting without relief and subscribing to Hollywood\u2019s toxic beauty standards are over.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t work on a diet. I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m standing on my feet. I need more energy,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember having a meltdown, freaking out that I had eaten five banana chips.\u201d\n\nRead Lawrence\u2019s full interview at Vanity Fair.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a956e092000003800eb017e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9570111f0000510016896c.jpeg?cache=lputbcs0cw&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9567382000003800eb016f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc855a6240000090c524d4f.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9571101f00002c00168970.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9570111f0000510016896c.jpeg?cache=lputbcs0cw&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-lawrence-red-sparrow-nude-photo-hack_n_5a9566b0e4b0699553cc7ee0", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Defends Nude Scene After Photo Hack: 'One Is My Choice'", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I got something back that was taken from me.\"", "keywords": "Arts and Entertainment,Celebrities,Jennifer Lawrence,nudity,Red Sparrow,photo hack", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Lawrence Defends Nude Scene After Photo Hack: 'One Is My Choice'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9570111f0000510016896c.jpeg?cache=lputbcs0cw&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9570111f0000510016896c.jpeg?cache=lputbcs0cw&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jennifer-lawrence-red-sparrow-nude-photo-hack_n_5a9566b0e4b0699553cc7ee0", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"I got something back that was taken from me.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Arts and Entertainment,Celebrities,Jennifer Lawrence,nudity,Red Sparrow,photo hack", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-27 10:48:46 -0500", "modified_time": "2018-02-27 10:48:46 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Defends Nude Scene After Photo Hack: 'One Is My Choice'", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a9570111f0000510016896c.jpeg?cache=lputbcs0cw&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"I got something back that was taken from me.\"", "creator": "cdelbyck"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a9566b0e4b0699553cc7ee0", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519746526.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
