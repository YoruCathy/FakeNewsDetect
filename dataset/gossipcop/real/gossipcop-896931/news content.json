Over a year after Prince William\u2019s father revealed that he was planting trees with his grandson Prince George, Kate Middleton also admitted that she is teaching her four-year-old son and daughter Princess Charlotte, two, how to garden. The Duchess of Cambridge made the revelation on Wednesday, November 29, during a visit to London\u2019s Robin Hood Primary School to see its gardening campaign.\n\nIn a speech, the 35-year-old shared, \"I've got such fond memories of being in the garden and being outside from my own childhood, and I'm sharing that with my own children, George and Charlotte, at the moment.\"\n\nCLICK FOR FULL GALLERY\n\nVIEW GALLERY The Duchess planted with children during the November 29 engagement Photo: Eddie Mulholland - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n\"It's been lovely to meet all of you and thank you so much to all the children who've shown me what they've been doing in their gardens. It's really inspiring and exciting to see what you've all been up to. I'm really excited about what you're doing here and taking inspiration from that in the school environment as well,\u201d she added. \"What you have created here is really so special. Hopefully you'll have lots of memories of your time here in the garden, looking for insects or planting bulbs. And I really hope you remember these special times for the rest of your lives.\u201d\n\nGALLERY: KATE MIDDLETON'S MATERNITY STYLE\n\nDuring the engagement, Kate helped children at the school plant winter bulbs.
