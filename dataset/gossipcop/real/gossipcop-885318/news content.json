Not blew my load.\"\n\n\n\nKit Harington and Rose Leslie are living the fairy tale ending their \"Game of Thrones\" characters never got to see. After dating for several years, the happy couple is now engaged to be married.\n\nUnfortunately for \"Game of Thrones\" fans hoping to hear a romantic proposal story, Harington flubbed a key turn of phrase when he told the tale to Jonathan Ross during a taping for his upcoming October 7 episode.\n\nAs reported by The Sun, Harington said the proposal didn't go as he'd planned.\n\n\"I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,\" Harington reportedly told Jonathan Ross.\n\nThen he laughed and said, \"Sorry that's a really bad expression. I was meant to [propose] the day after with the lights. What I meant to say was, I popped my question a bit early. Not blew my load.\"\n\nHarington and Rose met on the \"Game of Thrones\" set in 2012.
