Spoilers ahead, read on to see which pair failed to make the cut.\n\nWho Performed What?\n\nTo get into the Halloween spirit, the celebrities and professional dancers worked hard to prepare a lineup of hauntingly good routines. Some dances truly hit the mark, including Milo Manheim's performance with partner Witney Carson. Their routine earned a whopping perfect score from judges. Then, there were some that didn't earn the judges's stamp of approval like John Schneider and Emma Slater's effort. With this in mind, here is what all nine couples danced to:\n\nAlexis Ren and Alan Bersten. Jazz, \"Candyman\" by Christina Aguilera.\n\nJazz, \"Candyman\" by Christina Aguilera. Bobby Bones and Sharna Burgess. Argentine Tango, \"Mr. Sandman\" by SYML.\n\nArgentine Tango, \"Mr. Sandman\" by SYML. DeMarcus Ware and Lindsay Arnold. Salsa, \"Under Your Spell\" by Leo Soul.\n\nSalsa, \"Under Your Spell\" by Leo Soul. Evanna Lynch and Keo Motsepe. Tango, to \"Disturbia\" by Rihanna.\n\nTango, to \"Disturbia\" by Rihanna. Joe Amabile and Jenna Johnson. Argentine Tango, \"El Tango de Roxanne\" from Moulin Rouge.\n\nArgentine Tango, \"El Tango de Roxanne\" from Moulin Rouge. John Schneider and Emma Slater. Paso Dobl\u00e9, \"Main Titles\" from Beetlejuice.\n\nPaso Dobl\u00e9, \"Main Titles\" from Beetlejuice. Juan Pablo Di Pace and Cheryl Burke. Jive, \"Dead Man's Party\" by Atwater Men's Club.\n\nJive, \"Dead Man's Party\" by Atwater Men's Club. Mary Lou Retton and Sasha Farber. Tango, \"Shame\" by Elle King.\n\nTango, \"Shame\" by Elle King. Milo Manheim and Witney Carson. Contemporary, \"Toxic\" by 2WEI.\n\nWhich Couple Was Eliminated?\n\nABC/Craig Sjodin\n\nNot all couples succeeded in entrancing the judges and viewers with their spelling-binding routine. After receiving low votes from fans, Mary Lou Retton and Sasha Farber will no longer be competing to win the coveted Mirrorball Trophy.\n\nOddsmakers at Gold Derby initially predicted Amabile and Johnson's luck had halted. In previous weeks, the Bachelor in Paradise alum continued to earn low scores from judges. Amabile, however, had been repeatedly saved by his loyal fanbase. Amabile and Johnson earned a 22 on Monday, which was their highest score yet.\n\n\"He's the front-runner to be eliminated with leading odds of 5/1,\" Gold Derby's Daniel Montgomery wrote Monday. \"It's possible he would have gone home last week on Disney Night based on scores and votes, but he wasn\u2019t in jeopardy then either\u2014DeMarcus Ware and Alexis Ren were instead.\"\n\nCouples who survived Week 6 of Season 27 will have to prepare to enter the semi-finals.\n\nWho Else Has Been Eliminated So Far?\n\nWhile no contestants were eliminated in Week 5, Dancing with the Stars devotees have had to say farewell to the following four couples:\n\nNikki Glaser and Gleb Savchenko [Week 1]\n\nDanelle Umstead and Artem Chigvintsev [Week 2]\n\nNancy McKeon and Val Chmerkovskiy [Week 3]\n\nTinashe and Brandon Armstrong [Week 4]\n\nTinashe and Armstrong's elimination came as a surprise since oddsmakers initially pegged the couple as Season 27's frontrunner. Before Season 27 began, SportsBettingDime.com's Sascha Paruk suggested to Newsweek that Tinashe had an advantage over her competitors because the singer was the \"only contestant with significant dance training.\"\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
