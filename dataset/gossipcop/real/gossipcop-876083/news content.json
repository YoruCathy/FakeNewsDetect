Especially when it\u2019s as adorable as Gal Gadot and Chris Pine\u2019s friendship after co-starring in Wonder Woman. Yesterday, Gadot posted a sweet birthday tribute to Pine on Instagram. And of course, it was adorable and hilarious.\n\nThe birthday post contains a short video clip of the two uproariously giggling during an interview while promoting Wonder Woman. Along with the video, Gadot wrote a sweet caption.\n\nThe video that Gal used in her post has been used before as a hilarious meme, and it\u2019s great to see her use it too. The internet loved the way that Gadot looked at Pine. We certainly don\u2019t blame her!\n\nfalse\n\nWe love that Gadot and Pine have such a strong friendship.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise why these two have great on-screen chemistry in Wonder Woman. Whether through interviews or social media posts, it\u2019s clear to see how much the pair gets along off-screen too.\n\nWe\u2019re sad that we won\u2019t to get to see the pair together in the Wonder Woman universe again, but we\u2019re hoping that they can share the screen in another movie someday. Our fingers are crossed!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091648%2Fbestredlipsticks.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F27033544%2Fpicture-of-gal-gadot-chris-pine-photo.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F02%2F12155159%2Fbest-friend-stories.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2F22091645%2Fbest-money-apps.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F27033544%2Fpicture-of-gal-gadot-chris-pine-photo.jpg", "https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072533/avatar-e-150x150.png"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.hellogiggles.com%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F27033544%2Fpicture-of-gal-gadot-chris-pine-photo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Malamut"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/gal-gadots-birthday-tribute-to-her-wonder-woman-co-star-chris-pine/", "title": "Gal Gadot\u2019s birthday tribute to her \u201cWonder Woman\u201d co-star Chris Pine the cutest thing we\u2019ve ever seen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "birthday,chris pine,instagram,Wonder Woman", "news_keywords": "birthday,chris pine,instagram,Wonder Woman", "description": "Gal Gadot posted a sweet and adorable happy birthday wish to Chris Pine.
