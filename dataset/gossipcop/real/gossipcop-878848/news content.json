The frenemies have made this a storyline for a while now, so why would she end it? Besides that, it looks like Farrah Abraham has other reasons to not end the Amber Portwood fight.\n\nIt looks like E! News had a chance to talk with Farrah Abraham, as she was attending New York Fashion Week. Even though Amber Portwood recently revealed that she would be interested in being friends with Farrah again, we do not see a rekindling of their friendship happening, as Abraham confirmed this with E! News.\n\n\u201cI would want to bury that hatchet, too, but I\u2019m never wrong. I\u2019m a great friend; I\u2019m a stand-up individual and in the same sentence she wants to be friends with me, she always says I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\n\nSo, why is she not ending the feud? From that statement, it seems like Farrah Abraham believes she is never wrong. Well, that is definitely not going to mend any fences for either of them. Farrah is referring to Portwood\u2019s appearance on E!\u2019s Daily Pop last month, where Amber described Farrah as crazy.\n\n\u201cWe used to be friends, but I don\u2019t know what happened. I think she did things for publicity. I still love her to death. She knows that.\u201d\n\nAmber also mentioned wanting to rekindle their friendship and that she is \u201cready to let everything go.\u201d Amber may be ready, but it looks like Farrah is not on the same page.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the only one who is diagnosed with a split personality disorder amongst other things, which is not a joke. It\u2019s very serious.\u201d\n\nWhile it appears that Amber is ready to move on and make nice, Farrah is not. So, if Amber reached out and called Farrah to reconcile, would it happen? Not according to Abraham.\n\n\u201cI believe she\u2019s blocked. I just am on a whole other level of my life and I\u2019m focused on my daughter and not on her.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of her daughter, it looks like Sophia is calling all the shots in their lives. Farrah has reached out to her own mother, Debra Danielson, to try and mend those fences, especially with Debra\u2019s upcoming wedding. It looks like Sophia does not approve of it, so they won\u2019t be attending?\n\n\u201cWith my mom\u2019s wedding right now it\u2019s made Sophia not want to be around her. I\u2019m kind of stuck in the middle trying to have everyone get along. Sophie is not approving of it but I am happy for her and supportive. I hope she has an amazing wedding and we send her our best wishes. We are taking her to Italy next week so we just try to keep it cordial.\u201d\n\n#nyfw @nolchashows #NewYork A post shared by Farrah Abraham (@farrah__abraham) on Sep 8, 2017 at 4:16pm PDT\n\nThe craziness that is Teen Mom OG and Farrah Abraham continues, but it won\u2019t continue with Amber Portwood as her friend. While she does not want to be friends, she does not wish any ill feelings on Amber. In fact, she is happy with Amber and some of the recent decisions she has made in her life.\n\n\u201cI wish she would take other people in her circle more seriously so that she could be the happiest Amber. I think producers and production play off of that so I would just strive to keep people around who are there for you. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s not dating Matt Baier anymore. I told her years ago to ditch him and I\u2019m happy to finally have found out.\u201d\n\nDo you think Farrah Abraham and Amber Portwood will ever be friends again on Teen Mom OG?\n\n[Featured Image by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/12b68087c5cb7871876399934d5c96e2?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Teen-Mom-OG-Farrah-Abraham-Not-ending-feud-with-Amber-Portwood.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Betzold"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4487009/teen-mom-og-star-farrah-abraham-explains-why-she-cant-end-amber-portwood-feud/", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 Star Farrah Abraham Explains Why She Can\u2019t End Amber Portwood Feud", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
