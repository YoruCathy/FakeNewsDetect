Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were photographed arriving at Pippa Middleton and James Matthews\u2018 wedding reception in Bucklebury, England, on Saturday, May 20.\n\nThe low-key couple, who began dating last June, were all smiles as they pulled up to the Middleton family\u2019s 18-acre estate in a gray Audi, with Harry, 32, behind the wheel and Markle, 35, sitting in the passenger seat. The picture, which is the first to emerge of the pair together over the weekend, does not show what Markle wore to the reception.\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, the Suits actress did not attend Middleton, 33, and Matthews\u2019 wedding at the St. Mark\u2019s Church in Englefield, Berkshire, England, but Harry made a 100-mile round-trip to Kensington Palace to pick up his girlfriend for the reception later in the day.\n\nThe affair marks the first event Markle has attended with the royal family. \u201cThey will be engaged by the end of summer,\u201d a source exclusively told Us of Harry and Markle in March, adding, \u201cThey see a life together.\u201d\n\n15 Charming Throwback Photos of the Royal Family\n\nFor the time being, the Los Angeles native has continued to film her USA Network legal drama, though \u201cno one gets the impression she\u2019s staying on the show much longer,\u201d a second insider told Us. \u201cThey believe she\u2019s going to marry Harry.\u201d",
