If you\u2019re craving French fries, go for an OG baked potato (leave the sour cream, take the chives).", "images": ["https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img9.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img10.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img2.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img7.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img4.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img13.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img12.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-food-GS1141426-1.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img11.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img5.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img1.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img8.jpg", "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fastfood-img3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/fast-food-GS1141426-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://goop.com/travel/experiences/the-goop-fast-food-guide/", "title": "The goop Fast Food Guide", "meta_data": {"description": "Summer\u2019s (almost) here, which means the next family trip is just around the corner.
