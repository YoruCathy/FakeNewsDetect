Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP\n\n\u0097 -- Singer Aaron Carter, who has previously been forthcoming about his substance abuse and eating disorder, is now opening up about his sexuality.\n\nThe 29-year-old brother of Backstreet Boys alum Nick Carter tweeted on Saturday night a long open letter in which he acknowledges his attraction to both men and women since he was 13.\n\n\"There\u2019s something I\u2019d like to say that I feel is important for myself and my identity that has been weighing on my chest for nearly half of my life,\" he wrote. \"This doesn\u2019t bring me shame, just a weight and burden I have held onto for a long time that I would like lifted off me.\"\n\nHe explains, \"I grew up in this entertainment industry at a very young age and when I was around 13 years old I started to find boys and girls attractive.\"\n\nHe then reveals, \"There were years that went by that I thought about, but it wasn\u2019t until I was 17 years old, after a few relationships with girls, I had an experience with a male that I had an attraction to who I also worked with and grew up with.\"\n\nCarter continues, \"To me music has always been my temple. Music will ALWAYS be what transcends us and myself. The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment.\"\n\nA Tampa, Florida, native, he ends the letter with a quote from singer Boy George, who also has been open in discussing his sexuality.\n\n\"The best quote to sum 'I've never felt as though I didn't belong, I just acted as though I did.' \u2014 Boy George\"\n\nCarter's tweet follows his July 15 arrest in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the passenger seat of the car and was also taken into police custody. Carter was released after posting bail for $4,610.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/ap_carter_dc_071617_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/ap_carter_dc_071617_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "David Caplan", "August", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/singer-aaron-carter-pens-emotional-open-letter-sexuality/story?id=49061518", "title": "Singer Aaron Carter pens emotional open letter about his sexuality", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Aaron Carter", "copyright": "2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
