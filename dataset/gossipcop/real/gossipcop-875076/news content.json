Especially with what happened,\u201d Luann said. \u201cTom is actually a great guy who loves me. And together we just love being together and married.\u201d\n\nBut her praises were not blindly supported, especially when Luann explained that they like to travel, ski and play tennis together.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all lifestyle stuff,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cI always say you can make a lifestyle out of a life but you can\u2019t make a life out a lifestyle.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Take a Look at Some of the Highlights of Luann de Lesseps & Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr.\u2019s Wedding\n\nOn Aug. 3, Luann announced on Twitter that she and Tom were divorcing after only seven months of marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nDays later, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful.\n\n\u201cI do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,\u201d Luann told Page Sixon Aug. 3 when asked the reasons for their divorce. \u201cGod knows he\u2019s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don\u2019t believe that continued [while we were married].\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work.
