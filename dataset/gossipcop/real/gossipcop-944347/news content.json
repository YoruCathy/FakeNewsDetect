We can figure out her answer even without the tweet's text in the next photo, as Johnson leans down to kiss her brand new fiance.\n\nChmerkovskiy shared his sentiments in another tweet: \"I can't wait to make you my wife.\"\n\nMore:How Olympian Adam Rippon won 'Dancing With the Stars' beating Tonya Harding, Josh Norman\n\nMore:'DWTS' pro stars Peta Murgatroyd, Maksim Chmerkovskiy wed in New York\n\nIt's the latest happy news for Johnson. In May, she won the shortened, athletes-only season of \"Dancing\" with her celebrity partner, Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2040c2bcde43a66059cf0bd8e3cc5100019807d8/c=0-0-2039-1152/local/-/media/2018/06/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636646106984707815-GTY-833539786-93116373-1-.JPG?width=2039&height=1152&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b77ee29ba6caeb5563a8cb3201c35be179d4fe7/c=0-12-2039-2730/local/-/media/2018/06/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636646106984707815-GTY-833539786-93116373-1-.JPG?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2040c2bcde43a66059cf0bd8e3cc5100019807d8/c=0-0-2039-1152/local/-/media/2018/06/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636646106984707815-GTY-833539786-93116373-1-.JPG?width=2039&height=1152&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/06/14/dancing-stars-jenna-johnson-val-chmerkovskiy-engaged/704093002/", "title": "'Dancing with the Stars' pros Jenna Johnson and Val Chmerkovskiy are engaged", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "'Dancing with the Stars' pros Jenna Johnson and Val Chmerkovskiy are engaged", "description": "'Dancing with the Stars' pro Jenna Johnson Thursday tweeted a romantic photo of Valentin Chmerkovskiy proposing in Venice.
