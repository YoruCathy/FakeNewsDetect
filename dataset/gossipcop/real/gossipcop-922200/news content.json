I trust you a lot more than my Staten Island fashion knowledge,\" Davidson says. \"... It's so funny, I thought I was like, kind of dressing well, but it's so nice to know that I've been dressing like [bleep] the entire time.\"\n\nIn the new video posted \"SNL's\" YouTube page (check it out above), Tan pokes fun Pete's Staten Island roots and frozen-in-puberty vibe before pulling a few chic looks from the Saks racks for him to model.\n\nSo why the attempted upgrade? The 24-year-old admits he wants to dress to impress his mate Cazzie David's \"cool family.\" (Yes, her dad is Larry David of \"Seinfeld\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" fame.)\n\nThree charming Pete-to-Tan revelations: He \"never, NEVER\" thinks he's sexy, he doesn't \"even have mirrors at my house 'cause I don't like my face\" and his fashion sense is a case of arrested development: \"I think like an 18-year-old kids, like -- 'those are cool!'\" when picking out clothes.\n\nAfter modeling a series of jackets and a sharp hunter green top coat, Pete quips: \"I feel like I should reshoot my intro for the show.\"", "images": ["https://www.silive.com/pf/resources/images/common/icons/Arrow_back.svg?d=235", "https://www.silive.com/pf/resources/images/silive/logos/logo_main_inverse.svg?d=235", "https://www.silive.com/pf/resources/images/common/icons/sign-out-lock.svg?d=235", "https://www.silive.com/pf/resources/images/silive/logos/logo_main_sm.svg?d=235", "https://www.silive.com/pf/resources/images/common/ps-images/ad-choices-arrow.png?d=235", "https://www.silive.com/resizer/mQmNcE3_8Rwy5HDJ3kwUC4M0uTE=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width2048/img/entertainment_impact_home/photo/screen-shot-2018-03-22-at-93559-ampng-c4597bc092e2508a.png", "https://www.silive.com/pf/resources/images/footer-logo-advance.svg?d=235"], "top_img": "https://www.silive.com/resizer/mQmNcE3_8Rwy5HDJ3kwUC4M0uTE=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width2048/img/entertainment_impact_home/photo/screen-shot-2018-03-22-at-93559-ampng-c4597bc092e2508a.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rob Bailey", "Bailey Siadvance.Com", "In The New Video Posted", "Snl'S", "Youtube Page", "Check It Out Above", "Tan Pokes Fun Pete'S Staten Island Roots", "Frozen-In-Puberty Vibe Before Pulling A Few Chic Looks The Saks Racks For Him To Model."], "canonical_link": "https://www.silive.com/entertainment/2018/03/queer_eye_revamps_pete_davidso.html", "title": "'Queer Eye' revamps Pete Davidson's 'Guido trash' fashion sense", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435, "app_id": 105841282796862}, "title": "'Queer Eye' revamps Pete Davidson's 'Guido trash' fashion sense", "og": {"title": "'Queer Eye' revamps Pete Davidson's 'Guido trash' style", "url": "https://www.silive.com/entertainment/2018/03/queer_eye_revamps_pete_davidso.html", "site_name": "silive", "type": "article", "description": "Fab Five fashionista Tan France shows Pete Davidson how to step up his style to impress his girlfriend and her \"cool\" family.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.silive.com/resizer/mQmNcE3_8Rwy5HDJ3kwUC4M0uTE=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width2048/img/entertainment_impact_home/photo/screen-shot-2018-03-22-at-93559-ampng-c4597bc092e2508a.png", "width": 1280}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-22T17:46:38Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-22T14:46:38Z", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "@mobile,@river,entertainment", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/statenislandadvance/"}, "twitter": {"title": "'Queer Eye' revamps Pete Davidson's 'Guido trash' style", "site": "@SIAdvance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Fab Five fashionista Tan France shows Pete Davidson how to step up his style to impress his girlfriend and her \"cool\" family.", "image": "https://www.silive.com/resizer/mQmNcE3_8Rwy5HDJ3kwUC4M0uTE=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width2048/img/entertainment_impact_home/photo/screen-shot-2018-03-22-at-93559-ampng-c4597bc092e2508a.png"}, "article_publication_name": "https://www.silive.com/entertainment/2018/03/queer_eye_revamps_pete_davidso.html", "article_date_original": "Thursday, March 22, 2018, 01:46 PM", "article_date_updated": "Thursday, March 22, 2018, 10:46 AM", "sailthru.tags": "entertainment,pop culture,video, tv and movies,fashion,tan,saks,saks fifth avenue,pete davidson", "sailthru.date": "Thursday, March 22, 2018, 01:46 PM", "sailthru.title": "'Queer Eye' revamps Pete Davidson's 'Guido trash' fashion sense", "sailthru.author": "rbailey", "sailthru.description": "Fab Five fashionista Tan France shows Pete Davidson how to step up his style to impress his girlfriend and her \"cool\" family.", "machine_tags": "@mobile,@river", "sections": "entertainment", "byline": "Rob Bailey | bailey@siadvance.com", "subscriber_only": "false", "Description": "Fab Five fashionista Tan France shows Pete Davidson how to step up his style to impress his girlfriend and her \"cool\" family.", "article_author": "Rob Bailey | bailey@siadvance.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521740798.0, "source": "http://www.silive.com", "summary": ""}
