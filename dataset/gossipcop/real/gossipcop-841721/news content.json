Nikki Bella, 34, recently called off her engagement to John Cena just weeks before they were supposed to tie the knot in a destination wedding. But thanks to Nikki's twin sister and Total Bellas costar, Brie Bella, it looks like she won't have to go through these rough times alone. According to People, Brie is considering taking her sister on vacation on what would have been her wedding day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m throwing some stuff out there to her. We might do something, we are deciding. There\u2019s a part of her that just wants to be home,\u201d Brie told the publication at a celebration for World Immunization Week, co-hosted by Rotary International and Red Nose Day. \u201cBut I told her and I told my husband, [Daniel Bryan,] if we have to go to wine country, you\u2019re just going to have to watch [our daughter,] Birdie. I just told her, you lead the way and I\u2019ll follow.\"\n\nBrie added that she's open to doing anything her sister wants, just as long as it makes her feel better. \u201cIf it\u2019s at home and eating pizza and devouring ice cream, I\u2019m down for that or if she wants to escape to Napa and down a lot of wine, I\u2019m down for that as well,\u201d she said.\n\nNapa Valley is particularly significant to the sisters, making it the perfect girls getaway. \u201cNapa is literally our heaven on earth. Every time we go there, we can let our brains just shut down,\u201d Brie explained. \u201cIt\u2019s vacation, but because it\u2019s not a full day to travel there, you\u2019re not exhausted, and when we land in Napa, we get this energy from the vineyard. We love sitting out and hearing the birds and feeling the breeze and looking out at the greens and drinking great wines. I think the experience of wine-tasting is fun because you\u2019re learning something. Now we have our own wine there too,\u201d Brie said of their new line, Belle Radici.\n\nShe continued, \u201cIt\u2019s fun because we go to Napa and we\u2019ve made such close friends there. People feel like family. We all hang out and it\u2019s like we can get a little business done but then we just relax. Any time we need to recharge or need a break from the limelight, we go to Napa.\u201d\n\nBut Brie added no matter the location, she simply wants to be there for her sister. \u201cThe nice thing about having a sister is you just have a shoulder to cry on. My sister and I, she loves being around me right now because we can just sit in a room and not say a word,\u201d Brie said.", "images": ["https://:0", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/oLGzhxRB0OePumejPV5hFmHzb2w=/2096x1179/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5ae08bfa117b2e05a052d63f__169-bd518d625cda4bf5ae6ec07ec723bbdb.jpeg", "https://www.brides.com/thmb/3Oz4y_bqw6kz4oUWfybwYy2UywI=/500x350/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5ae08bfa117b2e05a052d63f__11-83df8b446b4a4f3faa7ad47246fe34d4.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/oLGzhxRB0OePumejPV5hFmHzb2w=/2096x1179/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5ae08bfa117b2e05a052d63f__169-bd518d625cda4bf5ae6ec07ec723bbdb.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Oehler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.brides.com/story/where-nikki-bella-might-spend-her-would-be-wedding-day", "title": "Where Nikki Bella Might Spend Her Would-Be Wedding Day", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'Total Bellas' star Brie Bella is considering taking her sister, Nikki Bella, on vacation on what would have been her wedding day with John Cena", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "BRIDES", "sailthru.author": "Christina Oehler", "sailthru.tags": "news,weddings-and-celebs", "article": {"section": "Brides"}, "fb": {"app_id": 785196361567992}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Brides", "url": "https://www.brides.com/story/where-nikki-bella-might-spend-her-would-be-wedding-day", "title": "Where Nikki Bella Might Spend Her Would-Be Wedding Day", "description": "'Total Bellas' star Brie Bella is considering taking her sister, Nikki Bella, on vacation on what would have been her wedding day with John Cena", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/oLGzhxRB0OePumejPV5hFmHzb2w=/2096x1179/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5ae08bfa117b2e05a052d63f__169-bd518d625cda4bf5ae6ec07ec723bbdb.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@Brides", "title": "Where Nikki Bella Might Spend Her Would-Be Wedding Day", "description": "'Total Bellas' star Brie Bella is considering taking her sister, Nikki Bella, on vacation on what would have been her wedding day with John Cena", "image": "https://www.brides.com/thmb/nXnXQ0fjyzLP3FJf6qcsUOsBzrs=/2100x2100/filters:fill(auto,1)/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__brides__proteus__5ae08bfa117b2e05a052d63f__11-83df8b446b4a4f3faa7ad47246fe34d4.jpeg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.56.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.brides.com", "summary": ""}
