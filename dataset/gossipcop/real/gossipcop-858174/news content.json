Here\u2019s a breakdown of the 10 most important moments.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC\n\n1. The questionable attire choices. All of them.\n\nDid no one tell DeMario that you\u2019re supposed to wear a suit to these things? Or at the very least, tuck your shirt in?\n\n2. Surprise! Whaboom is still the worst.\n\nThankfully ABC only allowed him enough screen time to utter a single \u201cwhaboom.\u201d And that was still one too many.\n\n3. DeMario didn\u2019t do himself any favors.\n\nDeMario, DeMario, DeMario. DeMario had the opportunity to acknowledge, apologize and move on from the whole Lexi situation \u2014 or at the very least, calmly explain his side of the story \u2014 but alas, he did not. (ICYMI, DeMario is the guy who signed up for the show while still having a girlfriend back home. After he ghosted on her, she found out that he was filming and confronted him about in on camera in episode 2. Rachel promptly sent him packing.)\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nDeMario\u2019s rant made little sense, but bizarrely, seemed to incorporate as many pop culture references as possible. A sampling, below:\n\n\u201cThis random a\u2014 chick calls in to say that she was my girlfriend. By you guys\u2019 logic, I\u2019m Beyonc\u00e9\u2018s boyfriend. I\u2019m dating Rihanna!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, what did the Weeknd say? I\u2019ll only call you when it\u2019s half past five? That\u2019s called a side chick. You can boo me, I\u2019m keeping it real.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said we dated for six months, but facts are facts. Show me a picture of her and I. Are there any ocular facts that her and I dated?\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Clinton had sex with Monica!\u201d\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n4. Everyone was #TeamKenny, all the way.\n\nThe drama between Kenny and Lee this season spanned several episodes before it came to a head on an incredibly uncomfortable two-on-one date. Ultimately, neither man ended up with Rachel \u2014 but Kenny did win the loyalty of his fellow contestants.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty evident if you look at it objectively that Kenny might have been the most well-liked guy in the house, and it\u2019s hard to say the same about Lee,\u201d said Dean. \u201cWhen you have 30 people on your side against one person, it\u2019s clear who\u2019s in the right and who\u2019s wrong. I will forever have Kenny\u2019s back in that situation.\u201d\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nWhile the underlying racial tensions between the two men were obvious to viewers throughout the season, Kenny insisted that in the moment, his beef with Lee didn\u2019t actually feel like it was stemming from racism.\n\n\u201cRacism feels a certain way \u2014 it\u2019s insidious, there\u2019s vitriol to it,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs I was trying to make sense of it, it really just felt to me that this dude was out of his league. To me, it was very reactionary. That\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d\n\nBut overall, the night ended on a high note for Kenny: Host Chris Harrison surprised him by bringing out his daughter Mackenzie \u2014 and gifted the two with tickets to Disneyland.\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC\n\n5. Lee got put on blast.\n\nFinally, it was time for Lee to face the hot seat. Visibly anxious, he started off by carefully avoiding using the word \u201cracist\u201d or \u201cracism,\u201d instead chalking up his actions on the show to his discomfort.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m facetious,\u201d he said. \u201cI make jokes when I\u2019m uncomfortable in inappropriate times. It doesn\u2019t always come off right, and I definitely learned that about myself.\u201d\n\nAfter several of the men repeatedly called him out for refusing to acknowledge what was really at play here, Harrison eventually brought up the crux of the matter: several misogynistic, sexist and racist tweets written by Lee within the last year-and-a-half that were discovered a little over a week after the season premiere.\n\n\u201cWomen were meant to hang around for a few seconds these days, dogs are meant to stick around. Get a dog, boys. Get a dog,\u201d reads one.\n\n\u201cGuys\u2026 When is the last time you actually saw a pretty feminist? There is a reason for this,\u201d reads another.\n\nAnd last but not least: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between the NAACP and the KKK? One has a sense of shame to cover their racist a\u2014 faces.\u201d\n\n6. Lee got a history lesson.\n\n\u201cI want you to articulate to all of us why you came on a show where the Bachelorette was an African-American woman, if on the other hand you\u2019re tweeting about black people and groups of black people who fought and died so I can be on this stage next to you?\u201d demanded Josiah. \u201cPeople came before me so I could go to the same school as you, so I could drink from the same fountain as you, and you\u2019re comparing them to the KKK \u2014 people who hung my ancestors.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nLee responded by denouncing the tweets, insisting that he doesn\u2019t like racism \u201cat all.\u201d But Anthony fired back by pointing out that Lee was still refusing to own up to what they were all trying to forgive him for.\n\n\u201cThe racism that is ingrained in your behavior to the point of invisibility is still pushing you to behave in a certain way towards Kenny, towards Eric, towards me, in a way that you don\u2019t even recognize,\u201d he said. \u201cAre your actions motivated by racist thoughts that are implicitly embedded in your mentality?\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Rachel Lindsay on Making History as First African American (& \u2018Oldest\u2019) Bachelorette \u2014 \u2018All Eyes Are on Me\u2019\n\n7. And finally, finally, Lee acknowledged his undeniable racism.\n\nIt certainly took him a while, but Lee\u2019s segment concluded with him finally recognizing that yes, his tweets were offensive \u2014 on many levels: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for saying things when I was not educated and ignorant in those subjects,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rest of the men thanked him for his honesty, and Kenny even stood up to hug it out.\n\n8. Dean was as adorable as ever.\n\nDean is so darn cute that we\u2019ll forgive him for that camo suit. His sit-down with Rachel was short but sweet: While he did call her out for sending him home just days after telling him she was falling in love with him, he did it in the gentlest, Dean-iest way possible \u2014 and it\u2019s pretty clear there\u2019s no bad blood between these two.\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC\n\n9. Rachel handled herself like an absolute queen.\n\nIt certainly can\u2019t be easy facing 20-some exes all at once, but Rachel breezed right through it like the queen that she is.\n\nImage zoom Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nRachel on reuniting with the men: \u201cI missed you guys! Not all of you.\u201d\n\nRachel on being the first black Bachelorette: \u201cI knew it would be something to talk about, but it wasn\u2019t something that we had to continually go on and on about. Race wasn\u2019t an issue for me as I was going through this season.\u201d\n\nRachel on Kenny and Lee: \u201cI\u2019m not in the house, so I only know what\u2019s happening right in front of me. To sit back and see things that I\u2019ve never seen before \u2014 it\u2019s very enlightening. Kenny, I was disappointed in the way that you handled the Lee situation. Because Lee was Lee, I wish that you could have just realized that that was background noise and focused on the two of us.\u201d\n\nRachel on DeMario: \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n10. And she didn\u2019t waste a second telling Lee exactly how disappointing he was.\n\n\u201cYou had such an amazing opportunity to be surrounded by different people and different cultures, and you didn\u2019t take advantage of that,\u201d she told him. \u201cI hope that in watching it back you realize that you were a part of something so great. But in case you didn\u2019t, please know that you can exit stage left and meet me backstage. I\u2019d be more than happy to give you a black history lesson and a lesson on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nWe are not worthy.\n\nThe Bachelorette season finale airs Monday at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-6.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-3-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-5.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-men-tell-all-lee-garrett-racist-tweets-demario-jackson-snaps/", "title": "Bachelorette: Lee Garrett Addresses Racist Tweets in Tense Men Tell All Special", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Chris Harrison,DeMario Jackson,News,Rachel Lindsay,Recap,The Bachelorette,TV,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "Chris Harrison,DeMario Jackson,News,Rachel Lindsay,Recap,The Bachelorette,TV,TV Watch", "description": "Here's a\u00a0breakdown of the 10 most important moments from Monday's Bachelorette:\u00a0Men Tell All special", "og": {"title": "Bachelorette: Lee Garrett Addresses Racist Tweets in Tense Men Tell All Special", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-men-tell-all-lee-garrett-racist-tweets-demario-jackson-snaps/", "description": "After weeks of watching Rachel Lindsay break hearts left and right, Bachelor Nation&nbsp;finally got to witness all of her ex-boyfriends gather for one giant, televised&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-5.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-men-tell-all-lee-garrett-racist-tweets-demario-jackson-snaps/", "description": "Here's a\u00a0breakdown of the 10 most important moments from Monday's Bachelorette:\u00a0Men Tell All special", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-5.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelorette-men-tell-all-lee-garrett-racist-tweets-demario-jackson-snaps/", "title": "Bachelorette: Lee Garrett Addresses Racist Tweets in Tense Men Tell All Special", "description": "Here's a\u00a0breakdown of the 10 most important moments from Monday's Bachelorette:\u00a0Men Tell All special", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fthe-bachelorette-5.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
