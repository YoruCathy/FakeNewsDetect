The adaptation of the Archie Comics could have been a clunky teen-drama-cum-murder-mystery, but instead managed to be an intricate, clever watch full of pop culture references and easter eggs.\n\nAs millions tuned in for Season 1, in March Riverdale was renewed for a second season, and we\u2019re now mid way through the second series which is a whole lot darker and dramatic than the first. This is what we know about what\u2019s still to come in season two.\n\nRiverdale season 2 release date\n\nIn the US it begins on October 11, 2017 on The CW. It\u2019ll then premier on Netflix UK on Thursday October 12, 2017 \u2013 and throughout the season episodes will continue to be made available on the streaming service less than a day after they air in the US. After a mid-season break, the second half of season two is set to return on January 17th in the US, and will be on Netflix on the 18th in the UK.\n\nHow many episodes will there be?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere will be 22 episodes \u2013 as confirmed by Archie Comics. This is an increase on Season 1, which only had 13 episodes.\n\nThe first episode of #Riverdale Season 2 has finished filming. 21 more episodes to go! pic.twitter.com/PXh0HzYsan \u2014 Archie Comics (@ArchieComics) July 7, 2017\n\nThe first episode has already been filmed, and will be called \u2018Chapter Fourteen: A Kiss Before Dying\u2019, as confirmed by series developer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa through his Twitter account.\n\nAny more episode titles?\n\nRoberto Aguirre Sacasa has been revealing the episode titles through his Twitter, and we\u2019ve got up to episode 28:\n\nChapter Fourteen: A Kiss Before Dying\n\nChapter Fifteen: Nighthawks\n\nChapter Sixteen: The Watcher in the Woods\n\nChapter Seventeen: The Town That Dreaded Sundown\n\nChapter Eighteen: When a Stranger Calls\n\nChapter Nineteen: Death Proof\n\nChapter Twenty: Tales from the Darkside\n\nChapter Twenty-One: House of the Devil\n\nChapter Twenty-Two: Silent Night, Deadly Night\n\nChapter Twenty-Three: The Blackboard Jungle\n\nChapter Twenty-Four: The Wrestler\n\nChapter Twenty-Five: The Wicked and the Divine\n\nChapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart\n\nChapter Twenty-Seven: The Hills Have Eyes\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight: There Will Be Blood\n\nAre there any changes to the Riverdale season 2 cast?\n\nDue to Ross Butler\u2019s ongoing commitments with Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, the role of Reggie has been recast, with Charles Melton taking on the role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile Skeet Ulrich, who plays Jughead\u2019s father FP Jones, will be returning to Season 2 as a series regular, after appearing in 7 episodes in Season 1. Speaking to Deadline, series executive producer Sarah Schecter said: \u201cHe\u2019s a stellar actor and we feel we have just scratched the surface of who FP is.\u201d Additionally, TVLine confirmed that Casey Cott, who plays Kevin Keller, will also be promoted to series regular.\n\nIt\u2019s also been confirmed that Molly Ringwald will be reprising her role as Archie\u2019s mum, Mary Andrews.\n\nAnd are there any new characters in Riverdale season 2?\n\nThere will finally be an appearance from Hiram Lodge, who spent season 1 in jail, with Mark Consuelos having been cast. Marisol Nichols, who plays Hermione Lodge, shared this picture on her Instagram of the newly reunited Lodge family:\n\nAccording to Deadline, Brit Morgan has been cast in a recurring role as Penny Peabody, known to some as \u201cSnake Charmer\u201d, an attorney the Southside Serpents keep on retainer \u2013 but prefers that her clients don\u2019t pay her with currency; instead they pay her with favours. Deadline are reporting that Jughead will discover this, when he enlists her help to help his Dad in prison.\n\nAs Entertainment Tonight reported, Vanessa Morgan is also set to be joining the cast, as Toni Topaz. Toni is a member of the Southside Serpents who befriends Jughead. Whether she\u2019ll be a love interest for him hasn\u2019t been confirmed.\n\nAdditionally, Hart Denton has been cast as Chic Cooper, the long-lost brother of Betty Cooper.\n\nIs there a Riverdale series 2 trailer yet?\n\nThe first trailer for Riverdale Season 2 debuted at San Diego\u2019s Comic Con on July 22.\n\nOnce again narrated by Jughead (played by Cole Sprouse), the trailer begins with the line, \u2018People will look back as the exact moment that last bit of Riverdale\u2019s innocence finally died\u2019. The footage sees Archie (played by K.J. Apa) taking his father (Fred Andrews \u2013 played by Luke Perry) into hospital after he was shot at the end of Season 1. Watch it below:\n\nThe second trailer was released on 17 August. The the 30-second teaser sees a shadowy figure reveal that they have \u201csome tragic news to share\u201d \u2013 which could relate to the fate of Archie\u2019s father Fred Andrews, who was shot in the season finale.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFkJW1xD7BI\n\nAny idea of the plot?\n\nSeason 1 left us at a cliff-hanger when Fred Andrews was shot in front of his son Archie. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight show runner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said the identity of Fred Andrew\u2019s shooter will be \u201cThe mystery that launches season two\u201d. He also commented on the rumours that the shooting is no accident, saying \u201cI think there\u2019s definitely a lot to that theory\u2026 Hermione says to Veronica, very clearly, if Fred doesn\u2019t sell, it\u2019s going to be really bad for him. And the next thing we see is Fred getting shot. I think that\u2019s one of the first, most likely suspects in my mind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also been reported that we\u2019ll be finding out Fred\u2019s fate at the end of the first episode.\n\nYou find out Fred's ultimate fate at the end of the premiere. #Riverdale #sdcc #wbsdcc \u2014 alanna ? (@AlannaBennett) July 22, 2017\n\nAguirre-Sacasa also commented on the Riverdale \u201ccivil war\u201d that could occur in Season 2, saying: \u201cIn the finale, Betty alludes to it with Jughead. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t want to let the civil war rip us apart.\u201d I can tell you that there\u2019s a civil war brewing between the north side of Riverdale and the south side. That\u2019s something that will really be playing out and complicating our characters\u2019 lives throughout the season.\u201d\n\nCole Sprouse took to reddit to answer some fan questions \u2013 and commented that the second season would be: \u201cdarker and weirder. much darker. much weirder\u201d adding that \u201ctone and genre elements that we touched upon in the cinematography and narrative are getting a big emphasis season 2.\u201d\n\nWhat about Jughead? Will he be joining the Serpents?\n\nCole Sprouse has confirmed that Jughead will be joining the Serpents. In an interview with Teen Vogue he said: \u201cJughead ends up joining the Serpents and he gets wrapped up in this world that forces his hand, forces him to play the game \u2014 which is something in season one he had a real aversion to.\u201d\n\nAdding that it doesn\u2019t work out as he would plan: \u201cHe ends up getting into a lot of trouble because of it. \u2026 He ends up a bit more of a damaged kid. He\u2019s a lot angrier than he was in season one. He ends up coming off as kind of a \u2026 not necessarily to say a bad boy, but way more angry, which I also think is a fundamentally key experience. He gets himself into a lot of trouble because of his loyalty and honour to his family and friends, and it begins to make him question where his allegiance lies and what that means for his character \u2014 if it means stepping back again or if it means putting a foot back in.\u201d\n\nAnd what about the Betty-Archie-Veronica love triangle? Will that play out further in Season 2?\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight Aguirre-Sacasa said: \u201cYeah, I think the love triangle, whether we\u2019re playing it directly, or it\u2019s just bubbling underneath, it\u2019s always sort of a part of the show\u2026\u201d\n\nWhat about Veronica, is she set to get more involved in the family business?\n\nSpeaking to NME on set in Canada, Camila Mendes who plays Veronica, revealed that the character would be getting more involved in the family business. Season two sees her father Hiram Lodge being released from prison and returning home, and when asked whether Veronica would be getting more involved in his shady dealings, Mendes responded: \u201cA hundred percent! Veronica season two is fully committing to the family business, and trying to decide how much of that she should share with Archie and her peers; because it is a big secret, but it\u2019s also her life, and she\u2019s chosen to step up to the plate and be part of the family. And be an established member of the family.\u201d\n\nAnd will there be any more deaths?\n\nAlmost certainly. Speaking to NME, when asked what the rest of season two will entail M\u00e4dchen Amick revealed: \u201cThere will be many more dead bodies\u201d so it looks like the Black Hood\u2019s reign of terror isn\u2019t over yet.", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/c05f70fc480027a31cad26f407d7d2e68ce2e097-1.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/c05f70fc480027a31cad26f407d7d2e68ce2e097-1-696x441.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/c05f70fc480027a31cad26f407d7d2e68ce2e097-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Mylrea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/riverdale-season-2-release-date-cast-plot-2112705", "title": "Riverdale Season 2: New Release Date, Cast & Plot hints", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Riverdale Season 2 is coming in October.
