And for some fans, like Joel and Karen, it was the first time they got to see Shakira live.\n\n\u201cWe drove eight hours from Minnesota just to see her,\u201d said the couple. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting since the '90s to see Shakira. I want to sing the oldies with her.\" \"I\u2019ve been practicing in my shower for the last 20 years,\u201d added Karen.\n\nAfter a successful run in Europe earlier this summer, Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado Tour at the United Center in Chicago on Friday (Aug. 3). The tour was rescheduled from January after the singer/songwriter had to postpone her international trek due to strained vocal chords.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d Shakira said after singing her first couple of songs, including \u201cEstoy Aqu\u00ed,\u201d \u201cShe Wolf\u201d and \u201cSi Te Vas.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long,\" she continued. \"I\u2019ve been dreaming about this moment. There were times when all of this seemed impossible, but miracles do exist. You made this happen! Thank you for all your support, especially in these last few months.\"\n\nNot only did Shakira sing her heart out -- in English and Spanish -- for nearly two hours and delivered classics like \u201cInevitable,\u201d \u201cT\u00fa\u201d and \u201cAntolog\u00eda\u201d and her most recent hits such as \u201cMe Enamor\u00e9\u201d and \u201cChantaje,\u201d she also danced all night long. Even as mother of two, those hips still don\u2019t lie.\n\nWorking the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue, the hypnotizing and infectious hip moves came when the chart-topping artist sang tracks like \u201cPerro Fiel,\u201d \u201cDare (La La La),\u201d \u201cWaka Waka\u201d and \u201cLoca.\u201d\n\nOf course, the sexy, upbeat tracks called for a change in wardrobe and for those, Shakira appeared onstage with her staple belly dancing wraps covered with beads and coins that really accentuated her hip-swiveling moves.\n\nTwo special guests spotted in the crowd were Shakira\u2019s sons: Milan and Sasha. The two almost stole the show when they were ushered to their front row seats where they would see their mam\u00e1 in all her glory. From the stage and throughout the show, she blew kisses their way.\n\nAnother fan favorite moment was when Shakira appeared on the other side of the venue wearing a long, gold dress to sing \u201cToneladas\u201d and right after, made her way back to the main stage walking in the middle of the crowd and stopping to snap a few selfies and greet fans who threw themselves at her as she passed by.\n\nThe grand finale was a succession of hits, including \u201cRabiosa,\u201d \u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie,\u201d \u201cLa Tortura\u201d and \u201cLa Bicicleta.\u201d It reminded us of how vast Shakira's catalog is, and how enduring the hits are, even after a seven-year wait.\n\n\u201cFirst night in the U.S., incredible,\u201d she wrote on social media immediately after the concert. \u201cThank you, Chicago.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Shakira-august-chicago-2018-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?c596412deda54d9a807d"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Shakira-august-chicago-2018-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8468666/shakira-north-american-el-dorado-tour-live-review", "title": "Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-08-04T12:46:07-04:00", "published_time": "2018-08-04T11:47:35-04:00"}, "description": "Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado tour in Chicago on Friday night (Aug. 3).", "og": {"description": "Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado tour in Chicago on Friday night (Aug. 3).", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Shakira-august-chicago-2018-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Shakira Kicks Off El Dorado U.S. Tour| Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8468666/shakira-north-american-el-dorado-tour-live-review", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado tour in Chicago on Friday night (Aug. 3).", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Shakira-august-chicago-2018-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533397655.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
