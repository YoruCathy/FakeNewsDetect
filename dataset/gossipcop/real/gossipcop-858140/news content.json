Griffin was fired from her post last spring after she posed for a controversial photo in which she was shown holding what appears to be the decapitated head of President Donald Trump.\n\nGriffin apologized, but later retracted any expression of remorse. Cooper publicly condemned Griffin for taking the photo and the comedian has since revealed that her friendship with the CNN anchor ended because of the scandal.\n\nCNN will live-stream New Year's Eve coverage, without requiring log-in to a cable provider, on Dec. 31 from 8 p.m.-1:05 a.m. ET.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real", "Evan.Real Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-cooper-andy-cohen-set-host-cnns-new-years-eve-again-1166257", "title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN's New Year's Eve Again", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "CNN on Tuesday announced that Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will host the network's upcoming New Year's Eve celebration in New York for a second year in a row.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-cooper-andy-cohen-set-host-cnns-new-years-eve-again-1166257", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN's New Year's Eve Again", "description": "The duo are reteaming once more after the network fired Cooper's co-host Kathy Griffin in 2017 for posing with what appeared to be a decapitated Trump head.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN's New Year's Eve Again", "description": "The duo are reteaming once more after the network fired Cooper's co-host Kathy Griffin in 2017 for posing with what appeared to be a decapitated Trump head.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/anderson-cooper-andy-cohen-set-host-cnns-new-years-eve-again-1166257", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg", "width": 2559, "height": 1441, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN's New Year's Eve Again", "sailthru.description": "The duo are reteaming once more after the network fired Cooper's co-host Kathy Griffin in 2017 for posing with what appeared to be a decapitated Trump head.", "sailthru.author": "Evan Real", "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.date": "2018-12-04 12:37:30", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Anderson Cooper,Andy Cohen,CNN"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543898250.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
