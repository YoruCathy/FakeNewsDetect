As more and more followers flock to Jesus, Judas grows concerned that Jesus is becoming arrogant and losing sight of his principles. So when Jesus attacks the money changers in a temple, Judas finally turns on his teacher, setting both on a path to tragedy. Originally conceived as a concept album that hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts, the show eventually made its way to the stage in 1971 and garnered five Tony nominations in addition to winning a Drama Desk Award for Andrew Lloyd Webber. Now this globally celebrated classic comes to NBC in 2018 for a one-of-a-kind live staging on Easter Sunday that's sure to amaze with jaw-dropping spectacle and an all-star cast of beloved recording artists. The special will air from 8-10:15pm ET/PT.\n\nStudio\n\nUniversal Television, The Really Useful Group, Marc Platt Productions, Storyline Entertainment\n\nExecutive Producers\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber, Tim Rice, Marc Platt, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron", "images": ["https://img.nbc.com/sites/nbcunbc/files/images/2020/4/09/JCSS2020-Logo-1920x1080.jpg", "https://cdn.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png"], "top_img": "https://img.nbc.com/sites/nbcunbc/files/images/2020/4/09/JCSS2020-Logo-1920x1080.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbc.com/jesus-christ-superstar", "title": "Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert", "meta_data": {"description": "Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert - John Legend stars in the reimagined rock opera.", "og": {"type": "tv_show", "title": "Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert - NBC.com", "description": "Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert - John Legend stars in the reimagined rock opera.", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.nbc.com/sites/nbcunbc/files/images/2020/4/09/JCSS2020-Logo-1920x1080.jpg", "type": "image/jpg", "width": 1920, "height": 1080}, "site_name": "NBC", "url": "https://www.nbc.com/jesus-christ-superstar"}, "al": {"android": {"package": "com.nbcuni.nbc", "url": "nbctve://shows/jesus-christ-superstar", "app_name": "NBC"}, "ios": {"app_store_id": 442839435, "app_name": "NBC", "url": "nbctve://shows/jesus-christ-superstar"}, "ipad": {"app_store_id": 442839435, "app_name": "NBC", "url": "nbctve://shows/jesus-christ-superstar"}, "iphone": {"app_store_id": 442839435, "app_name": "NBC"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.nbc.com/jesus-christ-superstar", "should_fallback": "true"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert - NBC.com", "card": "app", "description": "Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert - John Legend stars in the reimagined rock opera.", "image": "https://img.nbc.com/sites/nbcunbc/files/images/2020/4/09/JCSS2020-Logo-1920x1080.jpg", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "NBC", "ipad": "NBC", "googleplay": "NBC"}, "id": {"iphone": 442839435, "ipad": 442839435, "googleplay": "com.nbcuni.nbc"}, "url": {"iphone": "nbctve://shows/jesus-christ-superstar", "ipad": "nbctve://shows/jesus-christ-superstar", "googleplay": "nbctve://shows/jesus-christ-superstar"}, "country": "US"}, "site": {"identifier": "@nbc", "id": 26585095}, "url": "https://www.nbc.com/jesus-christ-superstar"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-media-service-subscription": "expires=9999, type=free", "fb": {"app_id": 653521154659171}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.nbc.com", "summary": ""}
