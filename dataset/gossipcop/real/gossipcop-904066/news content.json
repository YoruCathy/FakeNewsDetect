The Atlanta star has welcomed his second child, a boy, with his girlfriend Michelle, Us Weekly confirms.\n\n\u201cI sleep four hours a night! I mean I don\u2019t dream as much, I just miss dreaming!\u201d Glover told Us about balancing his career and being a father on Friday, January 5, at the Television Critics Association Winter Press Tour.\n\nGlover also told Us that his life hasn\u2019t changed a ton since welcoming his second son.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t. My partner, she does all the hard stuff to be honest. I haven\u2019t really had to change anything. It\u2019s given me another perception of what life is. It gives me a lot of context!\u201d Glover said on Friday.\n\nUs Weekly exclusively confirmed back in October 2016 that the rapper known as Childish Gambino, who is notoriously private about his personal life, welcomed his first child with Michelle. He revealed he was becoming a father for the second time during his acceptance speech for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 2017 Emmys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy. Wow! Thank you guys so much. This is nuts,\u201d Glover, 34, began in his speech in September. \u201cI really want to thank the Academy again, everybody in here, you guys. I love you. I want to thank my mom and my dad again, I want to thank the city of Atlanta. I want to thank FX.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI want to thank \u2014 I want to thank Michelle, my partner, you love me even how crazy I get. I want to thank my baby, my son, for just being the joy in my life. I want to thank my unborn son; we\u2019re listening to Stevie [Wonder] tonight.\u201d\n\nGlover, who is set to perform at the Grammys later this month, also spoke to ET about his creative process.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t rush my work. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re the type of people to do that,\u201d he told the publication on Friday. \u201cI\u2019d hate to be like, \u2018It was worth the wait.\u2019 You\u2019ll decide that. But it definitely won\u2019t be cheap because of that. It\u2019s a good season. I really like it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gloveratlanta.jpg?w=300", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/donald-glover-welcomed-baby-no-2-with-girlfriend-michelle/", "title": "Donald Glover Reveals Girlfriend Michelle Gave Birth to Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Donald Glover revealed that his girlfriend Michelle gave birth to their second child together \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Donald Glover Reveals Girlfriend Michelle Gave Birth to Baby No. 2", "description": "Donald Glover revealed that his girlfriend Michelle gave birth to their second child together \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/donald-glover-welcomed-baby-no-2-with-girlfriend-michelle/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:05:35+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-01-05T22:47:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:05:35+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Donald Glover revealed that his girlfriend Michelle gave birth to their second child together \u2014 get the details", "title": "Donald Glover Reveals Girlfriend Michelle Gave Birth to Baby No. 2", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glover.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515192423.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
