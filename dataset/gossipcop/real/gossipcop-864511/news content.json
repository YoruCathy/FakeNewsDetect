Here\u2019s a reminder of the story so far.\n\nSeason 1\n\nMembers of the Night\u2019s Watch, an ancient order guarding the Wall to the north of Westeros, encounter a supernatural being known as a White Walker in the forest, previously assumed to be mythical.\n\nNed Stark (Sean Bean), Warden of the North, is visited in Winterfell by Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) and invited to serve at his side following the sudden death of Jon Arryn, the previous Hand of the King. Stark\u2019s daughters Sansa (Turner) and Arya (Williams) travel with him to King\u2019s Landing but find the corrupt city-state in disarray.\n\nThe family of Baratheon\u2019s bride, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), are allegedly behind the killing of Arryn. His son Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) witnesses Cersei in bed with her brother Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), who shoves him from a tower window, leaving Bran paralysed.\n\nTyrion Lannister (Dinklage), a dwarf dilettante, accompanies Ned\u2019s bastard son Jon Snow (Harrington) to investigate the White Walker incident reported by the Night\u2019s Watch. Snow stays on with the order. Tyrion is arrested at the behest of Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), who believes him responsible for Bran\u2019s fall, prompting a trial by combat to secure his release. Tyrion, imprisoned in the Vale under the watchful eye of Catelyn\u2019s sister Lysa Arryn (Kate Dickie), enlists Bronn (Jerome Flynn) to fight for him. He defeats Arryn\u2019s chosen champion.\n\nWhen Baratheon is fatally wounded in a suspicious hunting accident, Ned is named Protector of the Realm until Cersei\u2019s sadistic son Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) comes of age. Ned, however, plans to instal Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane), the king\u2019s estranged brother, in his stead. Ned is betrayed by councillor Lord Petyr \u201cLittlefinger\u201d Baelish (Aidan Gillan) and decapitated on Joffrey\u2019s orders.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Tyrion crosses the Narrow Sea in the hope of meeting Daenerys, whom he believes can defeat Cersei.\n\nRoose Bolton returns to Winterfell from the Red Wedding to find that his vicious son Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) has tortured Theon to the point of madness, so much so that he now answers only to the name \u201cReek\u201d.\n\nIn the north, Jon Snow returns from the Wildling camp to warn the Night\u2019s Watch of Mance Rayder\u2019s advancing forces, who duly lay siege to Castle Black.

He burns her alive, losing the respect of his own troops.\n\nLittlefinger leads Sansa to Ramsay Bolton with the intention of marrying them, an event that would mean the return of the Starks to Winterfell.\n\nStannis arrives to fight the Boltons but is easily dispatched when his men desert over doubts about his pagan zealotry.

However, she struggles to retain control of the desert slave city when an anonymous collective known as the Sons of the Harpy rise up against her.

In his grief, Tommen commits suicide.\n\nDaenerys is now a prisoner of the Dhothraki. The barbarians expect the wife of their late Khal to live in seclusion like other widows.
