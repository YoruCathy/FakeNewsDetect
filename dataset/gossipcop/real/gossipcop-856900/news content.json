The Internet lost its mind; the photo became the record-breaking most-liked post on Instagram, and Twitter took off with memes and GIFs. Though the fanfare following her birth announcement might have been the biggest Hollywood has seen, Bey is joining a group of famous mothers of twins, which will now also include Amal Clooney. One of said mothers, Jennifer Lopez\u2014who has nine-year-old twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Marc Anthony\u2014is here to offer some advice to her fellow star, per Page Six.\n\n\u201cNothing can prepare you for twins,\u201d she cautioned at the premiere of her NBC series Shades of Blue. \u201cI certainly was not prepared. I would say, \u2018Stay calm.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHer advice is simple but sound. Zoe Saldana, whose twin sons Cy and Bowie Perego-Saldana are two, shared a story with E! News in January that proves raising twins is no task for the faint of heart. She said bedtime alone is a bilingual whirlwind.\n\n\u201cOne is more into talking in Spanish. The other is expressing himself more in English,\u201d she added. \u201cOne is like, \u2018No quiero! No quiero!\u2019 And the other is like, \u2018I don't wanna!\u2019 You're like, \u2018It's time to go to sleep,\u2019 and they\u2019re both yelling at you all these things. And when they start fighting, they just look like two lads at a pub fighting over like the wrong girl, too. It's like, \u2018Ugh!\u2019 It's just vicious. \u2018You guys are only two; this is horrible.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter Celine Dion gave birth to her twins Nelson and Eddy Angelil in 2010, she shared those early days in a special interview in her home on the Oprah Show. Still in her pajamas as she rocked her newborns, the new mother shared her secret to parenting multiples.\n\n\u201cMe, I\u2019m extremely fortunate because I have a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of help,\u201d the singer said as her mother and sister joined the room to tend to the sleepy babies and allow Dion to pour her morning coffee.\n\nFortunately for Beyonc\u00e9, Tina Knowles Lawson seems to already be on board in the role of proud grandmother.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898b79b1eeeaa1f3b7f600f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pregnant-performers-kelly-clarkson.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58922da2b9ae9c605ed18a35/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/beyonce-twins.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898b79b1eeeaa1f3b7f6010/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pregnant-performers-alicia-keys.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58a119271fce8b83738d9d25/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/beyonce-performance-grammys-2017.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/589257091eeeaa1f3b7f5ee4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/beyonce-jay-z-pregnant-twins.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Weaver", "Hilary Weave", "Erika Harwoo", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/jennifer-lopez-shares-advice-with-beyonce-on-twins", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Has Some Advice for Beyonc\u00e9 About Raising Twins", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hilary Weaver", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The seasoned mother of twins offered some wise words for Bey.", "id": "58b9b981f2a983252a4f245b", "keywords": "celebrity,beyonc\u00e9,jennifer lopez,twins,zoe saldana,celine dion,beyonce", "news_keywords": "celebrity,beyonc\u00e9,jennifer lopez,twins,zoe saldana,celine dion,beyonce", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58b9b981f2a983252a4f245b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The seasoned mother of twins offered some wise words for Bey.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The seasoned mother of twins offered some wise words for Bey.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Has Some Advice for Beyonc\u00e9 About Raising Twins", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/jennifer-lopez-shares-advice-with-beyonce-on-twins"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The seasoned mother of twins offered some wise words for Bey.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b9b9bac486164de2e4543d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lopez-beyonce-twin-baby-advice.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Has Some Advice for Beyonc\u00e9 About Raising Twins"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
