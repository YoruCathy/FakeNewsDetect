Read at your own risk.\n\nAnother long-time cast member has exited Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. Ra\u00fal Esparza has left the long-running NBC procedural after six seasons, EW has learned exclusively.\n\nThe actor joined SVU as Assistant District Attorney Rafael Barba in season 14 in a recurring capacity, before being upped to series regular in season 15.\n\nDuring Wednesday\u2019s episode, Barba ultimately left the District Attorney\u2019s office after pulling the plug on a brain dead child. Esparza has effectively exited as a series regular, but the door is open for him to return. In his stead, Chicago Justice character Peter Stone (Philip Winchester) has become the new ADA, with Winchester being added to the show as a regular who will likely continue with the show next season should it be renewed.\n\n\u201cIt has truly been an honor writing for Ra\u00fal,\u201d SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin says. \u201cThe power, sensitivity, and morality he brought to the character of Rafael Barba never failed to elevate our scripts. Ra\u00fal is family and we look forward to seeing his talent shine in new projects. As for Barba, SVU fans may see him again soon.\u201d\n\nThough SVU has been on for 19 seasons, the show hasn\u2019t seen too much turnover in recent years. After Christopher Meloni exited in season 12, fellow originals Richard Belzer and Dann Florek both left in season 15. Danny Pino, who joined the show in season 13, was the show\u2019s last big exit back in season 16.\n\nFollowing his departure, Esparza is temporarily returning to his Broadway roots for a Chess revival at the Kennedy Center. What\u2019s next for him after that? And why did he decide to leave SVU now? Read our full interview to get the scoop:\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Was it your decision to leave the series?\n\nRAUL ESPARZA: Yes.\n\nWhy did you decide to leave now?\n\nI\u2019ve done six seasons, I felt like it was time to go. I had explored a lot of what I thought Barba was about. I just felt it was time to move on. I was also feeling like the role has changed over the years in a way that has been an interesting experience for me. Again, I\u2019m a theater guy, so it\u2019s like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it. The learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.\n\nYou were also close with former SVU showrunner Warren Leight, who exited a few seasons back. Was that a factor in your decision to leave?\n\nYeah, I think that\u2019s pretty much understood. [Laughs]\n\nWere you surprised by the way in which Barba exited the series?\n\nYeah, it wasn\u2019t really a way that I figured that he would go out. But I do have to say that when we worked on the script, it was pretty extraordinary. I don\u2019t watch myself, so I haven\u2019t seen the episode, but putting it together was a really great experience. It\u2019s one of those things that you just learn as you go, what a script really is, and it was a surprising one. I think that [current showrunner] Michael Chernuchin has done some really beautiful writing for Barba this season, in a way that\u2019s like a really beautiful gift that got handed to me. Because I had decided to leave at the beginning of the season, before he came in, and then they hand me this beautiful gift with some really gorgeous writing from a new showrunner, who has really taken care of me this year. And this particular script was something very dear to him. As we began to do it I started to find that it was challenging, and emotional, and surprising, and not at all what I expected from having just read it on the page.\n\nWere there alternate ways in which Barba could leave, like him dying?\n\nI\u2019ll say that the one thing we talked about is he absolutely doesn\u2019t need to die, because it\u2019s not like I\u2019m leaving on bad terms. I think that Barba\u2019s become a part of the SVU family, and I think there\u2019s a life for him \u2014 I don\u2019t know necessarily, but it\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a life for him as the series goes on. I\u2019m glad they left that door open.\n\nWould you be interested in returning to SVU in the future?\n\nAbsolutely, because I\u2019m really rooting for the opportunity to make television history with the series. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say that\u2019s part of what we all hope for, that NBC manages in the end to get a record-breaking series on its hands with potential 21 years. Also, this doesn\u2019t always happen when you work with people, but I became friends with Mariska [Hargitay] and she\u2019s part of my life now. I don\u2019t just miss the role, I miss her, so any opportunity to get back into a room with her is valuable to me. Part of the reason I became Barba, and that it turned into the show that it did for me, was the way I hit it off with her and that was surprising. What was supposed to be a guest starring spot that Warren had written for me morphed into something very rich and surprising, and I really am not blowing smoke when I say it\u2019s entirely because of the space that was created between me and Mariska. It\u2019s chemistry \u2014 it happens or doesn\u2019t, and it happened.\n\nIt almost seemed like there was a potential for romance between Barba and Benson. Did you ever think the show would go that route?\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t, honestly, because they are both workaholics. I was never really interested in exploring his private life as much in terms of feeling like he\u2019s a man who has given up on relationships in order to succeed. His ambition has driven him. Maybe that\u2019s making an excuse for what they do or don\u2019t write on shows like Law & Order, but Benson\u2019s life is a much more complicated situation. I always thought it would remove a layer of excitement and friction and sexiness between us if we ever went in that direction. I really thought that would just state the obvious instead of letting it just simmer, which one of the rules of good television is keep them wanting \u2014 never have successful relationships and keep them wanting the one that you really wish would happen.\n\nIs there anything you wish you got to do with Barba that you didn\u2019t get a chance to?\n\nHonestly, no. If the show had been a different kind of show, it\u2019d be fun to spin into the political world of what the DAs office is all about, but that\u2019s not really what Law & Order: SVU is about. When they do the Barba spin-off, maybe we can go in that direction, right? [Laughs] I think New York politics in the mayor\u2019s office and with the district attorney\u2019s office is fascinating, but that would be a different world. That\u2019s the only thing we glanced at, but never really got into it. Other than that, I feel like Barba turned out to be both a showman and someone who slowly reined in his ambition to become a truly top-notch prosecutor. His intelligence was ferocious, his turn-of-phrase, and the ways that Benson changed him were apparent to me season by season, and the ways that he changed her were also really alive for me. So that\u2019s pretty rich stuff to get to play with.\n\nImage zoom Michael Parmelee/NBC\n\nWhat was it like having Sam Waterston and Philip Winchester come in for your final episode?\n\nIt was ridiculous. First of all, Philip is one of the coolest, nicest guys I\u2019ve gotten the opportunity to work with and welcoming him to SVU-land was pretty wonderful. For years, long before I had anything to do with Law & Order, Sam Waterston\u2019s performance as Jack McCoy is one of the great TV performances. I feel like it was a benchmark for me of excellence in what you could do in a procedural with material that didn\u2019t reveal a great deal about a character except for what they did, and he revealed an entire life and an entire person for so many years. I think Sam\u2019s a truly great actor, so he paid me an enormous compliment by coming in to see Barba off. It was a little bit of a passing of a baton, but also an opportunity for me to have what felt like a total career highlight. And I\u2019m not making that up, it was thrilling that time I got to spend with him \u2014 for the admiration, for the role, and for him in it and just to have his presence there. Even though we are on the series, you still get a little bit starstruck when some of the main people from the first show, show up. You just do. It\u2019s a little like, \u201cOh yeah, wow, because I\u2019ve been watching you since I was whatever age.\u201d\n\nAs you\u2019re in the middle of rehearsals for Chess right now, was getting back into the world of Broadway a priority for you?\n\nI mean, I miss it. There\u2019s this amazing concert, we\u2019re doing the musical Chess, which has not had a Broadway revival in 30 years, and so we\u2019re looking at it and have been working on it. It\u2019s just really a ferociously cool cast and we started reading it last summer, and we are going to do it at the Kennedy Center concert next week. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing and beyond that, I have no sense of what the Broadway world holds. It\u2019s part of my career and of course I miss it, because I miss the relationship to the audience. I love being on stage, but I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say that doing SVU and then doing Hannibal at the same time, and doing the kind of work that I\u2019ve been doing for the last few years, hasn\u2019t been a total amazing head rush. There is something to be missed of a live performance, but this is a whole new world that I am really thrilled to be a part of, and I don\u2019t plan on leaving it. This season, I\u2019m playing a professor on The Path for Hulu, and that was a fantastic arc to be part of and work with Michelle Monaghan, Aaron [Paul], and Hugh [Dancy], who I worked with on Hannibal. To go back and forth between that and SVU this year was thrilling, and also seeing the ways that television is being made, the differences between the ways that shows are made, and learning in every cast that I\u2019m part of how the whole experience comes together. I still feel like a newbie at this.\n\nI look back at some of my episodes when I first started: I\u2019m not bad, I\u2019m good, that\u2019s great. But then I see stuff now and I\u2019m like, holy sh\u2014, I\u2019ve learned so much about how to do this thing. The relationship with the camera, the camera can read your mind. There\u2019s no audience in any theater that can do what a camera can do. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, on Broadway \u2014 well, maybe not right now, I mean with the way that social media has changed some of the things that happen on stage \u2014 but for the most part, you\u2019re famous in a 10-block radius. What a television series does is put you in people\u2019s homes all over the world. It just completely transforms how far your acting can go and who it reaches. I am most grateful for the opportunity of rounding out my career. It was a big theater career, and now I\u2019ve been able to do these other projects. I mean, just last season \u2014 I was thinking about it before we started this interview \u2014 Bojack Horseman, Ferdinand, which I can\u2019t believe they got nominated for an Oscar for that, and then the work on The Path and the work on SVU, and now working on a Broadway musical, it\u2019s pretty thrilling.\n\nAny dream shows you would want to appear on?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m kind of obsessing over The Crown. And who doesn\u2019t want to be on Game of Thrones, honestly? But for years, my go-to was, \u201cI just want to be a zombie on The Walking Dead.\u201d [Laughs] Oh yeah, especially as soon as Danai [Gurira] joined, because Danai and I were in a film for Wes Craven many years ago, and as soon as she was on it, I was like, \u201cOh come on, I just wanna be there, just be like King Zombie, just one episode.\u201d It\u2019s hard to watch television when you\u2019re making television. I\u2019ve been catching up on some shows, and right now I\u2019m currently obsessing about The Crown. I think it\u2019s some of the best acting I\u2019ve seen on TV. I\u2019m like, \u201cHuh, I wonder if there\u2019s a role I can play there?\u201d\n\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.", "images":
