The Ukranian choreographer, 37, cited undisclosed \u201cpersonal issues\u201d for skipping the show, forcing Alan Bernsten to fill in for him.\n\nHe later apologized to the former Total Request Live cohost, 36, on Wednesday, October 4, with a tweet that said, \u201cAs you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my absence and want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the DWTS fan favorite and Lachey\u2019s partnership was \u201cnot going well.\u201d\n\nA source told Us, \u201cTheir personalities are very similar so they disagree about everything. They refuse to give into one another,\u201d before adding, \u201cThey\u2019re playing nice for the cameras but both are miserable paired with each other \u2014 there is a lot of fighting going on behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nHowever, an insider exclusively told Us the pair will appear on the upcoming DWTS episode on Monday, October 9, saying, \u201cThey have already rehearsed this week. Things are good. It\u2019s water under the bridge. Things are returning to normal.\u201d\n\nDancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-hug-dancing-with-the-stars-c63cc9ab-bb02-459f-9910-61871f67bb2c.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-dancing-with-the-stars-43344162-7a1f-4ff6-9268-0ce64c934e3d.jpg?crop=1px%2C77px%2C1999px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-dancing-with-the-stars-43344162-7a1f-4ff6-9268-0ce64c934e3d.jpg?crop=1px%2C77px%2C1999px%2C1124px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-dancing-with-the-stars-43344162-7a1f-4ff6-9268-0ce64c934e3d.jpg?crop=1px%2C77px%2C1999px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/vanessa-lachey-maks-chmerkovskiy-hug-amid-dwts-feud-w507735/", "title": "Vanessa Lachey, Maks Chmerkovskiy Hug Amid \u2018DWTS\u2019 Feud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Maks Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey were seen hugging it out while leaving a DWTS rehearsal on Saturday, October 7, amid rumors of a feud \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vanessa Lachey, Maks Chmerkovskiy Hug Amid \u2018DWTS\u2019 Feud", "description": "Maks Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey were seen hugging it out while leaving a DWTS rehearsal on Saturday, October 7, amid rumors of a feud \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/vanessa-lachey-maks-chmerkovskiy-hug-amid-dwts-feud-w507735/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:27:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-dancing-with-the-stars-43344162-7a1f-4ff6-9268-0ce64c934e3d.jpg?crop=1px%2C77px%2C1999px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-dancing-with-the-stars-43344162-7a1f-4ff6-9268-0ce64c934e3d.jpg?crop=1px%2C77px%2C1999px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-08T18:37:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:27:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Maks Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey were seen hugging it out while leaving a DWTS rehearsal on Saturday, October 7, amid rumors of a feud \u2014 read more", "title": "Vanessa Lachey, Maks Chmerkovskiy Hug Amid \u2018DWTS\u2019 Feud", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/vanessa-lachey-maksim-chmerkovskiy-feud-dancing-with-the-stars-43344162-7a1f-4ff6-9268-0ce64c934e3d.jpg?crop=1px%2C77px%2C1999px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507487820.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
