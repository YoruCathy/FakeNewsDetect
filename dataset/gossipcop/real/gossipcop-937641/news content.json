Here\u2019s what we know so far about how the wedding will be different.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.\n\nThe marriage of Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle will take place at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle in May 2018. pic.twitter.com/lJdtWnbdpB \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) November 28, 2017\n\nSt. George\u2019s Chapel contains the tombs of 10 royals, including Henry VIII and his third wife, Jane Seymour. At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. \"Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.\n\nSt. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

According to NBC News, Harry\u2019s uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.\n\nThe space is much smaller than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000, The Guardian reports. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony reflect their personalities and they're determining a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. Either way, the tone seems like it will be much different from William and Kate\u2019s pomp and circumstance.\n\n\u201cIt will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,\u201d their spokesman told journalists. \u201cThe couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Friedman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13953184/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-differences-william-kate/", "title": "Harry and Meghan\u2019s Wedding Will Be Very Different From William and Kate\u2019s", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Harry and Meghan\u2019s Wedding Will Be Very Different From William and Kate\u2019s", "description": "For one, it won't take place in London.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13953184/prince-harry-meghan-markle-wedding-differences-william-kate/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2017-11-28 05:13:43", "published_time": "2017-11-28 05:11:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Wedding Compared to Prince William and Kate Middleton - Differences Between Prince Harry and Prince William's Weddings", "description": "Here's how Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding will be different than Prince William and Kate Middleton's.", "keywords": "catherine, duchess catherine, duchess kate, duchess of cambridge, kate middleton, meghan markle, prince harry, prince william, royal engagement, royal wedding, prince harry and meghan markle wedding", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity,latest,duchess catherine,duchess kate,meghan markle,Duchess of Cambridge,prince harry,catherine,prince william,kate middleton", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-28T17:11:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/harry-william-weddings-1511886257.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Harry and Meghan\u2019s Wedding Will Be Very Different From William and Kate\u2019s", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511817060.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com", "summary": ""}
