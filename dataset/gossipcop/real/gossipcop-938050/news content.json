The 28-year-old, born as Tim Bergling, will be remembered in a private affair with those closest to him.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to Billboard, Avicii\u2019s family wrote:\n\n\u201cThere have been many inquiries regarding the funeral arrangements for Tim Bergling, known by music fans as Avicii. The Bergling family has now confirmed that the funeral will be private, in the presence of the people who were closest to Tim. They kindly ask media to respect this. There is no additional information forthcoming.\u201d\n\nOn April 20, 2018, the EDM community was shook to its core when Avicii\u2019s body was found in his hotel room in Oman. Authorities have since ruled out foul play. An autopsy report has yet to be revealed, although a previous statement from his family implied suicide.\n\nThat statement read:\n\n\u201cOur beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who traveled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress. When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be happy and be able to do what he loved most \u2013 music. He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could not go on any longer\u2026\u201d\n\nAs always, Avicii\u2019s family is asking their privacy be respected in this especially difficult time.\n\nFans will get to hear a new Avicii album with his family\u2019s blessing, according to Swedish magazine Aftonbladet. Details on that here.\n\nRIP, legend.\n\nSource: Billboard | Photo via Rukes.com", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21854097&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/calvin-harris_rukes_stereosonic-360x240.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/18e2df34fbf019d34382a91393e5df24?s=100&d=mm&r=x", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Galantis-Dolly-Parton-credit-Erik-Melvin-360x240.jpg", "http://c.statcounter.com/8067188/0/9a21a678/1/", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-rss.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-youtubeblk.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/avicii-somber-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/avicii-rough-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-facebookblk.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=270428839820698&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Spotify-Excl.-1-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/avicii-ultra-rukes-2.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Episode-137-Matt-Goldman-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-twitter1.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-twitterblk1.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/dillon-francis-diplo-hard-summer-2018-rukes-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-facebook.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-soundcloud.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/laidback_luke_1_lr-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/avicii-somber-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yedmv3sm.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/martin-garrix-ayyy-you-ultra-australia-2019-rukes-360x240.jpg", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/64-soundcloudblk.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/yedmlogo5.png", "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disclosure-youredm-360x240.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.youredm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/avicii-somber-1024x683.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.youredm.com/2018/05/22/aviciis-funeral-private/", "title": "Avicii\u2019s Funeral Will Be Private, According to Family", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Just over a month after\u00a0Avicii's unexpected passing, his family has announced funeral arrangements for the late DJ/producer.
