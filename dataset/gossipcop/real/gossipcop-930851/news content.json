Unsurprisingly, Kardashian\u2019s appearance on the TV game show has touched off feuding even before it airs.\n\nHarvey told Ellen DeGeneres a few weeks ago that Kardashian \u201cdidn\u2019t know nothing\u201d on the show, and praised Kardashian\u2019s husband, rapper Kanye West, as \u201cthe best \u2018Family Feud\u2019 celebrity panelist we\u2019ve ever had on the show.\u201d\n\nIn a new interview with DeGeneres, Kardashian said she\u2019s \u201cconfused\u201d by Harvey\u2019s claims, considering she\u2019s been a \u201cFamily Feud\u201d fan forever.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand \u2015 When I used to work in my dad\u2019s office as a teenager, I used to sit and not do my work, and play \u2018Family Feud\u2019 online,\u201d Kardashian said on Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cEllen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was my thing. I\u2019m good at it,\u201d she added.\n\nBut as DeGeneres pointed out, that\u2019s not what Harvey said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I got one answer, and it was a legitimate answer,\u201d Kardashian said, smiling. \u201cI feel like the more I talk about it, I get so angry.\u201d\n\nShe then repeated that she\u2019s \u201creally, really good\u201d at the game show and that Harvey\u2019s words were odd.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he was trying to be funny or what, so I was confused by his response to me,\u201d she said.\n\nKardashian also addressed allegations that Tristan Thompson has been cheating on her sister, Khloe. The NBA player was caught on videos with other women in the months leading up to the birth of his first child with Khloe in April.\n\n\u201cPoor Khloe,\u201d the reality TV star told DeGeneres. \u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe it besides it\u2019s just so fucked up.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe really were rooting for Khloe and we still are. She\u2019s so strong and she\u2019s doing the best that she can.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a really sad situation all over. I kind of made this rule with my brother,\u201d Kardashian said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a baby involved, I\u2019m going to keep it cute and classy and try not to say anything negative, because one day True is going to see this. It\u2019s just so messed up.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae867a81e00002d008e417d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5beb23a0200000ce050292ad.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae8674d1a00002800cdd534.png?cache=012uvwgxph&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5df70b30240000840a5a35d7.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae8674d1a00002800cdd534.png?cache=012uvwgxph&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-is-angry-about-steve-harveys-family-feud-claims_n_5ae754dce4b055fd7fce928a", "title": "Kim Kardashian Confused By Steve Harvey Dig That She 'Didn't Know Nothing'", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I feel like the more I talk about it I get so angry.\"", "keywords": "Celebrities,kim kardashian,Ellen DeGeneres,steve harvey,family feud", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Confused By Steve Harvey Dig That She 'Didn't Know Nothing'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae8674d1a00002800cdd534.png?cache=012uvwgxph&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae8674d1a00002800cdd534.png?cache=012uvwgxph&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-is-angry-about-steve-harveys-family-feud-claims_n_5ae754dce4b055fd7fce928a", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"I feel like the more I talk about it I get so angry.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Celebrities,kim kardashian,Ellen DeGeneres,steve harvey,family feud", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-05-01 10:39:14 -0400", "modified_time": "2018-05-01 10:39:14 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Kim Kardashian Confused By Steve Harvey Dig That She 'Didn't Know Nothing'", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ae8674d1a00002800cdd534.png?cache=012uvwgxph&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"I feel like the more I talk about it I get so angry.\"", "creator": "ledbettercarly"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5ae754dce4b055fd7fce928a", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525185554.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
