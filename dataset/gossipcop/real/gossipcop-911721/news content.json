The unique monikers that have been making the rounds include Butterfly, Posie and Monarch.\n\nFans first speculated that Jenner named her first child Butterfly after the 20-year-old wore a butterfly necklace and showed off the baby\u2019s butterfly-themed nursery in a video that Jenner shared on YouTube on Sunday, February 4, to announce that she quietly gave birth three days earlier.\n\nBut then, Kylie\u2019s mother, Kris Jenner, shared a promotional photo on Instagram of her daughter\u2019s latest beauty product, causing fans to wonder if it was yet another clue. The new Lip Kit shade is called Posie K. and it comes packaged in a pink box. Some Instagram users speculated that Posie can be used as a nickname for Mariposa, a Spanish word that translates to \u201cbutterfly.\u201d In addition, the K in the product\u2019s name could either be a middle initial or even an homage to Kylie\u2019s sisters, all whose names begin with the letter.\n\nOver on Twitter, fans continued the butterfly-themed name speculation, with many placing their bets on Monarch. \u201cI\u2019m calling it right now, Kylie is going to call the baby Monarch. It\u2019s butterfly related AND bougie af, the perfect mix,\u201d one user tweeted. Another wrote, \u201cWith all the emphasis on butterflies, I\u2019m guess[ing] Kylie is naming the baby \u2018Monarch\u2019 \u2026 \u2018Queen.\u2019\u201d\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to Us Weekly in September 2017 that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star was expecting her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott, whom she began dating that April. She chose to keep her pregnancy private, explaining in an Instagram post on Sunday, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions. I understand you\u2019re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world \u2026 for my little life and our happiness.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby-name.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kylie-jenner-baby-name-theories-butterfly-posie-monarch/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Baby Name Theories: Butterfly, Posie, Monarch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s fans first thought she named her newborn daughter Butterfly, but now there\u2019s speculation that she called the baby Posie or Monarch \u2014 see the theories", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "These Kylie Jenner Baby Name Theories Are Driving Fans Wild", "description": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s fans first thought she named her newborn daughter Butterfly, but now there\u2019s speculation that she called the baby Posie or Monarch \u2014 see the theories", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kylie-jenner-baby-name-theories-butterfly-posie-monarch/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-05T18:10:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-02-05T17:51:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-05T18:10:03+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s fans first thought she named her newborn daughter Butterfly, but now there\u2019s speculation that she called the baby Posie or Monarch \u2014 see the theories", "title": "These Kylie Jenner Baby Name Theories Are Driving Fans Wild", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby-name.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517853075.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
