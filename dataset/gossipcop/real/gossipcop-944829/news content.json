The couple are already parents to three daughters, Olivia, 7, Annabel Leah, 4, and Emilia, 2, as well as son Joshua, 6.\n\n\"Thrilled to announce we welcomed a brand new baby girl into the world Friday morning, just in time for #FathersDay ?\" Van Der Beek wrote. \"These last few days, as I\u2019ve enjoyed the privilege of making smoothies I know my older kids will like, making my wife red raspberry leaf tea to ease her uterine contractions, spending 'boy time' with my son and getting my two year-old down for a nap in the way only I know how... I\u2019ve been heart sick about something.\"\n\nThe former Dawson's Creek star then went on to criticize the Donald Trump Administration's crack down on illegal immigration with a zero-tolerance policy of separating families at the border.\n\n\"As I write this, kids are being ripped from the arms of their parents. By our government. For the kid\u2019s benefit? No - the opposite - as a purposeful display of cruelty to deter would-be illegal border crossers AND legal asylum seekers (it\u2019s happening to both). And it wouldn\u2019t be honest to wax poetic about my new-baby bliss without speaking up against this atrocity,\" Van Der Beek wrote.\n\nHe concluded with a sweet message to his wife, Kimberly.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, and @vanderkimberly -- you\u2019re a f*cking earth goddess rock star and I\u2019m as in awe of you as I am in love with you,\" he wrote. \"And our new baby\u2019s name is Gwendolyn \u2764\ufe0f #HappyFathersDay everybody.\"\n\nThe couple announced that they were expanding their brood back in February, with a sweet shot of the family crowded around Kimberly's baby bump.\n\n\"Thrilled beyond belief to announce that we are once again adding to our family ?,\" James captioned the pic. \"And I say 'beyond belief' because some people are probably wondering if we\u2019re out of our minds. Which we might very well be... but I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Or grateful. Or in awe of @vanderkimberly.\"\n\nHowever, the couple were also realistic about being way outnumbered by their growing family. Prior to welcoming their fifth child, James posted a pic of their kids on a sweet farm outing, with the knowing caption, \"In a few weeks, we\u2019ll look back on today and think, 'Boy, wasn\u2019t that easy?'\"\n\nSee more on the sweet family in the video below!\n\nJames Van Der Beek Welcomes Baby No. 4 With Wife Kimberly This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
