News is reporting that an anonymous call about a suicide threat involving Carter came into St. Petersburg, Fla. police department last night.\n\nE! News obtained police documents that state that police responded to the home at 10:01 p.m., however, they did not make contact with Carter.\n\nThe documents also stated that the caller claims that Carter told a friend he was going to kill himself.\n\nWhen police arrived at Carter's house there was no answer at the door and they did not see anyone.\n\nThis all comes after earlier concerns in the week for the welfare of Aaron.\n\nOn Tuesday he was involved in a car incident, in which he broke his nose and totaled his car.\n\n\n\nThen on Wednesday, Carter was visited by the police three times at his home following an anonymous call that said Carter had recently tried to buy a gun and had also made threats of harm against others, including his family.\n\nWe just really hope that Aaron gets the help he needs!\n\nWHERE TO GET HELP:\n\n\n\nIf you are worried about your or someone else's mental health, the best place to get help is your GP or local mental health provider.
