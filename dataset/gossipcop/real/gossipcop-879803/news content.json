I then did a CAT scan then a PET scan and then he said to me, \u2018You have lung cancer, but it looks very small, in the beginning stages.\u2019\u201d\n\nKing, 83, immediately underwent surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on July 17.\n\n\u201cThe doctor said to me, \u2018It was malignant, but you were in the first stage. If it had stayed and we didn\u2019t find it, you would have had trouble in two or three years, but we got it and you were lucky.\u2019\u201d\n\nKing told the celebrity news magazine it took two weeks to recover after surgery and he then immediately went back to work.\n\n\u201cThey showed me my latest chest X-ray, which is all clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was fun to see where that spot was and there is no spot now. They took off 20 percent of the lung.\u201d\n\nKing hasn\u2019t smoked cigarettes since his heart attack in the late \u201880s. However, his former habit was the reason behind his latest health scare.\n\n\u201cThe doctor said that tobacco from 30 years ago is still related to this lung cancer,\u201d he said.\n\nKing is hoping his experience will encourage others to see their doctors and make sure their health is in tip-top shape.\n\n\u201cWhen you are [getting] a checkup, get a chest X-ray because lung cancer ain\u2019t going to tell you it\u2019s there, but a simple chest X-ray will,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it shows you one little spot, you will do a CAT scan. They are all painless.\u201d\n\nThese days, King is keeping busy with his thriving career, which has lasted for over 60 years.\n\n\u201cI will probably die on the air,\u201d he joked. \u201cI have beaten so many things health-wise to feel this good now. I have no plans to retire. I\u2019ve never ever felt better than I do now.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ronnie-wood-mick-jagger-keith-richards-rolling-stones.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20110019543582.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/12/29/694940094001_5265534441001_Larry-King-remembers-Debbie-Reynolds--Carrie-Fisher.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/12/29/931/524/694940094001_5265534441001_Larry-King-remembers-Debbie-Reynolds--Carrie-Fisher.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/PattonOswalt1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/nickcordero.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/12/29/694940094001_5265534441001_Larry-King-remembers-Debbie-Reynolds--Carrie-Fisher.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/larry-kings-secret-lung-cancer-battle-revealed", "title": "Larry King's secret lung cancer battle revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The legendary TV host received the shocking news during a routine visit with his doctor.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Larry King's secret lung cancer battle revealed", "dcterms.abstract": "The legendary TV host received the shocking news during a routine visit with his doctor.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "The legendary TV host received the shocking news during a routine visit with his doctor.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:d9b56c01-1ed4-54b8-a736-a93c1025255a", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-09-13", "dcterms.created": "2017-09-13T18:18:48-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-09-18T19:39:50-04:00", "og": {"title": "Larry King's secret lung cancer battle revealed", "description": "The legendary TV host received the shocking news during a routine visit with his doctor.", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/12/29/694940094001_5265534441001_Larry-King-remembers-Debbie-Reynolds--Carrie-Fisher.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/larry-kings-secret-lung-cancer-battle-revealed", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Larry King's secret lung cancer battle revealed", "description": "The legendary TV host received the shocking news during a routine visit with his doctor.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2016/12/29/1024/512/694940094001_5265534441001_Larry-King-remembers-Debbie-Reynolds--Carrie-Fisher.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/larry-kings-secret-lung-cancer-battle-revealed"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Illness,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "illness,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
