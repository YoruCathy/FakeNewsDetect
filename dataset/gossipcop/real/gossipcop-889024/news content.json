However, not buying into the conspiracy theory, he confidently declared, \"It's pretty clear to me that this is the real Melania.\"\n\nWhat does \"the real Melania\" mean to The Late Late Show host? Well, it's actually Corden clad in a wig, oversized glasses and khaki trench coat. While his \"Melania\" didn't speak, she did appear gripped by Hillary Clinton's book What Happened.\n\nThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\n\nFallon had his own version of \"the real Melania\" on his program Monday.\n\nAfter discussing other \"theories\" Fallon said were plaguing the White House \u2014 including that Trump's tie is actually just Fruit By The Foot and Attorney General Jeff Sessions is actually gnome from the White House Rose Garden \u2014 The Tonight Show host spoke to \"Melania\" from Washington.\n\nSee The Tonight Show \"Melania\" struggle to get through a Q&A in the hilarious clip above.\n\nMore:Melania Trump's inaugural gown enters Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aeefd06079b7d1340cbfa2ace5ea821df05a926/c=0-204-6711-3996/local/-/media/2017/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636444268869261413-EPA-USA-TRUMP-IRAN-HEALTH-CARE-94550523.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aeefd06079b7d1340cbfa2ace5ea821df05a926/c=0-204-6711-3996/local/-/media/2017/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636444268869261413-EPA-USA-TRUMP-IRAN-HEALTH-CARE-94550523.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aeefd06079b7d1340cbfa2ace5ea821df05a926/c=0-204-6711-3996/local/-/media/2017/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636444268869261413-EPA-USA-TRUMP-IRAN-HEALTH-CARE-94550523.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/10/24/james-corden-jimmy-fallon-debunk-melania-trump-body-double-theory-late-late-show-tonight-show/793492001/", "title": "James Corden, Jimmy Fallon debunk first lady body-double theory with 'the real Melania'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "James Corden, Jimmy Fallon debunk first lady body-double theory with 'the real Melania'", "description": "'Late Late Show' host James Corden and 'The Tonight Show's' Jimmy Fallon gave their audiences 'real Melania (Trumps)' Monday.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/10/24/james-corden-jimmy-fallon-debunk-melania-trump-body-double-theory-late-late-show-tonight-show/793492001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aeefd06079b7d1340cbfa2ace5ea821df05a926/c=0-204-6711-3996/local/-/media/2017/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636444268869261413-EPA-USA-TRUMP-IRAN-HEALTH-CARE-94550523.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Erin Jensen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "'Late Late Show' host James Corden and 'The Tonight Show's' Jimmy Fallon gave their audiences 'real Melania (Trumps)' Monday.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aeefd06079b7d1340cbfa2ace5ea821df05a926/c=0-204-6711-3996/local/-/media/2017/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/636444268869261413-EPA-USA-TRUMP-IRAN-HEALTH-CARE-94550523.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "James Corden, Jimmy Fallon debunk first lady body-double theory with 'the real Melania'", "description": "'Late Late Show' host James Corden and 'The Tonight Show's' Jimmy Fallon gave their audiences 'real Melania (Trumps)' Monday."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508774400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
