The awards, voted for by members of Film Independent, often help to indicate which films will go on to win key Oscars; Moonlight in 2017, Spotlight in 2016, Birdman in 2015 and 12 Years A Slave in 2014 all won best feature at the Spirit Awards and went on to pick up the Best Picture Oscar.\n\nBo Burnham\u2019s Eighth Grade, Paul Schrader\u2019s First Reformed, and Lynne Ramsey\u2019s You Were Never Really Here all earned four nominations, including best feature. Barry Jenkins\u2019 If Beale Street Could Talk and Debra Granik\u2019s Leave No Trace rounded out the Best Feature category (and scored three nominations apiece).\n\nJeremiah Zagar\u2019s We the Animals scored the most nominations with five, including best first feature, best supporting actor for Ra\u00fal Castillo, and the Someone to Watch Award.\n\nThe Indie Spirits aren\u2019t a perfect predictor for what will eventually triumph at the Oscars, but they are a decent indicator of what will be in the conversation. (Alfonso Cuaron\u2019s Roma, for example, has been hailed as an early Oscars frontrunner, and it was only eligible at the Spirit Awards in the international film category.)\n\nThe winners will be announced Feb. 23 in an awards ceremony broadcast live on IFC.
