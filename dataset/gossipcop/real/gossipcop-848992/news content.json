The Women's Tennis Association has ranked her World No. 1 in singles on six separate occasions. She became the World No. 1 for the first time on July 8, 2002, and regained this ranking for the sixth time on February 18, 2013, becoming the oldest world no. 1 player in WTA's history. Williams is also widely regarded to be one of the greatest female tennis players in history. She is the only female player to have won over $50 million in prize money Williams is the reigning French Open, US Open, WTA Tour Championships and Olympic ladies singles champion.\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\nSerena Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price and is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea and Isha Price, and full sister Venus. When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California, where Serena started playing tennis at the age of four. Her father home-schooled Serena and her sister Venus and to this day, Serena Williams was and remains coached by both her parents. Williams's family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach when she was nine so that she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who would provide additional coaching. Macci spotted the exceptional talents of the sisters. He did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Another factor was racial, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.\n\n\n\nPlaying style\n\n\n\nWilliams is primarily a baseline player and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve, return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a \"high risk\" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which combines great power and placement with very high consistency. Her serve is considered to be the greatest in women's tennis history. In the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of 128.6 mph (207.0 km/h) which is the third-fastest all-time among female players (only Venus's 129 mph and Sabine Lisicki's 131 mph recorded speeds are faster). At the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Serena hit a women's tournament record of 102 aces which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks. Serena also possesses a very solid volley and powerful overhead which is very useful for her net game. Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also plays a strong defensive game.\n\n\n\nProfessional career\n\n\n\nWilliams's first professional event was in September 1995, at the age of 14 to counteract the forthcoming changes to age-eligibility rules, at the Bell Challenge. She lost in the first round of qualifying to Anne Miller, winning just two games.\n\n\n\nOff-court activities\n\nFashion\n\n\n\nWilliams was once known for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when she wore a Lane Bryant black lycra catsuit at the US Open. At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots\u2014tournament officials, however, did not allow her to wear the boots during matches.At Wimbledon in 2008, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match was the subject of much discussion since it was worn despite the sunny weather. Off-court, Williams has also presented new designs. In November 2004, at the London premiere of After the Sunset she wore a red gown that had a near-topless effect.\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nWilliams has appeared on television and also provided voice work on animated shows: in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons Serena joined the animation along with sister Venus, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. She has also provided guest voice work in a 2005 episode of Playhouse Disney's animated kids show Higglytown Heroes and a 2007 episode of the Nickelodeon cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender, which she has described as her \"favorite show\"\n\n\n\nCharity work\n\n\n\nIn 2008 Williams helped to fund the construction of the Serena Williams Secondary School in Matooni, Kenya. She received a Celebrity Role Model Award from Avon Foundation in 2003 for work in breast cancer. Williams has also been involved in a number of clinics at schools and community centers, particularly those which have programs focusing on at-risk youth. She has also won the \"Young Heroes Award\" from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater L.A. and Inland (2003) and the \"Family Circle and Prudential Financial Player Who Makes a Difference Award\" (2004). In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Williams, along with other ATP and WTA stars decided to forgo their final day of preparation for the 2010 Australian Open to form a charity event in which all proceeds will go to the Haiti earthquake victims.\n\n\n\nWriting\n\n\n\nThe Williams sisters, with author Hilary Beard, wrote a book titled Venus & Serena: Serving From The Hip: 10 Rules For Living, Loving and Winning, which was published in 2005. During the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, Williams said that she is in the process of writing a TV show storyline, which will be converted into script form by her agency. She stated that the show will represent subject matter from a mix of popular American television shows such as Desperate Housewives, and Family Guy. Serena released her first solo autobiography entitled On the Line, following the 2009 US Open.\n\n\n\nPersonal life\n\n\n\nWilliams and sister Venus are both Jehovah's Witnesses, who have a practice of not voting. However, the Williams sisters expressed support for President Barack Obam.", "images": ["https://www.biphoo.com/images/bipamerica-feedback-button.png",
