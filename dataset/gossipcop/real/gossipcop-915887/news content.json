His prostate as well as 11 lymph nodes were taken out in the first week of January.\n\nOn the grading system used to determine the aggressiveness of prostate cancer known as the Gleason Score, doctors labeled him a 9 out of 10.\n\n\u201cThis was quite an aggressive little bugger,\u201d Fry said in his video. \u201cAs far as we know, it\u2019s all been got. \u2026 I won\u2019t know for sure until my PSA levels are checked. They should be 0 now because I have no prostate. But if there is anything left on the bed of the prostate, then I\u2019ll need radiotherapy and the whole damn process will start again.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Stephen Fry Isabel Infantes/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nWhile he\u2019s \u201cfeeling well and happy,\u201d Fry says \u201cthe rather unwelcome and unexpected adventure\u201d has been hard on him.\n\n\u201cCancer, in the end, that\u2019s a word that just rings in your head,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to get cancer. I know it\u2019s an old clich\u00e9, but you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen to you. Cancer is something that happens to other people!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also been handling the physical side effects that come with recovery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a business having an operation like that,\u201d Fry said. \u201cThere\u2019s 5 holes punctured in me. It\u2019s like being stabbed 5 times when you\u2019re asleep. .. It\u2019s the same kind of traumatic effect. You think, \u2018I\u2019m going to recover really well.\u2019 But it takes longer than it might and it\u2019s all pretty undignified and unfortunate.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Prostate Cancer Symptoms Every Man Should Know\n\nAll in all, Fry says he fells \u201cbloody lucky\u201d to have found this cancer early. \u201cI generally felt my life was saved by this early intervention. I would urge any of you men of a certain age to think about getting your PSA levels checked,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy family and my divine, darling husband were just marvelous. And those friends who have known have been very kind about it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to be surrounded by such wonderful people. Lucky to have such an incredibly team working for me. And lucky to have an immune system working for me.\u201d\n\nHe ended his video with an emotional message.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s hoping I get another few years left on this planet,\u201d Fry said. \u201c\u2018Cause I enjoy life. That\u2019s a marvelous thing to be able to say. And I really hope it doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1549&h=811&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fstephen-fry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fstephen-fry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1549&h=811&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fstephen-fry-2-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/stephen-fry-reveals-2-month-battle-with-prostate-cancer/", "title": "Stephen Fry Reveals He Has 'Aggressive' Prostate Cancer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Cancer,News,Stephen Fry", "news_keywords": "Cancer,News,Stephen Fry", "description": "Stephen Fry\u00a0has had his prostate removed after being diagnosed with prostate cancer", "og": {"title": "Stephen Fry Reveals He Has 'Aggressive' Prostate Cancer", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/health/stephen-fry-reveals-2-month-battle-with-prostate-cancer/", "description": "Stephen Fry&nbsp;has had his prostate removed after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
