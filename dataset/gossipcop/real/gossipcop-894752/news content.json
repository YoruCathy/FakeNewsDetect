Teen Mom OG\u2018s Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18.\n\nE! News reports that the pair, who secretly tied the knot in May, a day before Edwards headed to rehab, wed in a church ceremony that Standifer told E! was their \u201coriginal, intended\u201d celebration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in the works since the day we got engaged,\u201d she told E! \u201cIt was never just decided upon \u2014 we knew from day one this was going to be it.\u201d\n\nStandifer said that Edwards\u2019 ex-fiance, Maci Bookout, had been invited to the wedding and the pair\u2019s son, Bentley, 9, didn\u2019t know that she and his dad were already married.\n\nEdwards proposed to Standifer over a romantic meal in December 2016, which was shown in an episode of Teen Mom OG that aired earlier this year.\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Edwards checked into rehab earlier this year to address substance abuse issues.\n\nHis decision to seek treatment came after Bookout, with whom he shares son Bentley, 8, tearfully spoke about her ex\u2019s problems on the MTV hit and accused him of driving while under the influence of Xanax.\n\nShe told her husband, Taylor McKinney, that she planned to stage her own intervention with Edwards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna be like, \u2018You have to go to rehab.\u2019 It\u2019s about saving his life,\u201d she told her husband.\n\nIn June, Edwards addressed his recovery in a statement to Us, saying, \u201cA little over 30 days ago, I made the decision to check myself into a rehabilitation facility. I am back home now doing well, and life could not be better. Without the support of my wife and parents I would not have been able to do this.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mackenzie-standifer-ryan-edwards-teen-mom-og-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C969px%2C509px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mackenzie-standifer-ryan-edwards-teen-mom-og-married.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mackenzie-standifer-ryan-edwards-teen-mom-og-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C969px%2C509px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-mom-ogs-ryan-edwards-mackenzie-standifer-get-married-again/", "title": "Teen Mom OG\u2019s Ryan Edwards, Mackenzie Standifer Get Married \u2014 Again", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Teen Mom OG's Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18 \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Teen Mom OG's Ryan Edwards, Mackenzie Standifer Get Married \u2014 Again", "description": "Teen Mom OG's Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-mom-ogs-ryan-edwards-mackenzie-standifer-get-married-again/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:16:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mackenzie-standifer-ryan-edwards-teen-mom-og-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C969px%2C509px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mackenzie-standifer-ryan-edwards-teen-mom-og-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C969px%2C509px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-11-19T23:02:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:16:21+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Teen Mom OG's Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18 \u2014 read more", "title": "Teen Mom OG's Ryan Edwards, Mackenzie Standifer Get Married \u2014 Again", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mackenzie-standifer-ryan-edwards-teen-mom-og-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C969px%2C509px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511132573.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
