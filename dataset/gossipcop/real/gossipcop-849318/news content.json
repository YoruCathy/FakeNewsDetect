The Real Housewives of New Jersey star lost her mother, Antonia Gorga, suddenly in early March, and now, she might be at risk of going back to prison?!\n\nWell, not so fast. But there is cause for concern for fans of the Italian gal.\n\nCredit: Charles Sykes/Bravo\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by TMZ, Teresa failed to report two traffic tickets while under supervised release (aka probation) for her fraud conviction.\n\nThe first violation was for an illegal turn last year, and at the time, the 44-year-old was warned that if she had any other contact with police, she had to report it.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nUnfortunately, she didn\u2019t do that when, last month, she was cited for using her cell phone while driving.\n\nBecause she didn\u2019t tell her parole officer, it says in the docs that she will go to court should she violate the terms of her probation again.\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on May 3, 2017 at 5:00am PDT\n\nOn the other hand, the mother of four\u2019s attorney, James Leonard, Jr., is telling a different story.\n\nIn a statement to the press, the lawyer claims both tickets were reported \u2014 just not within the \u201crequired time frame.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on Mar 24, 2017 at 3:39pm PDT\n\n\u201cTeresa's been fully compliant other than these incidents,\u201d he starts.\n\nJames continues, \u201cBoth she and I have spoken to her officer and understand exactly what is required should she have any future contact with law enforcement, which we do not anticipate will happen.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on May 9, 2017 at 12:14pm PDT\n\nIn other words, he doesn\u2019t \u201canticipate\u201d that she\u2019ll be violating traffic laws anytime soon, but if she is, she knows to report it to her P.O. ASAP.\n\nFor now, it seems she\u2019s just on a warning status, and hopefully she keeps it that way.\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on Apr 14, 2017 at 5:02am PDT", "images": ["http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nick-carter-sexual-assault-320x223-1509372738.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/26152787_1896505867329996_8668809372878503936_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/loading.gif", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kylie-jenner-plastic-surgery-pregnant-320x223-1511803275.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21149338_757212517791923_6938295666963644416_n-320x223.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/teresa-giudice-probation.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-519451536-320x223-1495779173.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/wetpaint.svg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/teresa-giudice-vacation-750x522-1492198572.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dwts-season-24-cast-celebrity-wishlist.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/teresa-giudice-probation-750x522-1494360948.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/teresa-giudice-probation-640x480-1494360942.jpg", "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/21041889_254812198371809_8175695720834138112_n-320x223.jpg"], "top_img": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/teresa-giudice-probation.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "http://wetpaint.com/teresa-giudice-parole-violation-probation-1589537/", "title": "Teresa Giudice Accused of Violating Her Probation \u2014 Will She Go Back to Prison?", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/screenshot.png", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "According to court documents, Teresa Giudice has been accused of violating her parole.
