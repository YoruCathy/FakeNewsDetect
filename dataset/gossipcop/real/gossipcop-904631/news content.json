The Lady Gaga/Bradley Cooper romance \u2014 the fourth retelling of the classic Hollywood tale about a budding ingenue who falls for a tragic, fading entertainer \u2014 is currently the only film to score a nomination from all 11 significant industry guilds. Most importantly, it has notched nods from the Producers Guild of America, the Directors Guild of America, and the Screen Actors Guild. Not to mention the film has also landed significant attention from non-industry precursors like the Golden Globes and multiple critics groups around the country. A Star is Born\u2019s problem, however, is that \u2014 outside of Gaga\u2019s surefire Best Original Song champion \u201cShallow\u201d \u2014 it hasn\u2019t won much of anything just yet. Given the Academy\u2019s preferential ballot system, A Star is Born could pick up significant steam in the wide-open Best Picture race, as Oscar\u2019s ranking system tips in the favor of passion votes. A Star is Born captures the heart as easily as its breathtaking aesthetics capture the eye, so expect it to snatch a wealth of nominations across the board on Tuesday morning. \u2014Joey Nolfi\n\nEW
