From her must-have nighttime skincare picks to her go-to healthy dinner to her ultimate self-care essentials\u2014bathing rituals included\u2014she shared it all. (And we've already made it a personal mission to adopt each and every one of her recommendations.)\n\nSo just in case you did miss the takeover, we're recapping every minute so you can glean all of the game-changing products, tips, and rituals that keep Michele glowing from head to toe all year round. Keep reading for the breakdown.\n\nLike so many of us who count down the minutes until we can wipe our faces clean every day, Michele shared that washing her face and prepping her skin with all of her favorite nighttime essentials is probably the best part of her day. And considering her enviable stash of products (we spotted celeb and beauty editor cult favorites like Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Alpha Beta Daily Peel Packets, $88, iS Clinical Active Serum, $135, Control Corrective Oil-Free Healing Lotion, $38, and Honest Beauty Organic Facial Oil, $28), we now completely understand her perpetual glow.\n\nThe actress and singer also gave her go-to esthetician, Shani Darden, a shout-out and told viewers she always finishes off her nighttime skincare routine with a quick once-over using Nurse Jamie's Instant UpLift Face Roller ($69), which increases blood flow and lymphatic drainage while simultaneously lifting and sculpting the face for an increase in contour over time and a touch of radiance.\n\nNext up: a luxurious bath, which Michele told us is one her favorite ways to decompress after a long day at work. She's currently loving Goop's The Martini Emotional Detox Bath Soak ($35) (aka a martini\u2014or glass of wine, whatever floats your boat\u2014sans the hangover). It's also handily infused with skin-improving ingredients like chia seed and jojoba oils and detoxing, muscle-relaxing components like Himalayan pink salt, rosemary, the list goes on.\n\nFollowing her bath, Michele explains she loves to treat herself to a light yet satisfying and healthy dinner. And luckily for us, she shared the recipe she falls back on again and again. (Plus, it only requires five ingredients and less than 10 minutes to prepare!) Here's what you'll need: soba noodles, fresh lemon, carrot-ginger dressing, fresh cucumbers, and an optional dash of hot sauce. So easy.\n\nLast but not least, the actress and singer's healthier, wellness-minded version of a nightcap: a steaming cup of soothing tea, Traditional Medicinal's popular nighttime elixir Cup of Calm ($6), which has relaxing, sleep-inducing ingredients like chamomile, lavender, peppermint, and licorice root. Add a book, (and perhaps Slip's coveted Silk Sleepmask, $50, that we slyly spotted atop Michele's forehead), and you have the ultimate, ultra-restorative night of self-care. Sleep tight!", "images": ["https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/GQkVtCH10ttryP9B-FtKZhT6J2Y=/700x700/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__253704__lea-michele-nighttime-beauty-routine-253704-1522855948936-main.700x0c-445e1ce87fe04a24b95f28ffd208ee1c.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/Z3Hj5OsB7TKV1v_8FjcwSj41qKc=/700x366/filters:fill(auto,1)/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__253704__lea-michele-nighttime-beauty-routine-253704-1522855930829-fb.700x0c-a3b03621745f47c2b187dc00c4c4728d.jpg", "https://:0"], "top_img": "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/Z3Hj5OsB7TKV1v_8FjcwSj41qKc=/700x366/filters:fill(auto,1)/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__253704__lea-michele-nighttime-beauty-routine-253704-1522855930829-fb.700x0c-a3b03621745f47c2b187dc00c4c4728d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Jahns", "Written By"], "canonical_link": "https://www.byrdie.com/lea-michele-nighttime-beauty-routine", "title": "Exclusive: Lea Michele Shows Us Her Nighttime Beauty Routine", "meta_data": {"robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "For her weekly Wellness Wednesday series, Lea Michele took over our Instagram to share her nighttime routine with us.
