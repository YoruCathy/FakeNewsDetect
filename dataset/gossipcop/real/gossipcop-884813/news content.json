After trying for years to get pregnant and undergoing in vitro fertilization, Teigen and husband John Legend welcomed little Luna Simone into their family last year. And soon the Legend-Teigen clan might be getting slightly bigger, with Teigen revealing on Wednesday that the couple will be trying for another baby with her last remaining embyro.\n\nIn InStyle's November cover story, Teigen gets candid about the challenging journey she took to conceive Luna, who turned 1 in April, and, hopefully, baby No. 2. The model and Twitter laureate told the magazine that she wishes she had extracted more eggs during her fertility treatments from a few years ago, because the resulting 20 embryos were narrowed to just three healthy and usable ones.\n\n\"The first little girl didn't work, and then the second is Luna,\u201d she said.\n\nTeigen also elaborated on her experiences with postpartum depression and the decision to speak openly about her diagnosis. At first, InStyle reports, she didn't want to speak up because she didn't understand what she was going through and didn't think she had the right.\n\n\u201cI thought I was just being a selfish a-hole,\u201d she told the publication. Things got better, Teigen says, after she was diagnosed and began taking the right medications. But the supermodel still has to battle through some days and said she's steeled herself for her condition getting more serious if she is going to have another baby.\n\n\u201cI have really good days and really bad days, and I don't tend to talk about the really bad days,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I would hate for people to think those days didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nPreviously, Teigen penned a moving open letter for us about her experiences with PPD, sharing details of her treatment as well as addressing other women who have faced the condition and the stigma surrounding it.\n\n\u201cI know I might sound like a whiny, entitled girl,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPlenty of people around the world in my situation have no help, no family, no access to medical care. I can't imagine not being able to go to the doctors that I need. It's hurtful to me to know that we have a president who wants to rip health care away from women. I look around every day, and I don\u2019t know how people do it. I've never had more respect for mothers, especially mothers with postpartum depression.\"", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1489791396/glamour_chrissy-teigen-takes-us-behind-the-scenes-of-her-favorite-instagram-shots.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evelyn Wang", "Evelyn Wan"], "canonical_link": "http://www.brides.com/story/chrissy-teigen-announces-try-second-child-last-embryo", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Reveals She's Trying for a Second Child With Her Last Frozen Embryo", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Evelyn Wang", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Chrissy Teigen revealed that she and husband John Legend will try for another child with her last remaining frozen embryo.", "id": "59d505697090e14a97592efa", "keywords": "snd,chrissy teigen,pregnancy,ivf,in vitro fertilization,john legend", "news_keywords": "snd,chrissy teigen,pregnancy,ivf,in vitro fertilization,john legend", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59d505697090e14a97592efa", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Chrissy Teigen revealed that she and husband John Legend will try for another child with her last remaining frozen embryo.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Chrissy Teigen revealed that she and husband John Legend will try for another child with her last remaining frozen embryo.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Is Going to Try for a Second Baby With Her Last Frozen Embryo", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.brides.com/story/chrissy-teigen-announces-try-second-child-last-embryo"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Chrissy Teigen revealed that she and husband John Legend will try for another child with her last remaining frozen embryo.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d50569240b1e16740eaf7b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-857279254.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Is Going to Try for a Second Baby With Her Last Frozen Embryo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
