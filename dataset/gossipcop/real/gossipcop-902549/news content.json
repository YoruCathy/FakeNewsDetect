So It\u2019s not enough to be a mom, you have to be the best mom.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Mayim Bialik on How She Tackles Talking Puberty with Her Sons: \u2018We Don\u2019t Want Them to Have Shame About Their Bodies\u2019\n\nBialik then urged mothers to join her in trying to \u201cfind more meaningful things to connect about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you ask someone, did you breastfeed, it shouldn\u2019t be assumed that you\u2019re asking because you want to pass judgement on them, it should be because you sincerely want to know, how did you choose to feed your baby and what was that like?\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cWe can only do this together \u2014 moms, are you with me?\u201d she asked.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMissMayim%2Fvideos%2F10159856780200008%2F&show_text=0&width=560", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fmayim-bialik.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fmayim-bialik-b-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F10%2Fmayim-bialik.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/mayim-bialik-competitive-moms-tears/", "title": "Mayim Bialik Reveals She \u2018Left in Tears\u2019 After First Group Meeting with \u2018Competitive Moms\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Babies,Mayim Bialik,News,Parenting,TV", "news_keywords": "Babies,Mayim Bialik,News,Parenting,TV", "description": "On Thursday, Mayim Bialik\u00a0spoke out about her experiences with \"competitive\" mothers", "og": {"title": "Mayim Bialik Reveals She \u2018Left in Tears\u2019 After First Group Meeting with \u2018Competitive Moms\u2019", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/mayim-bialik-competitive-moms-tears/", "description": "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMissMayim%2Fvideos%2F10159856780200008%2F&#038;show_text=0&#038;width=560 Mayim Bialik&nbsp;doesn\u2019t have fond memories of her past experiences with \u201ccompetitive\u201d moms.
