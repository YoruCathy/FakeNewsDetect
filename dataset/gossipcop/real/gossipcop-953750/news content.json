I couldn\u2019t be happier turning 30 and feeling so much more of what life truly is about. #unfiltered and totally #unknown \u2014 Life is absolutely remarkable!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you Brooks for completely blowing my mind with your thoughtful and adventurous spirit!\u201d she continued. \u201cI love you so much I can\u2019t even handle myself! #machupicchu #pachamamma #fathersun #bestbirthdayever #dressedtoimpress \ud83d\ude1c #divinefeminine #spire #energyrich.\u201d\n\nLaich was just as sentimental about his wife.\n\n\u201cWords cannot express how much love I have for you babe!\u201d he wrote in a birthday tribute to her. \u201cI love your spirit and your soul, and you bring more joy into my life than I could have ever imagined.

And I\u2019m just happy that I\u2019m able to bring [you] here \u2014 that you love this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an amazing adventure here in Machu Picchu. Take a look, this is beautiful. Happy birthday, babe.\u201d\n\nHough was so excited she said she couldn\u2019t \u201ceven move right now.\u201d\n\nWhen she did move, Hough made sure to film a video to her followers, asking them to participate in a breathing exercise with her \u201cto send and receive love and gratitude to the world, to humanity and all that keeps us alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I really want for my birthday is to spread more love for the world,\u201d she said in the clip. \u201cThat\u2019s what the world needs, is some giving and some receiving of love. \u2026 I want that to be my birthday present.

This girl is filled with more joy, compassion, love, and energy than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. I often say that I don\u2019t feel like I have a job, and that\u2019s because my job is simply supporting this girl in her mission to impact the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor me personally, Jules you have believed in me when I didn\u2019t believe in myself and have (patiently) helped me build a foundation of support in myself that I never thought was possible,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make me laugh harder, love deeper, and express myself more freely. Our memories range from hiking Machu Picchu (2 hours ago), watching too many hours of SVU in the back of the tour bus, getting me a puppy, walking on fire, driving each other crazy, endless closet clean outs, 5,000 breakthroughs, obsessing over our dogs, and more. I am so grateful to be your right hand chick, and wouldn\u2019t rather be anywhere else.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Maude Hirst/Instagram\n\nImage zoom Maude Hirst/Instagram\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Go Inside the World\u2019s Best Hotel\n\nHirst called Hough an \u201cincredible woman\u201d in a photo of the two doing yoga moves together.\n\n\u201cI love you more and more everyday, and what a way to celebrate you today,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cMachu Picchu, you have our hearts,\u201d she added, calling Hough\u2019s big day the \u201cbest birthday ever.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fscreen-shot-2018-07-21-at-2-15-52-pm-1.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fscreen-shot-2018-07-21-at-2-16-10-pm-1.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fscreen-shot-2018-07-21-at-2-13-18-pm-1.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F07%2Fscreen-shot-2018-07-21-at-2-13-05-pm-1.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F09%2Fjulianne.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F09%2Fjulianne.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/home/julianne-hough-30th-birthday-machu-picchu/", "title": "Julianne Hough's Husband Makes Her 'Dream' Come True on Surprise Birthday Trip to Machu Picchu", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Julianne Hough,News,Travel,TV", "news_keywords": "Julianne Hough,News,Travel,TV", "description": "Julianne Hough\u00a0celebrated her 30th birthday in Machu Picchu, thanks to her husband Brooks Laich", "og": {"title": "Julianne Hough's Husband Makes Her 'Dream' Come True on Surprise Birthday Trip to Machu Picchu", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/home/julianne-hough-30th-birthday-machu-picchu/", "description": "Julianne Hough&nbsp;celebrated her 30th birthday in Machu Picchu, thanks to her husband Brooks Laich.
