For me,\u201d he said in GQ\u2019s new cover story. In 2016, Fisher dropped a bombshell on fans of the franchise when she revealed in her memoir, The Princess Diarist, that she and Ford had an affair while on the set of the film that started the franchise,1977\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope.\n\nAt the time, Fisher was 19 and Ford was 33 \u2013 and married to his first wife, Mary Marquardt, with whom he had two children.\n\nThe steadfastly private actor admitted that he was given advance warning that Fisher planned to write about their affair (\u201cto a degree\u201d), but declined to go into detail about his reaction.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, with Carrie\u2019s untimely passing, I don\u2019t really feel that it\u2019s a subject that I want to discuss.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he\u2019s read Fisher\u2019s nearly 300-page memoir, Ford responded shortly, \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFord remained silent throughout Fisher\u2019s promotional tours and interviews for the book, though he was often asked for comment. In a chat with NPR\u2019s Fresh Air host Terry Gross in late November of that year, Fisher expressed surprise that readers made such a big deal out of the three-month affair.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I found the journals that I kept during the first movie, and I\u2019m probably going to publish them,'\u201d she said of the conversation she had with Harrison prior to moving forward with that chapter of the memoir. \u201cAnd he just sort of raised his finger and said, \u2018Lawyer!\u2019 Then I said, \u2018No, I won\u2019t write anything that you don\u2019t want. I mean, I\u2019ll show it to you before and you can take anything out that you want taken out. I don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable\u2019 \u2013 which I, of course, have. Unduly comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have ambushed him like that, but it\u2019s still \u2013 no matter if I told him or not, it probably feels like an ambush,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt feels like an ambush to me, and I\u2019m the one who wrote it.\u201d\n\nFisher and Ford reunited on the big screen for 2015\u2019s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and following Fisher\u2019s death in December 2016, he issued a statement remembering her \u201cfearless\u201d spirit, though he made no mention of their romance.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ford-fisher-02-e46cf142-d93a-4bf6-b821-512b6d2b0264.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=www.rollingstone.com&path=%2Fculture%2Fculture-news%2Fharrison-ford-breaks-silence-over-carrie-fishers-memoir-star-wars-affair-200810%2F&ct=article&lob=rollingstone&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=200810", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/RS-Get-The-Magazine-Free-Tote.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ford-fisher-02-e46cf142-d93a-4bf6-b821-512b6d2b0264.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", "Joyce Chen'S Most Recent Stories", "Soundgarden", "Family Honor Chris Cornell At Seattle Statue Unveiling", "Bill Coswill Face Five More Accusers In Sexual Assault Retrial", "Natalee Holloway", "Man Linked To Disappearance Fatally Stabbed", "View All"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/harrison-ford-breaks-silence-over-carrie-fishers-memoir-star-wars-affair-200810/", "title": "Harrison Ford Finally Addresses Carrie Fisher Memoir, Affair", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#df3535", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Rolling Stone", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2018/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cropped-rs-favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "application-name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "Harrison Ford says it was \"strange\" for him when Carrie Fisher revealed decades-old fling in memoir.", "news_keywords": "Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Star Wars", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harrison Ford Finally Addresses Carrie Fisher Memoir, Affair", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/harrison-ford-breaks-silence-over-carrie-fishers-memoir-star-wars-affair-200810/", "description": "Veteran actor says it was \u201cstrange\u201d for him when Fisher revealed decades-old fling", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ford-fisher-02-e46cf142-d93a-4bf6-b821-512b6d2b0264.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "American actors Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford on the set of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back directed by Irvin Kershner.
