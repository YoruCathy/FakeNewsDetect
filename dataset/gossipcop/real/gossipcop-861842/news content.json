Now, the Moonlight star is opening up about the challenges he faced as a black man in America.\n\nIn a recent interview, Ali revealed that his recent celebrity is an interesting contrast to the experience he\u2019s had as a black man in America \u2014 an experience that he told GQ includes being racially profiled and being placed on the terror watch list for having a Muslim name.\n\n\u201cWhen suddenly you go from being followed in Barneys to being fawned over, it will mess with your head,\u201d he said. \u201cThose experiences that you have from age 10, when you start getting these little messages that you are something to be feared\u2026walking down the street in Berkeley and some cops roll up on you and say straight up, \u2018Give me your ID,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018What the f\u2014k?\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite these interactions, Ali maintains a decidedly hopeful attitude about being an American, noting that he wants the country to live up to its claim of being \u201cgreat\u201d especially when it comes to racial politics.\n\n\u201cI think African-Americans have a very convoluted relationship with patriotism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, we essentially were the abused child. We still love the parent, but you can\u2019t overlook the fact that we have a very convoluted relationship with the parent. I absolutely love this country, but like so many people have some real questions and concerns about how things have gone down over the years and where we\u2019re at. And that\u2019s from a place of love, because I want the country to be what it says it is on paper.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.
