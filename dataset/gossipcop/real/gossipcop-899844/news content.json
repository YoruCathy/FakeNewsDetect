Jimmy Fallon played a great modern take on Charlie Brown, although he didn't get insulted nearly as much as the Charlie Brown we all know from back in the day. This take on Charlie Brown was a lot closer to KJ Apa's brooding portrayal as Archie Andrews, and yes, that does include writing songs and showing them to friends. For those that don't watch Riverdale, Archie also had a romantic affair with his teacher, although the Riverdale adults are a lot more intelligible than the Peanuts elders. Considering how often the RHS teens listen, though, the adults might as well be speaking gibberish!", "images": ["https://sp.analytics.yahoo.com/spp.pl?a=1000772689113&.yp=431002", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR4nGNaOxMAAfwBSW8IE8UAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21229662&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=YourTagID&noscript=1", "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/8/c/5/3/9/5/8c53958681a53dafe58a8eaa702ca0ff7c670b6c.jpg", "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/a/e/f/b/7/2/aefb72cd9fa85eb2ca53243acf56f5499b312fdf.gif"], "top_img": "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/8/c/5/3/9/5/8c53958681a53dafe58a8eaa702ca0ff7c670b6c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1740080/riverdale-stars-join-jimmy-fallon-for-hilarious-peanuts-spoof", "title": "Riverdale Stars Join Jimmy Fallon For A Hilarious Peanuts Spoof", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"tag": "riverdale", "publisher": "https://www.cinemablend.com/", "published_time": "2017-12-13T19:39:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-08T21:17:50+00:00", "section": "television"}, "CinemaBlend": 15010, "page": "story", "description": "Riverdale and Peanuts collide for a moody parody anyone can enjoy.", "robots": "all", "msvalidate.01": "9AA1A3C35B6D716AE80C1B615C6E8FE8", "fb": {"pages": 90893081682, "app_id": 956050344476201, "admins": 585420252}, "og": {"title": "Riverdale Stars Join Jimmy Fallon For A Hilarious Peanuts Spoof", "url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1740080/riverdale-stars-join-jimmy-fallon-for-hilarious-peanuts-spoof", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/8/c/5/3/9/5/8c53958681a53dafe58a8eaa702ca0ff7c670b6c.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 350}, "description": "Riverdale and Peanuts collide for a moody parody anyone can enjoy.", "type": "article", "site_name": "CINEMABLEND"}, "twitter": {"title": "Riverdale Stars Join Jimmy Fallon For A Hilarious Peanuts Spoof - CINEMABLEND", "description": "Riverdale and Peanuts collide for a moody parody anyone can enjoy.", "image": "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/8/c/5/3/9/5/8c53958681a53dafe58a8eaa702ca0ff7c670b6c.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cinemablend", "url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1740080/riverdale-stars-join-jimmy-fallon-for-hilarious-peanuts-spoof"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513193971.0, "source": "https://www.cinemablend.com", "summary": ""}
