They took that literally: The cover features the lifestyle site\u2019s founder and CEO, Gwyneth Paltrow, topless and slathered in mud from head to toe.\n\nThe 96-page magazine debut, which retails for a hefty price (like all things Goop) of $15, is the first iteration of a new quarterly publication. Just like the online brand, the book will feature wellness advice, clean beauty secrets, healthy recipes and more.\n\nThe Fall 2017 issue, specifically, covers a makeup-bag detox, deep-dives into crystals and mud masks, a do-anywhere workout from fitness guru Tracy Anderson, fall fashion, tips for a better orgasm and a candid conversation with Paltrow, 44, herself.\n\nIn one standout story, the actress talks about having bee venom injected into her C-section scar. \u201cThe doctor stings you [with a live bee] like it\u2019s an acupuncture needle,\u201d shared the mother of Apple, 13, and Moses, 11 (with ex Chris Martin). \u201cI had it done on my cesarean scar\u2026 I had some buckling in the scar, and it really evened it out.\u201d\n\nIn the issue\u2019s editor letter, Paltrow also recalls her first-ever cleanse: \u201cI remember standing in a hippie health-food store in Greenwich Village and I saw a little paperback book describing a \u2018master cleanse,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 I remember the next day [after I finished the cleanse] I was like, \u2018Oh, wow, I just did this cleanse, and I feel so much better. I can have a beer and a cigarette now, right?'\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-1c773925-8cb4-4d20-a42c-8559e676c490.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/goop_cover_noupc_hires-fa50ebf2-0a95-429d-ba8a-e9b9c7fac6cd.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Talia Ergas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/gwyneth-paltrow-poses-topless-in-mud-for-goops-first-issue-w501980/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Poses Topless in Mud for Goop's First Issue", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow posed topless while covered in mud for Goop's first ever print issue \u2014 see the stunning photo", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "See Gwyneth Paltrow Pose Topless While Covered in Mud", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow posed topless while covered in mud for Goop's first ever print issue \u2014 see the stunning photo", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/gwyneth-paltrow-poses-topless-in-mud-for-goops-first-issue-w501980/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:34:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Celebrity Style", "section": "Stylish", "published_time": "2017-09-08T19:21:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:34:03+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow posed topless while covered in mud for Goop's first ever print issue \u2014 see the stunning photo", "title": "See Gwyneth Paltrow Pose Topless While Covered in Mud", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504898478.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
