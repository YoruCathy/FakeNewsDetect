She\u2019s been the dominant force of her sport for two decades, and it seems no one will be able to stand the way of her quest in overtaking Margaret Court\u2019s 24 grand slams.\n\nExcept maybe for a second baby.\n\nIn an interview with In Style magazine, the 36-year-old new mom says a second child would possibly send her into retirement. But she\u2019ll have to discuss it with husband Alexis Ohanian first.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I want to play if I have another baby, but you\u2019re right. I need to talk to Alexis. We need a plan,\u201d Williams said.\n\nShe also said, \u201cIf I weren\u2019t working, I\u2019d already be pregnant.\u201d\n\nWilliams appears as the cover story for the magazine\u2019s first-ever \u201cBadass Women\u201d issue. She talks about her first year of motherhood, how she and Reddit co-founder Ohanian hooked up, attending the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and, of course, all things badass.\n\nWhich women does Williams place in the badass category? They would be Beyonce, Rihanna and Kate Middleton.\n\nAnd her own No. 1 badass moment involves her 10-month-old daughter, Olympia. Williams was nine weeks pregnant with Olympia in January 2017 when she won the Australian Open by ousting older sister Venus Williams in straight sets. It was Serena\u2019s 23rd singles grand slam title.\n\n\u201cI had a really tough first round and an even tougher second round. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to lose early. That\u2019s OK. I have a good excuse for the first time.'\u201d\n\nShe consulted with a doctor about withdrawing from the tournament, but she was cleared to play with a warning to be careful on hot days.\n\n\u201cI was literally nine weeks by the end of the tournament. I was almost done with my first trimester,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day that passed I thought, \u2018This is a dream.\u2019 It was like an animated Disney movie. And by the time the quarterfinals came, I was like, \u2018I know I can beat this girl,\u2019 and at the semifinals I thought, \u2018I know I can win this match.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think I would win the final, so when I won, it was like, \u2018OK, this is crazy.'\u201d Get more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.

So we started talking, just as friends. Just casually chatting. I was getting hot when he was talking about it all. So after that we just continued talking, and then, I don\u2019t know \u2014 I love his world.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/serena.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/020bf2b94c0fb6ac1f396598e197cf31?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/serena.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cicero Estrella", "Online Producer", "Cicero Estrella Is The Bay Area News Group'S Entertainment", "Lifestyles Producer.
