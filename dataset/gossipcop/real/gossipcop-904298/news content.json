The Disney alum revealed on Sunday, January 7, that she was sexually abused as a child.\n\n\u201cI was sexually abused and physically growing up from the day I can remember till I was 14..when I finally had the courage to lock my door at night and sit by it. All damn night. Waiting for someone to take advantage of my life again. Over and over I waited for it to stop and finally it did. But some of us aren\u2019t as lucky to get out alive. Please today stand up for every soul Mistreated. #timesup,\u201d Thorne wrote on Sunday via Instagram, referencing to the Time\u2019s Up movement, which was created by women in Hollywood to fund legal aid for victims of sexual harassment.\n\nThorne rose to fame on Disney\u2019s Shake It Up with Zendaya from 2010 to 2013. She made the transition from Disney to more adult roles as Paige on Freeform\u2019s Famous in Love and the 2015 teen movie The Duff. The 20-year-old actress shared the same photo of herself on Twitter with a different caption about her childhood abuse.\n\n\u201cI never knew what was right or wrong growing up..I didn\u2019t know the person sneaking into my bed room at night was a bad person. #timesup,\u201d Thorne tweeted on Sunday.\n\nAs previously reported, the Babysitter star briefly addressed her childhood abuse in December via Twitter.\n\nIn response to a photo of Thorne dressed in a purple suit with no top, a Twitter user wrote at the time, \u201cWhat did Disney do to this girl?! I think she was molested?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah I was. So it wasn\u2019t Disney,\u201d Thorne fired back, adding in another tweet, \u201cThe world can be a sick place sometimes :/.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/845598708_bella-thorne-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/845598708_bella-thorne-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1130px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/845598708_bella-thorne-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bella-thorne-reveals-she-was-sexually-abused-until-age-14/", "title": "Bella Thorne Reveals She Was Sexually Abused Until Age 14", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bella Thorne revealed via Instagram on Sunday, January 7, that she was sexually abused as a child until she was 14 years old \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bella Thorne Reveals She Was Sexually Abused Until Age 14", "description": "Bella Thorne revealed via Instagram on Sunday, January 7, that she was sexually abused as a child until she was 14 years old \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bella-thorne-reveals-she-was-sexually-abused-until-age-14/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:04:39+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/845598708_bella-thorne-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/845598708_bella-thorne-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-01-08T21:38:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:04:39+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bella Thorne revealed via Instagram on Sunday, January 7, that she was sexually abused as a child until she was 14 years old \u2014 details", "title": "Bella Thorne Reveals She Was Sexually Abused Until Age 14", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/845598708_bella-thorne-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515447486.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
