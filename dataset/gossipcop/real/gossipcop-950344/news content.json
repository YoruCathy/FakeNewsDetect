Louis\u2019s christening. pic.twitter.com/5rYUVvYttX \u2014 Richard Palmer (@RoyalReporter) July 9, 2018\n\nThe choice of designer behind her christening attire isn't quite a surprise given the Duchess' previous looks for the royal occasion.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, Kate wore an ivory Alexander McQueen coat dress, designed by creative director Sarah Burton, to Princess Charlotte\u2019s christening in 2015 which was widely believed to have been recycled for the recent royal nuptials.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFor Prince George\u2019s christening, the 36-year-old opted for a long-sleeved ruffled cream colour dress by the same designer.\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nEarlier this morning, Kensington Palace announced the names of the godparents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had chosen for Prince Louis.\n\n\n\nHowever, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were noticeably absent from their great-grandson\u2019s christening today.\n\nGet Kate Middleton's christening look below:\n\nBUY
