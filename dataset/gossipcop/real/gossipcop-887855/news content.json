On the HGTV show, the couple would renovate homes in Waco, Texas, where they\u2019re from.\n\n\u201cWhile we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with. Our family has grown up alongside yours, and we have felt you rooting us on from the other side of the screen. How bittersweet to say goodbye to the very thing that introduced us all in the first place,\u201d the blog post read.\n\nThe couple added their marriage and family are doing well and the decision to end the show \u201chas nothing to do with a fraudulent skincare line or anything else you\u2019ll inevitably read.\u201d Joanna Gaines previously shot down rumors that she would be leaving the show to launch a skincare line.\n\nHowever, if you were hoping one day the Gaines family would come and fix up your home, there\u2019s still hope. The couple said they will continue to work in Waco, renovating homes and focusing on their businesses.\n\nCNN noted that Fixer Upper brought about a spinoff Fixer Upper: Behind the Design, a magazine and a home collection.\n\nGet The Brief.
