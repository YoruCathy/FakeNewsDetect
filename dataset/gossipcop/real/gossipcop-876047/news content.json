This was later dropped but he then filed a new suit in Louisiana as it\u2019s a pro-life state and recognises embryos as humans or \u2018juridical persons\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s reported that Nick has named the two female embryos \u201cIsabella\u201d and \u201cEmma\u201d.\n\nThe businessman reportedly claims that if the embryos aren\u2019t brought to life, they are being denied the right to an inheritance fund set up in their name.\n\nSofia has successfully blocked Nick from using the embryos and creating life twice but he filed a third lawsuit in April 2018.\n\nAlthough it was reported that Sofia had lost her rights to the eggs in June, the legal battle is still ongoing with no resolve as yet.\n\nSo what have Nick and Sofia said about the embryos?\n\nSofia wants to keep the embryos frozen but Nick says life has already been created (Picture: WireImage)\n\nIn 2015, a rep for Sofia was clear to state that the actress does not want the embryos destroyed but rather, have them remain frozen.\n\nThe rep said: \u2018Vergara has never suggested that she wished to have the embryos destroyed \u2026 She has always maintained that they be kept frozen, a fact of which Loeb and his counsel have always been aware, despite Loeb\u2019s statements to the contrary.\u2019\n\nThat same year, Sofia herself gave a rare interview about the complex dispute and told Good Morning America: \u2018I\u2019ve been working very hard for 20 years to get to this point where I am, enjoying my movie.\n\n\u2018I promote all my movies, all my work, but I don\u2019t like promoting my private life and I don\u2019t understand why this person\u2026 I don\u2019t want to allow this person to take more advantage of my career and try to promote himself and get press for this.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018This shouldn\u2019t be out there for people to give their opinion. There\u2019s nothing to talk about, there\u2019s papers signed.\u2019\n\nCoincidentally, the same week of Sofia\u2019s GMA interview, Nick told Howard Stern that he didn\u2019t \u2018hate\u2019 the actress and actually had \u2018tremendous respect\u2019 for her.\n\nSofia married Joe in 2015 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe situation took an even more bizarre twist in April 2018 when Nick reportedly compared their legal case to slavery.\n\nAccording to The Blast, the lawsuit reportedly says that this type of legal argument has happened \u2018only one other time in United States history from which any legal precedent may be reviewed \u2013 the pre-Civil War era\u2019.\n\nIt continues: \u2018Under these simple definitions, a human embryo, if believed to be a human being and alive, (which is our contention) would be considered a slave and the parents would be the owners of the slave, particularly in states where they are considered property.\n\n\u2018There was a question at the time as to whether New York had the jurisdiction to reach into Louisiana and retrieve Northup. But the New York governor discussed it with Louisiana officials and they were allowed to retrieve him.\n\n\u2018There are also dozens of cases (called the Freedom Suits), where slaves themselves or their family members applied for freedom in slave states and won.\n\n\u2018The reference to slave cases is to demonstrate the jurisdictional and legal issues arising from this stark difference in how human beings are categorised. In modern day, frozen human embryo disputes and the question of how they are categorised (human being or property) has become more frequent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Since there is little or no legislation in most states on this issue, state courts are left to decide if embryos are human beings or property or something in between and what to do in cases of dispute.\u2019\n\nMost recently in October 2018, a source told TMZ that Sofia feels Nick is using the embryo lawsuit to come between her marriage with Joe Manganiello whom she tied the knot with in 2015.\n\nSofia\u2019s embryos are currently said to be frozen in a Beverly Hills clinic.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
