It\u2019s happening this summer so it\u2019s very soon,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI\u2019m super busy so I have amazing people taking care of a lot of stuff.\u201d\n\nRather than focusing on the little details, Copeland said she just wanted to have fun.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m a pretty simple girl, so I like for there to be no drama. I just want to enjoy the day, and not have it be about the preparation,\u201d she said.\n\nThe dancer told PEOPLE in November she was thrilled to be engaged to Evans, but finds the excitement over engagements a little silly.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Most Painful Ballet Boot Camp You\u2019ve Ever Seen!\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible for my relationship to be engaged. [But] it\u2019s such a strange feeling when people, like, applaud it like it\u2019s this accomplishment. I guess it\u2019s an American cultural thing, but personally, it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nE! News reports that the pair wed in front of 100 guests at the Montage Hotel in Laguna Beach, California, and that Copeland wore an Inbal Dror gown with Christian Louboutin shoes.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fmisty-copeland-a-435-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=435&h=228&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fmisty-copeland-a-435-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=435&h=228&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F08%2Fmisty-copeland-a-435-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/bodies/misty-copeland-marries-longtime-boyfriend-olu-evans/", "title": "Misty Copeland Marries Longtime Boyfriend Olu Evans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Wedding", "news_keywords": "Wedding", "description": "Ballet dancer Misty Copeland married her longtime boyfriend, attorney Olu Evans, on Sunday, July 31", "og": {"title": "Misty Copeland Marries Longtime Boyfriend Olu Evans", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/bodies/misty-copeland-marries-longtime-boyfriend-olu-evans/", "description": "[tempo-video id=\"5067230498001\" account=\"416418724\"] Their first dance must have been epic.
