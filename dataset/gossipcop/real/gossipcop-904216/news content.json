Many people on the show felt it might have been a meeting to discuss a possible 13th season, as CBS had started talks with producer Warner Bros TV about anther two-season pickup, though the actors had not yet been approached by the studio for new deals.\n\nInstead, I hear Lorre gave the floor to star Jim Parsons, who made a tearful announcement that he would not be continuing on the series beyond the upcoming 12th season. With the entire room still reeling from the shock, I hear Lorre revealed that the series too would end with Season 12.\n\nYesterday was a very emotional day in the offices of The Big Bang Theory, with cast and crew hanging out and hugging each other. \u201cIt\u2019s family over there,\u201d one insider said about the team that had been together for many, many years.\n\nThat\u2019s why Lorre made the decision not to continue with the show unless all key auspices were coming back. Parsons is one of the series\u2019 \u201cbig three,\u201d along with Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco. Lorre had publicly said he would not do the series without any of the original three leads. Additionally, Parsons\u2019 character on Big Bang, Sheldon Cooper, is at the center of the Big Bang prequel series Young Sheldon, which the actor executive produces and does voice over for.\n\nI hear Parsons informed Lorre about his decision to leave after the end of the season on Friday, when I hear renewal talks with CBS were still ongoing. I hear there were efforts over the weekend to persuade him to change his mind, which were unsuccessful.\n\nParsons has been actively doing theater and movies while on Big Bang over the past few years, with the production accommodating him. Because the series had been going for so long \u2014 according to Warner Bros TV, Big Bang will become the longest-running multi-camera series in television history with 279 episodes \u2014 it is a well-oiled machine, with the cast working 3.5 days a week during production. Still, I hear Parsons was ready to move on.\n\nThis morning, Parsons, a four-time Emmy winner for his role on Big Bang, posted a lengthy and emotional message on Instagram.\n\n\u201cIt is hard (really impossible, actually) to really accept that this is a picture of the first of the final 24 episodes we will shoot for The Big Bang Theory,\u201d he wrote before expressing \u201cintense gratitude\u201d toward the crew, the writers and his castmates. \u201cI will miss all of you and all of this more than I can say and more than I can know at this time.\u201d (Read his full note under the post.)\n\nThe entire cast\u2019s current contracts \u2014 paying the five original cast member around $1 million an episode \u2014 are up after the current Season 12, so all had to sign new ones in order to return.\n\nThat is how, in the span of two weeks, we went from CBS executives being confident that \u201cwe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the final season,\u201d having already started renewal discussions with WBTV, to yesterday\u2019s surprise announcement that Big Bang, the most watched series on television, is coming to an end.\n\n\u201cWe are forever grateful to our fans for their support of The Big Bang Theory during the past twelve seasons. We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show\u2019s success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring The Big Bang Theory to an epic creative close,\u201d WBTV, CBS and Chuck Lorre Productions said in the joint statement.", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2018%2F08%2Fbig-bang-theory-decision-jim-parsons-chuck-lorre-12-seasons-cbs-1202451333%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202451333&comment_count=34", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-big-bang-theory.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-big-bang-theory.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/08/big-bang-theory-decision-jim-parsons-chuck-lorre-12-seasons-cbs-1202451333/", "title": "\u2018The Big Bang Theory\u2019: Behind The Sudden Decision To End Series After 12 Seasons", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jim Parsons told the cast he would not continue on the series past the upcoming 12th season.
