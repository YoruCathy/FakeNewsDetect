Of course, that doesn't mean that the King and Queen of country music don't have their hangups with each other. Recently, McGraw and Hill dished their marriage secrets... and their pet peeves about their partner.\n\nWhen asked what bothers him about Faith Hill, McGraw was quick to crack a joke before 'ragging' on his wife. \"I don't think we have time for that,\" he said playfully, according to GAC. Instead, his wife took a stab at what habits she has that might bother her husband.\n\n\"If he answers this question truthfully, he'd probably say he wished I was less Type A,\" Hill admitted. \"He\u2019s gotten better about the clothes on the floor.\"\n\nIn October, the pair will celebrate their 16th wedding anniversary. Shortly after that milestone, they will head to Las Vegas to perform together at the Venetian for 10 weekends in a row as part of their Soul2Soul residency. They must have a lot of 'faith' (pun intended) in their relationship to commit to working together onstage!\n\nLuckily, McGraw says he knows the secret to a happy marriage, so the two won't have any trouble getting along during their stay in Sin City.\n\n\"Well I live in a house full of women so [the secret is] just to be as quiet as possible,\" he quipped.\n\n\"He has to be quiet,\" Hill joked, before giving a more serious answer. \"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a secret,\" she added. \"You just have to love the skin you\u2019re in, basically. You have to walk this life together. There will be times, ups and downs, but you have to essentially like the person that you love. I think it\u2019s important to laugh a lot and have a good time. Life is so short. It sounds contrived but it\u2019s the truth.\"\n\nTo us, that doesn't sound contrived at all -- just really sweet. Now that we have their tips for a happy marriage, maybe we can get them to spill their anti-aging secrets...", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2012/03/McGraw-Hill.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2012/03/McGraw-Hill.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Pacella"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-marriage-secrets/", "title": "Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Share Their Secrets to a Happy Marriage", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "After 15 years of wedded bliss -- and two mega-sized country music careers between them -- Tim McGraw and Faith Hill know a thing or two about maintaining a", "fb": {"app_id": 193351250697247, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 173910492638623}, "og": {"title": "Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Share Their Secrets to a Happy Marriage", "description": "After 15 years of wedded bliss -- and two mega-sized country music careers between them -- Tim McGraw and Faith Hill know a thing or two about maintaining a", "url": "https://tasteofcountry.com/tim-mcgraw-faith-hill-marriage-secrets/", "site_name": "Taste of Country", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2012/03/McGraw-Hill.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tasteofcountry"}, "sailthru.description": "After 15 years of wedded bliss -- and two mega-sized country music careers between them -- Tim McGraw and Faith Hill know a thing or two about maintaining a", "sailthru.date": "2012-08-10 17:00:08", "sailthru.title": "Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Share Their Secrets to a Happy Marriage", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, faith-hill, tim-mcgraw, country-music-news", "sailthru.author": "meganpacella", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2012/03/McGraw-Hill.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2012/03/McGraw-Hill.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "e19BTQtucrkVk-O5axdlPIIJWMrqGU-QRWcldJZvxnA", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1344589208.0, "source": "http://tasteofcountry.com", "summary": ""}
