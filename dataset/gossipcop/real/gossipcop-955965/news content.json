Born to a German mother and American father in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, he moved to the United States with his family in 1957. His career began on the Off-Broadway stage in the 1970s.[1] He later achieved fame with his leading role on the hit television series Moonlighting (1985\u20131989). He has since appeared in over 70 films and is widely regarded as an \"action hero\",[2][3][4] due to his portrayal of John McClane in the Die Hard franchise (1988\u20132013), and other such roles.\n\nHis credits also include Death Becomes Her (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), The Fifth Element and The Jackal (both 1997), Armageddon and Mercury Rising (both 1998), The Sixth Sense (1999), Sin City (2005), Red (2010), Moonrise Kingdom (2012), The Expendables 2 (2012), Looper (2012), and as David Dunn in the Unbreakable film series: Unbreakable (2000), Split (2016) and Glass (2019). He made his Broadway debut in the stage adaptation of Misery in 2015. As a musician, Willis released his debut album, The Return of Bruno, in 1987. He has released two more solo albums since then, in 1989 and 2001.\n\nWillis is the recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People's Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWalter Bruce Willis[5] was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany.[6][7] His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene,[8] was German, born in Kassel.[6] Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (deceased) and David.[9]\n\nAfter being discharged from the military in 1957, Willis's father took his family back to Carneys Point Township, New Jersey.[10] Willis has described himself as having come from a \"long line of blue collar people\".[10] His mother worked in a bank and his father was a welder, master mechanic, and factory worker.[5] Willis attended Penns Grove High School in his hometown, where he encountered issues with a stutter.[10] He was nicknamed \"Buck-Buck\" by his schoolmates.[5][11][12] Willis joined the drama club in high school, and acting on stage reduced his stutter. He was eventually appointed student council president.[5] He attended college at Montclair State University.[13]\n\nAfter he graduated from high school in 1973, Willis took a job as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant[14][15] and transported work crews at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater, New Jersey.[15] After working as a private investigator (a role he would play in the television series Moonlighting and the 1991 film The Last Boy Scout), Willis turned to acting. He enrolled in the Drama Program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in the class production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Willis left school in his junior year in 1977 and moved to New York City, where in the early 1980s he supported himself as a bartender at the West 19th Street art bar Kamikaze.[16] At the time, he lived in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan.[17] He performed as an extra in Paul Newman's closing summation scene in The Verdict in 1982.\n\nCareer\n\n1980s\n\nWillis upon receiving an Emmy Award in 1987 for Best Actor in Moonlighting\n\nWillis left New York City and headed to California. In 1984, he appeared in an episode of the TV series Miami Vice, titled \"No Exit\".\n\nIn 1985, he was the guest actor in the first episode of the 1980s revival of The Twilight Zone, \"Shatterday\".[18] He successfully auditioned for the role of David Addison Jr. of the television series Moonlighting (1985\u20131989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position.[19]\n\nThe starring role, opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor, with the show lasting five seasons winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy.[10] During the height of the show's success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products.[20] The advertising campaign paid the rising star between $5\u20137 million over two years. In spite of that, Willis chose not to renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.[21]\n\nWillis had his first lead role in a feature film in the 1987 Blake Edwards film Blind Date, with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette.[10] Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in Sunset (1988). However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film Die Hard (1988) as John McClane that catapulted him to movie star and action hero status.[10] He performed most of his own stunts in the film,[22] and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide.[23]\n\nFollowing his success with Die Hard, he had a leading role in the drama In Country as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in Look Who's Talking, as well as its sequel, Look Who's Talking Too.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues titled The Return of Bruno, which included the hit single \"Respect Yourself\" featuring The Pointer Sisters.[24] The LP was promoted by a Spinal Tap\u2013like rockumentary parody featuring scenes of Willis performing at famous events including Woodstock. He released a version of the Drifters song \"Under the Boardwalk\" as a second single; it got to No. 2 in the UK Top 40 but was less successful in the U.S. Willis returned to the recording studio several times afterward.[25]\n\n1990s\n\nHaving acquired major personal success and pop culture influence playing John McClane in Die Hard, Willis reprised his role in the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).[10] These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Willis's career suffered a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). He gained more success with Striking Distance (1993) but flopped again with Color of Night (1994): another box office failure, it was savaged by critics but did well in the home video market and became one of the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995,[26] Maxim magazine also ranked his sex scene in the film as \"the Best Sex Scene in film history\".[27]\n\nIn 1994, he also had a leading role in one part of Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed Pulp Fiction[10] (the film has three-parts story); the film's huge success gave a new boost to his career. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself.[28] That same year, he starred in Mike Judge's animated film Beavis and Butt-head Do America with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named \"Muddy Grimes\", who mistakenly sends Judge's titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He then played the lead roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Fifth Element (1997). However, by the end of the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal, Mercury Rising, and Breakfast of Champions, saved only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon which was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide.[29] The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse.[30] In 1999, Willis then played the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Sixth Sense, which was both a commercial and critical success.[10]\n\n2000s\n\nWillis after a ceremony where he was named Hasty Pudding Theatrical's Man of the Year in 2002\n\nIn 2000, Willis won an Emmy[31] for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on Friends (in which he played the father of Ross Geller's much-younger girlfriend).[32] He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on Friends. Also in 2000, Willis played Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski in The Whole Nine Yards alongside Matthew Perry. Willis was originally cast as Terry Benedict in Ocean's Eleven (2001) but dropped out to work on recording an album.[33] In the sequel, Ocean's Twelve (2004), he makes a cameo appearance as himself. In 2005, he appeared in the film adaptation of Sin City. In 2007, he appeared in the Planet Terror half of the double feature Grindhouse as the villain, a mutant soldier. This marked Willis's second collaboration with director Robert Rodriguez, following Sin City.\n\nWillis has appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when he was supposed to be a guest.[34] On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, he appeared again, this time wearing a Sanjaya Malakar wig.[35] On his June 25, 2007, appearance, he wore a mini-turban on his head to accompany a joke about his own fictional documentary titled An Unappealing Hunch (a wordplay on An Inconvenient Truth).[36] Willis also appeared in Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials.[37] Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged \"Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce\", in honor of Willis.\n\nWillis has appeared in five films with Samuel L. Jackson (National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Unbreakable, and Glass) and both actors were slated to work together in Black Water Transit, before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film Hostage. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller Perfect Stranger, opposite Halle Berry, the crime/drama film Alpha Dog, opposite Sharon Stone, and reprised his role as John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. Subsequently, he appeared in the films What Just Happened and Surrogates, based on the comic book of the same name.[38]\n\nWillis was slated to play U.S. Army general William R. Peers in director Oliver Stone's Pinkville, a drama about the investigation of the 1968 My Lai massacre.[39] However, due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, the film was cancelled. Willis appeared on the 2008 Blues Traveler album North Hollywood Shootout, giving a spoken word performance over an instrumental blues rock jam on the track \"Free Willis (Ruminations from Behind Uncle Bob's Machine Shop)\". In early 2009, he appeared in an advertising campaign to publicize the insurance company Norwich Union's change of name to Aviva.[40]\n\n2010s\n\nWillis starred with Tracy Morgan in the comedy Cop Out, directed by Kevin Smith and about two police detectives investigating the theft of a baseball card.[41] The film was released in February 2010. Willis appeared in the music video for the song \"Stylo\" by Gorillaz.[42] Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with former Planet Hollywood co-owners and '80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film The Expendables. Willis played the role of generic bald man \"Mr. Church\". This was the first time these three notable action movie actors appeared on screen together. Although the scene featuring the three was short, it was one of the most highly anticipated scenes in the film. The trio filmed their scene in an empty church on October 24, 2009.[43] Willis next starred in RED, an adaptation of the comic book mini-series of the same name, in which he portrayed Frank Moses. The film was released on October 15, 2010.[44]\n\nWillis starred alongside Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Frances McDormand in Moonrise Kingdom (2012). Filming took place in Rhode Island under the direction of Wes Anderson, in 2011.[45] Willis returned, in an expanded role, in The Expendables 2 (2012).[46] He appeared alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the sci-fi action film, Looper (2012), as the older version of Gordon-Levitt's character, Joe.\n\nWillis teamed up with 50 Cent in a film directed by David Barrett called Fire with Fire, starring opposite Josh Duhamel and Rosario Dawson, about a fireman who must save the love of his life.[47] Willis also joined Vince Vaughn and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Lay the Favorite, directed by Stephen Frears, about a Las Vegas cocktail waitress who becomes an elite professional gambler.[48] The two films were distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment.\n\nWillis reprised his most famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, starring in A Good Day to Die Hard, which was released on February 14, 2013.[49] In an interview, Willis said, \"I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty of being able to play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in Die Hard. I try to improve my work every time.\"[50]\n\nOn October 12, 2013, Willis hosted Saturday Night Live with Katy Perry as a musical guest.[51]\n\nWillis will star in the movie adaptation of the video game Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, named Kane & Lynch.[52]\n\nIn 2015, Willis made his Broadway debut in William Goldman's adaptation of Stephen King's novel Misery opposite Laurie Metcalf at the Broadhurst Theatre.[53]\n\nIn 2018, it was announced that Willis would be the next to be roasted by Comedy Central.[54]\n\nFilms featuring Willis have grossed between US$2.64 billion and $3.05 billion at the North American box offices, making him in 2010 the eighth highest-grossing actor in a leading role and 12th-highest including supporting roles.[55][56] He is a two-time Emmy Award winner, two-time Golden Globe Award winner, and has been nominated for a Saturn Award four times.\n\nBusiness activities\n\nWillis owns houses in Los Angeles and Penns Grove, New Jersey. He also rents apartments at Trump Tower[57] and in Riverside South, Manhattan.[58]\n\nIn 2000, Willis and his business partner Arnold Rifkin started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after Live Free or Die Hard.[59] He also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and is a co-founder of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.[60]\n\nIn 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA's Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% ownership in the company.[61]\n\nPersonal life\n\nOver the Hedge on June 28, 2006 Willis at the German premiere ofon June 28, 2006\n\nWillis's acting role models are Gary Cooper, Robert De Niro, Steve McQueen and John Wayne.[62] Willis is left handed.[63]\n\nWillis resides in Brentwood, Los Angeles with his family.[64]\n\nRelationships and children\n\nAt the premiere for the film Stakeout, Willis met actress Demi Moore. They married on November 21, 1987 and had three daughters: Rumer (born August 16, 1988),[65] Scout (born July 20, 1991),[66] and Tallulah (born February 3, 1994).[67] Willis and Moore announced their separation on June 24, 1998.[68] They filed for divorce on October 18, 2000[69] and on that same day, the divorce was finalized.[70][71] Regarding the divorce, Willis stated, \"I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.\" He credited actor Will Smith for helping him cope with the situation.[20] Willis has maintained a close relationship with both Moore and her third husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and attended their wedding.[72]\n\nWillis was engaged to actress Brooke Burns until they broke up in 2004 after ten months together.[19] He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009;[73] guests included his three daughters, Demi Moore, and Ashton Kutcher. The ceremony was not legally binding, so the couple wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills, six days later. The couple has two daughters, born in April 2012[74] and May 2014.[75]\n\nReligious views\n\nWillis was a Lutheran at some point,[76] but no longer practices. In a July 1998 interview with George magazine, he stated:\n\nOrganized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?[77]\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore campaigned for Democratic Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease.[78] Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention,[79] and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.[20]\n\nIn 2006, he said that the United States should intervene more into Colombia, in order to end the drug trafficking.[80] In several interviews Willis has said that he supports large salaries for teachers and police officers, and said he is disappointed in the United States foster care system as well as treatment of Native Americans.[78][81] Willis also stated that he is a supporter of gun rights, stating, \"Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys.\"[82]\n\nIn February 2006, Willis was in Manhattan to promote his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence:\n\nI'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.[83]\n\nWillis's name was in an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times on August 17, 2006, that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.[84]\n\nMilitary interests\n\nThroughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis' then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.[85]\n\nIn 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators.[86] Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq War, but was deterred by his age.[87] It was believed he offered $1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:\n\nI went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers\u2014young kids for the most part\u2014helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country.[88]\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn 1996, Roger Director, a writer and producer from Moonlighting, wrote a roman \u00e0 clef on Willis titled A Place to Fall.[89] Cybill Shepherd wrote in her 2000 autobiography, Cybill Disobedience, that Willis became angry at Director when he read the book and discovered the character had been written as a \"neurotic, petulant actor.\"\n\nA Lego version of himself appeared in the 2019 film The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part, with Willis providing the voice.[90]\n\nFilmography\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo albums\n\nCompilations/guest appearances\n\nAwards and honors\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame star\n\nWillis's hands and footprints at Grauman's Chinese Theatre\n\nWillis has won a variety of awards and has received various honors throughout his career in television and film.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/Impronte_di_Bruce_Willis_al_TCL_Chinese_Theatre_-_Los_Angeles_-_USA_-_agosto_2011.jpg/220px-Impronte_di_Bruce_Willis_al_TCL_Chinese_Theatre_-_Los_Angeles_-_USA_-_agosto_2011.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg/220px-Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Bruce_Willis_Walk_of_Fame.jpg/220px-Bruce_Willis_Walk_of_Fame.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Blank_television_set.svg/24px-Blank_television_set.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Bruce_Willis_Cannes_2006.jpg/170px-Bruce_Willis_Cannes_2006.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/BruceWillisLFDHpremiere07.jpg/170px-BruceWillisLFDHpremiere07.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Video-x-generic.svg/21px-Video-x-generic.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/21px-P_vip.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg/1200px-Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/Bruce_Willis_-_1987.jpg/220px-Bruce_Willis_-_1987.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Bruce_willis_cinedom.jpg/170px-Bruce_willis_cinedom.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/BruceWillis2002.jpg/220px-BruceWillis2002.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/ActorBruceWillis_Iraq.jpg/220px-ActorBruceWillis_Iraq.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg/1200px-Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis", "title": "Bruce Willis", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg/1200px-Bruce_Willis_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
