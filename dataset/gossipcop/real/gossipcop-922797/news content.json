They\u2019re expected to look good and do as they\u2019re told on set. Unfortunately for magazine\u2019s such as Lui, Sampaio is no longer willing to obey traditional industry conventions.\n\nBack in 2017, Lui released their Fall issue which featured the 26-year-old model on the cover. The image revealed the topless Sampaio laying on her side, breasts showing, partially covered with a fur coat.\n\nThe central portraits of her in the magazine also expose her bare breasts as well as her nipples, something to which she didn\u2019t agree. The model told the magazine that she didn\u2019t want to pose nude but did so anyway, and they signed a contract stating they wouldn\u2019t publish the images.\n\nSara said the company told her the photographs would only show her \u201cwet-skin\u201d and not her nude body. She said, \u201cI felt violated.\u201d\n\nFor Sampaio, the issue isn\u2019t with nudity; it\u2019s the fact that she doesn\u2019t like exposing her body in men\u2019s magazines. The lesson she hopes to spread to other models in the industry is women have agency and control of their body, despite what the industry wants them to think.\n\nWomen can control how they are perceived, and it is up to them to decide which images are used. If a model says she doesn\u2019t want certain images published than organizations need to respect that.\n\nSampaio said when women complain of being treated unfairly they are labeled as \u201cdifficult\u201d and are subsequently blackballed from the scene. Sampaio said models are \u201cnot respected,\u201d despite the fact that the industry is female-dominated.\n\nSampaio admitted the challenging aspect of the industry is to know that other women out there are willing to pose in whatever position they\u2019re told for fame. Models feel they have to violate themselves to get ahead.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sara-Sampaio-MoveNoticias.com_-e1521845603553.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sara-Sampaio-Jameela-Jamil-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/amber-rose-blac-chyna-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BeyoncC3A9_16_9_1584091346-300x166.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sara-Sampaio-MoveNoticias.com_-e1521845603553.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/sara-sampaio-claims-she-felt-violated-following-topless-photo-shoot-128501/", "title": "Sara Sampaio Didn\u2019t Agree To Lui Cover Photo Shoot \u2013 \u201cI Felt Violated\u201d", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "sara sampaio,", "keywords": "celebrity news, sara sampaio,", "description": "Victoria's Secret model Sara Sampaio said to Net-A-Porter recently that models don't have a voice in the industry.
