I think eventually, people will start to see that whole title kind of switch over.\u201d\n\nThe Gen Zers reportedly met as pre-teens at a mutual friend\u2019s party where they exchanged numbers; they\u2019ve remained inseparable ever since. Their friendship led to Woods, a 20-year-old Los Angeles, Calif., native, appearing on \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d and its spinoff reality show \u201cLife of Kylie\u201d alongside her bestie Jenner. In recent years, Woods has gained her own stardom as a plus-size model signed with Wilhelmina International\u2019s Curve division, propelling her to influencer status with more than 5 million Instagram followers. It\u2019s all proof that she can hold her own as a household name -- but it\u2019s not fame that she\u2019s after.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care to be known,\u201d she said while promoting St. Ives beauty products at an event in New York City. \u201cI just want to be successful and happy.\u201d\n\nJordyn Woods at the St. Ives Mixing Bar in Flatiron creating custom scrubs and lotions in New York City.

She worked the runway at the Chromat show during New York Fashion Week last fall, and got her feet wet in the design world with a new Barney\u2019s New York shoe collection earlier this month. She\u2019s also collaborated on her own namesake clothing collection with plus-size Canadian clothing retailer Addition Elle, and was featured in Kanye West\u2019s Yeezy Season 6 fashion ads as one of the models posing as Kim Kardashian. Woods is also designing an activewear line of her own that is slated to drop later this year.\n\nWhen it comes to building a successful business, she\u2019s had plenty of seasoned pros to look up to, considering she\u2019s constantly surrounded by female entrepreneurs like the Kardashians and Jenner, who already has an estimated net worth of $50 million at age 20. Jenner used Woods\u2019 name for a lip kit she created for her booming beauty business, Kylie Cosmetics, which has made $420 million since its launch less than two years ago and is estimated to become a billion-dollar company by 2022, according to Women\u2019s Wear Daily. The Jordyn Woods lip kit comes in a cool red shade, and Woods says watching it come to life has been a thrill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely crazy,\u201d she said, adding that the best advice she\u2019s learned from the Kardashian-Jenner clan is to stay involved in the behind-the-scenes work from inception to production.\n\n\u201cBeing involved in your own company, and being involved in the decisions and the process, that\u2019s the best thing you can do, because if you have a vision or something you want to do, you have to be behind it to make sure that it happens,\u201d she said.\n\nWoods\u2019 commitment to being a role model for young girls influences the kind of work that she plans to take on, particularly when it comes to being a symbol for body positivity.\n\n\u201cI have a little sister, so automatically, I try to be a good role model in general -- and I do think of all the young people out there like my little sister who need guidance and direction, so I try to keep everything I do as positive as possible, and as honest as possible,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd while living in a filtered world can make anyone seem picture-perfect, Woods says successful brands are those that come across as authentic instead of trying too hard, like her partnership with St. Ives and its commitment to using natural ingredients and embracing real beauty.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started modeling, I didn\u2019t really think of it as a body-positivity movement,\u201d said Woods, who often posts unretouched photos of herself on Instagram. \u201cI wasn\u2019t even too sure what that whole movement was at the time. But as I got more into it, I realized that we really can be leaders of the movement. It was natural to me. It was solely based off of me being myself, and people started gravitating towards it.\u201d\n\nAnd her growing brand has been successful because it happened so naturally, she says. \u201cI don\u2019t really have to try to stay on top of it. As long as I\u2019m being myself, and staying genuine to myself and my work and everything I\u2019m doing, I feel like it shows, and that\u2019s how I keep it going,\u201d she added.\n\nWoods also surrounds herself with inspiring women, like her mom and manager Elizabeth Woods. And she dreams of meeting more successful female mentors \u2014 such as two of the women she admires most.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Oprah, but I would love for her to be my mentor,\u201d she said. \u201cOr Michelle Obama -- those two would be awesome.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW803_cb1653_ZG_20181030180625.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/google-play.png", "https://moneyish.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/ZH/MW-GW803_cb1653_20181030180625_ZH.jpg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-IE698_stimul_ZU_20200417141427.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/app-store.svg", "https://moneyish.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/NS/MW-GW804_32055c_20181030180627_NS.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW803_cb1653_ZG_20181030180625.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "canonical_link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/kylie-jenners-best-friend-jordyn-woods-is-building-her-own-brand-2018-06-20-12882851", "title": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s best friend Jordyn Woods is building her own brand", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s best friend Jordyn Woods is building her own brand", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kylie-jenners-best-friend-jordyn-woods-is-building-her-own-brand-2018-06-20-12882851", "description": "The reality star\u2019s longtime friend is launching an activewear line and promoting body positivity campaigns", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW803_cb1653_ZG_20181030180625.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "page.site": "marketwatch", "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@marketwatch", "id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "The reality star\u2019s longtime friend is launching an activewear line and promoting body positivity campaigns", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW803_cb1653_ZG_20181030180625.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "theme-color": "#2e2e2f", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "googlebot-news": "index", "article.doctype": 88, "cXenseParse": {"wsj-doctype": 88, "wsj-product": "Moneyish Blogs", "wsj-column": "Moneyish"}, "article.id": "72e10c10-ad03-47cd-8a0f-be178277b612", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422,app-argument=mwatch://article?id=72e10c10-ad03-47cd-8a0f-be178277b612", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article.column": "Moneyish", "author": "Jeanette Settembre", "description": "The reality star\u2019s longtime friend is launching an activewear line and promoting body positivity campaigns", "article.template": "full", "keywords": "article_normal", "news_keywords": "article_normal", "parsely-link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kylie-jenners-best-friend-jordyn-woods-is-building-her-own-brand-2018-06-20-12882851", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Kylie Jenner\u2019s best friend Jordyn Woods is building her own brand", "parsely-section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-post-id": "72e10c10-ad03-47cd-8a0f-be178277b612", "parsely-tags": "PageType: Article, Template: full, ArticleId: 72e10c10-ad03-47cd-8a0f-be178277b612, Column: Moneyish, DocType: 88, Subsection: Personal Finance", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-06-20T12:28:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Jeanette Settembre"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://moneyish.com", "summary": ""}
