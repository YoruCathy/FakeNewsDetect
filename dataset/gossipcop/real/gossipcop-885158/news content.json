And jolly glad I am that you did, too, because Kaia Gerber relates to quite a few things that I\u2019ve been wanting to talk about for a while, including and not limited to celebrities, parents, teenage girls, fashion, tabloids, exploitation and more. It may turn out to be that Kaia Gerber is now the centre of the universe, which would explain quite a lot about this universe. Because Kaia Gerber is a 16-year-old girl.\n\nIn fact, she has just turned 16 and pretty much as soon as Kaia blew out the candles on her cake she was shoved on to every other catwalk at New York fashion week. An exciting start to the autumn for a fresh-faced teenager you may, or may not, be thinking. But this was not young Kaia\u2019s first encounter with fashion. She has already appeared in several fashion magazines and campaigns, starting with a Versace campaign when she was 10, a French Vogue cover with her mother a few years later and her first solo magazine cover when she was 14. Tabloids have been running pap photos of her for years, doing everything from going shopping with her mother when she was 14 (\u201cwith long limbs to rival her mother\u2019s\u201d) to putting petrol in a car when she was 15 (\u201cHer slender model figure was covered in a mini white bandeau top and high-waisted jeans\u201d).\n\nThe media coverage of her 16th was, shall we say somewhat thigh-rubbing, with the British tabloids in particular barely able to control their excitement that young Kaia is now legally of age \u2013 in the UK anyway, if not in her home state of California.\n\nPerhaps you are thinking that this seems a little OTT for your run-of-the-mill pretty teenage girl, which it is. But \u2013 and you might have seen this coming \u2013 the key detail here is that Kaia is a celebrity offspring. She is the daughter of Cindy Crawford and the rather amusingly named Rande Gerber, who is also, it turns out, George Clooney\u2019s best friend, neatly proving this column\u2019s theory that all famous and vaguely famous people know each other.\n\nThere is a sharp divide among celebrities between those who put their kids in the limelight, and those who very much don\u2019t, and I\u2019m always intrigued as to which celebrity chooses which path. Because, contrary to what you might think, celebrity children don\u2019t have to be famous: the parents just have to choose to keep them away from red-carpet events, to get their lawyers to threaten tabloids that publish unobscured photos of them and not to pose with them on the cover of French Vogue. And if you don\u2019t believe me, think of Matt Damon: Damon has four kids and I have not a clue even what their names are and it is kind of my job to know stuff like that. Or Christy Turlington, for that matter. Does Christy have kids? Probably, but I wouldn\u2019t recognise them if they sat next to me on the bus. By contrast, the Crawford-Gerber children, rather like the Beckham children, are by now almost as familiar to me as my own offspring, such is the amount of time they\u2019ve spent in the spotlight. Kaia and her 18-year-old brother, Presley, have been in front of the cameras since they were little and, between the two of them, have 2.2 million followers on Instagram.\n\nCindy Crawford didn\u2019t become a model until she was 19 so it\u2019s striking that she decided to let her daughter model from the age of 10. It\u2019s not like history is littered with successful tales of high-profile celebrity children, and the few who do end up happy and well and accomplished \u2013 Michael Douglas, Stella McCartney \u2013 were kept out of the limelight by their parents and then encouraged to make their own way, not just use their family connections. I get that all parents want to give their kids the best childhood, and a lot of people do equate \u201cfame\u201d with \u201cthe best\u201d. It\u2019s just weird when famous people do it because they, of all people, should know that being a celebrity ain\u2019t, actually, all that great. So maybe Cindy and Rande have had nothing but positive experiences of fame. If so, they are next to unique.\n\nAs it happens, new father George Clooney has been talking about this quite a lot recently in regards to his twins, Ella and Alexander. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to give them one of those ridiculous Hollywood names that don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said recently, perhaps unaware that his best friend\u2019s kids are called Kaia and Presley. Clooney added that his own children \u201care going to be born into a place of privilege and so they\u2019re going to have to learn that it\u2019s just by accident.\u201d I\u2019m guessing this probably means Clooney\u2019s not going to put his kids in movies when they\u2019re 10.\n\nSo is Clooney making a dig at his friends here? Isn\u2019t 16 still a little young to be the star of New York fashion week, given Kaia is still in high school? These are questions we may never be able to answer in full. But good luck, Kaia. You are (nearly) an adult now, and not just your mother\u2019s daughter, so don\u2019t let other adults tell you what to do, OK?\n\nPost your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
