I got my spot, yo.\"\n\nThree years later, Perry has proved herself right: She's the highest-paid woman in music, pulling in $83 million pretax during our scoring period. One of the hardest-working names on the list, Perry played 80 dates of her Witness: The Tour in Forbes' June-to-June timeframe, grossing over $1 million per night. She also managed to find time to serve as a judge on ABC's American Idol reboot, reportedly earning north of $20 million for her troubles.\n\nTaylor Swift ranks second with $80 million. The superstar songstress briefly disappeared from social media last year before roaring back with the launch of new album Reputation, which sold two million copies worldwide in its opening week. The only reason she didn\u2019t claim the top spot on this list? Most of her Reputation Stadium Tour dates fell just outside this year\u2019s scoring period.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 rounds out the top three, pulling in $60 million. After she and husband Jay-Z welcomed twins Rumi and Sir to the family in June 2017, Queen Bey had a quiet year, by her standards, until delivering a groundbreaking performance at Coachella this spring and dropping a joint album with Jay-Z in June. Much of this summer\u2019s On The Run II, their second stadium tour together, will be reflected in our next scoring period\u2014boosted by an inevitable deluge of new moneymaking opportunities.\n\n\"I'm never satisfied,\" she once told Forbes. \"I\u2019ve never met anyone that works harder than me in my industry.\"\n\nOf course, making music isn't the only way these musicians are making bank. Lady Gaga (No. 5, $50 million) added \u201cmovie star\u201d to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 this year, thanks to a critically acclaimed turn in A Star Is Born alongside Bradley Cooper. Rihanna (No. 7, $37.5 million) is cashing in on Fenty Beauty and Savage Lingerie, and although she hasn't been on tour since 2016, Rihanna stays in the public eye with starring roles in films like Ocean's 8.\n\nThere were plenty of female musicians who had lucrative years but didn\u2019t quite make the list. Among them: Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey, Selena Gomez, Madonna, Halsey and Janet Jackson, all of whom tallied double-digit millions. They'll look to crack the top 10 next year.\n\n\"That's the best thing about being a musician,\" said Halsey. \"You get to constantly show the world how you've changed and how you've grown. And you get to say, 'Hey, look at me, look at how much better I am now than I used to be.'\"\n\nMethodology\n\nFigures are for pretax earnings from June 1, 2017, through June 1, 2018, before deducting fees for agents, managers, lawyers and estate executors.
