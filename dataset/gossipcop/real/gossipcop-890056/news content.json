Kim Kardashian kicked off Halloween by dressing up as Cher, alongside her best friend Jonathan Cheban as Sonny Bono. The social media mogul and her pal attended the Casamigo Annual Halloween Party on Friday, October 27, and their costumes were spot-on!\n\nThe duo arrived hand in hand at the star-studded 1970s bash held at the Gibson Showroom in West Hollywood. Although a source tells Us Weekly that they didn\u2019t stay long, they posed for photos wearing their costumes inspired by what the iconic singing duo wore to the Academy Awards in 1973.\n\nBefore heading to the event, Kardashian, 37, showed off her costume and toned abs in a video on Snapchat, wearing a long, black wig and two-piece yellow ensemble created by Brazilian couture designer Alexandrine, that was almost identical to Cher\u2019s original Bob Mackie outfit, while the Oscar winner\u2019s hit song \u201cBelieve\u201d played in the background. Cheban, 43, danced with her, wearing a burgundy suit by Stello with a wig and mustache similar to the late singer, who died in 1998.\n\nThe Keep Up With the Kardashians star began teasing her look early on Friday, tweeting to fans: \u201cGetting ready for tonight! My first look for the Halloween week! Can you guess what I\u2019m going to be??? #HallowKKWeen\u201d\n\nGetting ready for tonight! My first look for the Halloween week! Can you guess what I\u2019m going to be??? #HallowKKWeen \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) October 28, 2017\n\nThe Selfish author then gave a play by play as she got ready, and once she was finished, Cheban joined her for a duet of the singing duo\u2019s 1965 hit, \u201cI Got You Babe.\u201d\n\nCher gave a shout-out to the business mogul on Twitter on Saturday, October 28, for dressing up as her, writing: \u201c@KimKardashian Woke To See You Are Me 4 \ud83c\udf83 You Look BEAUTIFUL Little Armenian Sister\ud83d\udc8b\u201d\n\n@KimKardashian Woke To See You Are Me 4 \ud83c\udf83\n\nYou Look BEAUTIFUL Little Armenian Sister\ud83d\udc8b\n\nDream Of India\u201dIs Perfect 4U,&@BobMackie at his best \u2014 Cher (@cher) October 28, 2017\n\nThe singer previously gave Kardashian her seal of approval after the reality star emulated the pop icon on the September cover of Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia. \u201c\u2764\ufe0f This pic.
