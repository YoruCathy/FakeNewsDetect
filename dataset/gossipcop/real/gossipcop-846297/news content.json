It's a stress eating disorder, I'm sorry I didn't choose this.\"\n\nHe added that \"No I don't do drugs, yes I feel pain, I haven't stopped working since I was 7 years old 22 years later and I still won't give up. Any of my fans who I let down or made them embarrassed to be my fans anymore I'm so sorry. I will never stop trying to win your hearts back. All things done in the dark always come to light.\"\n\nCarter ended his tweets on a hopeful note, writing, \"I might not be exactly where I want to be but I'm doing much better than I was before ... Goodnight.\"\n\nThe singer has been back in the news in recent weeks after he released a five-song EP, L\u00d8V\u00cb, in February, his first release since his 2002 album Another Earthquake. In a recent interview with Us Weekly, he talked about how he's grown since his troubles in the spotlight when he was younger.\n\n\u201cWhen you start off so young, you lose sight of what\u2019s reality and it becomes your normality,\" he told the magazine. \"I lost everything and got it back. When that happened, it made me have much more appreciation for what I have now.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Carter's representatives for further comment on his tweets.\n\nSee all of Carter's tweets below.", "images": ["http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201704/173/29906170001_5412164051001_5412164391001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d456bab6e1ffb3a25768095e0166e93e189fe58b/c=0-47-1968-2671/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287924772870647-EPA-GERMANY-MUSIC.jpg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d34891ab7973492e1e511cad1d744121b1d74adf/c=0-0-1962-1109/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287924772870647-EPA-GERMANY-MUSIC.jpg?width=1962&height=1109&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d34891ab7973492e1e511cad1d744121b1d74adf/c=0-0-1962-1109/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287924772870647-EPA-GERMANY-MUSIC.jpg?width=1962&height=1109&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/04/26/aaron-carter-basically-have-eating-disorder/100922174/", "title": "Aaron Carter: 'Basically, I have an eating disorder'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Aaron Carter: 'Basically, I have an eating disorder'", "description": "The singer explained his struggle with a hiatal hernia in a series of tweets.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/04/26/aaron-carter-basically-have-eating-disorder/100922174/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d34891ab7973492e1e511cad1d744121b1d74adf/c=0-0-1962-1109/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287924772870647-EPA-GERMANY-MUSIC.jpg?width=1962&height=1109&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1962, "height": 1109}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Kelly Lawler", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The singer explained his struggle with a hiatal hernia in a series of tweets.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d34891ab7973492e1e511cad1d744121b1d74adf/c=0-0-1962-1109/local/-/media/2017/04/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636287924772870647-EPA-GERMANY-MUSIC.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Aaron Carter: 'Basically, I have an eating disorder'", "description": "The singer explained his struggle with a hiatal hernia in a series of tweets."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493136000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
