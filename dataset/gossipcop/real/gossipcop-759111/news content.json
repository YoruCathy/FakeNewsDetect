But they sketch a picture of how this musician, a strict proponent of clean living who suffered from chronic hip pain, concealed his opioid addiction using a variety of methods, including mixing various prescription pills in bottles for everyday products like Bayer and Aleve. In at least one instance, Prince procured an opiate prescription in the name of Kirk Johnson, a personal friend and employee since the 1980s, according to investigators.\n\nPrince was found dead in the elevator of his home in Chanhassen, Minn., on April 21, 2016, by Mr. Johnson and others after he ingested the fatal amount of fentanyl, which is often used to manufacture counterfeit pills that are sold on the black market as oxycodone and other pain relievers. Investigators have said they are most concerned with who obtained the fentanyl, and have yet to charge anyone in Prince\u2019s death. They noted in court records that those who were present at the home that morning \u201cprovided inconsistent and, at times, contradictory statements.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/18/arts/18PRINCE/18PRINCE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/18/arts/18PRINCE/18PRINCE-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/21/multimedia/obit-prince/obit-prince-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/18/arts/18PRINCE/18PRINCE-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli", "Serge F.
