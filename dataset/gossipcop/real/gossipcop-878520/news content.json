The former Bachelorette contestant opened up about not being the lead on the ABC reality show and his future in the franchise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d Kraus exclusively told Us Weekly on Wednesday, January 24, about the fact that he could have been the one dating the contestants current on Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season of The Bachelor. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy it\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why, Kraus explained, \u201cLike reality TV is \u2026 it\u2019s a whole \u2018nother beast. The amount of pressure that he has to face now, he\u2019s on every magazine cover. He\u2019s all over the place, and people have their opinions of him and I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a world that I am happy without \u2026 I mean, being in the spotlight if you will, it\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m not going to lie. Walking past a magazine and seeing myself in a little tiny picture in the corner, it\u2019s interesting. But, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not something that I need to get fulfillment in my life.\u201d\n\nKraus was a fan-favorite to be The Bachelor after he was the runner-up on Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of The Bachelorette last year. Fans were shocked when Luyendyk Jr. was announced as the lead instead of Kraus, and some viewers even started calling Luyendyk Jr. \u201cnot Peter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel kind of bad for him,\u201d the personal trainer said about the fan\u2019s nickname for Luyendyk Jr. \u201cHe got kind of pushed into a pressure situation last minute it sounds like and I mean he\u2019s already got kind of like cards stacked against him going into a situation like that. To then be added on to that, not even being called by his own name, that\u2019s got to be tough.\u201d\n\nDespite things not working out with The Bachelor, Kraus has managed to stay busy. He just launched an app called Hive with former NFL star Terrell \u201cT.O.\u201d Owens.\n\n\u201cHive is a social networking app,\u201d the Bachelor finalist told Us. \u201cThe idea behind it is you have friends here in this area that you\u2019ve probably never met, so it will put you in sync with people who have similar interests based on the categories you select or the groups you join. You all go onto one feed and anything that you follow as far as categories will show up on that feed.\u201d\n\nAs for his future in Bachelor Nation, Kraus told Us that Bachelor in Paradise is \u201ca hard no.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut other things within the franchise, I really like the people that I worked with \u2026 The production team are fantastic, yeah,\u201d he said about returning to the franchise one day. \u201cPeople ask me about Mike Fleiss, like what\u2019s my thought on Mike Fleiss, and I think he\u2019s a great guy. We have a great rapport. If they were to talk to me about something else in the future, I\u2019d be open.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-kraus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-kraus.jpg?w=300", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-kraus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/peter-kraus-is-happy-hes-not-the-bachelor/", "title": "Peter Kraus Is Happy He's Not the Bachelor", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Peter Kraus spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about why he\u2019s happy he isn\u2019t \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 and also spoke about Arie Luyendyk Jr. and \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 \u2014 watch", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Peter Kraus Is Happy He's Not the Bachelor", "description": "Peter Kraus spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about why he\u2019s happy he isn\u2019t \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 and also spoke about Arie Luyendyk Jr. and \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/peter-kraus-is-happy-hes-not-the-bachelor/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:00:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-kraus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-kraus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Bachelor", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-01-25T00:45:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:00:45+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Peter Kraus spoke exclusively to Us Weekly about why he\u2019s happy he isn\u2019t \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 and also spoke about Arie Luyendyk Jr. and \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 \u2014 watch", "title": "Why Peter Kraus Is Happy He's Not the Bachelor", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-kraus.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516841120.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
