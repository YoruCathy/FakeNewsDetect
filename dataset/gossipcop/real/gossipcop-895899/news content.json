The joyful journey is Pixar\u2019s best effort since 2015\u2019s Inside Out and, like the studio\u2019s greatest works, makes you laugh and cry in equal doses. (If Up left you a teary mess, go ahead and bring a whole tissue box.)\n\nMore:Everything you need to know about the Mexican cultural references in 'Coco'\n\nEarlier:The 'Incredibles 2' trailer is here with a dangerously powerful Jack-Jack\n\nRelated:Meet music-loving Miguel and dog friend Dante in an exclusive 'Coco' scene\n\nDirector Lee Unkrich (Toy Story 3) centers the story on the Day of the Dead and the importance of family \u2014 though Miguel (voiced by Anthony Gonzalez) in his own way rebels against his clan. (Coco isn't related to that other animated movie based on the Day of the Dead, the 2014 romantic adventure The Book of Life, though they would make a fine double feature.)\n\nA gifted 12-year-old, Miguel yearns to be a balladeer like his idol Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), an A-list celebrity of yesteryear who\u2019s a Latino Elvis and the most famous son of Santa Cecilia. But music is banned in Miguel's household, because his great-great-grandfather left the family behind for a performing career many years prior, so Miguel has to teach himself guitar in secret.\n\nHe runs off to the Land of the Dead \u2014 full of wondrous sights and skeleton residents \u2014 to find his ancestor and right a wrong, meeting the rest of his deceased relatives (who also hate music) and a lovable scamp named H\u00e9ctor (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal). He's a key to getting Miguel some face time with Ernesto but also the guy who relays the stakes at hand: If someone in the Land of the Dead is forgotten by their family, they disappear into the ether, and if Miguel doesn\u2019t get back home in time, he\u2019ll turn into a skull and bones himself. (In a nod to Back to the Future, H\u00e9ctor watches as the skin disappears from his hand as time passes.)\n\nCoco is one of Pixar\u2019s most gorgeously animated outings in some time. The Land of the Dead pops like an afterlife Las Vegas, and Miguel\u2019s town and its residents are impressively photorealistic. The screenplay by Matthew Aldrich and co-director Adrian Molina sticks closely to the Pixar template in terms of coming-of-age and find-your-identity themes and is unabashed in its emotional manipulation. But by the time you realize it, your heart\u2019s been wholly warmed and there\u2019s no going back.\n\nBratt lends over-the-top machismo to Ernesto, Bernal gives H\u00e9ctor a fun sparkle, and Alanna Ubach is all sass as Mama Imelda, Miguel\u2019s fiery, no-nonsense great-great-grandmother. But Gonzalez is tops in the cast: The 13-year-old newcomer gives Miguel a mischievous but heroic quality and a surprising depth, especially in the loving asides between Miguel and his great-grandmother Coco (Ana Ofelia Murgu\u00eda). Plus, the kid can sing like nobody\u2019s business.\n\nMore:The 5 best Pixar movies to binge-watch this weekend\n\nAlso:10 holiday movies you must see, from 'Justice League' to the new 'Star Wars'\n\nCoco is arguably the most musical Pixar film, with a host of catchy tunes. Proud Coraz\u00f3n is an emotionally packed showstopper for Gonzalez, who also duets with Bernal on the toe-tapping Un Poco Loco. The Let It Go of the bunch is Remember Me, a track by the Frozen songwriting team that gets reprised in various ways by different characters yet feels fresh every time.\n\nNot that you\u2019ll forget how moving Coco is anytime soon.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5623026535001_5623013574001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2eb382014f49f103792ae5eab2947e2e46241a29/c=0-13-4000-2273/local/-/media/2017/11/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467929847206659-Coco596d30d0192bd.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2eb382014f49f103792ae5eab2947e2e46241a29/c=0-13-4000-2273/local/-/media/2017/11/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467929847206659-Coco596d30d0192bd.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/11/21/review-joyful-coco-breaks-pixar-pack-mexican-musical-spectacular/882699001/", "title": "Review: Joyful 'Coco' breaks from the Pixar pack as a Mexican musical spectacular", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Review: Joyful 'Coco' breaks from the Pixar pack as a Mexican musical spectacular", "description": "The tale of a Mexican boy who travels to a colorful afterlife is Pixar's best effort since 'Inside Out.'", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/11/21/review-joyful-coco-breaks-pixar-pack-mexican-musical-spectacular/882699001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2eb382014f49f103792ae5eab2947e2e46241a29/c=0-13-4000-2273/local/-/media/2017/11/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467929847206659-Coco596d30d0192bd.jpg?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Brian Truitt", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The tale of a Mexican boy who travels to a colorful afterlife is Pixar's best effort since 'Inside Out.'", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2eb382014f49f103792ae5eab2947e2e46241a29/c=0-13-4000-2273/local/-/media/2017/11/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467929847206659-Coco596d30d0192bd.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Review: Joyful 'Coco' breaks from the Pixar pack as a Mexican musical spectacular", "description": "The tale of a Mexican boy who travels to a colorful afterlife is Pixar's best effort since 'Inside Out.'"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511193600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
