Ratner tries to kiss Williams once more but is again rejected.\n\nYou can watch the clip here:\n\nOn Wednesday, the Times reported that six women had accused Ratner of sexually harassment or assault.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider on behalf of the director, Ratner's attorney said Ratner \"vehemently denies the outrageous derogatory allegations that have been reported about him\" and was \"confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims.\"\n\nIn another statement to Business Insider, the attorney said Ratner would step away from all \"Warner Bros.-related activities\" until his \"personal issues are resolved.\"", "images": ["https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "https://i.insider.com/59fb368458a0c15d1f8b5470?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59fb366158a0c19d378b50dd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/59fb368458a0c15d1f8b5470?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/video-of-brett-ratner-and-serena-williams-shared-online-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations-2017-11?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59fb366158a0c19d378b50dd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Luz Henning Santiago"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/video-of-brett-ratner-and-serena-williams-shared-online-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations-2017-11", "title": "A cringeworthy clip of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams is making the rounds online following sexual-misconduct allegations against him", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "A cringeworthy clip of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams is making the rounds online following sexual-misconduct allegations against him", "date": "2017-11-02", "news_keywords": "Serena Williams, Brett Ratner, Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "description": "A clip from the 2005 reality series \"Venus and Serena: For Real\" of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams, his girlfriend at the time, has surfaced.", "author": "Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "og": {"title": "A cringeworthy clip of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams is making the rounds online following sexual-misconduct allegations against him", "description": "A clip from the 2005 reality series \"Venus and Serena: For Real\" of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams, his girlfriend at the time, has surfaced.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/video-of-brett-ratner-and-serena-williams-shared-online-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations-2017-11", "image": "https://i.insider.com/59fb366158a0c19d378b50dd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "A cringeworthy clip of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams is making the rounds online following sexual-misconduct allegations against him", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-02", "sailthru.tags": "Serena Williams, Brett Ratner, Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "sailthru.description": "A clip from the 2005 reality series \"Venus and Serena: For Real\" of Brett Ratner and Serena Williams, his girlfriend at the time, has surfaced.", "sailthru.author": "Amanda Luz Henning Santiago", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, sportspage", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/59fb365458a0c19d378b50db?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/59fb365458a0c19d378b50db?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "variant", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "post-breadcrumbs": "variant", "tabbed-homepage": "variant", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "variant"}, "viking-id": "59fb2f7c58a0c11f008b58bd", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509552000.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
