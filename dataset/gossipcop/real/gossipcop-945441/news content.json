Kang then went a step further and revealed that Scott Wilson and Sonequa Martin-Green will be returning as their respective characters, Hershel and Sasha.\n\nWhat do Shane, Sasha, and Hershel\u2019s arrivals have to do with Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes leaving? Maybe nothing! But if a show\u2019s most important character is leaving said show, what better way to do so then to have him shepherded off into the sunset (metaphorical or literal) by a host of specters from the show\u2019s past?\n\nRegardless of their purpose in The Walking Dead Season 9, it will just be nice to have Shane, Sasha, and Hershel back.", "images": ["https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-sonequa-martin-green.jpg?resize=768%2C432", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/alec-bojalad.jpg?resize=80%2C80&filter=grayscale", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-sonequa-martin-green.jpg?resize=1024,683"], "top_img": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-sonequa-martin-green.jpg?resize=1024,683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alec Bojalad", "John Saavedra", "Ron Hogan", "Louisa Mellor", "Chris Manning"], "canonical_link": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-walking-dead-season-9-three-former-twd-stars-return/", "title": "The Walking Dead Season 9: Three Former TWD Stars Return", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d23226", "description": "The Walking Dead Season 9 will feature appearances from three dearly departed characters: Shane, Hershel, and Sasha.", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Walking Dead Season 9: Three Former TWD Stars Return | Den of Geek", "description": "The Walking Dead Season 9 will feature appearances from three dearly departed characters: Shane, Hershel, and Sasha.", "url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/the-walking-dead-season-9-three-former-twd-stars-return/", "site_name": "Den of Geek", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-sonequa-martin-green.jpg?resize=1024,683", "secure_url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-sonequa-martin-green.jpg?resize=1024,683", "width": 1024, "height": 683}}, "article": {"tag": "The Walking Dead", "section": "TV", "published_time": "2018-10-07T01:13:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Walking Dead Season 9 will feature appearances from three dearly departed characters: Shane, Hershel, and Sasha.", "title": "The Walking Dead Season 9: Three Former TWD Stars Return | Den of Geek", "image": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-walking-dead-sonequa-martin-green.jpg?fit=2070%2C1380"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/favicon.geek_.purple.swirl_-1.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538874780.0, "source": "https://www.denofgeek.com", "summary": ""}
