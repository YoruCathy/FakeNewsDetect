I'm with her because I like her and I hope she's with me because she likes me. When we come home, we don't really talk about that sh*t. We just spend time together as a normal couple, cook food, watch TV, have a laugh,\" he added.\n\nForever rooting for Zigi to defy the odds. <3", "images": ["http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/all/themes/vimn/common/images/logos/mtv.svg", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/vimn_image_embed/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/howwasitoknow.jpg?itok=Qru6F96I", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/ziginav.jpg?itok=MdI2r2pH", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAPcAAAAAAAEBAQICAgMDAwQEBAUFBQYGBgcHBwgICAkJCQoKCgsLCwwMDA0NDQ4ODg8PDxAQEBERERISEhMTExQUFBUVFRYWFhcXFxgYGBkZGRoaGhsbGxwcHB0dHR4eHh8fHyAgICEhISIiIiMjIyQkJCUlJSYmJicnJygoKCkpKSoqKisrKywsLC0tLS4uLi8vLzAwMDExMTIyMjMzMzQ0NDU1NTY2Njc3Nzg4ODk5OTo6Ojs7Ozw8PD09PT4+Pj8/P0BAQEFBQUJCQkNDQ0REREVFRUZGRkdHR0hISElJSUpKSktLS0xMTE1NTU5OTk9PT1BQUFFRUVJSUlNTU1RUVFVVVVZWVldXV1hYWFlZWVpaWltbW1xcXF1dXV5eXl9fX2BgYGFhYWJiYmNjY2RkZGVlZWZmZmdnZ2hoaGlpaWpqamtra2xsbG1tbW5ubm9vb3BwcHFxcXJycnNzc3R0dHV1dXZ2dnd3d3h4eHl5eXp6ent7e3x8fH19fX5+fn9/f4CAgIGBgYKCgoODg4SEhIWFhYaGhoeHh4iIiImJiYqKiouLi4yMjI2NjY6Ojo+Pj5CQkJGRkZKSkpOTk5SUlJWVlZaWlpeXl5iYmJmZmZqampubm5ycnJ2dnZ6enp+fn6CgoKGhoaKioqOjo6SkpKWlpaampqenp6ioqKmpqaqqqqurq6ysrK2tra6urq+vr7CwsLGxsbKysrOzs7S0tLW1tba2tre3t7i4uLm5ubq6uru7u7y8vL29vb6+vr+/v8DAwMHBwcLCwsPDw8TExMXFxcbGxsfHx8jIyMnJycrKysvLy8zMzM3Nzc7Ozs/Pz9DQ0NHR0dLS0tPT09TU1NXV1dbW1tfX19jY2NnZ2dra2tvb29zc3N3d3d7e3t/f3+Dg4OHh4eLi4uPj4+Tk5OXl5ebm5ufn5+jo6Onp6erq6uvr6+zs7O3t7e7u7u/v7/Dw8PHx8fLy8vPz8/T09PX19fb29vf39/j4+Pn5+fr6+vv7+/z8/P39/f7+/v///ywAAAAAEAAJAAAIFgD/CRxIsKDBgwgTKlzIsKHDhxARBgQAOw==", "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/vimn_image_embed/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/gigizayn.jpg?itok=PE3VuoAY"], "top_img": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/ziginav.jpg?itok=MdI2r2pH", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/gigi-hadid/news/zayn-malik-and-gigi-hadid-are-celebrating-their-two-year-anniversary-and-love-is-alive", "title": "Zayn Malik And Gigi Hadid Are Celebrating Their Two Year Anniversary And Love Is Alive", "meta_data": {"og": {"url": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/gigi-hadid/news/zayn-malik-and-gigi-hadid-are-celebrating-their-two-year-anniversary-and-love-is-alive", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/ziginav.jpg?itok=MdI2r2pH", "description": "The supermodel has shared an adorable shot of the couple living their best life.", "title": "Zayn Malik And Gigi Hadid Are Celebrating Their Two Year Anniversary And Love Is Alive  | MTV UK"}, "twitter": {"title": "Zayn Malik And Gigi Hadid Are Celebrating Their Two Year Anniversary And Love Is Alive  | MTV UK", "description": "The supermodel has shared an adorable shot of the couple living their best life.", "url": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/gigi-hadid/news/zayn-malik-and-gigi-hadid-are-celebrating-their-two-year-anniversary-and-love-is-alive", "image": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_wide/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/ziginav.jpg?itok=MdI2r2pH", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow,NOODP", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "vimn": {"entity_type": "node", "entity_uuid": "5f256713-fb25-44ee-b7b1-5c7a8deeca95"}, "thumbnail": "http://www.mtv.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/media_thumbnail/public/mtv_uk/galleries/large/2017/11/13/ziginav.jpg?itok=YejkNlOJ", "description": "The supermodel has shared an adorable shot of the couple living their best life.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.co.uk", "summary": ""}
