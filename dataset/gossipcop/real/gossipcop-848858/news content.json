For starters, many of the options on the market tend to be laden with skin-drying chemicals\u2014and when you pair that with the fact that they aren't exactly the most thorough way to cleanse your face, they really aren't worth the minute or two you're saving yourself by using them in the first place. (Seriously: Our managing editor Lindsey even tried replacing her traditional cleanser with wipes for a week, and let's just say it wasn't exactly a positive experience.)\n\nWith all this in mind, we were pretty surprised to learn that one very high-profile makeup artist actually does swear by wipes\u2014and since Mary Phillips's esteemed clientele includes Chrissy Teigen, the Kardashians, and Jennifer Lopez (aka the woman who does not age), we obviously trust her POV.
