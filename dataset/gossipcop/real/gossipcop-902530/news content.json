From the red carpet and Seth Meyers' opening monologue to the acceptance speeches, Tinseltown turned what has traditionally been a previously lighter-toned awards show into a serious statement on the state of women in Hollywood. Debra Messing called out E!'s wage-gap issue in a red carpet interview with the network before Natalie Portman savagely ripped the fact that only men were nominated for best director. Oh, and all hail Oprah Winfrey. As for the awards themselves? Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and HBO's Big Little Lies dominated, each winning four Globes.\n\nThe 2018 Golden Globe Awards show Seth Meyers delivers his opening monologue at the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards held at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 'Good evening, ladies and remaining gentlemen.' Meyers kicks off talking about the topics of the day, especially sexual harassment: 'It's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood.' A pair of real superheroes, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson present the award for Best Actress in a Limited Series or Motion Picture Made for TV. Big Little Lies' Nicole Kidman wins best actress in a limited series or movie. Getting the trophy early 'means my daughters are still awake' she says. 'I'm bringing this award home to my babies.' Kidman points out that her abused character on the show is very much a symbol of the current climate, and by having projects like Big Little Lies, 'I do believe we can elicit change.' Helen Mirren and Viola Davis present the award for Best Support Actgor in a movie at the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards. Sam Rockwell takes the first big movie award of the night, supporting actor for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. 'I've been in a lot of indies and it's nice to be in a movie that people see,' Rockwell says, thanking his 'force of nature' co-star Frances McDormand.

Carol Burnett and Jennifer Aniston present the award for best actress in a television series, musical or comedy. Rachel Brosnahan takes best actress in a TV comedy for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. 'I'm going to have to write a whole bunch of thank-you notes, my brain is scrambed eggs,' she says. After saying hey to Oprah, she added that 'there are so many women's stories that need and deserve to be told' and called for people to champion those stories. The Handmaid's Tale gets its first Globe win with Elisabeth Moss getting best actress in a drama. She paid tribute to author Margaret Atwood and others before and after her who 'were brave enough to speak out against intolerance and injustice and to fight for equality and freedom in this world.' Sarah Paulson intriduces a clip from 'The Post.' Kerry Washington (L) and Garrett Hedlund present the award for best actor in a TV drama. Sterling K. Brown of This Is Us snags best actor in a TV drama - his first Globes victory. He thanks writer Dan Fogelman for such a great role: 'I'm being seen for who I am and being appreciated for who I am, and it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or anybody who looks like me.'\n\n#MeToo is changing awards season, and it started at tonight's Golden Globes\n\nThe 75th Golden Globe Awards begins the race to the Oscars, with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association honoring 2017\u2019s best in movies and TV. But Sunday wasn't the beginning of an ordinary awards season. In the wake of a massive sexual harassment scandal that's descended upon Hollywood, the women of Tinseltown are sticking a stiletto to the patriarchy. Well aware that live cameras are pointed in their direction \u2014 with millions watching \u2014 stars showed up on the red carpet in black as a way to protest gender inequality and drive home the continued power of #MeToo.\n\nGolden Globe Awards 2018: See all the red carpet looks Celebrities hit the 2018 Golden Globe Awards red carpet on Jan. 7, 2017.

Huh, AP\n\nTrump: I'm 'a very stable genius'\n\nPresident Trump, likely responding to discussion of his mental state raised in a new tell-all book, branded himself a \"very stable genius,\" in a string of Saturday tweets, saying his two greatest assets are mental stability and being smart. The tweet burst erupted in the morning from Camp David on a day the president was meeting with top Republicans in Congress to work out a legislative agenda for 2018. Trump's tweets also followed days of brutal commentary in the wake of the publication of Michael Wolff's new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, that quotes staffers as calling the president everything from \"moron\" to \"idiot,\" and describing him as uninformed and \"like a child.\" On Sunday, former White House strategist Steve Bannon said he intended to blame former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, not Trump's son, for a meeting in 2016 with a Russian lawyer that was characterized as \"treasonous\" in Wolff's book.\n\nAstronaut John Young dies at 87\n\nAstronaut John Young, who walked on the moon and was the first to fly into space six times, died Friday night at 87.

He went to the moon in May 1969 aboard Apollo 10 and again in April 1972 on Apollo 16. Young had gone into space as apart of the Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs, the only NASA astronaut to be a part of all three.\n\nRemembering John Young (1930-2018) Astronaut John Young aboard Gemini III on March 23, 1965.

He was 86. Van Dyke's wife, Shirley Ann Jones, said his health had deteriorated since a car accident two years ago. Van Dyke got his start in TV by making appearances on The Dick Van Dyke Show, the American sitcom that starred his real-life older brother.

Trump's administration asked Congress on Friday to set aside that amount over the next 10 years to build or extend the nearly 700-mile barrier that became a signature 2016 presidential campaign pledge. The estimate is the most detailed accounting yet of how much it will cost to make the border wall a reality. The proposal comes as the administration intensifies negotiations with Congress on a package to overhaul the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nThe Wall: Untold stories along the U.S.-Mexico border March 19, 2017; Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; Tutu'uli, a 6-month old female jaguar lives at the Ecological Center of Sonora on March 19, 2017, in Hermosillo, Mexico.

The mountain is in a spot along the U.S.-Mexico border that allows pilgrims to see Mexico, El Paso and New Mexico from different vantage points. It's also a reminder of the church's teachings, which Aguilar said will be threatened if a wall is erected. Pilgrims reach the base of the limestone cross atop Mount Cristo Rey near Sunland Park, N.M., on April 14, 2017 which is Good Friday.
