While there were plans for Princess Charlotte to join her brother, Prince George, at St. Thomas\u2019 Nursery School, a source told Us Weekly that Prince William and Duchess Kate decided to send their 2-year-old daughter to Willcocks Nursery School because it\u2019s much closer to their Kensington Palace home.\n\n\u201cCharlotte will be attending five days a week in the mornings only, so going further away in London would mean she would spend half her day on the commute,\u201d the source told Us. \u201cNot something a child would want!\u201d\n\nThe insider adds that William and Kate loved Willcocks \u201cbecause it\u2019s a traditional nursery with high standards.\u201d\n\nThe news that Charlotte is starting nursery school next year was announced on Monday, December 18.\n\n\u201cWe are delighted that The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have chosen the Willcocks Nursery School for Princess Charlotte,\u201d the school said in a statement that day. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming Charlotte to our nursery in January.\u201d\n\nWillcocks, which the school\u2019s website says \u201cstrives to maintain its ethos for high standards, excellence and good manners,\u201d is not too expensive despite its awards for excellence. According to Willcocks\u2019 website, tuition at the nursery school is \u00a33,050 per term, which is equivalent to roughly $4,080 a semester.\n\nThe royal family of four also released their Christmas card on Monday. The couple, both 35, stood behind their children for the portrait.\n\nGeorge, 4, and Charlotte are spending the holiday with their parents; their uncle Prince Harry and his bride-to-be, Meghan Markle; and their grandma Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\u201cThey will get some toys \u2014 a dollhouse is \u2018a strong contender\u2019 for Charlotte \u2026 George is obsessed with anything on wheels, BMX bikes, skateboards and toy cars,\u201d a Middleton family friend said in the new issue of Us Weekly, adding that many of the presents sent in from fans around the world are quietly donated to toy banks and other children\u2019s organizations. \u201cReceiving that many gifts wouldn\u2019t have a good effect on the kids.\u201d\n\nFor more on how the little royals are spending Christmas, check out the latest issue of Us Weekly on stands now.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C868px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte.jpg?crop=0px%2C51px%2C868px%2C490px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C868px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-william-kate-chose-willcocks-for-charlottes-nursery-school/", "title": "Why William, Kate Chose Willcocks for Charlotte\u2019s Nursery School", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Find out why Prince William and Duchess Kate chose Willcocks for Princess Charlotte\u2019s nursery school \u2014 exclusive details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why William, Kate Chose Willcocks for Princess Charlotte\u2019s Nursery School", "description": "Find out why Prince William and Duchess Kate chose Willcocks for Princess Charlotte\u2019s nursery school \u2014 exclusive details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-william-kate-chose-willcocks-for-charlottes-nursery-school/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:08:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C868px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C868px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Royals", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-12-22T19:41:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:08:13+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Find out why Prince William and Duchess Kate chose Willcocks for Princess Charlotte\u2019s nursery school \u2014 exclusive details", "title": "Why William, Kate Chose Willcocks for Princess Charlotte\u2019s Nursery School", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte.jpg?crop=0px%2C24px%2C868px%2C456px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513971715.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
