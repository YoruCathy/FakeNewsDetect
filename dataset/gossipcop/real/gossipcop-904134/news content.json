The former couple might have rekindled their romance, after all. Fans spotted Perry and Bloom in the Maldives, at luxury resort Amilla Fushi (which a source confirmed to People). They both wore baseball caps, and tried to go incognito in the resort's restaurant, but a fan caught them on camera:\n\nBloom shared a photo on Instagram this week of himself at the Amilla Fushi resort in the Maldives, wearing a shirt that looks suspiciously similar to the one he wore to dine with Perry (albeit with a heavy filter). His caption, \"lookin into 2018 like \ud83e\udd84#amillafushi #grateful \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\" suggests he's feeling extremely positive about the year ahead:\n\n\n\nAccording to E! News, a source revealed that \"Katy was in Dubai and then stopped over in Maldives where she met up with Orlando. It's a few hours away and Katy wanted to stop there since it was pretty close.\" Although the source says that the meet up is \"nothing serious,\" it's clear that the exes are still very friendly with one another. Could 2018 be their year?", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/katy-orlando-1515252206.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/katy-orlando-1515252206.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden", "Weekend Editor", "Amy Mackelden Is The Weekend Editor At Harpersbazaar.Com", "Where She Writes About Entertainment", "Celebrity News", "Beauty"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a14768851/exes-katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-in-the-maldives/", "title": "Exes Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Just Reunited on Vacation in the Maldives", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Exes Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Just Reunited on Vacation in the Maldives", "description": "They're staying at a luxury resort together.", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a14768851/exes-katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-in-the-maldives/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/katy-orlando-1515252206.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-01-06 03:38:00", "published_time": "2018-01-06 03:36:00", "section": "Celebrity News 2020", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/katy-orlando-1515252206.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Exes Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Just Reunited on Vacation in the Maldives", "description": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom could be back together.
