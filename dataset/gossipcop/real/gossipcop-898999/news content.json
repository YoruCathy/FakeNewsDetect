We\u2019ll get to that.\n\nThe subject came up while Kirby and former Doctor Who Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip, were being interviewed together to promote Season 2 of The Crown, which debuts Dec. 8 on Netflix. The series, of course, follows the long reign of Queen Elizabeth II, played by Claire Foy.\n\nWith Season 2 picking up where Season 1 left off \u2014 in the mid-1950s \u2014 Smith was talking about how the changing times really started affecting the relationships and inner workings of the royal family as the swinging \u201960s approached.\n\nAnd when you think about it, that has been one of the consistent struggles for the royal family ever since, hasn\u2019t it? Should you modernize? Can you modernize? How much? Does modernization potentially expose uncomfortable ironies, leaving you vulnerable to obsolescence?\n\nToday\u2019s Prince Harry \u2014 who is getting married to TV actress and humanitarian Meghan Markle, as was announced in the past week \u2014 is the Princess Margaret of the \u201950s and \u201960s. You know, the younger sibling of the monarch, the \u201cspare\u201d who follows the heir, with a form of limited freedom that expands once the heir starts pumping out kids, each one of which moves the \u201cspare\u201d further away from the actual throne.\n\n\u201cMargaret, she\u2019s the one character who really embraces the \u201960s,\u201d Smith pointed out, as Kirby nodded her head in agreement. \u201cThe rest of the royal family don\u2019t quite know what to be.\n\n\u201cThe perception of them changes so greatly, and then Maggie gets on with it, doesn\u2019t she, with Tony (Margaret\u2019s eventual husband Antony Armstrong-Jones, played by Matthew Goode). It\u2019s quite interesting.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sex in it. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Kirby recalled there had been a debate about whether or not to show \u201croyal boob\u201d in a sex scene featuring Margaret and Tony. But beyond those physical concerns, Kirby acknowledged the emotional trap Margaret finds herself in, both as a young woman in Season 1 and continuing into full adulthood in Season 2.\n\n\u201cIn the first season Margaret was really kind of combative with (Elizabeth),\u201d Kirby said. \u201cAnd then (in Season 2), as Margaret looks elsewhere for reassurance, and for identity and for a sense of self, in Tony and that world, I think she kind of grows with confidence.\n\n\u201cBut wounds don\u2019t heal that easy.\u201d\n\nWith the royal sisters still in opposition in many ways in Season 2, Kirby found herself increasingly protective of Margaret.\n\n\u201cPlaying it with Claire (Foy), I felt like in fact Margaret had to step up even more,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cMargaret had to define who she isn\u2019t, meaning, \u2018I\u2019m not you, I\u2019m free to break away, I\u2019m free to live, I\u2019m free to love, I know who I am now, I\u2019m a woman for the modern age, i.e., you\u2019re not.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmith agreed that Queen Elizabeth must have felt somewhat abandoned by her husband Philip and her sister Margaret in the late \u201950s and into the \u201960s, at least in terms of the vibrant social scene.\n\n\u201cElizabeth is sort of left behind, because she can\u2019t go to the theatre in quite the same way, she can\u2019t engage culturally with the world around her in quite the same way that Philip and Margaret do,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey go and they live their lives a bit more.\u201d\n\nI must admit, there were times in Season 1 of The Crown when I felt sorry for the young Elizabeth, dealing with her bratty sister and pouty husband. Hey, Elizabeth didn\u2019t ask for any of this. Her uncle abdicated and her dad died. Suddenly she was Queen. How about a little understanding and co-operation, huh?\n\nBe that as it may, Kirby and Smith had a fun exchange when asked if they had heard anything about how the real royal family has reacted to The Crown.\n\n\u201cI might have,\u201d Smith said playfully.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Kirby replied.\n\nSmith said to Kirby, \u201cI don\u2019t know about you. We have heard, but I think it\u2019s prudent and respectful of us not to say anything.\u201d\n\nKirby added, \u201cThe only reason I\u2019ve heard from another route is that an American friend of mine was in London and happened to be chatting to Princess Beatrice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking about the big guns,\u201d said Smith, prompting laughter.\n\n\u201cBut (Princess Beatrice) was talking about her granny, in context of The Crown, and my American friend was like, \u2018Who is this girl talking about her granny?\u2019 \u201d Kirby explained. \u201cAnd then later (my American friend) was like, \u2018Oh my God, it\u2019s the Queen!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cOh wow, really? That\u2019s funny,\u201d Smith said. \u201c(Princess Beatrice) sent us a lovely email, actually. She\u2019s nice, Princess Beatrice.\u201d\n\nBut back to the question. What do the \u201cbig guns\u201d among the royals think of The Crown?\n\n\u201cUm, yeah, we\u2019ve heard,\u201d Smith repeated. \u201cPhilip hasn\u2019t watched it.\u201d\n\nWell, if any or all of the royals watch Season 2, they obviously will see some new characters, including U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie. The glamorous American couple is played by Michael C. Hall (best known for his roles in Dexter and Six Feet Under) and Jodi Balfour (a South African actress best known to Canadian TV audiences for her role in the series Bomb Girls).\n\nIt\u2019ll be close to an entirely new cast in Season 3 of The Crown, even with regard to the principals. Creator Peter Morgan\u2019s plan is for The Crown to run for six seasons, covering Queen Elizabeth\u2019s entire reign, so the main characters have to age relatively briskly. To this point, the only official casting news is that Olivia Colman will take over from Foy to play Queen Elizabeth in Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nKirby joked that maybe she isn\u2019t quite done yet. \u201cCan I just wear a different wig and come back as Margaret Thatcher?\u201d\n\nThis seems like an odd place to revive the debate about \u201croyal boob,\u201d but we can\u2019t leave it unanswered. So what was the final determination?\n\n\u201cAt the beginning, we were like, \u2018Should we?\u2019 \u201d Kirby said. \u201cBut we decided we don\u2019t want to see royal boob, thank God.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s probably a good idea,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d repeated Kirby with a hint of comic uncertainty in her voice.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s no royal boob?\u201d Smith asked again, just to make sure.\n\n\u201cNo royal boob,\u201d Kirby confirmed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t raunchy at all, in the end. It was respectful.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the royal family for you. Respectful on the outside, raunchy on the inside.\n\nTwitter: @billharris_tv\n\nbillharristv@gmail.com", "images": ["https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/secondcity.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/jon-roche-500d4654-cf24-4058-befa-dee46a2fb8d5-e1587142593459.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/toronto-desktop.png", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/health-coronavirus-canada-banks-e1587174436594.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/modern-family-abc.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/christine2-e1587160520269.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/jon-roche-500d4654-cf24-4058-befa-dee46a2fb8d5-e1587142593459.jpeg?quality=80&strip=all&w=107&h=80&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/146292_0337-e1587076947758.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/claire-foy-matt-smith-1-e1512005953905.jpg", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/11/doctor.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=205&h=153&crop=1", "https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/dylan-colbert.jpg?w=107&h=80&crop=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=identicon&r=g", "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/streaming-gettyimages-1078740886.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=365&h=273&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/claire-foy-matt-smith-1-e1512005953905.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://torontosun.com/entertainment/television/the-crown-season-2-accentuates-how-todays-prince-harry-is-yesterdays-princess-margaret", "title": "'The Crown' Season 2 accentuates how today's Prince Harry is yesterday's Princess Margaret", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. &mdash;
