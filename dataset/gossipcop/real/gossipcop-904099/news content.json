Investigators say he hit a tractor in rural Buchanan County, north of Aurora, in April 2017. While Soules stayed at the scene initially, he left before authorities arrived.\n\nKenneth Mosher died as a result of the crash.", "images": ["https://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=499012051&7=2712091&25=0&18=0.742976578728527", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-Print-34.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/KCRG_50_32.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Livestream_Nav_Icon.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/chris-soules-8-14-17.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=16575094&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Sports_Nav_Icon.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/KCRG_311_98.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Weather_Nav_Icon.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-YouTube-34.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-LinkedIn-34.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-Email-34.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-Twitter-34.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/wx_85.png", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Home_Nav_Icon.png ", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-Yelp-34.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-423IyeSlam-w-.gif?labels=Stations.KCRG", "https://media.graytvinc.com/designimages/Social-Facebook-34.png"], "top_img": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/chris-soules-8-14-17.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ellyn Felton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Chris-Soules-withdraws-motion-to-change-venue-499012051.html", "title": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"title": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules", "description": "An Iowa farmer who appeared on ABC's 'The Bachelor' will not be appearing in court today after more motions for his trial have been made.", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/chris-soules-8-14-17.png", "url": "https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Chris-Soules-withdraws-motion-to-change-venue-499012051.html"}, "description": "An Iowa farmer who appeared on ABC's 'The Bachelor' will not be appearing in court today after more motions for his trial have been made.", "author": "Ellyn Felton, KCRG-TV9", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kcrgtv9"}, "google-site-verification": "_pi-uBEP3DU48yOrVs_IYPqZzPgLtRkS7bl24Ebx1MY", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "fb": {"app_id": 1482644542038403, "pages": 57827502171}, "news_keywords": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal", "keywords": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@KCRG", "creator": "@KCRG", "url": "https://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Chris-Soules-withdraws-motion-to-change-venue-499012051.html", "title": "Plea discussions underway regarding fatal crash and Chris Soules", "description": "An Iowa farmer who appeared on ABC's 'The Bachelor' will not be appearing in court today after more motions for his trial have been made.", "image": "https://media.graytvinc.com/images/chris-soules-8-14-17.png"}, "burst": "kcrg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.kcrg.com", "summary": ""}
