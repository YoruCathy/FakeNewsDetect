The singer and former tennis pro are first-time parents. E! Online also confirmed the news.\n\nKournikova, 36, reportedly gave birth to a baby boy, Nicholas, and girl, Lucy, over the weekend in Miami. The couple hadn\u2019t announced they were expecting. Representatives for Iglesias and Kournikova did not return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDespite making themselves mighty comfortable in that public bathroom for Iglesias\u2019 \u201cEscape\u201d music video all those years ago, the pop star and former tennis pro are famously private and rarely appear in public together.\n\nThe two have been together since 2001. While Kournikova sported some serious bling on her ring finger in a snap from 2016, they\u2019ve never confirmed that they are married.\n\nA post shared by Enrique Iglesias (@enriqueiglesias) on Dec 15, 2017 at 2:02pm PST\n\nA post shared by \ud83d\udc3e Anna \ud83c\udf88\u0410\u043d\u044f (@annakournikova) on Dec 15, 2017 at 1:38pm PST\n\nThe couple did, however, share some posts from Miami over the last few days looking happy in the sun.\n\nSpeaking with Women\u2019s Health in 2011, Kournikova revealed that while kids were part of her game plan, marriage wasn\u2019t \u201cimportant\u201d in her eyes.\n\n\u201cI absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt. I love taking care of people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in a happy relationship \u2015 that\u2019s all that matters \u2026 I believe in commitment. I believe in being open and trusting each other and respecting each other completely.\u201d\n\nCongrats to the happy couple, and may they forever take each other\u2019s breath away.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a38386e150000490049c633.jpeg?cache=cnj5a43uyq&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5909e3941700002000dd64a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc855a6240000090c524d4f.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a38386e150000490049c633.jpeg?cache=cnj5a43uyq&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/enrique-iglesias-anna-kournikova-twins_n_5a38372ce4b0fc99878e1dab", "title": "Anna Kournikova And Enrique Iglesias Welcome Twins In Secret", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The famously private couple have been together since 2001.", "keywords": "celebrity children,enrique iglesias,Anna Kournikova", "og": {"title": "Anna Kournikova And Enrique Iglesias Welcome Twins In Secret", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a38386e150000490049c633.jpeg?cache=cnj5a43uyq&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a38386e150000490049c633.jpeg?cache=cnj5a43uyq&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/enrique-iglesias-anna-kournikova-twins_n_5a38372ce4b0fc99878e1dab", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The famously private couple have been together since 2001."}, "article": {"tag": "celebrity children,enrique iglesias,Anna Kournikova", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-12-18 18:23:07 -0500", "modified_time": "2017-12-18 18:23:07 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Anna Kournikova And Enrique Iglesias Welcome Twins In Secret", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a38386e150000490049c633.jpeg?cache=cnj5a43uyq&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The famously private couple have been together since 2001.", "creator": "cdelbyck"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a38372ce4b0fc99878e1dab", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513639387.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
