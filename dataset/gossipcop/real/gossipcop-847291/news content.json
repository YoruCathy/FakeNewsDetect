Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear play the billionaire Shepherd siblings who are trying to use Claire to their advantage, and end up becoming her primary opponents; a combination of the Koch brothers and Facebook, their corporate holdings manage to mine data, pollute the environment, steal users\u2019 privacy, and uphold traditional family values. But even though the siblings make for a fascinating if grotesque portrait of power, privilege, and traditional family values, they barely have a story; like so much else in this season, the plot arc merely gestures toward relevance. Lane\u2019s character Annette, a friend of Claire\u2019s since girlhood, provides a striking foil for Claire\u2019s ascent. (In one flashback to the dorms at Andover, the two are shown mirroring each other in elaborate cotillion-style curtsies, while sharing a bitten-off joint. It\u2019s a loaded, arresting moment, but it\u2019s just that: a moment.)\n\nThe Shepherds amass all of the not-yet-dead pawns from the last five seasons of House of Cards on their team\u2014journalists working on hit pieces, operatives-turned-data miners, Russian plants in Claire\u2019s administration, Cabinet secretaries and Supreme Court justices that can be bought for the right price. By the end of the season, in what feels like a desperate attempt to tie up loose ends, nearly all of these characters are killed. (The list includes Patricia Clarkson\u2019s character Jane, Boris McGiver\u2019s Tom Hammerschmidt, and Jayne Atkinson\u2019s Cathy Durant, who technically dies twice.) The Shepherds get behind a Supreme Court ruling that would limit Claire\u2019s power, so to outmaneuver them President Hale dives into a heated conflict between ICO, the show\u2019s version of ISIS, and Russian President Viktor Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen), the show\u2019s version of Vladimir Putin. This brings the nation to the brink of nuclear war. And if this were not enough drama, Annette begins to coolly plan the president\u2019s assassination, with a cabal of co-conspirators that includes the vice president (Campbell Scott). Her man for the job? Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Frank Underwood\u2019s long-serving jack-of-all-trades.\n\nWhich leads to the final scene of the entire series. A face-off, between Claire and Doug, in the Oval Office. During which Stamper confesses to murdering Frank, somewhat by accident, by tampering with his medication\u2014and then lunges at Claire with Frank\u2019s letter opener. Claire adroitly turns it back on him, and then, as he bleeds, suffocates him. He does not resist. So Stamper dies, in a pool of blood, inches from the presidential seal on the carpet. And Claire\u2014almost 30 weeks pregnant, with an armed nuclear football awaiting her, and political chaos looming\u2014whispers, \u201cNo more pain,\u201d and then turns to the camera, with an almost crazed look in her eye.\n\nIt\u2019s a great shot. The camera looks up at Claire, almost as if we are lying next to Doug on the ground. Wright\u2019s blonde bob arcs toward the lens in a sweep. But it\u2019s a mysterious, ambiguous ending for a show that has, until now, specialized in rather blunt storytelling. With Stamper dead, is Claire poised to succeed? Doomed to fail? Confident in her purpose? Haunted by guilt? Is this her last murder, or a harbinger of future carnage? What about everything else\u2014the press secretary who knew too much (Kristen Sieh), the fearmongering journalist (Athena Karkanis), the conniving Speaker of the House (Boris Kodjoe)? What about the data mining that exposed the midterms to fraud, or the nuclear conflict in Syria? What about Claire\u2019s as-yet unnamed daughter, and Annette\u2019s thwarted assassination attempt? What about the story Janine (Constance Zimmer) had worked for so long to report? The story of House of Cards took Macbeth and Machiavelli and unleashed it on the White House; at its end, all it can show the audience is a moment of interpersonal bloodlust.\n\nHouse of Cards has always been a show that works best when in conversation with its political moment; the early years were so striking because their chilly cynicism was juxtaposed against the vivid optimism of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration. In the Trump era, its cynicism seems like piling on to what\u2019s already pernicious. The weekend before the real 2018 midterms, it\u2019s jarring to watch this show, where politicians plot to steal elections and sway Supreme Court justices with horrifying gusto. In this season, the story seems to be simply about power, and the dangers of it\u2014but for a show that so rewarded Frank Underwood\u2019s precise, brutal reign, it feels like a sharp detour.\n\nIn its way, this abrupt conclusion is a staggering commentary on what came before: the stakes of the Underwoods\u2019 House of Cards were global and political, but it could only lead to this kind of intimate, selfish violence. The rest of the story\u2014the world outside the Oval Office\u2014is abandoned midway. It\u2019s as if House of Cards is telling us the rest of the story must be written by us.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d3d1e975989820008deba1f/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Sonia_Saraiya%252520(1).png", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54fefcd81bb97fd46fe01f11/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss09-robin-wright-fashion.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54fefccc9689cbfa72bf3a64/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss01-robin-wright-fashion.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54fefdaa3d33425a57fc673f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss08-robin-wright-fashion.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bad3754e5ae6a094d0018cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/house-of-cards-trailer.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd345e155187a2d9530c8ab/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/HOC_601_Unit_01950rCROP.jpeg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bafaa962b57202d9836fe12/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kevin-spacey-misconduct.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sonia Saraiya", "Sonia Saraiy", "Joy Pres", "Yohana Dest", "Hilary Weave"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-final-season-review", "title": "Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.", "id": "5bdcb58a7d738b4e26033e43", "keywords": "hollywood,television,kevin spacey,netflix,robin wright,house of cards", "news_keywords": "hollywood,television,kevin spacey,netflix,robin wright,house of cards", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5bdcb58a7d738b4e26033e43", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-final-season-review"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
