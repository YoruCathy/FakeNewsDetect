Since then, the One Direction member has gushed about the hundreds of ways his life has changed since becoming a father. Now with the holiday season quickly approaching, Payno has got some things planned for his first Christmas with the family.\n\nSpeaking with Entertainment Tonight, the \u201cBedroom Floor\u201d singer admitted that close friends and family have been giving him tons of advice on how to make this little lad\u2019s first holiday special. Liam said he\u2019s been told, \u201cIt's his first Christmas. He's only going to be interested in the wrapping paper, so buy the shiniest one!\u201d\n\nHopefully Payno shares some adorable video of little Bear being totally obsessed with the wrapping paper, because that\u2019s definitely going to be one of the cutest things ever. As for future plans, the singer admitted that in the future he hopes to keep his family\u2019s tradition of heading to Disneyland in Florida for the holiday season alive. He added, \u201cI like the idea of taking him when he\u2019s maybe when he\u2019s six. That\u2019s a way off, but it\u2019s the dream.\u201d\n\nThat sounds like one very adorable tradition, and one everyone in his family is sure to love. As for himself, Payno only has one thing he wants to do. \u201cMy holiday plans are to spend some beautiful time with my son and to eat my own weight in lovely Christmas food. You might see a different Liam after Christmas, and then you'll see post-Christmas Liam with a new years resolution, hopefully,\u201d he said.\n\nWe wonder just how different of a Liam we\u2019ll see when the holiday season comes to an end. Of course we\u2019re going to have to wait and see, but hopefully the \"Get Low\" singer will share with fans what he\u2019s got planned for the next year and what this mysterious resolution is.\n\nLove J-14?
