Let\u2019s talk about Serena Williams. You say she is the best female player in the world in the book. McEnroe: Best female player ever \u2014 no question. Garcia-Navarro: Some wouldn\u2019t qualify it, some would say she\u2019s the best player in the world. Why qualify it? McEnroe: Oh! Uh, she\u2019s not, you mean, the best player in the world, period? Garcia-Navarro: Yeah, the best tennis player in the world. You know, why say female player? McEnroe: Well because if she was in, if she played the men\u2019s circuit she\u2019d be like 700 in the world. Garcia-Navarro: You think so? McEnroe: Yeah. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think Serena is an incredible player. I do, but the reality of what would happen would be I think something that perhaps it\u2019d be a little higher, perhaps it\u2019d be a little lower. And on a given day, Serena could beat some players. I believe because she\u2019s so incredibly strong mentally that she could overcome some situations where players would choke \u2019cause she\u2019s been in it so many times, so many situations at Wimbledon, The U.S. Open, etc. But if she had to just play the circuit \u2014 the men\u2019s circuit \u2014 that would be an entirely different story.\n\nAs I wrote at the time, it was a pretty \u2018gotcha\u2019 line of questioning from the host. McEnroe repeatedly lavished praise on Serena\u2019s ability but didn\u2019t steer away from the line of questioning above, creating a backlash that Serena responded to on Monday:\n\nDear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based. \u2014 Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017\n\nI've never played anyone ranked \"there\" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir \u2014 Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017\n\nMcEnroe could\u2019ve just left it there, but his tennis player instinct to volley back apparently cropping back up, he did the opposite. McEnroe doubled down on the comment by refusing to apologize.\n\n\"Would you like to apologize?\" \u2014 @NorahODonnell\n\n\"No.\" \u2014 John McEnroe pic.twitter.com/BFN8w2EyfY \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) June 27, 2017\n\nClarified that he didn\u2019t know it would create controversy, and that he didn\u2019t intend to bother Serena during her pregnancy.\n\n\"It wasn't necessary\u2026.
