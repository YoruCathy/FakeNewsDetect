In an interview with Stephen Colbert Tuesday, the two-time Oscar winner updated fans on her father\u2019s health, sharing that he\u2019s doing well after undergoing a lung transplant.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s great, thank you for asking,\u201d she told the late-night host. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest surgery a person can undergo, and I thank all the people who make themselves a donor, it saves lives.\u201d\n\nSwank explained that doctors had \u201cgiven him a short time to live\u201d if he didn\u2019t get the surgery. Now, though, \u201che\u2019s alive and thriving and well. I took three years off to be with him and help him through that life journey.\u201d\n\nSwank first revealed the news about her father\u2019s condition back in 2015, announcing her acting hiatus shortly after his surgery.\n\n\u201cMy dad is living with me,\u201d she told HuffPost Live. \u201cI\u2019m his sole caretaker now.\u201d\n\nThough there were certain job opportunities that she had to pass on, making the choice to care for her father was an easy one, said Swank. \u201cThere is nothing I want to do more other than being with my dad in this time of need. And if it wasn\u2019t me taking care of him, I think I would always look back and regret that opportunity to be able to take care of him and help him through this extraordinary time.\u201d And even when she was taking time away from the screen, Swank kept busy; she launched an athleisure line called Mission Statement in the fall of 2016.\n\nSwank has since gingerly stepped back into the acting world, first by playing a small role in last year\u2019s Steven Soderbergh heist movie, Logan Lucky. She\u2019s currently back on the circuit to promote her new FX series, Trust, about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III. Swank plays his mother, Gail\u2014the same role played by Michelle Williams in 2017\u2019s All the Money in the World\u2014and will appear in 8 of its 10 episodes. Trust, helmed by Danny Boyle, will air on March 25.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d5c423c0f45451fecd62d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-3264763.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab2644fafb7596b1f1a0176/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Olivia-FX-Feud-Battle.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dfc8e3c0f45451fecd3b8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Nell-Scovell-Late-Night-Boys-Club-Lede.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d5c439028ff3af11a1b13/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-492438964.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d5c429028ff3af11a1b11/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-141568033.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab25872d81411654dbdb691/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Late-Night-Mocks-Trump-Putin-Call.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta", "Yohana Dest", "Nell Scovel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/hilary-swank-acting-hiatus-three-years-father-lung-transplant", "title": "Why Hilary Swank Took Three Years Off from Hollywood", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.", "id": "5ab266fcb15b4b643f115abf", "keywords": "movies,hillary swank,stephen colbert,trust,fx,danny boyle", "news_keywords": "movies,hillary swank,stephen colbert,trust,fx,danny boyle", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ab266fcb15b4b643f115abf", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Why Hilary Swank Took Three Years Off from Hollywood", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/hilary-swank-acting-hiatus-three-years-father-lung-transplant"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Why Hilary Swank Took Three Years Off from Hollywood"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGD3Qvb04gc"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
