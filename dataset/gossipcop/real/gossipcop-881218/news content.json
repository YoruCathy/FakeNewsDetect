But they can also be quite elegant, and few things feel as good to wear. My main rule with these materials is to play it relatively straight: velvet in particular makes enough of a statement on its own, so you don\u2019t want to get too tricky with it. This dress is so feminine, but at the same time nicely streamlined.\n\nA black blazer looks nice and rich.\n\nIf I still worked in an office, I\u2019d be all over this dress.\n\nThis tee is the lightest, lightest lavender, and hangs so nicely.\n\nA dress for throwing on when comfort is the priority. It\u2019d look amazing with leather leggings.\n\nHere\u2019s pencil skirt with nice clean lines.\n\nThis tank worn with your most beaten-up jeans would be aces.\n\nA blouse that\u2019s ladylike without being prissy, which is nice.\n\nVelvet on shoes can be disastrous, but if the color is good enough, as it is here, they can really add a lot to an outfit.\n\nThis blazer is just such a good green.\n\nI like the dressed-up feel of these Tretorns.\n\nThe kind of tee that goes into high rotation as soon as it reaches your closet.\n\nGrey velvet jeans are nicely sophisticated.\n\nI adore this vest, and so wish I had the nerve to try and pull off a vest.\n\nJust a very simple top that could easily be dressed up or down.\n\nThe choker collar here is really sexy.\n\nAnd why not a velour hoodie?", "images": ["https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-1.00.50-PM.png", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-tee.jpeg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bambi-e1583611858972-150x150.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-jeans.jpeg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/frame-velvet.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kim-france.0.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-tretorns.jpeg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/kim.png", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-plus.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-dress.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/wren-150x150.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-1.12.20-PM.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ganni-top-e1582675091401-150x150.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-top.jpeg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/logo.png", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/fisher-dress.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velour-hoodie.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-12.58.49-PM.png", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/maje-dress.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-.jpeg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-skirt.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/choker-collar.jpg", "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/green-blazer.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-dress.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dana D", "Sarah K"], "canonical_link": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/fashion/velvet-and-velour-womens-clothing-is-having-a-moment/", "title": "Velvet and velour are having quite a moment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Velvet and velour are having quite a moment, on Girls of a Certain Age\u2014two materials that can skew really elegant if you choose the right pieces.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Velvet and velour are having quite a moment - Girls of a Certain Age", "description": "Velvet and velour are having quite a moment, on Girls of a Certain Age\u2014two materials that can skew really elegant if you choose the right pieces.", "url": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/fashion/velvet-and-velour-womens-clothing-is-having-a-moment/", "site_name": "Girls of a Certain Age", "updated_time": "2018-07-16T12:54:17+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-dress.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-dress.jpg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/girlsofacertainage/", "section": "Fashion", "published_time": "2017-10-05T11:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-16T12:54:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Velvet and velour are having quite a moment, on Girls of a Certain Age\u2014two materials that can skew really elegant if you choose the right pieces.", "title": "Velvet and velour are having quite a moment - Girls of a Certain Age", "image": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/velvet-dress.jpg", "creator": "@kimfrancenyc"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/favicon-1-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507201225.0, "source": "https://www.girlsofacertainage.com", "summary": ""}
