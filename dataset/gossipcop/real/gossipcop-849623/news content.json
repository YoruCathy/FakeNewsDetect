The couple has also announced that they will continue to work together on their HGTV show Flip or Flop, which will only add to their hefty bank accounts. So just how much is Tarek El Moussa worth?\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Tarek had a net worth of $4 million while he was married to Christina, and The Huffington Post also noted that the couple's net worth was $4 million. While his accountant is the only one to know for sure, it would be safe to bet that he is still doing just fine financially after the divorce. Based on what they've made together on the show and his profits from his house flipping business, it's certainly no surprise to see Tarek has made so much over the years\u2014but it wasn't always like that for the couple.\n\nIn 2008, after the housing market crash, the then-couple had to move out of their lush house and move into a $700-per-month apartment to stay afloat, according to The Ocean County Register. They continued to work on their business and in 2011, Tarek and a close friend rented a video camera and filmed their own audition tape for an HGTV show. The video worked, and the El Moussas had their first season of 13 episodes OF Flip or Flop ordered.\n\nOn top of the money that they made from flipping the houses and selling them, the couple also made $10,000 per episode, according to The Ocean County Register. They are also co-producers on Chi-Town Flip, a Flip or Flop spin-off that takes follows husband and wife Bryan and Maria Segal in Chicago, Deadline notes.\n\n\n\nAfter the divorce, Tarek purchased a 3,010-square-foot home for $2.28 million. He also recently rebranded his realtor business, Tarek & Associates, according to Realtor.com, where he continues to buy properties and flip them. He said that although Christina's name is not on the business anymore, he will still continue to work with her. Despite their split, the former power couple is certainly keeping the money rolling in.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/christina-tarek-el-moussa-house-1521820918.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.905xh;0,0.0231xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/08/1600x800/1487717015-landscape-1487697645-tarek-and-christina-el-moussa.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-house-tour-1533248923.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tamara Fuentes", "Entertainment Editor", "Tamara Fuentes Is The Entertainment Editor For Seventeen", "Covers Celebrity News", "Pop Culture", "Television", "Movies", "Music"], "canonical_link": "https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a19864327/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth/", "title": "What is Tarek El Moussa's Net Worth?", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Country Living", "title": "What is Tarek El Moussa's Net Worth?", "description": "Find out how much money the Flip or Flop star really makes.", "url": "https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a19864327/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 165119423553230, "pages": 12013348247}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CountryLiving", "modified_time": "2018-04-20 09:57:18", "published_time": "2018-04-20 09:57:00", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CountryLiving", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "y2umrM2fg1eXvnoHVUyHzeVTDYfhwLzq_rWVXkg0Yhw", "title": "How Much Is 'Flip or Flop' Star Tarek El Moussa Worth?", "description": "Find out how much money 'Flip or Flop' star Tarek El Moussa really makes since his divorce from Christina El Moussa.", "keywords": "tarek el moussa net worth, tarek el moussa money, flip or flop, christina el moussa, tarek el moussa worth, tarek el moussa salary, flip or flop salary", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Country Life,life,entertainment,Tarek El Moussa,Flip or Flop", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-20T21:57:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/tarek-el-moussa-net-worth-1524261151.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "What is Tarek El Moussa's Net Worth?", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524189420.0, "source": "https://www.countryliving.com", "summary": ""}
