In our four-year history of working together on this incredible show, these accusations have NEVER been revealed or discussed directly with me or anyone at Amazon. Therefore, I can only surmise that the investigation against me was deeply flawed and biased toward the toxic politicized atmosphere that afflicted our set,\u201d he added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amber Tamblyn Defends Husband David Cross Amid Allegation of Racism: \u2018He Said He Was Sorry\u2019\n\nHe continued, \u201cAs I have consistently stated, I deeply regret if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone and I will continue to vehemently defend myself.
