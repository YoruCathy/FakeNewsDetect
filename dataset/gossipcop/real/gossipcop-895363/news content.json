Pink is tired of the fake beef people are trying to create between her and Christina Aguilera. It all started on Sunday night when the \u201cBeautiful Trauma\u201d singer was spotted in the audience at the 2017 American Music Awards.\n\nDuring Aguilera\u2019s tribute to Whitney Houston, Pink appeared to have a slightly pained look. Viewers quickly jumped on the moment, but failed to notice future cut backs to Pink in which she was smiling, in tears, and clapping enthusiastically.\n\nAfter praising Xtina\u2019s performance on Twitter the night of the show, Pink even further clarified her thoughts on Monday in a series of supportive tweets.\n\nLast night was about honoring first responders, singing with one of the greatest voices I have ever heard @kelly_clarkson, and pushing myself to do something I was afraid of and everyone thought was impossible. I scaled a building. While singing live. \u2014 P!nk (@Pink) November 21, 2017\n\n\u201cLast night was about honoring first responders, singing with one of the greatest voices I have ever heard @kelly_clarkson, and pushing myself to do something I was afraid of and everyone thought was impossible. I scaled a building. While singing live,\u201d the acrobatic singer said.\n\nBut Pink was upset that more people seemed to focus on her reaction shot than on the hard work of the show\u2019s performers.\n\nWaking up to see a newly created riff between myself and another incredible woman, Christina, who took on an incredible feat, who I support fully, makes me so sad. You all perpetuate keeping women apart b/c you're afraid of the power we have when we get together. \u2014 P!nk (@Pink) November 21, 2017\n\n\u201cWaking up to see a newly created riff between myself and another incredible woman, Christina, who took on an incredible feat, who I support fully, makes me so sad,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou all perpetuate keeping women apart b/c you're afraid of the power we have when we get together.\u201d\n\nShe concluded her explanation by adding, \u201cI choose to remember last night as being a celebration of women, of Diana, of Whitney, of love and life and joy and all things good. THANKYOU to everyone that had the courage to take that stage- whether it be right side up or sideways. All love.\u201d\n\nI choose to remember last night as being a celebration of women, of Diana, of Whitney, of love and life and joy and all things good.

In October, Pink told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live that she had collaborated with Xtina on a new song, years after their real-life feud ended.\n\nWatch the clip below for more from the 2017 AMAs!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMORE: Pink Praises Christina Aguilera After AMAs Cameras Catch Her Making a Face During Whitney Houston Tribute\n\nMORE: Christina Aguilera Honors Whitney Houston With Emotional American Music Awards Performance\n\nMORE: Pink Claims Christina Aguilera Tried to Punch Her in a Club, Hints They've Collaborated Since Settling Feud\n\nChristina Aguilera Pays Tribute to Whitney Houston With Powerful 'Bodyguard' Medley at 2017 AMAs This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
