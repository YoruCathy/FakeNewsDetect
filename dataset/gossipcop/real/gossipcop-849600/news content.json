I love my children more than anything in the world. But like a lot of women, I too struggled with postpartum depression after my first baby was born,\u201d Gellar, 40, wrote.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

Chrissy Teigen did so earlier this year in a personal essay published by Glamour.\n\nThe model and TV host, who has a 1-year-old daughter, Luna, with husband John Legend, wrote, \u201c(P)ostpartum does not discriminate. I couldn\u2019t control it. And that\u2019s part of the reason it took me so long to speak up: I felt selfish, icky, and weird saying aloud that I\u2019m struggling. Sometimes I still do.\u201d\n\nLast fall, Grammy-winning singer Adele discussed with Vanity Fair her own struggle with postpartum depression after she welcomed her son, Angelo, in 2012.\n\n\u201cI had really bad postpartum depression after I had my son, and it frightened me,\u201d she said, adding that it had left her feeling \u201cvery inadequate.\u201d\n\nRELATED", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_19/1213298/sarah-michelle-gellar-today-170509-tease_045ba0ecd9aa3d023400cd8a658e97bd.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_19/1213298/sarah-michelle-gellar-today-170509-tease_045ba0ecd9aa3d023400cd8a658e97bd.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/parents/sarah-michelle-gellar-reveals-struggle-postpartum-depression-t111369", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar reveals struggle with postpartum depression", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/parents/sarah-michelle-gellar-reveals-struggle-postpartum-depression-t111369", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar reveals struggle with postpartum depression", "description": "The former \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" star wrote that she struggled with postpartum depression following the birth of her now-7-year-old daughter, Charlotte Grace Prinze.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_19/1213298/sarah-michelle-gellar-today-170509-tease_045ba0ecd9aa3d023400cd8a658e97bd.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_19/1213298/sarah-michelle-gellar-today-170509-tease_045ba0ecd9aa3d023400cd8a658e97bd.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_19/1213298/sarah-michelle-gellar-today-170509-tease_045ba0ecd9aa3d023400cd8a658e97bd.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar reveals struggle with postpartum depression", "description": "The former \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" star wrote that she struggled with postpartum depression following the birth of her now-7-year-old daughter, Charlotte Grace Prinze.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" star wrote that she struggled with postpartum depression following the birth of her now-7-year-old daughter, Charlotte Grace Prinze.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_19/1213298/sarah-michelle-gellar-today-170509-tease_045ba0ecd9aa3d023400cd8a658e97bd.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494365940.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
