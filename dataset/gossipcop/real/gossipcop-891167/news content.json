HollywoodLife.com has an EXCLUSIVE preview of the Nov. 5 episode. Nicole is all about wedding planning, but Larry is really feeling the pressure.\n\nAfter 5 years of being together, Nicole Williams, 31, is beyond ready to plan her wedding to NFL player Larry English, 31. She wants to go all-out for her dream wedding. She starts talking to Larry about a bridal shower, bachelorette, bachelor, and an engagement party all before the wedding even happens. \u201cI don\u2019t remember going to all these different, separate things for the wedding,\u201d Larry says to Nicole. Larry\u2019s getting a little stressed, to say the least. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to like sit and plan yet another thing to attach to the whole wedding,\u201d he continues.\n\nNicole gets a little peeved about Larry\u2019s words about wedding planning. He\u2019s put the ring on it, and he thinks Nicole should handle the rest. But Nicole is not letting him get out of wedding planning. She starts to tell him about how she wants all the wedding guests to wear black. She also doesn\u2019t want to do vows and wonders if they should have vegan options on the reception. \u201cAll the pressure and all the decision-making is basically on me, and it would just be nice if I could have more of Larry\u2019s help because I just can\u2019t handle stress very well,\u201d Nicole says.\n\nWAGS LA returns for a third season with new faces Amber Nichole Miller, Dominique Penn, and Michelle Quick on Sunday, November 5th at 10p ET/PT. This is the synopsis for season 3: Sasha Gates also prepares for big changes as she relocates her family permanently with the Chargers move to LA. Meanwhile, Autumn Ajirotutu struggles to repair severed ties within the group, and officially single, Natalie Halcro and Olivia Pierson are haunted by their romantic pasts and uncover fractured friendships of their own. Barbie Blank\u2019s friendship with model/actress Amber Nichole Miller (girlfriend to former MMA Light Heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz) continues to develop despite Amber\u2019s growing tensions with the rest of the ladies. Additionally, self-proclaimed \u201cmomprenuer\u201d Dominique Penn (married to offensive lineman Donald Penn) tries to navigate the rocky relationship between her close friends Autumn and Sasha, as Michelle Quick (wife of wide receiver Brian Quick) transitions her family from LA to Washington following the latest trade announcements.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you excited for the new season of WAGS LA?
