The Views rapper walked hand-in-hand with Rosalyn \u201cRos\u201d Gold-Onwude as his date for the inaugural event which will honor the best players in basketball.\n\nWhile it may be possible that they\u2019re dating, we\u2019re fairly sure they\u2019re not. At this point, it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s a \u201cprofessional\u201d relationship.\n\nHowever, what we do know for sure is that the hip-hop star started hanging out with Ros almost two years ago.\n\nBack in 2015, Drake was cuddling up to the reporter after the Toronto Raptors lost to the Golden State Warriors who the beauty has been a sideline broadcaster for since the 2014-2015 season.\n\nIn his Instagram throwback, he wrote, \u201cwhen the post game makes you forget about what happened during the actual game.\u201d\n\nWhen the post game makes you forget about what happened during the actual game @rosgo21 ? A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Dec 8, 2015 at 7:39am PST\n\nRos and Drake will get along considering she knows what she\u2019s talking about when it comes to basketball.\n\nShe was even honored as the Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year while playing for Stanford University up until 2008.\n\nDrake obviously loves the sport himself; the Hotline Bling rapper serves as the \u201cglobal ambassador\u201d for the Toronto Raptors.\n\nIf that\u2019s not all, the pair even shares Jewish backgrounds where they both have close relationships with their parents.\n\nIn 2015, the journalist revealed that her mother\u2019s constant worrying was a factor in all of her achievements in life.\n\nShe explained, \u201cBut that\u2019s the reason why I think I\u2019m able to have success. She was so engaged with making sure I got on the right path.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRos and Drake must get alone considering we all know how Drake loves his mother. Will the couple get together in the future, let\u2019s hope so! For now, we just have to wait and see!", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lil-Wayne-Nicki-Minaj-Remy-Ma-NBA-Awards-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Drake-Adonis-Brussaux-50-Cent-Porsha-Williams-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drake-e1498533952794.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Drake-RapBasement.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BeyoncC3A9_16_9_1584091346-300x166.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rihanna-New-Album-Coming-Soon-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Drake-e1498533952794.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/drake-brings-basketball-reporter-rosalyn-gold-onwude-as-his-date-to-the-2017-nba-awards-47056/", "title": "Drake Brings Basketball Reporter Rosalyn Gold-Onwude As His Date To The 2017 NBA Awards", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "drake, Rosalyn Gold-Onwude,", "keywords": "celebrity news, drake, Rosalyn Gold-Onwude,", "description": "Drake is hosting the 2017 NBA Awards in New York City tonight, and you know that the Champagne Papi wouldn't show up alone.
