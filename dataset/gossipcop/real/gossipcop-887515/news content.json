(Through a spokesperson, Weinstein has repeatedly denied \"any allegations of non-consensual sex.\")\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to six sex crime charges in New York, including two counts of rape.\n\nWeinstein remains under investigation by authorities in Los Angeles and London.\n\nThe stories about Weinstein's alleged mistreatment snowballed into a movement against abuse that reverberated across industries.\n\nTo date, thousands of people have raised their voices to say, \"me too.\" Dozens of once powerful men -- from celebrities to political figures -- have been held accountable for mistreatment. Many continue to vehemently fight charges of misconduct.\n\nOne year later, the movement to end mistreatment is larger, stronger and more vocal than ever, with the hope being that at least one industry will never be the same.\n\nBelow is a timeline of some of the fallout since the Weinstein scandal began.\n\nOctober 5\n\nThe New York Times publishes a story detailing numerous accusations of sexual harassment against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. One of Weinstein's accusers is actress Ashley Judd.\n\n\"Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it's simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly,\" Judd told the Times.\n\nIn response, Weinstein issues a statement and announces his leave of absence from The Weinstein Company.\n\n\"I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it,\" the statement read in part.\n\nOctober 8\n\nWeinstein is fired by The Weinstein Company, which he co-founded with his brother Bob in 2005. The board cites \"new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days\" as the reason for his termination.\n\nOctober 10\n\nWeinstein is accused of rape by multiple women in an explosive story by Ronan Farrow for The New Yorker.\n\nThe story, 10 months in the making, also included new allegations of harassment and other improper behavior -- along with assertions that people at Weinstein's film company knew about his misconduct.\n\nLater that day, The New York Times publishes a followup story with quotes from Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and other Hollywood actresses with allegations against Weinstein.\n\nWeinstein issues his first of what would be several denials of \"non-consensual sex.\"\n\nOctober 14\n\nIn a statement, the Academy said the action was intended \"not simply to separate ourselves from someone who does not merit the respect of his colleagues but also to send a message that the era of willful ignorance and shameful complicity in sexually predatory behavior and workplace harassment in our industry is over.\"\n\nIn the coming weeks, the Directors Guild of America, the Producers Guild of America and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts would all take steps to distance themselves from Weinstein.\n\nOctober 15\n\nAlyssa Milano tweets a note reading, \"Suggested by a friend: If all the women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote 'Me too' as a status, we might give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.\" #MeToo, created more than a decade earlier by civil rights activist Tarana Burke to increase awareness of the sexual abuse of young women of color, becomes a viral campaign.\n\nOctober 19\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department opens an investigation into an alleged 2013 sexual assault involving Weinstein and an accuser who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nLaw enforcement in London and New York also investigate alleged sex crimes by Weinstein.\n\nOctober 25\n\n\"Game Change\" co-author and journalist Mark Halperin is accused of sexual harassment by former female colleagues at ABC News.\n\n\"During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me,\" Halperin said in a statement to CNN.\n\nJUST WATCHED Mark Halperin apologizes after sexual harassment claims Replay More Videos ...

For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation.\"\n\nNBC News, where Halperin was a contributor, would cut ties with him days later.\n\nOctober 29\n\nActor Anthony Rapp accuses Kevin Spacey of making a sexual advance at him when Rapp was 14 in a report published by Buzzfeed. Spacey responds via Twitter, saying he did not recall the alleged incident with Rapp. He apologizes for what he said would have been \"deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\"\n\nKevin Spacey\n\nSpacey was fired from his television series, \"House of Cards,\" and has not spoken publicly since.\n\nNovember 1\n\nDirector and producer Brett Ratner is accused of sexual misconduct by Olivia Munn and five other women in a report published by The Los Angeles Times. The allegations range from sexual harassment to assault.\n\nRatner's attorney Martin Singer says the director \"vehemently denies\" the allegations.\n\nNovember 9\n\nComedian Louis C.K. is accused of sexual misconduct by five women in a New York Times report, including allegations that he masturbated in front of them.\n\nLouis C.K.\n\nNovember 10\n\n\"These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was okay because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true,\" the comedian wrote. \"But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn't a question. It's a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly.\"\n\nIn August , the comedian performed his first stand-up set since the allegations first surfaced.\n\nNovember 21\n\nCBS and PBS cuts ties with host Charlie Rose after The Washington Post publishes claims of sexual harassment by eight women.\n\nBloomberg, which aired Rose's eponymous interview program, also ended its business relationship with Rose.\n\nRose said in a statement that he \"deeply apologized\" for what he admitted was \"inappropriate behavior,\" but said he did \"not believe that all of [the] allegations are accurate.\"\n\nIn December, PBS gave CNN's Christiane Amanpour her own show as an interim replacement for Rose.\n\nNovember 29\n\n\"I've been fired over a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard,\" Keillor said in a statement. \"It's some sort of poetic irony to be knocked off the air by a story, having told so many of them myself, but I'm 75 and don't have any interest in arguing about this.\"\n\nOn the same day, Savannah Guthrie announces on the \"Today\" show that Matt Lauer has been fired by NBC News after an employee filed a complaint about \"inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace,\" according to the network.\n\n\"We are devastated,\" Guthrie said.\n\nNovember 30\n\nA day after he is fired, Matt Lauer issues an apology.\n\n\"There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\" Lauer said in a statement provided to CNN. \"Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.\"\n\nMatt Lauer\n\nOn the same day, Russell Simmons announces he is stepping down from his companies in the wake of an accusation of harassment and sexual assault by screenwriter Jenny Lumet in a guest column published by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\"I know Jenny and her family and have seen her several times over the years since the evening she described. While her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real,\" Simmons writes in a statement. \"While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely and humbly apologize.\"\n\nDecember 6\n\nTime magazine names \"The Silence Breakers,\" representing people who came forward to report sexual misconduct, as its Person of the Year.\n\n\"These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day,\" read an excerpt from the piece. \"Their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.\"\n\nTime's 2017 'Person of the Year' cover\n\nDecember 7\n\nDemocratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota resigns from Congress following allegations of sexual harassment.\n\n\"I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office,\" Franken says in his resignation speech.\n\nFranken had previously said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed.\"\n\nDecember 11\n\nCelebrity chef Mario Batali steps away from his restaurant business and ABC television show amid allegations of sexual misconduct, following an investigation by online publication Eater.\n\nBatali issues an apology to \"the people I have mistreated and hurt.\"\n\n\"That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses,\" he says. \"I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.\"\n\nMario Batali\n\nJanuary 1\n\nA group of more than 1,000 women in entertainment announce the launch of Time's Up , a comprehensive plan to combat sexual assault, harassment and inequality in the workplace. Director Ava DuVernay, producer Kathleen Kennedy and dozens of actors, including America Ferrera, Emma Stone and Constance Wu, outline the mission of Time's Up in an open letter.\n\n\"We want all survivors of sexual harassment, everywhere, to be heard, to be believed, and to know that accountability is possible,\" the letter read in part.\n\nJanuary 7\n\nBlack dresses rule the red carpet at the 75th Golden Globe Awards in a show of solidarity for the Time's Up mission.\n\nOprah Winfrey accepts the Cecil B.

They knew how pervasive it was. And yet they did nothing.\"\n\nFebruary 17\n\nThe Weinstein Company terminates David Glasser , a top executive who had been in charge of running the studio along with Harvey and Bob Weinstein.\n\nGlasser was fired in response to some of the allegations contained in Schneiderman's lawsuit, sources told CNN.\n\nGlasser responds with a wrongful termination claim. In a February statement to Variety, his attorney Eve Wagner said \"the board had no grounds to justify his firing.\"\n\n\"Through this lawsuit, we intend to bring to light facts and evidence to demonstrate that the board acted precipitously and with malice.

And I've never been one of those people who obsesses about where someone is.\"\n\nMay 24\n\nActor Morgan Freeman is accused by eight women of engaging in a pattern of alleged inappropriate behavior and harassment in a CNN investigation.\n\nSeveral of the women CNN spoke to said Freeman made frequent comments about their bodies and clothing in incidents that took place on movie sets or at his production company, Revelations Entertainment. Two of those eight said they were subjected to unwanted touching by the actor.\n\nAfter the publication of CNN's story, Freeman released a statement.\n\n\"Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,\" he said. \"I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected -- that was never my intent.\"\n\nMay 25\n\nWeinstein turns himself in to authorities and is arrested, charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.\n\nThe charges stem from incidents with two separate women, the NYPD says in a statement, and were the result of a joint investigation between police and the Manhattan District Attorney's office.\n\nHarvey Weinstein's attorney Benjamin Brafman tells media outside of court in New York that his client intends to enter a plea of not guilty.\n\n\"Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone.
