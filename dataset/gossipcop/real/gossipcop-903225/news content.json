Yeah, it\u2019s pretty sick.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be real, a ring that size and worth that much money would obviously get a ton of publicity.\n\nParis Hilton is taking a break from wearing the ring\n\nSince news of her split from Chris Zylka, Hilton has opted out of wearing the ring for some time.\n\nOne week after the split, the heiress was spotted in Australia posing with her wedding finger bare. After flashing the rock for ten-months, Hilton is giving her wedding finger a break since we\u2019re pretty sure 20-carat rings are a little bit on the heavy side (I personally wouldn\u2019t know).\n\nHilton called off her engagement\n\nNews of Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka\u2019s split broke headlines back in November.\n\nAfter posting the news of their breakup on Instagram, Hilton appeared on the daytime talk show, The Talk, and discussed the reasoning behind ending her relationship with Zylka by stating, \u201cWhen I fall in love, I fall in love fast and hard, and it was this whirlwind romance,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been obsessed with Disney stories and love stories, and I thought it was gonna be my happy ending, and I just realized after time that it wasn\u2019t the right decision.\u201d\n\nParis Hilton and Chris Zylka | Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Maddox Gallery Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka | Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for Maddox Gallery\n\nWith all of the talk surrounding their breakup, Chris Zylka has been said to want the ring back but hasn\u2019t spoken to Hilton since their split (AWKWARD).\n\nThe pair got engaged while on a ski trip in Aspen. The actor popped the question while he and his lady love were on top of a snowy mountain. The whole thing was captured on video, which in turn went viral in a matter of minutes.\n\nThe now-deleted Instagram video made us start to believe in love again, but that dream was short lived.\n\nThere is no bad blood between the two\n\nEven though Zylka and Hilton have not spoken to each other since the split, Hilton wishes all the best to her ex-fianc\u00e9.\n\nFor the time being, Paris Hilton is focusing on herself and her career. Since calling off the engagement, Hilton has been busy raking in her funds with club appearances and DJing.\n\nThe heiress has been leaning on her family since the breakup and they are planning to spend this holiday season in Aspen. Let\u2019s just hope they don\u2019t accidentally stumble upon Hilton\u2019s engagement spot.", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/paris-hilton-diamond-640x462.jpg?x62514", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-engagement-ring-640x427.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-engagement-ring-640x427.jpg?x62514", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-chris-zylka-640x427.jpg?x62514"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-engagement-ring-640x427.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bre Williams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-is-keeping-her-2-million-engagement-ring-diamonds-are-a-girls-best-friend.html/", "title": "Paris Hilton Is Keeping Her $2 Million Engagement Ring: \u2018Diamonds Are A Girl\u2019s Best Friend\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-is-keeping-her-2-million-engagement-ring-diamonds-are-a-girls-best-friend.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Makes sense why Paris Hilton is refusing to part ways with her $2.2 million ring, men come and go but diamonds are forever!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Paris Hilton Is Keeping Her $2 Million Engagement Ring: 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'", "description": "Makes sense why Paris Hilton is refusing to part ways with her $2.2 million ring, men come and go but diamonds are forever!", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/paris-hilton-is-keeping-her-2-million-engagement-ring-diamonds-are-a-girls-best-friend.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-engagement-ring-640x427.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-engagement-ring-640x427.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "Paris Hilton", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-12-20T17:05:46-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Makes sense why Paris Hilton is refusing to part ways with her $2.2 million ring, men come and go but diamonds are forever!", "title": "Paris Hilton Is Keeping Her $2 Million Engagement Ring: 'Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend'", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/paris-hilton-engagement-ring-640x427.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545343546.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
