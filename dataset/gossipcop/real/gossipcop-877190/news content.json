It\u2019s been a trend since day one, and it was further amplified with the debut of the newest Bachelorette season, where our leading lady, Becca Kufrin, got seduced by suitors with esteemed titles such as \u201csocial media participant\u201d and \u201ccolognoisseur.\u201d What exactly do these entail?
