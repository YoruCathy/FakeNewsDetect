In the opening song, \u201cKill Jay-Z,\u201d the musician referenced his reported cheating on Beyonc\u00e9, rapping, \u201cYou almost went Eric Ben\u00e9t / Let the baddest girl in the world get away / I don\u2019t even know what else to say / N\u2014a, never go Eric Ben\u00e9t.\u201d\n\nThe line is notably a nod to when Ben\u00e9t was unfaithful to his then-wife, Halle Berry, in the early 2000s. The two were married in 2001, separated by 2003, and their divorce was finalized in 2005.\n\nBen\u00e9t aptly responded to the name-drop on Twitter Friday morning, writing, \u201cHey yo [Jay-Z]! Just so ya know, I got the baddest girl in the world as my wife\u2026 like right now!\u201d\n\nBen\u00e9t was referring to Manuela Testolini, who he\u2019s been married to since 2011.\n\nHey yo #Jayz!

/ A man who don\u2019t take care of his family can\u2019t be rich.\u201d\n\nJay-Z\u2019s entire 10-song album dropped exclusively on Tidal in partnership with Sprint on Friday.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2Feric-benet-jay-z-444-name-drop-1202484335%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202484335&comment_count=2", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/eric-benet-jay-z.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/eric-benet-jay-z.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/eric-benet-jay-z-444-name-drop-1202484335/", "title": "Eric Ben\u00e9t Responds to Name-Drop on Jay-Z\u2019s \u20184:44\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Eric Ben\u00e9t took to Twitter to defend himself after Jay-Z name-dropped him on his newly released \"4:44\" album, which dropped on Tidal Friday.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202484335, "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-06-30T11:46:15"}, "pmc-tag": "4:44,Jay Z", "title": "Eric Ben\u00e9t Responds to Name-Drop on Jay-Z\u2019s \u20184:44\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "music", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "music", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Eric Ben\u00e9t Responds to Name-Drop on Jay-Z\u2019s \u20184:44\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/eric-benet-jay-z-444-name-drop-1202484335/", "description": "Jay-Z alluded to a number of revelations in his newly dropped album, \u201c4:44\u201d \u2014 his beef with Kanye West, the Oscars envelope-gate,\u00a0and his alleged infidelity with \u201cBecky with\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/eric-benet-jay-z.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Eric Benet Jay Z"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-30T18:46:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-30T21:31:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@rebeccaarubin", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "Eric Ben\u00e9t Responds to Name-Drop on Jay-Z\u2019s \u20184:44\u2019"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/eric-benet-jay-z.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "Eric Benet Jay Z"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Eric Ben\u00e9t Responds to Name-Drop on Jay-Z\u2019s \u20184:44\u2019", "description": "Eric Ben\u00e9t took to Twitter to defend himself after Jay-Z name-dropped him on his newly released \"4:44\" album, which dropped on Tidal Friday."}, "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202484335, "title": "Eric Ben\u00e9t Responds to Name-Drop on Jay-Z's '4:44'", "published_at": "2017-06-30 11:46:15", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/eric-benet-jay-z.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 2, "tags": "Jay Z", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "Jay-Z alluded to a number of revelations in his newly dropped album, \"4:44\" -- his beef with Kanye West, the Oscars envelope-gate,\u00a0and his alleged infidelity with \"Becky with the good hair.\"\r\n\r\nAt least one person wasn't so thrilled with how he addressed that last one.
