After Madison self-eliminated at the end of season 24, telling Peter she could no longer trust him once he admitted he'd been intimate with contestants Hannah Ann and Victoria Fuller in the Fantasy Suite, he chose to propose to the last woman standing, Hannah Ann, after much soul-searching on both of their parts.\n\nFast-forward to After the Final Rose, when viewers learned Peter and Hannah Ann broke off their engagement one month after filming the finale \u2014 in large part due to his lingering feelings for Madison (despite his family's pleas to pursue Hannah Ann). Madison appeared on After the Finale Rose, as well, and the pair decided to slowly give their relationship a go.\n\nTwo days later, the pair announced that they were ending their relationship. Peter wrote on Instagram \"Madi and I have mutually decided to not pursue our relationship any further. Believe me this was not easy for either of us to be ok with, but after a lot of honest conversations, we have agreed that this is what makes most sense for the two of us. The love and respect I have for Madi will continue to endure.\"\n\nMadison wrote of their relationship on Instagram, \"As Peter and I have decided to go our separate ways, I am confident that we will both move in the direction of our purpose and never forget that God has a plan in all things. I will always love and respect him. I am convinced our paths were meant to cross and we are both better because they did.\"", "images":
