That is when the process will be complete and we will see justice really being served. But until then, this is a great first step.\u201d\n\nFollowing the arrest when Weinstein turned himself in May 25, Sorvino tweeted, \u201cSending love to all my sisters today who stood up against a monster...so many emotions...I am proud of and grateful to you all.\"\n\nWeinstein on Tuesday (June 5) pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyer vowed to beat the case before it goes to trial.\n\nToday\u2019s Savannah Guthrie praised Sorvino for coming forward after holding onto the secret for a long time. \u201cThe funny thing is at the time it happened, I told everyone I knew and a lot of people will tell you that,\u201d said Sorvino. \u201cAll these people wrote to me online, \u2018I remember you telling me about that.\u2019 Quentin Tarantino corroborated that I told him about it right away that September.\u201d\n\nSorvino previously wrote in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter that she believed her romantic relationship with Tarantino stopped further advances from Weinstein. \u201cI was just happy that Quentin was my protector. I think that's why Harvey stopped trying with me because he would never mess with the girlfriend of his star director,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI told everyone I knew. No one said, \u2018Hey, this is sexual harassment. You should go to the authorities. You have a case. You should go to the police. Maybe it\u2019s assault.\u2019 No one said anything like that,\u201d she recalled in the Today interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand the law and I didn\u2019t think I was important enough to make a big enough deal over, I just kind of tried to put it to the side and keep working and go on about my life. And I think a lot of people felt that way.\u201d\n\nSorvino admitted that she was shocked to learn how many women Weinstein had harassed. Had she been aware of the other victims, she is confident that she would have spoken out sooner. \u201cI think we would have found strength in numbers and we would have done something a lot sooner,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I did try to do something at the time, I even spoke to someone at Miramax about it and nothing happened and it kind of went away and I tried to go on with my life.\u201d\n\nFollowing her abuse from Weinstein, Sorvino suspected that she had been blacklisted by him. Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson admitted that he was warned not to work with her because she was believed to be difficult. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what I suspected. I just knew that my career had slumped and I thought, \u2018Well maybe it\u2019s my fault. Maybe I\u2019ve had too many children,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes you have bad luck and I was like, \u2018OK, maybe it wasn\u2019t meant to be that my career was going to continue at the same level that it had been.\u201d\n\nShe said that reading Jackson\u2019s tweet admitting to blacklisting her and actress Ashley Judd based on Weinstein\u2019s influence was a surprise. \u201cIt was like a thunderbolt. It was kind of crazy. I was like, \u2018Oh, so it was really this malevolent hand that changed the course of my life and my professional horizons.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe actress then stated that she is proud of the work she\u2019s done throughout her career and has been blessed with a wonderful family. \u201cAt the end of the day I\u2019m fine with everything, but to know this was done to me rather that it just being fate was kind of world rocking at the time,\u201d she said.\n\nSorvino elaborated on the downfall of her career in the THR column. \u201cI won an Oscar with Miramax. To not continue and star in their movies much past that doesn't make sense. I felt if I had accepted Harvey's advances, I would have continued to make movies with them, and they were the people winning the Oscars for that decade,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was not offered any movie roles past 1996. I was still on the fringes of the Miramax family after that, but once Quentin and I broke up, that was it. Radio silence.\u201d\n\nShe told Guthrie, \u201cRight now I\u2019m really excited to be apart of this movement of #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up and I\u2019m working on promoting legislation in California for bills that are among the strongest anti-sexual harassment legislation in the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRape has been with us forever and if we\u2019re at the cusp of this moment where all of this action, all of this legislation, but also this culture changing where we\u2019re working with children, we\u2019re working with high school students, we\u2019re working with men to change the idea of what being a strong man is and how to not do this to people and for women, for boys and girls to know their rights, then all this will have been worth it in some crazy way,\u201d she said. \u201cIf culture\u2019s gonna change and less people will be sexually assaulted because of this movement and this outcry among millions across the world, then it was all worth it.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nJune 6, 1 p.m. Updated with Weinstein lawyer response.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/nfe_square_383x383/2015/03/writerimage-thr.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/mira_sorvino_on_today__screen_shot-h_2018.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2018/06/mira_sorvino_on_today__screen_shot-h_2018.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/mira_sorvino_on_today__screen_shot-h_2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall", "Thrnews Thr.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mira-sorvino-harvey-weinstein-rape-charges-1117655", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Accuser Mira Sorvino Calls Charges a \"Really Good First Step\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\"It\u2019s him finally facing real, real criminal consequences for his criminal behavior and so for that I feel gratified,\" Mira Sorvino said of rape charges against Harvey Weinstein, whom she accused of sexual misconduct, in an interview on NBC's 'Today' show.", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mira-sorvino-harvey-weinstein-rape-charges-1117655", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Accuser Mira Sorvino Calls Charges a \"Really Good First Step\"", "description": "\"It\u2019s him finally facing real, real criminal consequences for his criminal behavior and so for that I feel gratified,\" said Sorvino.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2018/06/mira_sorvino_on_today__screen_shot-h_2018.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Accuser Mira Sorvino Calls Charges a \"Really Good First Step\"", "description": "\"It\u2019s him finally facing real, real criminal consequences for his criminal behavior and so for that I feel gratified,\" said Sorvino.", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mira-sorvino-harvey-weinstein-rape-charges-1117655", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2018/06/mira_sorvino_on_today__screen_shot-h_2018.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Harvey Weinstein Accuser Mira Sorvino Calls Charges a \"Really Good First Step\"", "sailthru.description": "\"It\u2019s him finally facing real, real criminal consequences for his criminal behavior and so for that I feel gratified,\" said Sorvino.", "sailthru.author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "sailthru.vertical": "Culture", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-06 08:55:52", "sailthru.tags": "Movies,Television,Culture,Harvey Weinstein,Mira Sorvino,nsfs"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528246552.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
