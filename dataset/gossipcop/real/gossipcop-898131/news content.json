As the world knows, Bush lost his NBC \u201cToday\u201d show gig last October after The Washington Post published audio of a 2005 conversation between him and then-\u201cApprentice\u201d host Donald Trump while they were on a bus to film a segment for \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d Trump talked about how he liked to just start kissing beautiful women. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cGrab them by the p\u2011\u2011\u2011y.\u201d Bush laughed throughout the exchange.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBush has been mostly off the grid ever since. However, this week, he kicked off some image rehabilitation with a New York Times op-ed and this appearance on \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d Here are the six main takeaways from the interview \u2014 besides the fact that when Bush walked out onstage, Colbert\u2019s band played a slow-jam rendition of \u201cWheels on the Bus.\u201d\n\n1. Bush really, really hates watching that \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to roll the tape,\u201d Colbert said at the beginning of their conversation.\n\nBush was visibly not thrilled. \u201cCan we make a deal that it\u2019s the last time, or no?\u201d he asked.\n\nThey switched topics, and Bush talked and talked \u2014 and admitted that he was trying to keep Colbert from playing the video.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to air it no matter what,\u201d Colbert assured him, and then played the most-quoted part of the tape. (See above.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOkay, what\u2019s your reaction when you hear that even almost a year and a half later?\u201d Colbert asked after the awkward moment was over.\n\n\u201cThe first time I ever heard it was three days before it leaked. And so it was like a gut punch,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt\u2019s a gut punch now. It will always be.\u201d\n\n2. Bush is still in disbelief that he lost his \u201cToday\u201d show gig.\n\nBush seemed to alternate between anger and incredulity that he lost the job of a lifetime.\n\n\u201cHow do you feel about NBC firing you?\u201d Colbert asked bluntly. \u201cEspecially in light of Matt Lauer being fired for allegations of actual sexual impropriety?\u201d (This was not the only time Bush\u2019s former \u201cToday\u201d colleague came up in the conversation.)\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLook, it was a difficult time. I think it was very hot emotionally in the country,\u201d Bush said. \u201cA lot of people were not comfortable with the man who was close to winning the election, and a lot of things happened quickly.\u201d Bush added that his boss stated, months later, that NBC \u201cmay have moved a little quickly\u201d in forcing his exit.\n\nAD\n\nMostly, Bush said, he wished he could have addressed his \u201cToday\u201d show audience after everything happened. But he was never allowed back on air.\n\nBush seemed most upset as he talked about Trump winning the election and facing no consequences for the tape.\n\n\u201cStephen, it\u2019s an unbelievable irony. The very day that he was swearing in as the 45th president of the United States, I was checking in to this soul-searching retreat in St. Helena, California, nine days off the grid,\u201d Bush said. \u201c\u2026 It was the beginning of me saying, \u2018All right, get up, stop being sorry for yourself, stop worrying about these things. There\u2019s life to live, let\u2019s go, get better \u2014 be a better man, be a better person.\u2019 So I passed the television in the office when I was checking in. He\u2019s got the hand up and I\u2019m going into my little cabin to do the work.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere was a long pause. \u201cTough,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIrony.\u201d\n\n3. Bush also cannot believe that Trump has reportedly been telling people that it\u2019s not his voice on the tape.\n\nBush\u2019s New York Times editorial is titled \u201cYes, Donald Trump, You Said That.\u201d So you can imagine what he thinks of reports that Trump has been privately saying he doesn\u2019t think that it\u2019s his voice on the bus audio.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that. Because I was there, and the last 14 months of my life I have been dealing with it,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou dealt with it for 14 minutes and went on to be the president.\u201d\n\nBush said that Trump\u2019s denial really upset him, particularly after he read an article in which multiple women made allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump.\n\nAD\n\nTONIGHT: After his op-ed in the @NYTimes, Billy Bush stops by #LSSC to reveal why he's speaking out now, and to talk about what really happened on that bus. pic.twitter.com/buSWhph3mJ \u2014 The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) December 5, 2017\n\n\u201cWhen he said this, it infuriated me on the personal front, and then I ended up Googling and I read an article with all of these women\u2019s accounts,\u201d Bush said. \u201c\u2026 As I read these, I said, \u2018Twenty women don\u2019t get together and say, \u2018Hey, you know what would be really fun? Let\u2019s take down a powerful guy together. Haha.\u2019 No, they don\u2019t. And I said, \u2018Okay, you\u2019re reopening wounds on them, too.\u2019 Enough is enough. Stop playing around with people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nColbert also wondered why Trump brought up the subject again. \u201cHim saying that actually brought this particular subject around in conjunction with the cultural moment we\u2019re in now where revelations of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, sexual impropriety are putting new spotlights on the accusations against the president,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cAnd he stuck \u2014 I\u2019m going to say his finger \u2014 in this door hinge by denying this. It\u2019s really the dumbest thing he could have done.\u201d\n\n4. Bush attempted to explain why he laughed along with Trump\u2019s vulgar remarks on the bus.\n\nAD\n\nHe regrets it now. But at the time, \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was a massive hit, and shared a parent company with \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d So a major part of Bush\u2019s job was to bond with Trump. As Bush put it, \u201cEverybody had to sort of kiss the ring a little bit of The Donald because he was making so much money for NBC. \u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was 2005, and his ratings were through the roof and he was the big star of NBC. And I sort of equated what he was saying to some kind of, you know, crass standup act, like an Andrew Dice Clay performance,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou figure, well, that\u2019s not Dice when he\u2019s home, he doesn\u2019t actually do those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the camera wasn\u2019t on him. Why did it seem like a performance to you?\u201d Colbert asked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBecause he was just regaling the seven guys on there and doing this, doing his bit,\u201d Bush said. \u201c\u2026 If I had thought there was a man detailing a sexual assault strategy to me, I would have called the FBI, not just reported it to my executive producer.\u201d\n\n5. Matt Lauer couldn\u2019t save Bush\u2019s job \u2014 yet Bush isn\u2019t mad at him.\n\nBush didn\u2019t have the best start to the \u201cToday\u201d show when he joined in August 2016, as he immediately sparked controversy by defending Ryan Lochte\u2019s fabricated robbery story at the Olympics on-air. Still, as Colbert pointed out, Lauer was an extremely powerful force at \u201cToday\u201d and theoretically could have stepped in to help.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMatt Lauer controlled that show. He could have protected anybody and he did famously protect people from being fired on that show. Do you wish he would have protected you?\u201d Colbert said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe had a conversation about that,\u201d Bush explained. \u201cHe told me that he went privately to the bosses and took that line. And I said I appreciated it, and I accepted it and thanked him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believed he did what he could?\u201d Colbert asked. Bush agreed with that sentiment.\n\n6. Bush says we\u2019re in a cultural moment where \u201cwomen must be believed\u201d about sexual harassment, and the bus tape might have started it all.\n\n\u201cWomen must be believed, and we kind of have to find our way to have the dialogue,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the dialogue isn\u2019t going to be around, because we get on to the next thing, we get on our phones, the next outrage comes. We have to continue it all the way through, and I hope we do that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInterestingly, this particular moment that we\u2019re in hasn\u2019t ended,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt started with Harvey Weinstein, at least the latest iteration of it, and goes on to this moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Bush offered, \u201cthe bus ride was the tip of the iceberg.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nyoE_fo8-G9GVc7QY4WBMH_Dv7k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JLBJF2ELIU545K7ZSSPSNCX5M4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nyoE_fo8-G9GVc7QY4WBMH_Dv7k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JLBJF2ELIU545K7ZSSPSNCX5M4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/05/stephen-colbert-made-billy-bush-watch-the-access-hollywood-tape-and-it-was-awkward/", "title": "Stephen Colbert made Billy Bush watch the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape \u2014 and it was awkward", "meta_data": {"description": "Here are the main takeaways from Bush's interview with Colbert \u2014 and yes, he's still in disbelief that he lost his \"Today\" show job.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/12/05/stephen-colbert-made-billy-bush-watch-the-access-hollywood-tape-and-it-was-awkward/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nyoE_fo8-G9GVc7QY4WBMH_Dv7k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JLBJF2ELIU545K7ZSSPSNCX5M4.jpg", "title": "Stephen Colbert made Billy Bush watch the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape \u2014 and it was awkward", "description": "Here are the main takeaways from Bush's interview with Colbert \u2014 and yes, he's still in disbelief that he lost his \"Today\" show job."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Stephen Colbert made Billy Bush watch the \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape \u2014 and it was awkward", "description": "Here are the main takeaways from Bush's interview with Colbert \u2014 and yes, he's still in disbelief that he lost his \"Today\" show job."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-26T00:24:40.695Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvcIeSfaB3c?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1512403200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
