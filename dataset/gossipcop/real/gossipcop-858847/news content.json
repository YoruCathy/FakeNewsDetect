Allman\u2019s children Devon, Layla and Delilah Island, his niece (and Duane\u2019s daughter) Galadrielle, his lifelong friend Chank Middleton and his manager Michael Lehmen delivered eulogies at the service.\n\nAs requested by Allman\u2019s estate, mourners wore jeans to the funeral instead of suits. Following the private service, hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band\u2019s music, lined the route along the funeral procession to nearby Rose Hill Cemetery, where Allman was buried close to Duane, who died in a 1971 motorcycle accident.\n\nWhile the burial was also private, hundreds of fans gathered on a hill overlooking Allman\u2019s grave while the rocker was taken to his final resting place.\n\nIronically, Allman was scheduled to perform Saturday night at Macon\u2019s Grand Opera House before he canceled his 2017 tour plans as he battled health issues.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the 92-year-old Carter said he would attend Allman\u2019s funeral to \u201cpay his respects\u201d to the singer.\n\n\u201cRosalynn and I were deeply saddened when we learned that Gregg Allman had passed.
