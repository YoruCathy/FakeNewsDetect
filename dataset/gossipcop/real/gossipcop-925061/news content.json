Of course, Darcell didn't get partake.\n\nWe're told the pregnancy announcement was a huge success. Darcell's family wasn't at the show but she immediately texted them a video and they \"freaked out,\" naturally.\n\nCongratulations ... looks like someone already has a Godfather!", "images": ["https://theblast.com/static/theblast/logo.svg", "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//a1h0ZjVTMjBJRE52S2h0MGFaWGguanBn.jpg"], "top_img": "https://img.srgcdn.com/e//a1h0ZjVTMjBJRE52S2h0MGFaWGguanBn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff", "Ryan Naumann", "Mike Walters", "Jeff Mazzeo"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "meta_data": {"mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#f60", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "url": "https://theblast.com/c/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy", "site_name": "The Blast", "description": "Justin Timberlake stopped his concert to help a lucky fan make one of the biggest announcements of her life.
