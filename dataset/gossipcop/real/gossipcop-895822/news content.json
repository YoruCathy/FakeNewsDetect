He had an entire generation of young girls swooning after him, and after his days on TV, he would wow the crowds as he took to the stage. Sadly he met his fate in November 2017. Yet he will always be remembered as a legend. However, his family\u2019s recent decision to not give him a proper send off has shocked the world. What is their reasoning for this? Sad Ending He was only 67 when he died, and his life certainly had its ups and downs. It has taken until now for his family to speak out about what the funeral arrangements are, or shall we say lack of funeral arrangements. But why?\n\nLooming Sadness David Cassidy shot to fame for his role in the beloved show The Partridge Family in the 1970s. This character would change the course of his entire life. He became the archetypal teen idol, with girls fawning over him and sticking his picture on their bedroom walls. But no matter how many girls fell at his feet, and how big his career became he still didn\u2019t seem to be happy.\n\nLoathed The Image In fact, Cassidy actually spent most of his life trying to shed this teen idol image. He longed to be taken seriously as an adult entertainer, but none of his attempts seemed to work. Even way back in 1972, when The Partridge Family was still on air, he posed naked for Rolling Stone magazine. In the corresponding interview he revealed that he was a drug user.\n\nTragedy Looms Sadly, tragedy seemed to follow Cassidy. In 1974 a terrible incident happened to one of his young adoring female fans. When Cassidy performed a show at London\u2019s White City Stadium, a dangerous stampede occurred. Almost 800 concert-goers were badly injured. What\u2019s more, tragically, one fan suffered a heart attack and died in hospital. He never got over this trauma.\n\nDevastation Occurered Cassidy was devastated over the tragic incident. The fan, Bernadette Whelan, had only been 14 years old. Although Whelan\u2019s parents publicly stated that they didn\u2019t blame Cassidy, the singer chose not to go to her funeral service. He was worried that his presence would turn the event, meant to be a private time of mourning, into a media frenzy and he wanted to respect the family.\n\nAnother Tragedy Occurs Just a few years later, another terrible accident occurred. Cassidy\u2019s estranged father, Jack, perished in a house fire. The elder Cassidy was bipolar and an alcoholic, and David hadn\u2019t spoken to him for over a year. In December 1976 Jack returned drunk to his apartment and passed out with a lit cigarette in his hand. The cigarette dropped and set the room on fire, consequently killing him.\n\nA Sign Of Things To Come Sadly, David Cassidy would experience problems with alcohol of his own. As The Partridge Family ended and the years passed by, his substance abuse problems would continue to get worse. He subsequently claimed that by the 1980s he had spent all his money, and he barely saw his daughter Katie, who was brought up by her mother.\n\nLegal Difficulties If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, he began to encounter legal difficulties. Cassidy was even arrested several times for DUIs between 2010 and 2014. Due to this, he was ordered to go to rehab, during which time Cassidy also filed for bankruptcy. In September 2015 he appeared on the British TV show This Morning, but appeared drunk and angrily shouted at the hosts as the audience awkwardly watched.\n\n\n\nBad Behaviour But there was another reason for his agitated behavior. In February 2017 Cassidy made the announcement that he was suffering from dementia, a terrible brain disease that affects people\u2019s ability to function. \u201cI was in denial but a part of me always knew this was coming,\u201d he told People magazine. \u201cI want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I\u2019ve been, without any distractions\u2026 I want to love, I want to enjoy life.\u201d\n\nSad Ending But, sadly, Cassidy didn\u2019t get the chance to live the rest of his days out happily. On November 18, 2017, his liver and kidneys began to pack in and he was admitted to hospital suddenly. He was put into a medically-induced coma for a couple of days, and once he came out of it doctors hoped that they could get him a liver transplant. However, they were too late. Cassidy passed away due to liver failure on November 21.\n\nTribute Members of Cassidy\u2019s family paid public tribute to him. The day after he died, his younger brother Shaun posted a series of tweets and photographs. \u201cThank you for all your love and good wishes for David. It means the world to all of us,\u201d Shaun wrote, before sharing a story.\n\nPublicly Expressing Sadness \u201cWhen I was a little boy and my big brother would come to visit, the first call of business would be a punishing pillow fight,\u201d he wrote of his past. \u201cDuring the battle, he would regale me with hysterical stories of our father, often culminating in his taking a giant leap off my top bunk. I tried to catch him of course. I always tried to catch him. But I never could.\u201d\n\nHeartfelt Words His brother continued to speak of his loss: \u201cNow, I will carry him, along with all of the funny/sad/extraordinary days we shared, none more filled with love than these last few at his side,\u201d he finished. And Cassidy did indeed die with his family at his side. His representative informed E! that \u201cDavid died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long.\u201d\n\nKatie Finally Speaks Out Cassidy\u2019s daughter, actress Katie Cassidy, also broke her silence with a message on Twitter about her father\u2019s death. \u201cWords can\u2019t express the solace our family\u2019s received from all the love & support during this trying time,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy father\u2019s last words were \u2018So much wasted time.\u2019 This will be a daily reminder for me to share my gratitude with those I love as to never waste another minute.\u201d Their feud was publicly squashed with this heartfelt message.\n\n\n\nExploitation Unfortunately, some mean people immediately tried to exploit that incredibly personal moment. In December 2017 CNBC reported that the Cassidy family were taking legal action against bootleggers selling Cassidy T-shirts with \u201cSo much wasted time\u201d emblazoned on them. \u201cPeople don\u2019t even wait until somebody\u2019s cold. It\u2019s like virtual grave robbing,\u201d Cassidy\u2019s ex-wife Sue Shifrin Cassidy said.\n\n\n\nTaking Advantage Of His Death She spoke out stating:\u201dIt\u2019s really bad. It was a private moment, and to have people making money off of that makes me wonder what kind of people have we become,\u201d she added. The family took action and hired an LA lawyer to serve cease-and-desist notices to the illegal merchandisers. On the same subject, Shifrin Cassidy posted on Twitter, \u201cIt is the poorest of taste to see people trying to make money off of our loved one\u2019s death.\u201d\n\n\n\nShock To The World Many people subsequently eulogized Cassidy on social media. But the day after he died, media outlets began reporting that he wouldn\u2019t have a regular funeral. \u201cSources with direct knowledge of the situation tell [us that] in lieu of a burial/funeral, the family is planning a private memorial after the holidays for close friends and relatives to attend,\u201d website The Blast announced.\n\nWhy No Funeral? It was decided that Cassidy would be quietly cremated, by the family. According to The Blast, however, the family did also recognize that many fans wanted to pay their respects to their idol. Therefore, they had plans for a public memorial as well. \u201cWe\u2019re told a time and venue for the public memorial is far-off, but you can bet it will draw a gigantic crowd,\u201d the website stated.\n\nGone But Not Forgotten They wanted a private cremation, similarly to when music megastar David Bowie died in 2016, his family didn\u2019t have a big service, but instead scattered his ashes on the island of Bali. Was this was David wanted though?", "images": ["https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092637/David-Cassidy-4-1024x687.jpg", "https://www.eternallifestyle.com/wp-content/themes/unified/images/logo_v2.png", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092632/David-Cassidy-20-1024x679.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092640/David-Cassidy-5-1024x762.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092617/David-Cassidy-13-1024x782.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092648/David-Cassidy-9-1024x703.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092634/David-Cassidy-3-1024x805.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092615/David-Cassidy-12-1024x732.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092611/David-Cassidy-10-1024x684.jpg", "https://www.eternallifestyle.com/wp-content/themes/unified/images/logo_footer.png", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092645/David-Cassidy-7-1024x746.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092628/David-Cassidy-19-1024x671.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092622/David-Cassidy-16-1024x760.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092630/David-Cassidy-2.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092619/David-Cassidy-14.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=382791848977127&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092641/David-Cassidy-6.jpg", "http://trc.taboola.com/1021215/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092621/David-Cassidy-15-1024x765.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092609/David-Cassidy-1-1024x614.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092613/David-Cassidy-11-1024x740.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092646/David-Cassidy-8-1024x581.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092626/David-Cassidy-18-1024x682.jpg", "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092624/David-Cassidy-17-1024x765.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d1v3t0rdobjdgs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/08092609/David-Cassidy-1-1024x614.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mark Parker", "Bonnie Kaplan", "Elizabeth Bartov", "Becca Bridges", "Brandon Strauss", "Jennifer Hall", "Sandra Moore"], "canonical_link": "https://www.eternallifestyle.com/living/david-cassidys-family-revealed-wont-holding-funeral-hollywood-star/", "title": "David Cassidy\u2019s Family Won\u2019t Be Honoring The Hollywood Star But Why?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "David Cassidy\u2019s Family Won\u2019t Be Honoring The Hollywood Star But Why? | EternalLifestyle", "description": "David Cassidy was a world-famous teen idol.
