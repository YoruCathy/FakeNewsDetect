{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick_career_statistics", "text": "This is a list of the main career statistics of retired professional American tennis player, Andy Roddick. Throughout his career, Roddick won thirty-two ATP singles titles including one grand slam singles title and five ATP Masters 1000 singles titles. He was also the runner-up at the Wimbledon Championships in 2004, 2005 and 2009 and the US Open in 2006, losing on all four occasions to Roger Federer. Roddick was also a four-time semi-finalist at the Australian Open and a three-time semi-finalist at the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals. On November 3, 2003, Roddick became the World No. 1 for the first time in his career.\n\nCareer achievements [ edit ]\n\nRoddick reached his first career Grand Slam singles quarterfinal at the 2001 US Open, where he lost to fourth-seeded Australian and eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt in a five-set thriller 7\u20136, 3\u20136, 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 4\u20136. A year later, he reached his first masters series singles final at the 2002 Rogers Cup, losing in straight sets to Argentine Guillermo Ca\u00f1as. The following year, Roddick reached his first grand slam semi-final at the 2003 Australian Open, where he lost to thirty-first seed Rainer Sch\u00fcttler in four sets, 5\u20137, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 3\u20136. In August, Roddick won his first major singles title at the 2003 Rogers Cup, defeating David Nalbandian in the final in straight sets. Three weeks later, Roddick rallied from two sets and a match point down to defeat Nalbandian in five sets to reach his first Grand Slam singles final at the US Open, where he defeated fourth-seeded Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final in straight sets, 6\u20133, 7\u20136, 6\u20133, to win his first and only Grand Slam singles title to date. Roddick's strong results throughout the year allowed him to qualify for the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals for the first time in his career. He advanced to the semi-finals of the event after victories over Guillermo Coria and Carlos Moy\u00e1 in the round robin stage but lost in straights to then World No. 2 Roger Federer in the semi-finals. Despite the loss, Roddick finished the year as the World No. 1 for the first (and only) time in his career, becoming the first American player to finish a season as World No. 1 since Andre Agassi and the youngest American player to have held the top ranking since computer rankings began in 1973.\n\nIn July 2004, Roddick reached his first Wimbledon final but lost in four sets to then World No. 1, Roger Federer. He reached the final of the event again the following year but once again lost to Federer, this time in straight sets. The following year, Roddick reached his fourth grand slam singles final but once again lost to Federer, this time in the final of the US Open. In 2007, Roddick reached the semi-finals of the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals for the third and final time in his career, losing in straight sets to Spaniard, David Ferrer.\n\nRoddick enjoyed a resurgent year in 2009, during which he reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open for the fourth and final time in his career and the fourth round of the French Open for the first and only time in his career. The highlight of Roddick's year came at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships where he reached his third final at the event and fifth and final grand slam singles final. There, he lost to Federer in a five set thriller. On July 22, 2012, Roddick won his thirty-second and final career singles title at the Atlanta Tennis Championships, defeating Gilles M\u00fcller of Luxembourg in the final in three sets; Roddick won his first career singles title at the same event eleven years prior.\n\nFinals [ edit ]\n\nGrand Slam finals [ edit ]\n\nSingles: 5 finals (1\u20134) [ edit ]\n\nOutcome Year Championship Surface Opponent Score Winner 2003 US Open Hard Juan Carlos Ferrero 6\u20133, 7\u20136(7\u20132), 6\u20133 Runner-up 2004 Wimbledon Grass Roger Federer 6\u20134, 5\u20137, 6\u20137(3\u20137), 4\u20136 Runner-up 2005 Wimbledon Grass 2\u20136, 6\u20137(2\u20137), 4\u20136 Runner-up 2006 US Open Hard 2\u20136, 6\u20134, 5\u20137, 1\u20136 Runner-up 2009 Wimbledon Grass 7\u20135, 6\u20137(6\u20138), 6\u20137(5\u20137), 6\u20133, 14\u201316\n\nMasters Series finals [ edit ]\n\nSingles: 9 finals (5\u20134) [ edit ]\n\nDoubles: 2 finals (1\u20131) [ edit ]\n\nATP career finals [ edit ]\n\nSingles: 52 (32 titles, 20 runner-ups) [ edit ]\n\nLegend Grand Slam Tournaments (1\u20134) Year-End Championships (0\u20130) ATP World Tour Masters 1000 (5\u20134) ATP World Tour 500 Series (5\u20133) ATP World Tour 250 Series (21\u20139) Titles by surface Hard (21\u201315) Clay (5\u20132) Grass (5\u20133) Carpet (1\u20130)\n\nDoubles: 8 (4\u20134) [ edit ]\n\nLegend Grand Slam Tournaments (0\u20130) Year-End Championships (0\u20130) ATP World Tour Masters 1000 (1\u20131) ATP World Tour 500 Series (0\u20131) ATP World Tour 250 Series (3\u20132) Titles by surface Hard (3\u20133) Clay (1\u20131) Grass (0\u20130) Carpet (0\u20130)\n\nATP Challenger Tour career finals [ edit ]\n\nSingles: 4 (3 titles, 1 runner-up) [ edit ]\n\nDoubles: 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up) [ edit ]\n\nSingles performance timeline [ edit ]\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# A P Z# PO G F-S SF-B NMS NH\n\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (A) absent; (P) postponed; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (F-S) silver or (SF-B) bronze Olympic medal; a (NMS) downgraded Masters Series/1000 tournament; (NH) not held.
