What if all three did?\u201d\n\nThe couple adopted their daughter, Marley, in 2008. Ware and Smith divorced in 2012.\n\nMilo Manheim and Witney Carson\n\nManheim, who rose to fame as the star of this year\u2019s Disney Channel original movie Zombies, will be season 27\u2019s youngest competitor at 17 years old.

She broke up with him on Monday night\u2019s episode, but during the reunion segment Tuesday, they revealed they\u2019ve reconnected.\n\nAnd when it comes to love, Amabile will (hopefully!) get plenty of advice from partner Jenna Johnson, who recently got engaged to fellow pro, Val Chmerkovskiy.\n\nJohn Schneider and Emma Slater\n\nBest known for his portrayal of Beauregard \u201cBo\u201d Duke in the comedy series The Dukes of Hazzard, Schneider, 58, has also found success as a country music star.\n\nIn June, he was sentenced to three days behind bars in the Los Angeles County Jail for failure to pay more than $150,000 in owed alimony payments to his ex-wife, Elvira \u201cElly\u201d Schneider.\n\nA month later, Schneider said it was \u201cunlikely\u201d he would be able to comply with the conditions set forth by the court to have the charge dropped, and thus avoid his three-day jail sentence, so he instead effectively asked the court to simply lock him up for the entirety of that sentence.\n\n\u201cI am willing and able to accept the punishment for my actions/inactions as to this matter and I request this court to impose such sentence without further delay,\u201d he wrote in a letter to the judge in his case.\n\nImage zoom ABC/Lou Rocco\n\nNancy McKeon and Val Chmerkovskiy\n\nBest known for her role as Jo Polniaczek on the 1980 NBC sitcom The Facts of Life, McKeon, 52, also acted in Sonny with a Chance, Without a Trace, Touched by an Angel, and the TV movie Wild Hearts.\n\nLast week, during an appearance on Good Morning America, McKeon said Chmerkovskiy is \u201cthe most amazing partner, most patience than anybody I know and I\u2019m so lucky.\u201d\n\nImage zoom ABC/Lou Rocco\n\nMary Lou Retton and Sasha Farber\n\nThe retired gymnast, 50, was the first U.S. woman to win the individual all-around Olympic gold medal and is often considered the greatest American gymnast of all time.\n\nThe West Virginia native, who retired in 1986, was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997.\n\nBorn with hip dysplasia, years of gymnastics further aggravated the condition and eventually led her to receiving a hip implant in 2008.\n\nFun Fact: Retton was the first female athlete to be pictured on the front of a Wheaties box!\n\nThe athlete is paired with pro dancer and newlywed Sasha Farber, who recently married his fellow pro Emma Slater in March.\n\nTinashe and Brandon Armstrong\n\nThe Zimbabwean singer-songwriter was a part of the musical group The Stunners, but has since found success as a solo artist.

It\u2019s really important that young girls know the difference.\u201d\n\nEvanna Lynch and Keo Motsepe\n\nThe Irish actress, 27, rose to fame with her portrayal of Luna Lovegood in the Harry Potter films.\n\nIn 2016, Lynch hit the pavement in the New York City Half Marathon to raise awareness for the World Animal Protection.\n\nImage zoom ABC/Lou Rocco\n\nSo what was on the Ravenclaw\u2019s playlist? \u201cWhen the running gets tough, that\u2019s when I need to put on my Disney soundtracks,\u201d the actress told PEOPLE. \u201cThe ones where they defy the odds.\u201d\n\nAny princess in particular? \u201cMulan, because she had to fight a war and pretend she was a man,\u201d said Lynch. \u201cIt\u2019s so inspiring, so motivating.
