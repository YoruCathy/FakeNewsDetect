I think about how, after six Marvel Studios films featuring Chris Evans in the role, we\u2019ve gotten to the point where it\u2019s impossible to trace where Evans ends and where Cap begins. I think about how he\u2019s evolved from a character whose duty was to serve his country into a character whose country let him down. I think about how he bicep-curled a helicopter.\n\nAnd after seeing Avengers: Infinity War, and after seeing Evans tweeting about his character\u2019s presumed cinematic end, I\u2019ve thought a lot about what happens when Captain America dies.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t trade lives,\u201d Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Cap, tells Vision around Infinity War\u2019s midpoint, explaining that the Avengers leave no men, women, or any other forms of life behind. But as we see half the world\u2019s population (including some of our favorite Avengers) decimated at the movie\u2019s end, it\u2019s not hard to foresee an outcome in next year\u2019s Avengers 4 where Cap is put in the position of trading his life for others.\n\nIt\u2019s been eight years since Evans donned the stars and stripes for Captain America: The First Avenger. In that time, he\u2019s evolved from a selfless patriot to a man out of time to a prodigal son. Now, with the future of the universe at stake, the table is set for what could be the biggest moment in the character\u2019s cinematic life.\n\nGiven Cap\u2019s character arc, which has always been underscored by his selflessness, and how much Infinity War emphasized his stance on \u201ctrading lives,\u201d it certainly seems like a noble sacrifice to save the universe lies in his future. And even if it somehow doesn\u2019t come to that, he\u2019s already cemented his legacy as Earth\u2019s most enduring Avenger.\n\nIn Infinity War, Cap and Thanos\u2019s worldviews are symmetrical\n\nOne of the biggest revelations in Infinity War is Thanos\u2019s motivations for culling the universe: He believes that in order to sustain life, we have to reduce it by half. Resources are finite, and life is a burden on those resources. Eliminate life to an ideal degree (roughly half, according to Thanos\u2019s math), and both life and resources reach an optimal level.\n\nIn other words, Thanos believes in trading lives.\n\nThe ultimate example of his willingness to trade is his choice to throw his adopted daughter Gamora off a cliff in order to obtain the Soul Stone. His sights are set on completing the Infinity Gauntlet and using it to create his vision of a utopia. Killing his daughter, whom he seems to genuinely love, is the price he\u2019s willing to pay.\n\nSteve Rogers and everything he stands for \u2014 and, by extension, the standard for what superheroes in Marvel\u2019s Cinematic Universe strive to be \u2014 are the antithesis to Thanos. When faced with the choice between ripping the Mind Stone from Vision\u2019s forehead and killing him, or protecting Vision and risking the fate of half the universe, Rogers refuses to trade a single life in the name of preserving his and countless others\u2019. He\u2019d rather die fighting than sacrifice an innocent to avoid the fight.\n\nThis stance is remarkable for a couple of reasons. First, Vision is an AI \u2014 Tony Stark\u2019s computer program upgraded with the power of an Infinity Stone \u2014 which raises the question of whether Vision is even \u201calive\u201d to begin with. Also, in contrast to Gamora and Thanos, Vision isn\u2019t someone with a particularly distinct relationship to Steve Rogers. But despite this, Cap doesn\u2019t hesitate in choosing to save Vision at all costs, risking the lives of Avengers and Wakandans alike to protect him.\n\nWhen Avengers 4 unfolds next year it will most likely involve the resurrection of its vaporized heroes (especially those with confirmed sequels on the schedule). Because of this, I\u2019d expect there to be a continued emphasis on Steve\u2019s \u201cwe don\u2019t trade lives\u201d mantra \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few lines he\u2019s given in Infinity War, and it\u2019s repeated \u2014 in contrast to Thanos\u2019s worldview. There\u2019s just too much symmetry and thematic opportunity there for Marvel to ignore it.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if in Avengers 4, in order to undo Thanos\u2019s massive cull, Steve Rogers would have to sacrifice himself to undo the damage of not trading Vision\u2019s life \u2014 that he would be faced with having to \u201ctrade lives\u201d to get back all the lives that were lost. And the only life Cap would be fine with trading would be his own. (It also wouldn\u2019t surprise me if some sort of Soul Stone mythology leads to a confrontation between Cap and Red Skull, the supervillain from Captain America: The First Avenger who\u2019s revealed to be the keeper of the Soul Stone in Infinity War.)\n\nCap sacrificing himself for the greater good would feel like the ultimate inverse of Thanos\u2019s decimation: giving his life to save the people he loves, instead of killing someone he loves in the name of a greater good. It\u2019s a sacrifice that only Cap could make.\n\nMarvel figured out the importance of being earnest\n\nBack in 2008, Marvel found itself a hero in Iron Man\u2019s Tony Stark, who was sardonic, quippy, and smarter and cockier than his peers. Compared to other relatively earnest cinematic superheroes of the time, like the X-Men and Spider-Man, Tony Stark was the \u201ccool\u201d superhero we needed.\n\n\u201cIt takes about two minutes of watching Robert Downey Jr. in action in Iron Man 3 \u2014 in any of his appearances as the armored Tony Stark, in fact \u2014 to realize what the other Avengers are lacking: Charisma,\u201d Graeme McMillan wrote in Time in 2013, bemoaning the Cap\u2019s stiffness and earnestness in comparison to the Avengers\u2019 other leader.\n\nBut a lot changes in five years.\n\nWith the way the Marvel Cinematic Universe has since shaken out, with Tony Stark at fault for creating Ultron and ripping apart the Avengers in Civil War, Downey\u2019s portrayal of an artisanal tech jerk hasn\u2019t aged particularly well. (And while I don\u2019t blame Marvel or Downey for this, I can\u2019t see Elon Musk without thinking of the smarminess of Tony Stark, and vice versa.) Tony Stark\u2019s cocksure genius has gone from being an asset to a liability, for the character and the franchise alike. And in those same five years, Cap has become the more endearing hero.\n\nEver since his first appearance in 2011\u2019s The First Avenger, Steve Rogers has been defined by his spirit \u2014 it\u2019s the reason he, in spite of his physical deficiencies, was chosen for the super soldier experiment. In 2012\u2019s The Avengers, he\u2019s a thawed-out man out of time; he has all the powers of a super soldier, but beneath his superhero surface is that scrawny guy who\u2019s a grandpa among his peers. He\u2019s a relic of America\u2019s golden age, and his earnestness and selflessness feel like relics as well: too good and sweet to be of our contemporary time and place, and directly at odds with the modern sensibilities of Tony Stark.\n\nBut Cap\u2019s evolution into the heart of the modern MCU begins with the surreal revelation in 2014\u2019s Captain America: The Winter Soldier that the country and the government he believed in and fought for has spoiled since he left it, forcing him to redefine his heroism in relationship to the government that first made him a hero. Then in 2016\u2019s Captain America: Civil War, he\u2019s completely at odds with the government, defying orders to save and protect his friends and the greater good, while Tony Stark aligns the remaining Avengers with the government in the name of atoning for the damage he caused by creating Ultron.\n\nClashing with Tony\u2019s contemporary sarcasm, Steve\u2019s earnestness becomes timeless. His heroism isn\u2019t undertaken out of duty like Tony\u2019s, but rather woven into the fabric of his being. Tony Stark\u2019s goodness saves him from himself, while Steve\u2019s goodness is quantified in saving others.\n\nAfter Infinity War, it feels like it\u2019s time for Marvel to pass the torch\n\nInfinity War ends with a cliffhanger and a twist. Thanos eliminates half of the universe \u2014 and half of the Avengers \u2014 as the movie fades to black. But in a post-credits scene, Nick Fury is seen sending a distress call to someone he believes can save the day: Captain Marvel.\n\nWe know very little about the upcoming 2019 Captain Marvel film other than that it\u2019s set in the 1990s and that its titular superhero, Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, is an Air Force pilot caught in the middle of a war between two alien races, probably the Kree and the Skrulls. Setting the movie in the 1990s, and then possibly sending the character into space to deal with cosmic threats, could help explain why Captain Marvel hasn\u2019t already appeared on Earth at some point in the MCU\u2019s 10-year history.\n\nBut with the Avengers and the universe in tatters, the table is set for Captain Marvel to make her debut and rally the troops. It also feels like the time when the original core Avengers will pass the torch to the next generation of Marvel heroes.\n\nEvans hasn\u2019t detailed the specifics of his Captan America contract, but he told Good Morning America during the Infinity War press tour: \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next \u2014 but by 2019, that\u2019s it.\u201d And this week he tweeted about how grateful he was for the memories and the experiences of playing (in past tense) the character.\n\nOfficially wrapped on Avengers 4. It was an emotional day to say the least. Playing this role over the last 8 years has been an honor. To everyone in front of the camera, behind the camera, and in the audience, thank you for the memories! Eternally grateful. \u2014 Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) October 4, 2018\n\nAssuming Evans isn\u2019t bluffing, there will be a storytelling opportunity for Captain America to pass his leadership of the team to another captain who happens to share many of his defining qualities (time displacement, an outsider to the core group, a US service member). It would make sense that Cap would sacrifice himself, but also that he would see to it that the Avengers are left in capable, caring, and responsible hands.\n\nThere\u2019s thematic precedence for this in the comics that Avengers 4 could easily draw on for this scenario. In Captain Marvel No. 1, written by Kelly Sue DeConnick and drawn by Dexter Soy, Carol and Cap have a strikingly pertinent discussion about her taking the name \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d and leading the team. It\u2019s primarily a conversation about legacy: Carol doesn\u2019t want the title because she doesn\u2019t want to be seen as stealing or besmirching the original Captain Marvel\u2019s good name.\n\nReading over that scene made me think about the title of Captain America as it stands in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has, over the past seven years, created a humanity in Captain America. In taking up that mantle, Steve Rogers has become one of the most beloved characters in pop culture, and the defining spirit of the first generation of Avengers. Should Avengers 4 be his last hurrah, it will also necessarily be a celebration of his legacy.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPecCkRqnF6R7JyArkNyCUz_b54=/0x0:950x623/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:950x623):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10806827/Screen_Shot_2018_05_09_at_9.40.16_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672024/1218646346.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p7MnWpC_1jDGRKvYse3bNrs3h-A=/0x0:2048x1072/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10417219/infinitywar.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ezdyN3vKXlxhUafWEspiaM0U7FA=/0x0:2048x1080/1200x800/filters:focal(821x285:1147x611)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59677381/infinitywar.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671059/GettyImages_1210050360.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOaWiaUKIq2ZmlNRe53Wa1Bq9jc=/0x0:433x684/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:433x684):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10769383/Screen_Shot_2018_05_02_at_3.57.13_PM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YugQ6KkRaYLRMa3ikfHarhy_LUQ=/0x0:981x530/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:981x530):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10806839/Screen_Shot_2018_05_09_at_9.39.31_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66563937/GettyImages_1129912168.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671897/shel_silverstein.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667959/1219262470.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671808/1214635621.jpg.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4sPeeKHAj7sYw4jLHD_jOnVf-c=/0x0:1800x197/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1800x197):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8635113/spoilers_below.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p7MnWpC_1jDGRKvYse3bNrs3h-A=/0x0:2048x1072/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10417219/infinitywar.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Abad-Santos", "Matthew Yglesias", "Constance Grady", "Emily Todd Vanderwerff", "Jag Bhalla", "Shirin Ghaffary", "German Lopez", "Oct"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2018/5/9/17308114/avengers-infinity-captain-america-death", "title": "Goodbye to Captain America: How Marvel might retire Steve Rogers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2018-05-09T10:10:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-05T12:37:53-04:00"}, "author": "Alex Abad-Santos", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/dd55371d9ef76d5d505f37d268e3aefb/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Chris Evans has all but confirmed he\u2019s done playing Cap.
