We have been blessed two times over,\u201d the \u201cLemonade\u201d singer captioned the photo.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 shared a series of photos throughout her pregnancy, many who featured their 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy Carter.\n\nThe twins\u2019 birth was one of the most widely anticipated events of 2017, with Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s avant garde Instagram pregnancy announcement breaking a Guinness World Record for most liked photo on Instagram.\n\nThe power couple, who married in 2008, welcomed Blue \u2013 who is now five \u2013 on January 7, 2012.\n\nSee the name announcement in all its glory below.\n\nGet The Brief.
