From India, naturalised US citizen\n\nWed to Manjula in arranged marriage\n\nFather of octuplets (8 children)\n\nOwner of convenience store Kwik-E-Mart\n\nPhD in computer science\n\nHindu\n\nVegan\n\nAzaria said he wanted to see Indian and South Asian writers join The Simpsons' fold, to help shape the character's development and portrayal.\n\n\"Not in a token way, but genuinely informing whatever new direction this character may take, including how it is voiced or not voiced.\n\n\"It not only makes sense but it feels like the right thing to do to me.\"\n\n'What can you do?'\n\nAzaria also distanced himself from the show's stance on the issue.\n\nOn the episode No Good Read Goes Unpunished, Simpsons' matriarch Marge tries to share books from her youth to daughter Lisa \u2014 only to realise they now seem politically incorrect.\n\n\"Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect,\" Lisa says.\n\n\"What can you do?\"\n\nThe young character looks towards a picture of Apu on a table nearby, as Marge says, \"some things will be dealt with at a later date\".\n\n\"If at all,\" Lisa replies.\n\nAzaria said he was not involved in the scene.\n\n\"I think that if anybody came away from that segment feeling that they should lighten up, or take a joke better, or grow a thicker skin ... that's definitely not the message I want to send.\"\n\nAzaria also voices up to 30 regular characters on the show, including bar owner Moe Szyslak and Police Chief Wiggum.\n\nTopics: animation, race-relations,
