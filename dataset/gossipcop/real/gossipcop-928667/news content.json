From opening locations in Los Angeles, Miami and New York, to having our Dash Dolls spin-off show, it\u2019s been such a huge part of our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve loved running DASH, but in the last few years we\u2019ve all grown so much individually,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve been busy running our own brands, as well as being moms and balancing work with our families. We know in our hearts that it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe love our DASH Dolls and are so grateful for the amazing memories \u2014 and we have to give a special thanks to the DASH employees and all of the incredible fans and customers who have supported us throughout the years!\u201d Kardashian West added. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without you.
