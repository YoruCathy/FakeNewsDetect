News asked Gosling whether he had asked Ford about starring in the fifth Indiana Jones film he said: \"I'm working on it man\u2026 easy.\" He then jokingly added: \"You just blew it for me.\"\n\nIt looks as though Gosling, who has just starred alongside Ford in Blade Runner 2049, isn't quite done working with his childhood hero - even if he did manage to \"walk into\" Harrison's fist on set.\n\nBut what did Ford have to say about the potential casting? \"I'm trying to wrap my head around that. Too soon.\"\n\nWe'll be honest, it's not the most positive reaction we've ever heard, but then again it is Harrison Ford.\n\nSpeaking to ET recently, Gosling said that Ford's films meant a lot to him, so it was great to see firsthand \"how it's done\".\n\n''He's been creating all these seminal movie experiences for all of us. He's the one person who hasn't got to experience that, because he's been too busy making them. And so to have a window into how he does that was really great.''\n\nThe fifth Indiana Jones will be dropping in 2020, so far both Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg have been slated to return, but no official casting announcements have been made.", "images": ["https://www.esquire.com/sites/esquire/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2560x1280/landscape-1506334648-harrison-ford-ryan-gosling.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2560x1280/landscape-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg?resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2560x1280/landscape-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Raphael"], "canonical_link": "https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/film/news/a17467/ryan-gosling-say-he-is-working-on-getting-indiana-jones-role/", "title": "Ryan Gosling Say He Is \"Working On\" Getting 'Indiana Jones' Role", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Esquire", "title": "Ryan Gosling Is \"Working On\" Harrison Ford To Get 'Indiana Jones' Role", "description": "Good luck, Gos", "url": "http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film/news/a17467/ryan-gosling-say-he-is-working-on-getting-indiana-jones-role/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2560x1280/landscape-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1643411472613830}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/esquiremagazine/", "modified_time": "2018-06-25 04:27:46", "published_time": "2017-09-26 10:25:00", "section": "Film", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@EsquireUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2560x1280/landscape-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "1vf5i9wM7chlCFc_0XI_e-oCfDf4sEvp32sTGKoaukQ", "title": "Ryan Gosling Say He Is \"Working On\" Getting 'Indiana Jones' Role", "description": "Could this be his second film with Harrison Ford?", "keywords": "Ryan Gosling,Harrison Ford", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2048x2048/square-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture,film,harrison ford,Ryan Gosling", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-26T10:25:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2560x1280/landscape-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/17/39/2048x2048/square-1506419312-gettyimages-820941414.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Ryan Gosling Is \"Working On\" Harrison Ford To Get 'Indiana Jones' Role", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506392700.0, "source": "https://www.esquire.com", "summary": ""}
