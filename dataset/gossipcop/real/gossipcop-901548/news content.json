Ahead of the Games, the siblings spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about what really lies within that picture-perfect brother-sister relationship, movie dates (with each other), and how they hope to to make an impact beyond the rink.\n\n\n\nIs there a common assumption people make about you guys when they hear you spend all this time together?\n\nMaia Shibutani: People think that it\u2019s really cool! They [do] wonder how siblings are able to work together so closely and get along, though.\n\nAlex Shibutani: Yes, people think it\u2019s really cool because we think it\u2019s really cool! Our parents raised us to care a lot about each other \u2014 we\u2019re lucky that we have an awesome relationship.\n\n[But] sibling rivalry often gets brought up; you can care about your sibling and care about your family but, to the extent that we spend life together, people presume it does\u2026 occasionally present challenges.\n\nM: People tend to [say] either \u201cwow, it must be amazing\u201d or \u201coh, that must be so hard.\u201d With any relationship when you\u2019re working toward a goal with a teammate, there are days where it\u2019s great and there are days it\u2019s challenging, but the strength in our team is the way we work through that. We\u2019re just really grateful to have been on this journey together.\n\nRuben Chamorro\n\nWhat don\u2019t people ask you about very often that you wish you could talk more about?\n\nA: I think because we are such a strong team and so in sync on the ice, there's the perception that we\u2019re literally always the same in life and that we have the same interests. We are different people! We are!\n\nAlex, when you say \u201cdifferent,\u201d what specifically do you mean?\n\nA: We have some [different] interests outside of skating, which is great. It\u2019s nice to be able to pursue other things. Skating is our priority; being the best ice dance team we can be is really important to us, yes, but we have different personalities! Maia is definitely more organized than I am, which is great. As evidenced by the fact that she's been the point person for scheduling this interview... we never would\u2019ve talked if it were me! With me, I don\u2019t know. My ego is what sets me apart.\n\nM: Alex is really charismatic and he brings a lot of great energy to whatever he\u2019s doing. He works so hard. But as far as different interests, for example, Alex follows sports more closely than I do.\n\nA: Yeah. Interest-wise, we both to love see movies. Not separately, actually. We\u2019ll go together just because that\u2019s a fun way for us to relax and unwind with a bag of popcorn.\n\nWhat does it look like to have a relationship \u2014 any kind of relationship \u2014 with someone competing at such a high level?\n\nA: On a day-to-day basis, we\u2019re each other\u2019s best friends and we spend a lot of time together, sort of out of necessity [given] how much our training demands and how much we\u2019re pushing each ourselves \u2014\n\nM: And we\u2019re really lucky we have a teammate who truly understands everything you\u2019re going through, because you\u2019re reaching for the same goal.\n\nA: Our coaches are our friends. Not to sound so pathetic, but our dogs are our friends. We have two Maltese dogs, one named Lily, the other\u2019s named Pom \u2014 he\u2019s named after one the main character in of our favorite movies, Kung Fu Panda. A lot of our non-skating friends we don\u2019t, unfortunately, get to see very often, but we have a lot of friends on the U.S. Olympic team from our travels. On the relationship thing, it\u2019s tough. There\u2019s not a lot of time! Maia and I have an hour, maybe two, every so often to fit in a movie, but relationships outside of what we\u2019re doing right now are very challenging and difficult.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say we wouldn\u2019t be interested in personal lives, it\u2019s just\u2026 Right now, my [most important] relationship is with skating and trying to be the best skater I can be \u2014 and it's the same thing for Maia. It\u2019s just complicated. It's not that it can\u2019t be done, but there\u2019s a lot of other things that we have to focus on.\n\nBroadcasting is a natural progression for some people in their lives after skating. Given your YouTube success, do you ever think about that?\n\nA: I think that it\u2019s [an interesting prospect]. It would be nice, whenever the time comes for us to retire from skating, to be able to continue to perform in some way. We don\u2019t have acting experience, per se [both laugh], but we did appear on the Nickelodeon show Nicky, Ricky, Dicky & Dawn a year-and-a-half ago. We played ourselves.\n\nM: We grew up watching all those sitcoms, so to actually be on one was really cool.\n\nA: We're skaters right now [but] we have some experience with hosting things. We hosted a series produced by Team USA where we talked about different Olympic and Paralympic sports, and that was fun because we were able to help write the scripts \u2014 we were able to inject a lot of our own humor and try to make it a fun watch. It was also our first time reading off a prompter!\n\nM: And a huge honor to be chosen to explain the Olympic and Paralympic sports to an audience.\n\nA: I think one of the things we enjoy about the Olympic movement is how much it\u2019s affected our lives. The Olympics are so much more than just us. The values of the Olympics \u2014 strength, friendships, respect \u2014 are things we care a lot about and I think they apply beyond sports. So we\u2019ve done some ambassador work as Sports Envoys and we\u2019re doing a program with Team USA and the PyeongChang organizing committee where we\u2019ve been mentoring kids in a middle school in South Korea.\n\nM: That\u2019s one of the great things about social media and technology in general. No matter where you are, you\u2019re able to learn something or connect to another part of the world.\n\nRuben Chamorro\n\nWill you meet the kids at the Games?\n\nM: Yes! It\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re most looking forward to [in PyeongChang], because the communication has only been through Skype so far. Their energy is really incredible.\n\nI assume that medaling is a primary goal, but you\u2019ve spoken about the lack of diversity, specifically in team ice dancing. What else are you hoping to accomplish in that realm?\n\nA: It\u2019s not something we talk about very often, because there is a strong presence in Asia in singles-skating. But there isn\u2019t a history of Asian success in ice dance. There aren\u2019t very many Asian ice dance teams currently either. Part of that is the way the sport originated \u2014 we looked to Kristi Yamaguchi and Michelle Kwan as figure skating role models. We didn\u2019t really have that.\n\nNow, this is the first time the Winter Olympics are going to be back in Asia since 1998 in Nagano. It's a really huge opportunity for us to get exposure for our sport and inspire people around the world, Asian or not. And it\u2019s not even if you\u2019re interested in skating \u2014 diversity, representation, and equality are [in the news currently] and I\u2019m very glad they're being discussed, because [they are] issues that still need to be tackled.\n\nBut for us, I don\u2019t feel like we feel extra pressure \u2014 the goal is to have our best performances, and medal! And we know that if we continue to be ourselves, we will be representing ourselves and our country and anyone who looks to up to us. It will be an amazing and incredible honor to be at the Games and to inspire anyone.\n\nMeet all 14 Members of Team USA's Figure Skating Squad\n\n19 Fascinating Things You Didn't Know About Figure Skating Costumes\n\n11 Things to Know About Madison Chock and Evan Bates, Team USA's Ice Dancing Love Birds\n\n12 Things to Know About Madison Hubbell and Zach Donahue, Team USA's Ice Dancing Exes\n\nFollow Tess on Twitter.\n\nSenior Video Producer: Jason Ikeler\n\nVideographer: Josh Archer\n\nVideo Edited by: Gigi Pena\n\nTo learn more, visit teamusa.org.
