Leave it to Britney to shake up international politics.\n\n\"We delayed the vote one day, to July 4. We couldn't hire enough security for the election because of the Britney Spears concert on July 3. There would also be a lot of traffic and roadblocks that would make it hard for the vote to go ahead,\" Labor Party spokesman Liron Zach said.\n\nSecurity and traffic concerns prompted move\n\nThe primary election will decide who becomes chairman of the party. The elected official will then enter the running to be prime minister.\n\nPhotos: Photos: Britney Spears through the years Photos: Photos: Britney Spears through the years Britney Spears speaks on stage during the Teen Choice Awards on Sunday, August 16.
