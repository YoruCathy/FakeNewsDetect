Read at your own risk!\n\nOliver and Felicity officially reunited during Thursday\u2019s episode of Arrow.\n\nDespite their kiss in the season 5 finale, when Arrow returned, Oliver (Stephen Amell) and Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) had pressed pause on their relationship so that William could adjust to life with Oliver. But now that Oliver has given up the mantle of being the Emerald Archer and William seems somewhat settled, Oliver gives Felicity a key to his apartment, a sign he\u2019s ready for their romance to continue \u2014 something they seal with a kiss at the close of the hour.\n\n\u201cThey are back together,\u201d Amell confirms to EW. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re back together, but I don\u2019t know [what\u2019s next].\u201d\n\nAs Amell previously teased, there is much more trust between the duo now in the wake of everything they\u2019ve experienced, which means they won\u2019t be restarting this relationship from square one. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can,\u201d Rickards concurs. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you can with anyone you have history with and someone you really, really care for. It\u2019s usually one to 100. They do really love each other and they\u2019ve hopefully solidified their friendship and hopefully can grow off the base of that.\u201d\n\nBut they will face their fair share of challenges, especially when Felicity\u2019s past comes back to haunt her during next week\u2019s episode \u2014 something she chooses to face alone. \u201cShe refuses the team\u2019s help for 75 percent of it,\u201d Rickards says of the hour. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen before, Felicity doing that doesn\u2019t always end up in her favor and is also nearsighted. It has to do with stealing some tech. It is one of my favorite episodes ever. I had one of the best times filming that episode, so hopefully you\u2019ll like it.\u201d\n\nThough he\u2019s no longer the Green Arrow, Oliver will question her decision not to rely on the team. \u201cThey have a little bit of a back and forth because he says, \u2018You can do what you want to do,\u2019 and that\u2019s a big thing with Oliver this year, is he trusts people to do their job,\u201d Amell says. \u201c\u2018Do it, take over, go for it.\u2019 And he and Felicity get into it a little bit because he says, \u2018Look, you can do what you want, just don\u2019t do it without backup. Use the team, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.\u2019 The fact that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t gives him pause a little bit.\u201d\n\nArrow airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on The CW.", "images":
