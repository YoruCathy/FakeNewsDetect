He told me the door was locked but I never ran over and tried the knob. When I got home, I remember I stood in front of the mirror and I looked at my hands and I was so mad at them for not being bloody or bruised. Something like that tunes the dial one way or another, right? You become more compliant or less compliant, and I think I became less compliant.\u201d\n\nThurman got to know Weinstein and his first wife, Eve, in the afterglow of \u201cPulp Fiction.\u201d \u201cI knew him pretty well before he attacked me,\u201d she said. \u201cHe used to spend hours talking to me about material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs. This was my champion. I was never any kind of studio darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me.\u201d\n\nThings soon went off-kilter in a meeting in his Paris hotel room. \u201cIt went right over my head,\u201d she says. They were arguing about a script when the bathrobe came out.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel threatened,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI thought he was being super idiosyncratic, like this was your kooky, eccentric uncle.\u201d\n\nHe told her to follow him down a hall \u2014 there were always, she says, \u201cvestibules within corridors within chambers\u201d \u2014 so they could keep talking. \u201cThen I followed him through a door and it was a steam room. And I was standing there in my full black leather outfit \u2014 boots, pants, jacket. And it was so hot and I said, \u2018This is ridiculous, what are you doing?\u2019 And he was getting very flustered and mad and he jumped up and ran out.\u201d\n\nThe first \u201cattack,\u201d she says, came not long after in Weinstein\u2019s suite at the Savoy Hotel in London. \u201cIt was such a bat to the head. He pushed me down. He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn\u2019t actually put his back into it and force me. You\u2019re like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard. I was doing anything I could to get the train back on the track. My track. Not his track.\u201d\n\nShe was staying in Fulham with her friend, Ilona Herman, Robert De Niro\u2019s longtime makeup artist, who later worked with Thurman on \u201cKill Bill.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-thumbLarge.png", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/04/opinion/sunday/04dowd-jump/04dowd-jump-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/02/autossell/KBCrashStill/KBCrashStill-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "title": "Opinion | This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-02-03T14:49:59.000Z", "modified": "2018-02-03T18:57:15.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/maureen-dowd", "tag": "Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (Movie)", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005715262, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/f7ca9bef-99d8-58cd-a394-1ab584c3dd25", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/13c43414cde248d5bf4865a8bd923257", "description": "The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "byl": "By Maureen Dowd", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Uma Thurman,Actor,Miramax Films,Weinstein,Quentin Tarantino,Harvey Weinstein,Movies,Rape,Sexual harassment,MeToo Movement,Pulp Fiction,Kill Bill: Vol. 1,Kill Bill: Vol. 2", "pdate": 20180203, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "alt": "Uma Thurman in New York."}, "description": "The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "title": "Opinion | This Is Why Uma Thurman Is Angry", "description": "The actress is finally ready to talk about Harvey Weinstein.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/opinion/sunday/04dowd/04dowd-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "alt": "Uma Thurman in New York."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/f7ca9bef-99d8-58cd-a394-1ab584c3dd25"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "opinion", "SCG": "sunday", "CN": "maureen-dowd", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/f7ca9bef-99d8-58cd-a394-1ab584c3dd25", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/03/opinion/sunday/this-is-why-uma-thurman-is-angry.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517587200.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
