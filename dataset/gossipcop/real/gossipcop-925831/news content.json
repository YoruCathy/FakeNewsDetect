And, in particular, she has the most relatable thoughts about Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's breakup, which might make you cry a little less.\n\nSpeaking to E! at a This Bar Saves Lives event, Bell revealed, \"We're not looking at the whole picture when we sort of idolize the relationship. Like those two, that may be a better path for both of them, and they're both lovely people, and they're still friends, and that's okay.\"\n\nAs Tatum and Dewan's joint statement made clear, the love they have for one another hasn't gone, but their relationship has changed:\n\nAnd Bell thinks it's time the world accepted that not all relationships are forever, and that sometimes that's for the best. She told E!:\n\n\"It's okay to feel like, I went through 10 years with you, I love you and now I feel like I want something different and so do you. Like it doesn't have to be a heartbreak, I guess is what I mean. It could actually be the healthiest thing for both individuals to thrive and it could also be the best example for your kids.\"\n\n\n\nBut as for whether her and husband Dax Shepard will ever split, Bell thinks it's unlikely. She revealed:\n\n\"We're in too deep and I like him too much. Even when he's annoying I really like him. I'm still like, 'I still wanna be on the porch with you when I'm 80, but I really need you to get out of my face right now.'\"", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/02/1483975345-channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-1483971997.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0530xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/chan-jenna-1523020850.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden", "Weekend Editor", "Amy Mackelden Is The Weekend Editor At Harpersbazaar.Com", "Where She Writes About Entertainment", "Celebrity News", "Beauty"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/a19709332/kristen-bell-channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-split/", "title": "Kristen Bell Offers New Perspective on Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Split", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Kristen Bell Offers New Perspective on Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Split", "description": "\"They're both lovely people, and they're still friends, and that's okay.\"", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/a19709332/kristen-bell-channing-tatum-and-jenna-dewan-split/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2018-04-07 06:20:05", "published_time": "2018-04-07 06:20:00", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Kristen Bell on Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Split and the Pressures facing a celeb couple", "description": "Kristen Bell on the challenges of being a celeb couple, relationship in the spotlight. \"They're both lovely people,\u00a0and they're still friends,\u00a0and that's okay.\"", "keywords": "kristen bell, jenna dewan, channing tatum, jenna dewan breakup, channing tatum breakup, jenna channing divorce, channing tatum divorce, kristen bell dax, kristen bell husband", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Culture,culture", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-07T18:20:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jenna-channing-tatum-kristen-bell-1523124410.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kristen Bell Offers New Perspective on Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Split", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523053200.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
