Use a washcloth to exfoliate the skin prior to applying a self-tanner. Using an exfoliating product also will help remove dead skin cells. Spend a little more time exfoliating where your skin is thickest, on the elbows, knees and ankles.\n\nDry your skin. Drying your skin before you apply a self-tanner helps it go on evenly.\n\nApply in sections. Apply the self-tanner in sections (such as the arms, then legs, followed by the torso). Massage the self-tanner into your skin in a circular motion.\n\nWash your hands after each section. You will avoid orange-colored palms by washing your hands with soap and water after you finish applying the self-tanner to each section of your body.\n\nBlend at your wrists and ankles. For a natural look, you need to lightly extend the tanner from your wrists to your hands and from your ankles to your feet.\n\nDilute over your joints. Dilute the self-tanner on the knees, ankles and elbows, because these areas tend to absorb more self-tanner than the rest of the skin. To dilute, lightly rub with a damp towel or apply a thin layer of lotion on top of the self-tanner.\n\nGive your skin time to dry. Wait at least 10 minutes before getting dressed. For the next three hours, it is best to wear loose clothing and try to avoid sweating.", "images": ["https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/3EDji39Jt9VXYHn8CcHAWe/17da00204c5f7f301601a276de29412e/skin-cancer-take-a-hike.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/1YEVObHejOEZYOvbF1JZI2/c71c2f3718c0a791b427044b0ddba923/Poison-ivy-featured.png?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/5AkZaRHxNK7ukhBCuv1tXb/b481bf53420960006f84fea708dcab2d/scar-removal-laser-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/6TL7I7k0GMZvXKRTra2TSu/c9be3b988ba6b03d62ca122feb1f1fc4/why-choose-board-certified-derm-card.png?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/2064cmOdQNjTOwCcDttlrj/d0e0bb7ff68d436d86ddb25266bb04e3/hair-removal-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/4pFzDSyHY0z4cu6MYvzfCV/10e224eeecc3f16eb7afa5e120a723f7/large-pores-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/2AM6alD0EXDDGeleN1R4Aw/7c511fd9c9e6ea824a1d8ae4e4e6a185/botox-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/yQVCQgb1SDIHMlTvbQtFL/26acb11d8fb77f14881ee4605fd6a165/red-face.png?w=268", "https://assets.aad.org/assets/images/logo-blue-lg.png", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/4xRx4aB3HbjkzaanZVjIRH/d56db13ab8ed8f940b56c5da028fc9fa/Diabetes-signs-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/65UXq0QIX1TtzLSGR88Pmd/21d7708206fe0140e029473ceb0ae250/find-a-derm-card.png?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/7DcyeoUX4gEosoHRc8Nzqk/0ebb3bba9c0502cf313eda20e48fbfb3/surviving-acne-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/63FVfgnd02JbtbaB8glSPv/95106fc53f2bd3c1ee8385539ec84d72/Selecting-Derm-featured.png?w=268", "https://assets.aad.org/assets/images/Academy-dual-blue-225.png", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/10DS0EVWM9sfLTvU433HKr/6af22e61617f4bf19a991fd5eb99fd05/Continue-sunscreen-use-fall-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/4YuvCRLew19JE5vWpA9hZN/e9d3aed019eb3a59d4d9e0f6c6e0a3fb/camp-discovery-featured-nav.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/4HYHZ955GaBeCtsZSS0iiV/8116b70ea0b65c0f18cc66d45bd90ce1/prevent-hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/4CHloxp4W8hunKxLhQMJBw/7617366f1a513dda6e8a6756f979f572/shade-structure-featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/318ri7nrZumt3lk83QJqXu/b787ae3164f624204873eece17726156/Psoriasis-Relief-Featured.jpg?w=268", "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/62hqz1KleiBuGGE1tpynjT/2587fbd2b1112ce7d5ac294f2b94ecc0/scabies-treat-everyone.jpg?w=268"], "top_img": "https://images.ctfassets.net/1ny4yoiyrqia/5AkZaRHxNK7ukhBCuv1tXb/b481bf53420960006f84fea708dcab2d/scar-removal-laser-featured.jpg?w=268", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/routine/apply-self-tanner", "title": "How to apply self-tanner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "How to apply self-tanner", "description": "Learn about dermatologist tips for applying self-tanner.", "url": "https://www.aad.org/public/everyday-care/skin-care-secrets/routine/apply-self-tanner"}, "description": "Learn about dermatologist tips for applying self-tanner."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.aad.org", "summary": ""}
