That article, along with reporting by Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker, led to a global movement that would expose sexual misconduct by prominent men in numerous industries, as well as the everyday sexism and abuse experienced by millions of women.\n\nAfter the news broke, Mr. Weinstein told The Hollywood Reporter, \u201cThe story sounds so good, I want to buy the movie rights.\u201d He was soon fired from the movie company he co-founded.\n\nSubsequent Times articles revealed many more victims of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s harassment, including the actresses Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. By the end of October, the list of known allegations stretched back to the 1970s. The Times later documented how Mr. Weinstein\u2019s abuses went unchecked for decades with help from his associates.\n\nThe movie deal, first reported Wednesday by Deadline Hollywood, stemmed from a new partnership between The Times and Anonymous Content\u2019s media rights division. Ms. Kantor and Ms. Twohey are also writing a book for Penguin Press.\n\nDespite the challenges facing the media industry, journalism has become a hot subject for mass entertainment. The movie \u201cSpotlight,\u201d about the Boston Globe investigation that uncovered sexual abuse of children within the Roman Catholic Church, won best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards, and \u201cThe Post,\u201d about The Washington Post\u2019s efforts to publish the Pentagon Papers, was a box office hit in late 2017 and early 2018.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/26weinsteinmovie-sub-articleLarge-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/26weinsteinmovie-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/26weinsteinmovie-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Astor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/movies/new-york-times-weinstein-movie.html", "title": "The Times\u2019s Reporting on Harvey Weinstein Will Get Movie Treatment", "meta_data": {"article": {"published": "2018-04-26T15:09:41.000Z", "modified": "2018-04-26T23:57:06.000Z", "section": "Movies", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/maggie-astor", "tag": "Weinstein, Harvey", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "noarchive", "articleid": 100000005869484, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/2ae287e4-bc4e-5bb6-95a2-fbf90f6fb858", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/6e37b4035cde4c5287310db4c4f29622", "description": "Plan B Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures bought the rights for a film about how the reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey helped set off the #MeToo movement.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/26weinsteinmovie-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "byl": "By Maggie Astor", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/17pulitzers-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Movies,The New York Times,Jodi Kantor,Megan Twohey,Harvey Weinstein", "pdate": 20180426, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/movies/new-york-times-weinstein-movie.html", "type": "article", "title": "The Times\u2019s Reporting on Harvey Weinstein Will Get Movie Treatment", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/26weinsteinmovie-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "alt": "Megan Twohey, left, and Jodi Kantor, who revealed decades of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, will be the subjects of a film."}, "description": "Plan B Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures bought the rights for a film about how the reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey helped set off the #MeToo movement."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/movies/new-york-times-weinstein-movie.html", "title": "The Times\u2019s Reporting on Harvey Weinstein Will Get Movie Treatment", "description": "Plan B Entertainment and Annapurna Pictures bought the rights for a film about how the reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey helped set off the #MeToo movement.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/business/27weinsteinmovie2-PRINT/26weinsteinmovie-sub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v2.jpg", "alt": "Megan Twohey, left, and Jodi Kantor, who revealed decades of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, will be the subjects of a film."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/2ae287e4-bc4e-5bb6-95a2-fbf90f6fb858"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "CG": "movies", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/movies/new-york-times-weinstein-movie.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/2ae287e4-bc4e-5bb6-95a2-fbf90f6fb858", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/movies/new-york-times-weinstein-movie.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/movies/new-york-times-weinstein-movie.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524672000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
