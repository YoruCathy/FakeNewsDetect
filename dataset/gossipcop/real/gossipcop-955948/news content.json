Brown) and his adult daughter \u2014 along with Toby and now Beth \u2014 are going to see \u201cRandall\u2019s mother,\u201d as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she\u2019s running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown on What That Election Result Means for Randall and Beth - And Future Randall and Future Beth\n\nThough this \u201cher\u201d revelation didn\u2019t come until the episode\u2019s closing moments \u2014 which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack\u2019s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War \u2014 we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.\n\nThe installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won\u2019t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.\n\nThat spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: 'ER' Alum Goran Visnjic Cast as Beth's Teacher on Backstory Episode\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d returned from hiatus tonight with an episode that jumped between the past and present \u2014 but didn\u2019t head into the future again. So since we didn\u2019t get anymore new hints on screen, TheWrap was able to gather a few clues for you while speaking with Brown about Randall winning the Philadelphia City Council race and how those election results might impact the Pearsons in the present and the future.\n\nTheWrap: How did you feel about the reveal Rebecca is the mysterious future \u201cher\u201d we\u2019ve all been wondering about? How soon are we going to find out why everyone is gathering to see her?\n\nSterling K. Brown: We\u2019ve all [in the cast] known that it\u2019s Rebecca, though the audience didn\u2019t know, and we know why it\u2019s Rebecca and you guys will find out at the end of the season what it is. Yeah, you\u2019ll see at the end.\n\nEnd of the season?\n\nEnd of the season you\u2019ll get a better glimpse of why we\u2019re going to see Rebecca.\n\nAlso Read: 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Boss on Why a 'This Is Us' Crossover Is Probably a Bad Idea\n\nCan you tell me the significance of the \u201cPin the Tail on the Donkey\u201d game?\n\nI cannot! That\u2019s an easy question.\n\nWelp, that\u2019s all we were about to get out of Sterling on that front, but you can read more from our interview with him about tonight\u2019s episode here.\n\nSee below for all the clues TheWrap previously rounded up about \u201cThis Is Us\u2019s\u201d now-not-so-mysterious character, so you can theorize over the next piece of the puzzle \u2014 what are the circumstances surrounding this foreboding reunion? \u2014 for the next couple months.\n\nAlso Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers\n\nShe\u2019s close to Tess, Randall and Toby\n\nIn the third season premiere, the final scene gives a few more clues as to who the unnamed woman might be. Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he\u2019s \u201ccoming down.\u201d Toby says he doesn\u2019t know, but Randall tells him the \u201cshe\u201d would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed \u2014 alone \u2014 which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes!\n\nAlso Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers\n\n\u201cYou thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate \u2014 I would say that\u2019s open to interpretation,\u201d co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show\u2019s Season 3 finally in September.\n\nAlright, now we know it\u2019s not Kate, but \u201cRandall\u2019s mother\u201d \u2014 a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby.\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting For\n\n\u201cToby is part of our family now,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That\u2019s my brother.\u201d\n\nTess hasn\u2019t seen \u201cher\u201d in awhile\n\nBack on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go see her, Tess,\u201d Randall says. Tess responds that she\u2019s \u201cnot ready,\u201d and Randall says he\u2019s not either.\n\nThe scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights.\n\nBrown also told TheWrap that there\u2019s a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see \u201cher\u201d \u2014 which of course we\u2019ll find out in due time.\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,\u201d Brown said. \u201cYes, there\u2019s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn\u2019t seen the \u2018her\u2019 for some time. And so there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s time to go and she\u2019s like, \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 There\u2019s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.\u201d\n\nThis is as far in the future as we\u2019ll go\n\n\u201cThis future timeline is sort of the furthest that we\u2019ll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,\u201d Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,\u201d Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. \u201cBut we may have other past timelines we\u2019re going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'\n\n\u201cWell we\u2019re going to give answers in that timeline, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a timeline we can\u2019t revisit and sort of push the story forward in that timeline,\u201d co-showrunner Elizabeth Berger told TheWrap. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give a lot of satisfying answers regarding that timeline this season \u2014 so they\u2019re quickly in store.\u201d\n\nAnswers were promised to be coming soon\n\n\u201cI think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,\u201d Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. \u201cThe story is not about where it ends up, it\u2019s about how you kind of get there\u2026 we\u2019re not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.\u201d\n\nMoore said Fogelman has, \u201ctalked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues\n\n\u201cI think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,\u201d Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it\u2019s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan\u2019s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we\u2019re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.\u201d\n\nBrown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.\n\n\u201cIt is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won\u2019t be something that comes out of nowhere,\u201d Brown said. \u201cDan has already spoken to the fact that we\u2019ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that\u2019s dealing with that particular \u2018her\u2019 as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/This-Is-Us-Jack-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EndeavorContent-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BillMaherCOVID-19-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Mandy-Moore-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/This-Is-Us-Jack.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sterling-K-Brown-This-Is-Us.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ranjit-Chowdhry-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-160x105.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUP_183539_3802-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sterling-K-Brown-This-Is-Us-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1207555653-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Sterling-K-Brown-This-Is-Us.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ashley Boucher", "Ross A.
