Some Angelenos, on the other hand, say the event itself will benefit few, while the decade-long polishing of the city\u2019s image will harm many.\n\nWith this series of stories, Curbed is starting a dialogue about how past games have changed the city\u2014for better and for worse\u2014and how city leaders can use those lessons to put forth the best games for everyone.\n\nThis series looks at what made 1932 and 1984 so successful, from deploying budget-friendly design to virtually eliminating traffic. We look at the way LA is using 2028 as a deadline for fixing bigger problems related to transit and housing. And we take a deeper dive into pressing issues like displacement and policing, areas where the Olympics have traditionally failed LA\u2019s most vulnerable communities.\n\nThe Olympics in LA have historically been about showcasing the city\u2014its climate, its landmarks, its culture\u2014and situating its ambitions in a global context. The decisions made in the next decade will prove if LA can make 2028 work for all Angelenos. \u2014 Alissa Walker and Alexandra Lange", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60151849/GettyImages_1237540.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60360021/Lead_Colorway_RV.1531503098.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wUoqmm5Q-Q95VZMl7sHVUdVR1qY=/0x219:2958x1768/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11710535/GettyImages_1237543.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60349583/AP_840717076.1531415326.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60323371/shutterstock_1038828424.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60411879/GettyImages_1237543.1531942184.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59988781/AP_8407280299.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59767421/GettyImages_569162869.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wUoqmm5Q-Q95VZMl7sHVUdVR1qY=/0x219:2958x1768/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11710535/GettyImages_1237543.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alissa Walker", "Alexandra Lange", "Jenna Chandler", "Elijah Chiland", "Patrick Sisson"], "canonical_link": "https://la.curbed.com/2018/7/19/17548932/la-olympics-1984-2028-summer-games", "title": "LA 2028 Olympics: Lessons from the 1984 summer games", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Curbed LA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedla", "published_time": "2018-07-19T10:00:43-07:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-19T10:00:43-07:00"}, "author": "Alex Bazeley", "style-tools": "https://www.curbed.com/style/community/593/d57c57f4d7bf576611d71c417d62fa8d/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "In 1984, Los Angeles did the impossible: It used the Olympics to virtually eliminate traffic\u2014and turn a profit.
