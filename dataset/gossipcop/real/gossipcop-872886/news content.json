News. \"If there are two people that decide not to be together, it shouldn't really be a heartbreak for everyone.\"\n\nThe funny woman, who is married to her equally hilarious husband, Dax Shepard, believes we should focus on the good times that formed the former couple's eight-year marriage. \"You should say, 'Oh, they tried. But that doesn't discount the lovely years they had together,'\" she said. \"If I ever get divorced, I'm still going to be like, 'Wow, I loved being married to that man.'\"\n\nVIDEO: Kristen Bell & Dax Shepard's Cutest Instagram Moments\n\nBell was quick to blast rumors that Pratt's rise in Hollywood played a part in the pair's split. Instead, she admitted that marriage is really hard\u2014especially when you shoot movies in faraway places without your significant other. \"It's a little more nuanced I think than people want to acknowledge. I think it's the truth,\" she said, revealing that she and husband go to couple's therapy and are careful to differentiate between a disagreement and an argument.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the actress says she chooses to remain positive after a breakup. \"I'm glad I spent my time with that person,\" she mused. \"We may have to make different choices, [and] those choices might make us sad for a while, but ultimately you have to make hard choices in life. I don't fault anyone for making them.\"\n\nRELATED: Anna Faris and Chris Pratt Have Split and the Internet Can't Deal\n\nWise words, Kristen!", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F08%2F081117-kristen-bell-and-anna-faris.jpg%3Fitok%3DchDH58pf"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F08%2F081117-kristen-bell-and-anna-faris.jpg%3Fitok%3DchDH58pf", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Walsh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/kristen-bell-advice-anna-faris-chris-pratt-split", "title": "Kristen Bell Has Some Advice for Anyone Heartbroken over Anna Faris and Chris Pratt's Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Celebrity,News,Star Couples,Chris Pratt,Kristen Bell,Anna Faris", "news_keywords": "Chris Pratt, Anna Faris, Chris Pratt Anna Faris, Kristen Bell, Kristen Bell Anna Faris, Chris Pratt split", "description": "Kristen Bell urges heartbroken fans to find the silver lining in Anna Faris and Chris Pratt's split in a new interview with E!
