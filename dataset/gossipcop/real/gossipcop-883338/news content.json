And I think it would take a lot for me to do that. I don't want Jolie to see guys coming in and out of my life. That just wouldn't be a good example.\u201d\n\nThe 43-year-old is living her best single life, though, after splitting from her husband of 11 years, Michael Dodd, last year, admitting to keeping a \u201cbench\u201d of men in her rotation, including one named Alex, whom RHOC fans will meet before the end of season 13.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very single,\u201d she confirms. \u201cI want somebody that I'm best friends with ... like fun, that I can have a great time with, we can laugh and have fun. And then, you know, like, a buddy. And then second, we have to have good sex -- very important -- and then third, like, somebody very, very smart. Really, I want a smart guy, and somebody that, you know, is driven. So, those are the things I'm looking for in a guy\u2026 and nice! That treats me nice. There's a lot!\u201d\n\nKelly admits she never felt like she had that \u201cbest friend\u201d dynamic with any of her partners, including Michael, who is nearly 20 years older than the reality star.\n\n\u201cHe's socially inept, you know what I mean?\u201d she says. \u201cHe always made people feel awkward or whatever, but he's a great dad, he's a great husband. I just couldn't go out with him, let loose and have a good time. So, for whatever reason, I've never had a best friend I've been romantically involved in. Looking back, that's what I want for myself. Maybe that's why all my relationships have failed.\u201d\n\nOne part of her relationship with Michael that is working, though? Co-parenting.\n\n\u201cYou know, [Jolie] always says, 'Mom, I'm happy that you and Dad are divorced,\u2019\u201d Kelly reveals. \u201cShe's at peace, she has fun with me -- it's like she gets one-on-one time with each parent. Our custody is one week on, one week off. So, we have, you know, we co-parent very well together.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo complaints,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt's really good. So, and we're trying to be friendly with each other and do things with her, so she doesn't feel, you know, uncomfortable or doesn't feel insecure. Because if we're cool with each other, she feels good.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, there's times where I wanna, like, smash Michael or talk bad about him, but ultimately I have a daughter and I have to think about her,\u201d she notes. \u201cSo I really don't want to, you know, disparage Michael in any way in the press or anything like that, even though I want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael and I, there's good days and bad days,\u201d Kelly continues. \u201cBut I try to be as positive as I can and not think of the negative, \u2018cause thinking in the negative just puts me in a bad place and doesn't get me anywhere. I still have issues and problems, but I just don't like to tell people about them.\u201d\n\nThe former couple attempts to put those issues aside to create quality experiences for their girl, but it doesn\u2019t always go as planned.\n\n'RHOC': Kelly Dodd Admits She and Vicki Gunvalson No Longer Speak (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

She exploded on co-star Vicki Gunvalson earlier this season for helping to set Michael up with a new woman.\n\n\u201cI have a child with him, I've built up assets with him, I have had one of the best times of my life with him, he's my, you know, a great person,\u201d she explains. \u201cI mean, no matter what, no matter how or not in love with him [I am], you have a kid with them so it's like, \u2018Is this person gonna be nice to my child?\u2019 There's so many emotions that go into your ex dating ... I really want him to date, I want him to get married. I want those nice things for him because it actually gets him to, like, get off my back. But, I really want Michael to be happy.\u201d\n\nAs for her own future, Kelly\u2019s not sure she sees marriage again.\n\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d she confesses. \u201cI'm not, like, opposed to it. But, it's not a must. I think marriage is to have children, you know? But if someone wants to get married, we have a really good relationship, then yes.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County airs Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'RHOC': Kelly Dodd Breaks Down Shannon Beador's 'Unhinged' Behavior in Jamaica (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
