Then again, the \u201cPirates\u201d franchise itself has always seemed like an unlikely mash-up of outlaw posture and pop silliness, eschewing any real sense of seagoing adventure for the more readily achievable goals of brand management and CGI swash and buckle.\n\nThe good news, though, is that the fifth entry, \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,\u201d is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it\u2019s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape the sense that the whole thing, newly steered by the Norwegian directing team of Joachim R\u00f8nning and Espen Sandberg (Oscar nominees for 2012\u2019s \u201cKon-Tiki\u201d), is a cheeky corrective. Though not as resolutely tipped toward weirdness as Gore Verbinski\u2019s sequels were, it\u2019s neither as overstuffed with the nonsense that sunk \u201cDead Man\u2019s Chest\u201d and \u201cAt World\u2019s End.\u201d It\u2019s also not as zipless and personality-free as the last one, the Rob Marshall-helmed \u201cOn Stranger Tides,\u201d which couldn\u2019t justify its existence, stumbling around as much as the series\u2019 anti-hero, Captain Jack.\n\nWatch Video: Keira Knightley Returns in New 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' Trailer\n\nAnd speaking of Johnny Depp\u2019s scoundrel of self-preservation, his tipsy-turvy antics may no longer be the freshly perfumed brine that subversively pickled what we all assumed was a craven theme-park movie (\u201cThe Curse of the Black Pearl\u201d), turning it into a surprise hit. But with the popcorn ethos that animates \u201cDead Men Tell No Tales,\u201d he\u2019s at least treated like a reliably wiggly wind-up toy again, good for batting about, arranging into crazy positions, and countless batted-eyes double takes mixed with sloshy, cynical one-liners.\n\nWhen Jack opines on \u201cthe unscratchable itch\u201d to his young sailor companion Henry (Brenton Thwaites, \u201cGods of Egypt\u201d), newly smitten by a beautiful astronomer named Carina (a plucky Kaya Scodelario, \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d), Henry knowingly agrees: love, right? Jack, confused, corrects him: \u201cScabies.\u201d This isn\u2019t searing wit, obviously, but coming amidst a thrillingly crazy ghost-shark attack and a beach siege by rotting pirates, it\u2019s all just off-kilter enough to feel like a disreputably fun carnival ride.\n\nAlso Read: Why 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5' Could Break $1 Billion Despite Flat US Debut\n\nThe plot, such as it is in the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson (who wrote the story with franchise stalwart Terry Rossio), follows the pattern of the others: intersecting quests that allow for narrow escapes, odd alliances, and parental reunions. Henry wants to lift the curse on his father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, back briefly), trapped at the bottom of the ocean in the Flying Dutchman, by finding the all-powerful Trident of Poseidon.\n\nCarina, deemed a witch due to her intelligence, says she can find the Trident using \u201cthe map no man can read,\u201d a reference to the use of stars to guide ships. They team with Jack, smarting from having lost the trust of his crew after a foiled bank robbery (an impressive opening action sequence in which a bank building is hauled through St. Martin).\n\nJack\u2019s reasons for locating the Trident are personal, however: he\u2019s become the target of a ghost captain named Salazar (a digitally decayed Javier Bardem), recently unleashed from the Devil\u2019s Triangle and hellbent on securing revenge on the then-newbie buccaneer who vanquished him. Salazar\u2019s murderous rampage against pirates \u2014 his risen, rotted ship forming jaws that chomp other vessels \u2014 even spurs the return of Geoffrey Rush\u2019s peg-legged scalawag Barbossa to help defend against this newest threat.\n\nREAD MORE See Johnny Depp's latest POWER MOVE. PowerRank: 432\n\nThe appeal of any \u201cPirates\u201d movie is in the aggregate gleam of its many working parts, and this time around, thanks to the energetic direction of R\u00f8nning and Sandberg, the shine feels freshly buffed. There\u2019s a dual guillotine/hanging rescue that\u2019s as humorously staged as any in the series\u2019 history; it calls to mind the inventive dash of silent comedy. The elaborate location trappings (ships at sea, island shores, bustling cities) veer between baroquely beautiful and picturesquely lush thanks to Paul Cameron\u2019s colorful cinematography, and unlike the relentlessly dreary night in \u201cOn Stranger Tides,\u201d it\u2019s all mostly daytime-set this time around.\n\nThe regular houseguests \u2014 from Depp and Rush to utility pirate players like Stephen Graham \u2014 look game again, while a newcomer like Bardem seems hungry to make his mark and scare the bejesus out of any kids in tow. (Between the sword deaths and the Oscar-winner\u2019s terrifying countenance, this is most decidedly a hard PG-13, parents.) We even get a suitable rock-world replacement for Keith Richards this time around: a delightfully funny Paul McCartney as Jack\u2019s cheerily philosophical, imprisoned pirate uncle.\n\nIf you have \u201cPirates\u201d PTSD, though, discovering the Trident is likely to give you endless-climax hives, and \u201cDead Men\u201d doesn\u2019t disappoint, devolving into the usual over-the-top CGI operatics. (For starters, the ocean parts.) Afterward, a human-sized surprise is revealed, and it\u2019s easily guessable who\u2019s going to show up, considering Henry\u2019s lineage.\n\nAnd yet the best thing one can say about \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d is that it needs no referential callbacks to be its own admirably playful splash in the summer tentpole waters.", "images":
