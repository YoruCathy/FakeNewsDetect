The new Bachelorette exclusively tells E! News she has no lingering feelings\u2014romantic or otherwise\u2014for Arie following The Bachelor\u2018s most dramatic finale ever.\n\n\u201cI wish him and Lauren the best,\u201d Becca says. \u201cWatching their relationship unfold it made much more sense. I\u2019m just beady to move on and be done with that and sayonara to them.\u201d\n\nWhile Becca was blindsided when Arie broke up with her on-camera during what was intended to be a Happy Couple Weekend, she doesn\u2019t harbor any resentment about the way everything ultimately unfolded, telling us, \u201cAt the end of the day, I think I\u2019m winning!\u201d\n\nFans got a sneak peek at Becca\u2019s first night of winning filming, thanks to creator Mike Fleiss\u2018 behind-the-scenes pics on Twitter, including a guy in a chicken suit.So how is Becca feeling now that she\u2019s gotten past the many limo entrances and first rose ceremony?While she admits it still feels \u201csurreal\u201d that she is the Bachelorette, Becca says, \u201cAfter meeting the guys coming out of the limo that first night, it just put me at ease and it just makes me so excited to start this!\u201d\n\nTo hear more from Becca, press play on the video above.When E! News chatted with Chris Harrison after the finale, he revealed naming Becca the next Bachelorette was one of the \u201ceasiest\u201d decisions the franchise has ever had to make.\u201dOnce this evolved and once we saw the outpouring of love and support for Becca\u2014and on top of that, we saw how she handled that unedited, controversial scene. I mean, she was so graceful, so poised, so strong and put together, it made our decision so easy,\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018216/rs_1024x1132-180316110739-1024.bachelorette-becca.ch.031618.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018216/rs_1024x1132-180316110739-1024.bachelorette-becca.ch.031618.jpg?resize=880%2C312&crop=1", "https://hittvibe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cropped-lljpxsf3gbe-nick-turner.jpg?w=40", "https://hittvibe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/cropped-images.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://defaultcustomheadersdata.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/city1.jpg?resize=1180,360", "https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/SL2k9kpTURBXy82MzA2NjZhODk2YzZiMjA0N2U1YTc1YjU2YjhkNWRhOC5qcGeSlQLNAxQAwsOVAgDNAvjCw4GhMAE", "https://i0.wp.com/a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/entertainment/2018/03/28/donald-trump-jr-tweets-his-support-for-roseanne-while-skewering-late-night-hosts/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/931/524/1522268283369.jpg?resize=40%2C40", "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018216/rs_1024x1132-180316110739-1024.bachelorette-becca.ch.031618.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=100", "https://i2.wp.com/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/985E/production/_109960093_hi003505945.jpg?resize=40%2C40&ssl=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif"], "top_img": "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018216/rs_1024x1132-180316110739-1024.bachelorette-becca.ch.031618.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=100", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hittvibe.wordpress.com/2018/03/21/the-bachelorette-becca-kufrin-is-ready-to-say-sayonara-to-arie-luyendyk-jr-and-lauren-burnham/", "title": "The Bachelorette: Becca Kufrin Is Ready to Say \u201cSayonara\u201d to Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "6TQ9gX3gmFxryuJosgNu3Dm2JLeDui-k556fEBfVsrI", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Bachelorette: Becca Kufrin Is Ready to Say \u201cSayonara\u201d to Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham", "url": "https://hittvibe.wordpress.com/2018/03/21/the-bachelorette-becca-kufrin-is-ready-to-say-sayonara-to-arie-luyendyk-jr-and-lauren-burnham/", "description": "Becca Kufrin\u00a0is more than ready to do the damn thing.
