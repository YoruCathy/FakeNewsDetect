The rapper wears a full-body, high-neck custom latex catsuit by Vex Clothing underneath a mirrored corset, finishing off the look with pink braids that extend to the very bottom of her translucent PVC thigh-high heeled boots. In fact, this could be her most radical take on the Barbie trope yet.", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cbde39a5255ddb2d2c/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-migos-nicki-minaj.gif", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Hahn", "Rachel Hah"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Rachel Hahn", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "id": "5a2b169bc16b071bbc37108c", "keywords": "fashion,music videos", "news_keywords": "fashion,music videos", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a2b169bc16b071bbc37108c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb94a13738da830273/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-migos-nicki-minaj.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb94a13738da830273/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-migos-nicki-minaj.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/migos-cardi-b-motorsport-music-video-moto-cross-latex-bodysuit-pink-braids"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "While \u201cMotorsport\u201d features some bold motocross-inspired looks from Quavo, Takeoff, Offset, and Cardi B, it\u2019s Minaj\u2019s futuristic bodysuit that ultimately shines the brightest.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a2b17cb69b3cf6467ebebdb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-migos-nicki-minaj.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Nicki Minaj Is a Futuristic Barbie in Migos\u2019s Neon Bright Video for \u201cMotorsport\u201d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9v_rtaye2yY"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
