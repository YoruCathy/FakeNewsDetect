U need help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is from Chyna yesterday to me,\u201d Rob wrote in the caption of the naked photo of Chyna. \u201cI never been so disrespected in my life. I just bought her 250K of jewelry yesterday. This woman is so disrespectful and I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nFollowing on from his tirade, Rob moved on to Twitter where he continued the rant. In his Tweets the star alleged that Chyna had only agreed to marry him and have a child with him out of 'spite' for Kylie Jenner and Tyga's romance.\n\n\"Soon as kylie and tyga broke up Chyna was over the game. She had a baby out of spite and I'll never view her the same,\" he wrote.\n\nShould Chyna choose to pursue legal action against Rob, he could face serious consequences. California, which both Rob and Chyna call home, has had a revenge porn law since 2013, TMZ reports.\n\n\"A person who intentionally distributes the image of the intimate body part of another ... knowing they'll cause emotional distress\" is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in jail, the law states.\n\nHowever, problems between the two appear to go deeper as Chyna has responded to the social media tirade with worrying accusations of domestic abuse.\n\n\"Rob u did all this but u beat me up and try act it never happen!!!!!\u201d she wrote on Snapchat. \u201cU put hand on me I swear on god!!!! On my kids but I\u2019m supposed to be quiet because you\u2019re a Kardashian.\u201d\n\nThe concerning accusations have not yet been elaborated on by Chyna or her team, and Rob is yet to respond.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, contact 1800 Respect (1800 737 732)", "images": ["http://www.instylemag.com.au/media/6155/170706-blac-rob.jpg", "https://snowplow.swm.digital/i?e=se&se_ca=ping&tv=http-get-0.1.0&dtm=0&stm=0&tna=pac&p=web", "https://www.instylemag.com.au/Branding/InStyle/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "https://www.instylemag.com.au/Branding/InStyle/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.instylemag.com.au/media/41281/ps-xxx-bws-dropdown-mag-sub-image-is.jpg?height=158"], "top_img": "http://www.instylemag.com.au/media/6155/170706-blac-rob.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tina Burke"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instylemag.com.au/rob-kardashian-accuses-blac-chyna-of-cheating-during-explicit-social-media-rant", "title": "Rob Kardashian Shares Revenge Porn Images Of Blac Chyna During Explicit Social Media Rant", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Rob Kardashian's Instagram account has been deactivated after he shared a series of explicit images of, and made several expletive ridden accusations against, ex-fiancee Blac Chyna.", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "InStyle", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.instylemag.com.au/rob-kardashian-accuses-blac-chyna-of-cheating-during-explicit-social-media-rant", "title": "Rob Kardashian Shares Revenge Porn Images Of Blac Chyna During Explicit Social Media Rant", "description": "Rob Kardashian's Instagram account has been deactivated after he shared a series of explicit images of, and made several expletive ridden accusations against, ex-fiancee Blac Chyna.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.instylemag.com.au/media/6155/170706-blac-rob.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"title": "Rob Kardashian Shares Revenge Porn Images Of Blac Chyna During Explicit Social Media Rant", "description": "Rob Kardashian's Instagram account has been deactivated after he shared a series of explicit images of, and made several expletive ridden accusations against, ex-fiancee Blac Chyna.", "image": "http://www.instylemag.com.au/media/6155/170706-blac-rob.jpg", "url": "https://www.instylemag.com.au/rob-kardashian-accuses-blac-chyna-of-cheating-during-explicit-social-media-rant"}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499295654.47, "source": "https://www.instylemag.com.au", "summary": ""}
