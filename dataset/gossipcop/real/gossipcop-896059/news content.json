While Porgs won't be the only fascinating creatures introduced to the Star Wars mythos, they do join the Ewoks as one of the most adorable critters in this franchise. Located on Ahch-To (which is also the home of the Caretakers), Porgs will be hanging around while Luke Skywalker is training Rey, but at least one of them will separate from the pack to hang around with our favorite Wookie. There's no word yet on if that one will become a permanent resident aboard the Millennium Falcon. One final note: while the Porgs are indeed adorable, that's something they grow into, as you can see when looking at them as infants.", "images": ["https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/0/c/4/e/5/b/0c4e5bdf17d979d96c39a853db24d3774d20c849.jpg", "https://sp.analytics.yahoo.com/spp.pl?a=1000772689113&.yp=431002", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR4nGNaOxMAAfwBSW8IE8UAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21229662&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=YourTagID&noscript=1", "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/a/e/f/b/7/2/aefb72cd9fa85eb2ca53243acf56f5499b312fdf.gif"], "top_img": "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/0/c/4/e/5/b/0c4e5bdf17d979d96c39a853db24d3774d20c849.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1729450/watch-chewbacca-smack-a-porg-in-the-latest-star-wars-the-last-footage", "title": "Watch Chewbacca Smack A Porg In The Latest Star Wars: The Last Footage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"tag": "porg", "publisher": "https://www.cinemablend.com/", "published_time": "2017-11-23T19:11:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-08T21:17:47+00:00", "section": "news"}, "CinemaBlend": 15010, "page": "story", "description": "Porgs are adorable, but that doesn't stop Chewbacca from smacking one of them aside in the latest Star Wars: The Last Jedi footage.", "robots": "all", "msvalidate.01": "9AA1A3C35B6D716AE80C1B615C6E8FE8", "fb": {"pages": 90893081682, "app_id": 956050344476201, "admins": 585420252}, "og": {"title": "Watch Chewbacca Smack A Porg In The Latest Star Wars: The Last Footage", "url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1729450/watch-chewbacca-smack-a-porg-in-the-latest-star-wars-the-last-footage", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/0/c/4/e/5/b/0c4e5bdf17d979d96c39a853db24d3774d20c849.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 300}, "description": "Porgs are adorable, but that doesn't stop Chewbacca from smacking one of them aside in the latest Star Wars: The Last Jedi footage.", "type": "article", "site_name": "CINEMABLEND"}, "twitter": {"title": "Watch Chewbacca Smack A Porg In The Latest Star Wars: The Last Footage - CINEMABLEND", "description": "Porgs are adorable, but that doesn't stop Chewbacca from smacking one of them aside in the latest Star Wars: The Last Jedi footage.", "image": "https://img.cinemablend.com/quill/0/c/4/e/5/b/0c4e5bdf17d979d96c39a853db24d3774d20c849.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cinemablend", "url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1729450/watch-chewbacca-smack-a-porg-in-the-latest-star-wars-the-last-footage"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511464292.0, "source": "https://www.cinemablend.com", "summary": ""}
