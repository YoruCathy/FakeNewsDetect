Mindy Kaling has walked her first red carpet since it was revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child. The Wrinkle in Time actress attended the Television Critics Association\u2019s summer press tour to promote her Hulu series The Mindy Project in L.A. on Thursday, July 27.\n\nKaling, who has kept the identity of the father private, opened up about the comedy\u2019s final season and how her character will face mom-shaming.\n\n\n\nTV Pregnancies: How Stars Worked Around Their Baby Bumps\n\n\u201cMarriage was a big [goal] for Mindy and now finally has it and what\u2019s fun about this season is showing the reality of marriage and what lived up to expectations and what didn\u2019t \u2014 and then frankly getting disillusioned with it over the course of the season,\u201d Kaling, 38, told the crowd.\n\nExecutive producer Matt Warburton chimed in: \u201cI think she\u2019s going to learn a little bit more about how to be a good, involved parent. We have a really funny episode where [Modern Family\u2018s] Julie Bowen plays a rival mother who thinks that Mindy\u2019s not doing that great of a job.\u201d\n\n\n\nCelebrity Babies of 2017\n\nKaling \u2014 who was joined by costar Ike Barinholtz (the star wore a neck brace as he recently broke his neck five weeks ago on set of the film The Pact) \u2014 said that the episode was \u201cwas really fun\u201d to do. \u201c[It\u2019s] a little bit about mom-shaming and that\u2019s cool,\u201d she said. \u201c[A] lot those juicy ripped-from-the-blogger-headline storylines.\u201d\n\nDr. Mindy Lahiri, of course, is mom of son Leo with ex Danny Castellano (Chris Messina). The fave TV couple called it quits and she has since moved on with nurse Ben (Bryan Greenberg).\n\nWhen asked if it\u2019s important that her character gets a happily ever after, Kaling replied: \u201cI think that we do, I think we\u2019re romantics. I think that happily ever after can sometimes be romantic happiness and sometimes it can be a feeling of contentment with your life, as a professional and as a mother \u2026 We just have such a good finale that we\u2019ve known about for awhile.\u201d\n\nThe Mindy Project\u2019s final sixth season debuts on Hulu on September 12.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-6083e87c-6c23-4d42-bc4a-166acd87e8f1.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-07f0498e-2631-473c-be82-dca22f28cc9e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1402px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-2-d9540039-d296-4d50-b9e6-361c9a80de4c.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-07f0498e-2631-473c-be82-dca22f28cc9e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1402px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mindy-kaling-walks-first-red-carpet-since-pregnancy-news-photos-w494699/", "title": "Mindy Kaling Walks First Red Carpet Since Pregnancy News: Photos", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Mindy Kaling debuted her tiny baby bump during the 'Mindy Project' TCA panel in L.A. on Thursday, July 27 \u2014 find out what she said about mom-shaming", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mindy Kaling Walks First Red Carpet Since Pregnancy News: Show Will Talk Mom-Shaming", "description": "Mindy Kaling debuted her tiny baby bump during the 'Mindy Project' TCA panel in L.A. on Thursday, July 27 \u2014 find out what she said about mom-shaming", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mindy-kaling-walks-first-red-carpet-since-pregnancy-news-photos-w494699/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:51:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-07f0498e-2631-473c-be82-dca22f28cc9e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1402px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-07f0498e-2631-473c-be82-dca22f28cc9e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1402px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2017-07-28T12:44:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:51:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Mindy Kaling debuted her tiny baby bump during the 'Mindy Project' TCA panel in L.A. on Thursday, July 27 \u2014 find out what she said about mom-shaming", "title": "Mindy Kaling Walks First Red Carpet Since Pregnancy News: Show Will Talk Mom-Shaming", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/mindy-kailing-07f0498e-2631-473c-be82-dca22f28cc9e.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1402px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501245859.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
