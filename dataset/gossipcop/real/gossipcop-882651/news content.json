It seems that Erinn Hayes won\u2019t make even the slightest appearance in Kevin Can Wait\u2019s season 2. In the premiere, which aired on Monday, September 25, it was revealed in the first scene that her character, Donna Gable, had died.\n\nThe CBS comedy briefly mentioned her absence when Kevin Gable (Kevin James) received a postcard for her gym saying they missed her.\n\n\u201cSo do I,\u201d he said. No other details were given as to what happened to Donna, but she was also brought up toward the end of the episode during Kendra\u2019s last-minute wedding.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s] just missing one thing,\u201d Kevin said at the ceremony. Kendra (Taylor Spreitler) replied: \u201cI know, I wish Mom was here too.\u201d Leah Remini\u2019s character, Vanessa, helped organize Kendra\u2019s big day.\n\nAs previously reported, it was announced in June that Remini was bumped to a series regular after she guest starred on the series on season 1. On the same day, CBS revealed that Hayes would be leaving the sitcom.\n\n\u201cTrue, I\u2019ve been let go from the show. Very sad, I had a great experience season 1. Thank you for all the support from our wonderful fans,\u201d Hayes tweeted at the time. Last month, executive producer Rob Long said that they killed off Donna \u201cout of respect.\u201d\n\nRemini, meanwhile, is ecstatic to be teaming up again with her former King of Queens costar. \u201cI have been having the time of my life being reunited with my favorite funny man @officialkevinjames,\u201d she captioned an Instagram photo of the pair on Monday. \u201cNot often in life do you get to go back and add to already amazing memories. Thank you @cbstv and the cast and crew @kevincanwaitcbs for welcoming me! And to all of you who have been so incredibly supportive, we thank you! #blessings.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/leah-remini-b78d4037-3e4b-429f-b432-3000710aafed.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-can-wait-a7730d05-0fed-4d50-9853-b393c015ef37.jpg?crop=0px%2C3px%2C910px%2C478px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-can-wait-a7730d05-0fed-4d50-9853-b393c015ef37.jpg?crop=0px%2C3px%2C910px%2C478px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/how-kevin-can-wait-dealt-with-donnas-death-in-season-2-premiere-w505416/", "title": "How \u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 Dealt With Donna\u2019s Death in Season 2 Premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kevin Can Wait's season 2 premiere didn't go into much detail about the death of Erinn Hayes' character \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How 'Kevin Can Wait' Dealt With Donna's Death in Season 2 Premiere", "description": "Kevin Can Wait's season 2 premiere didn't go into much detail about the death of Erinn Hayes' character \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/how-kevin-can-wait-dealt-with-donnas-death-in-season-2-premiere-w505416/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:30:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-can-wait-a7730d05-0fed-4d50-9853-b393c015ef37.jpg?crop=0px%2C3px%2C910px%2C478px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-can-wait-a7730d05-0fed-4d50-9853-b393c015ef37.jpg?crop=0px%2C3px%2C910px%2C478px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Fall TV", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-09-26T12:34:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:30:21+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kevin Can Wait's season 2 premiere didn't go into much detail about the death of Erinn Hayes' character \u2014 get the details", "title": "How 'Kevin Can Wait' Dealt With Donna's Death in Season 2 Premiere", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kevin-can-wait-a7730d05-0fed-4d50-9853-b393c015ef37.jpg?crop=0px%2C3px%2C910px%2C478px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506429240.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
