Case in point: This weekend, New Yorker writer Hannah Goldfield intercepted an accidental leak of a guest notes spreadsheet from an unnamed celebrity hot spot, and many of these notes are hilariously strange.\n\nSoothing my anxiety by slowly savoring this spreadsheet of notes on customers that a restaurant accidentally attached to an email blast pic.twitter.com/X4oXBXPqpY \u2014 Hannah Goldfield (@hannahgoldfield) July 7, 2017\n\nHere are a few takeaways from this epic Twitter thread:\n\nGoldfield remarks that this spreadsheet has over 30,000 notes on guests. The identity of the restaurant remains a mystery, but if you have any guesses \u2014 or any other great stories about POS notes concerning celebrities and/or wannabe VIPs \u2014 please share them in the comments of this post.\n\n\u2022 @hannagoldfied [Twitter]\n\n\u2022 All Pop Culture Coverage [E]", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667789/shutterstock_1485451799.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNpFieeEc5g2nh2_QfmYnUNfODE=/0x103:2000x1228/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642947/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66573805/EatHome_Lede_HowtoPantryCook.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ldH_zBaw54frSwhBcN2ZqSjEXEw=/0x0:2000x1330/1200x800/filters:focal(840x505:1160x825)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642951/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672408/french_toast_eater.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66668122/1216654248.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670656/killing_eve_s3_ep1_sandra_oh.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670290/tosi_baking.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNpFieeEc5g2nh2_QfmYnUNfODE=/0x103:2000x1228/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642947/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Greg Morabito", "Ellie Krupnick", "Eater Staff", "Kelly Hoover Greenway", "Brenna Houck", "Jaya Saxena", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.eater.com/2017/7/10/15947070/restaurant-guest-notes-leak-opentable", "title": "Mystery Restaurant Accidentally Leaks Hilarious Notes About Its Guests", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Eater", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/eater", "published_time": "2017-07-10T11:32:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-10T11:32:02-04:00"}, "author": "Greg Morabito", "fb": {"pages": "6029273333,242726355745404,115169205199800,139755792796580,131547960225574,213601342019363,301223156562915,309491225851948,243335249017579,348494641841991,109814609047278,442143005803582,110073695686645,385346484849141,451388614896528,240433149442075,670887879603309,150611155024023,176453365796072,110358775652218,465169560201718,105842919452319,213198508690703,192135047484517,243781239374345,111376838888644", "app_id": 549923288395304}, "style-tools": "https://www.eater.com/style/community/450/12d5845ed2d33e4d343f580ee522dcdd/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Tales from the host podium of a celebrity hot spot", "og": {"description": "Tales from the host podium of a celebrity hot spot", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNpFieeEc5g2nh2_QfmYnUNfODE=/0x103:2000x1228/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642947/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "height": 900, "width": 1600}, "site_name": "Eater", "title": "Mystery Restaurant Accidentally Leaks Hilarious Notes About Its Guests", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.eater.com/2017/7/10/15947070/restaurant-guest-notes-leak-opentable"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.eater.com/2017/7/10/15947070/restaurant-guest-notes-leak-opentable", "title": "Mystery Restaurant Accidentally Leaks Hilarious Notes About Its Guests", "description": "Tales from the host podium of a celebrity hot spot", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNpFieeEc5g2nh2_QfmYnUNfODE=/0x103:2000x1228/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642947/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "site": "Eater"}, "sailthru.title": "Mystery Restaurant Accidentally Leaks Hilarious Notes About Its Guests", "sailthru.tags": "general,eater,front-page,news,pop-culture", "sailthru.description": "Tales from the host podium of a celebrity hot spot", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-10T11:32:02-04:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TNpFieeEc5g2nh2_QfmYnUNfODE=/0x103:2000x1228/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642947/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwX0qXKuMN7szxmIAPObX0du3Ww=/335x0:1665x1330/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55642947/waiter_at_a_celebrity_hot_spot.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6253179/apple-touch-icon-144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#e20000", "outbrainsection": "news"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499616000.0, "source": "https://www.eater.com", "summary": ""}
