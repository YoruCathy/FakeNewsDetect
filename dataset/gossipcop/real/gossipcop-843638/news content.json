{"url": "https://www.wwe.com/shows/totaldivas/article/natalya-total-divas-season-7-interview", "text": "When Total Divas premieres tomorrow for Season 7, Natalya will once again allow the WWE Universe behind the scenes. And that\u2019s a bigger deal than you might think; The Queen of Harts has been a cast member on the E! reality show since its very first episode \u2014 one of only three Superstars to claim that honor \u2014 and the upcoming slate of episodes will showcase her run to the SmackDown Women\u2019s Championship and the first-ever Women\u2019s Money in the Bank Ladder Match. Natalya spoke with WWE about the season, dealing with Lana and the ever-increasing wealth of her cat.\n\nWWE.COM: Congratulations on the new season. How does it feel?\n\nNATALYA: Oh, thanks very much! It\u2019s incredible to be going into our seventh season, and by the time the season finale happens, I\u2019ll have been in 100 episodes of Total Divas. Which, to me, is crazy to think we\u2019ve had the WWE Universe on this journey with us for 100 episodes, but it\u2019s also a huge honor.\n\nWWE.COM: You are one of the few Superstars who has been on the show the entire time without leaving for a season and coming back. How does it feel to be one of the veterans of the show?\n\nTo be able to showcase [my] journey from Season 1 and have it finally reach fruition on Season 7 has been a dream come true. - Natalya\n\nNATALYA: I think it\u2019s been, for me, a journey, to be on this show since day one. It\u2019s so cool that I\u2019ve been able to allow the audience to be on that journey with me, that roller coaster of life. And we\u2019ve never, ever let cameras behind the scenes before like this. We\u2019ve never done a reality show like this before. So, to be able to share with the world what it is that we do, what makes us laugh, what makes us cry, what drives us nuts, what gets on our nerves \u2013 being able to share that sisterhood with the girls is most important. My life in and out of the ring isn\u2019t the five minutes you see me on SmackDown or Raw or WWE programming. There\u2019s so much more. To get to work is a struggle sometimes. It\u2019s planes, trains and automobiles; [the week of] Hurricane Irma we almost didn\u2019t make it to SmackDown LIVE.\n\nTotal Divas allows us to document these journeys in and out of the ring and show you go through the heartaches and heartbreaks of life and the moments we come together like sisters. There are girls I love, but drive me crazy in the same breath. Like Lana. She\u2019s really somebody that I\u2019ve built a friendship with, but she\u2019s like a sister. We have moments where we fight. I just came back from a tour of China with her, and in the same breath of me hugging her, I was ready to bodyslam her. And not in the ring. So, it\u2019s really, really special. I\u2019ve never once taken the show for granted, and to be on the show since the very beginning, I feel so honored that the WWE Universe and the upper brass and everybody that I work with can see me as somebody that people want to watch.\n\nWWE.COM: Alexa Bliss, Carmella and Nia Jax are joining the show this season. What was it like welcoming them into this weird little corner of the WWE world you occupy?\n\nYou see us on TV, and you think something of us, and then we bring you back down to earth, open up and show you we\u2019re really just like everyone else. - Natalya\n\nNATALYA: When I look at my favorite TV shows \u2014 for example, \u201cSeinfeld\u201d is one of my all-time favorite TV shows \u2013 I love watching George, Elaine, Kramer and Jerry. They feel like friends to me. I feel like myself, Naomi and The Bella Twins are all old friends because we\u2019re from the very, very beginning of the show. But I also love it when we get new cast members on because I think it really spices things up. It really adds to the flavor and keeps things moving and new. You love your friends, but you also love seeing and meeting new girls. Alexa, Nia and Carmella are girls I love, and I enjoy working with all of them. I respect those three girls very, very much. They\u2019re great partners and opponents in the ring, but they\u2019re also human. So, in real life, it\u2019s great to showcase our friendship behind the scenes and how we interact with each other. It\u2019s refreshing to have new blood. And Nia has a larger than life personality, and Alexa is so much more than what we see in the ring. She plays this mean girl on TV, but she\u2019s so real and relatable in real life. She\u2019s somebody that I just enjoy being around. And Carmella is one of my best friends on SmackDown. I\u2019ve really become friends with her over the last year. I love hanging out with her and spending time with her. She\u2019s become one of my close friends.\n\nWWE.COM: This season will also show your path to the SmackDown Women\u2019s Championship. What was it like having the cameras rolling as you reached that goal?\n\nSince Day One of Total Divas, we\u2019ve been documenting this journey of me trying to win the championship. And a lot of people thought it would never happen. - Natalya\n\nNATALYA: It\u2019s such a crazy feeling that I got to reach my dream of becoming the Women\u2019s Champion. Since Day One of Total Divas, we\u2019ve been documenting this journey of me trying to win the championship. And a lot of people thought it would never happen, even some of my own co-workers. \u201cYou\u2019ve never gonna get it, it\u2019s not your time.\u201d For me, I always felt in my heart it would happen, but I had to keep going, I had to persevere and not give up. And to be able to showcase that journey from Season 1 and have it finally reach fruition on Season 7 has been a dream come true. It\u2019s a really great example for people \u2014 for women, especially, who watch the show, that when you have a dream, it\u2019s important not to give up on it. There were so many times I wanted to throw in the towel and be like, \u201cMaybe this isn\u2019t for me anymore; maybe I don\u2019t belong here anymore; maybe it\u2019s not my time anymore; maybe my time has passed.\u201d And that is just so very wrong now because I can truly say that within WWE, if I had said my time has passed, I never would have made history this past year the way I did.\n\nThere\u2019s so many incredible things I\u2019ve done in WWE. I was part of the first-ever Women\u2019s Tables Match in WWE. I was part of the first-ever Women\u2019s Ladder Match in WWE. At Hell in a Cell, I surpassed Trish Stratus\u2019 record of having the most pay-per-view matches of any woman in the history of WWE. I\u2019ve done all these monumental things, but the one thing I wanted to do was win the Women\u2019s Championship. And now I get to share that joy on Total Divas. It\u2019s the fairy-tale ending I dreamed of, and I\u2019m so happy everybody gets to watch it.\n\nWWE.COM: This also appears to be the first season in a while where nobody\u2019s getting married. Does that make it more or less stressful knowing you won\u2019t have to travel to an exotic location for a ceremony this time around?\n\nNATALYA: Well, Lana took a lot out of all of us with that Bulgarian wedding. She had two weddings, so that was enough for a couple of seasons. Had a couple temper tantrums as well. [Laughs] I had to talk Lana off a couple ledges, but we made it through. It\u2019s funny, because Lana\u2019s actually become a close friend of mine, but that\u2019s part of why I love her. She\u2019s not afraid to have a temper tantrum and then apologize after. It\u2019s part of what makes her Lana. And relatable. But there\u2019ll be other things [we\u2019ll see on this season.] We\u2019ve seen weddings on every season, and that\u2019s great because that\u2019s really what happened. I really got married. Some people were like, \u201cOh, she just did that for the reality show.\u201d No! I really got married. It was a real thing! I have a real marriage certificate. I really did that.\n\nI\u2019ve never once taken the show for granted, and to be on the show since the very beginning, I feel so honored. - Natalya\n\nIf you watch Total Divas, even though we\u2019re on TV every week, we all seem larger than life. You see Alexa winning championships and Nikki being featured on \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d Maryse announcing her pregnancy and Lana jumping into new roles of not managing Rusev anymore but stepping into the ring. You see Carmella winning Money in the Bank and all these different things all of us girls are doing. But what I love the most about this show is that people can watch us and go, \u201cthey\u2019re just like us!\u201d They have the same fears, the same hopes, the same dreams, the same insecurities. We\u2019re all human, and that\u2019s what\u2019s great about the show. You see us on TV, and you think something of us, and then we bring you back down to earth, open up and show you we\u2019re really just like everyone else.\n\nWWE.COM: Last but not least, will we be seeing anymore of the iconic 2Pawz this year?\n\nNATALYA: Oh, you will definitely get to see more of the iconic 2Pawz. I\u2019ve made sure to talk to Peyton Royce and Billie Kay about the word \u201ciconic,\u201d and they\u2019re more than happy to lend it to me in talking about 2Pawz. Let me just tell you this: He\u2019s as rich and famous as he\u2019s ever been, and it\u2019s only going to get better from here. He\u2019s getting ready to drop a rap album, drop a perfume line, and he\u2019s got a fleet of Pawzerattis in our garage ready to rock and roll for all the beautiful women that are lined up to have dates with him. Like a true reality star.\n\nWatch Natalya on Season 7 of Total Divas, Wednesdays at 9/8 C, only on E!.", "images":
