While the latter stays (presumably) forever, non-Netflix content typically has an expiration date.\n\nThat's why next month movies like 13 Assassins, The Road and The 40 Year Old Virgin are all on their way out.\n\nIf you haven't seen any of those films, do yourself a favor and go watch them. The Road is a pretty dark take on the apocalypse. As in, it's dark even for a post-apocalyptic movie which, by definition, is going to be a little dark. But you can wash off all that grimdark with the fun humor in The 40 Year Old Virgin starring Steve Carell.\n\nKids take the biggest hit next month, losing Disney/Pixar's Finding Dory, along with seasons of Care Bears, Pound Puppies and Littlest Pet Shop.\n\nFor my part, I just really need to watch 13 Assassins which leaves on the 5th. It's been on my watch-list forever, but now that it's leaving Netflix it's time to stop procrastinating.\n\nHer's everything leaving Netflix in August.
