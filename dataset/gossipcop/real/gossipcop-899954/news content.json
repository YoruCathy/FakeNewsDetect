We all love the man, right?\n\nThat's why his hiatus from social media stunned us all exactly two years ago on this day.\n\nThe British singer-songwriter with unfathomable popularity and love on a global level shocked his fans by sharing about his digital detox on Instagram.\n\nHe announced a break from what many people deem as an inseparable part of life, 'phone, email and social media'. His post read:\n\nA year ago, he talked about how life's different and better in ways he did not imagine post this decision. Keeping his cell phone at bay proved to be so liberating that he now has completed two years without it.\n\nCan you imagine going two days without your phone?\n\nThe acclaimed singer re-posted the message on Instagram and captioned it as, \"2 years since I ditched my phone x\".\n\nEarlier this year, he had revealed that tossing his phone was a New Year's resolution in an attempt to decrease stress on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\n\nHe said, \"I bought an iPad, and then I just work off of email, and it's so much less stress. I don't wake up in the morning and have to answer 50 messages of people asking for stuff. It's just like, I wake up and have a cup of tea.\"\n\nSounds peaceful, right? Yet we are hooked onto social media like it's our lifeline.\n\nSheeran told E! News about this break from the spotlight recently. He said, \"I feel like life is all about balance, and my life wasn't balanced. Taking it all off the scale balanced it, oddly enough.\"\n\nHe even deleted Twitter this July over what he described a \"headfuck\" due to brutal internet trolls. He had explained, \"I go on it and there's nothing but people saying mean things. One comment ruins your day.\"\n\nWould you dare to ditch your phone?", "images": ["https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/anj/bb/714d6515-b8fe-437a-b369-e4566afc79d0_3.jpg", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/v4/newdesignassets/static/sw/newDesign/desktop/images/scoopwhoop_new.png", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/ed/4a72801d-9d05-4090-9838-a8900d2a005f_3.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/956616734/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://s3.scoopwhoop.com/anj/ed/924d415c-36c4-4655-b5f2-f421bce643b9_3.jpg", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/bb/1bc63855-05f5-4239-9f3d-9a7cf7b4bc19.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=31744522&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/v4/newdesignassets/static/sw/newDesign/desktop/images/vagabomb_new.png", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/ed/37f0ab52-9ffe-4d52-a4cc-6e5687f23275_3.jpg", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/9c06bd1a0f5b4983876c15cc822fa2c6/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/v4/newdesignassets/static/sw/newDesign/desktop/images/sketches_new.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1511988929032581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/v4/newdesignassets/static/sw/newDesign/desktop/images/unscripted_new.png", "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/v4/newdesignassets/static/sw/newDesign/desktop/images/oktested_new.png"], "top_img": "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/bb/1bc63855-05f5-4239-9f3d-9a7cf7b4bc19.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rishita Roy Chowdhury"], "canonical_link": "https://www.scoopwhoop.com/ed-sheeran-digital-detox/", "title": "Having Not Used His Phone In 2 Years, Ed Sheeran Reflects On Life With A Digital Detox", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5", "google-signin-client_id": "286947471023-1gd3gh9mob8tslujirk4cbvgmg2eppr5.apps.googleusercontent.com", "fb": {"pages": 110141895861579, "app_id": 915004185247274}, "google-site-verification": "w-5K8RO4qUtBEZjM1qwB_3Waul01CrTH0UV_pZGN7mg", "msvalidate.01": "8677646C2CE716FE237A1E2DC9569AE8", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ScoopWhoop", "theme-color": "#ffec41", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/v4/newdesignassets/sw_icons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "description": "Worth a try.", "Author": "ScoopWhoop", "language": "English", "robots": "index, follow", "author": "Rishita Roy Chowdhury", "og": {"title": "Having Not Used His Phone In 2 Years, Ed Sheeran Reflects On Life With A Digital Detox", "url": "https://www.scoopwhoop.com/ed-sheeran-digital-detox/", "image": "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/bb/1bc63855-05f5-4239-9f3d-9a7cf7b4bc19.jpg", "description": "Worth a try.", "locale": "En"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Scoopwhoop", "published_time": "2017-12-19T17:33:18+05:30", "modified_time": "2017-12-19T17:33:18+05:30", "author": "Rishita Roy Chowdhury", "section": "music"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ScoopWhoop", "creator": "@ScoopWhoop", "image": "https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj/bb/1bc63855-05f5-4239-9f3d-9a7cf7b4bc19.jpg", "description": "Worth a try.", "title": "Having Not Used His Phone In 2 Years, Ed Sheeran Reflects On Life With A Digital Detox", "url": "https://www.scoopwhoop.com/ed-sheeran-digital-detox/", "domain": "scoopwhoop.com"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513684998.0, "source": "https://www.scoopwhoop.com", "summary": ""}
