With music by Tony and Oscar winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dear Evan Hansen, La La Land), there was much anticipation leading up to Fox\u2019s second live musical broadcast. (The network first jumped into the scene with Grease: Live in 2016.)\n\nCo-directed by eight-time Tony nominee Scott Ellis (She Loves Me) as the stage director and Alex Rudzinksi as the live television director, the broadcast starred Saturday Night Live alum Maya Rudolph as Mrs. Parker, Chris Diamontopoulos (Waitress) as Mr. Parker, Tony winner Jane Krakowski as Miss Shields, Ana Gasteyer as Mrs. Schwartz, and Andy Walken as Ralphie Parker.\n\nJust as Grease: Live kicked off with a pop star performance from Jessie J, Bebe Rexha opened the broadcast with the new song \u201cCount on Christmas\u201d:\n\nTony winner Matthew Broderick served as the \u201cgrown up\u201d version of Ralphie Parker, narrating the story of the kid desperate for an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle. In this clip, Broderick narrates the opening scene and audiences meet Walken as young Ralphie singing the Act 1 opener, \u201cIt All Comes Down to Christmas.\u201d\n\n\n\nViewers got to know Ralphie\u2019s dad, played by Diamontopolous, a bit better in the next number \u201cThe Genius On Cleveland Street\u201d as he dreams of being the best crossword-puzzle solver. It\u2019s the simple things in life:\n\n\n\nAt school, Ralphie struggled with bullying problems. In this song on the playground, the kids of A Christmas Story Live! sing \u201cWhen You\u2019re a Wimp.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn another dream-like sequence, Ralphie saves the day in \u201cRalphie to the Rescue\u201d:\n\n\n\nThe famous leg lamp, now symbolic of A Christmas Story, inspires the next number, \u201cA Major Award\u201d:\n\n\n\nPasek and Paul wrote a new song for the December 17 event: \u201cIn the Market for a Miracle.\u201d Drama Desk winner Gasteyer played Mrs. Schwartz, the mother of one of Ralphie\u2019s friends, and sang the new song about celebrating Chanukah amidst the typical Christmas festivities. Watch her belt it out here:\n\n\n\nIn this iconic moment from the movie, Ralphie\u2019s friend Flick gets his tongue stuck to the flagpole in \u201cSticky Situation\u201d:\n\n\n\nIn this fantasy sequence, Ralphie\u2019s teacher Miss Shields (Krakowski) wows in a traditional musical theatre showstopper. Zach Woodlee\u2019s choreography takes center stage in this number. Complete with sequins and top hats, Krakowski sings and taps to \u201cYou\u2019ll Shoot Your Eye Out\u201d to explain to Ralphie why his theme will never work:\n\n\n\nLike any kids, Ralphie and his brother, Randy, can\u2019t sleep on Christmas Eve because they\u2019re too busy tracking Santa\u2019s path in \u201cSomewhere Hovering Over Indiana\u201d:\n\n", "images": ["https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/e2ff6ca/2147483647/thumbnail/812x424/resize/1200x627/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2Fd3%2Fbef44aec472e9fabf4c2b87574c2%2Fscreen-shot-2017-11-01-at-9.25.54%20AM.png", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/s-img/bcEFAButton.jpg", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/45/f3/cc2142224db6844ce7cebc51fc13/covid-ghost-light-icon.png", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/7018131/2147483647/resize/114x15/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2Fff%2F19d7acd74ba997d28c71f3e4fb43%2Fbrightspot.png", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/s-img/actorsFundButton.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=33044428&cv=3.1&cj=1", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/c8/ce/183565db4e49acf3c331b3e605c7/uat.playbill.psdops-1.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d4EOGSLZ4snXA.gif", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/bdb3441/2147483647/crop/3000x1689%2B0%2B127/resize/970x546/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9a%2F0f%2Fb736a9044a03bcfb8c098e317260%2Frvm-7569-hires2.jpg", "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/9cc3589/2147483647/thumbnail/300x300/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F63%2Ff208a3cd47c6833ea04b1dfb10b7%2Fpcart.Sq.Trans.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=925349244281937&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/e2ff6ca/2147483647/thumbnail/812x424/resize/1200x627/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2Fd3%2Fbef44aec472e9fabf4c2b87574c2%2Fscreen-shot-2017-11-01-at-9.25.54%20AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://www.playbill.com/article/relive-the-tk-musical-numbers-from-a-christmas-story-live", "title": "Relive 10 Musical Numbers From A Christmas Story Live!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Relive 10 Musical Numbers From A Christmas Story Live! | Playbill", "description": "In case you missed it: Here\u2019s a video recap from the event starring Maya Rudolph, Jane Krakowski, Ana Gasteyer, and more.", "og": {"url": "http://www.playbill.com/article/relive-the-tk-musical-numbers-from-a-christmas-story-live", "site_name": "Playbill", "title": "Relive 10 Musical Numbers From A Christmas Story Live! | Playbill", "description": "In case you missed it: Here\u2019s a video recap from the event starring Maya Rudolph, Jane Krakowski, Ana Gasteyer, and more.", "image": "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/e2ff6ca/2147483647/thumbnail/812x424/resize/1200x627/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2Fd3%2Fbef44aec472e9fabf4c2b87574c2%2Fscreen-shot-2017-11-01-at-9.25.54%20AM.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Relive 10 Musical Numbers From A Christmas Story Live! | Playbill", "description": "In case you missed it: Here\u2019s a video recap from the event starring Maya Rudolph, Jane Krakowski, Ana Gasteyer, and more.", "site": "@playbill", "creator": "@playbill", "image": "https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/b901123/2147483647/crop/812x406%2B0%2B0/resize/1024x512%5E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fed%2Fd3%2Fbef44aec472e9fabf4c2b87574c2%2Fscreen-shot-2017-11-01-at-9.25.54%20AM.png"}, "article": {"published_time": "Mon Dec 18 11:21:35 EST 2017", "author": "Ruthie Fierberg", "section": "Features"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/13hdKXfku4M", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/80U9tCySMR0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FZTwl2LZijo", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXTQoUH8vRM", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/yI7qQ85DTZY", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3j2xHG-gqK8", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/xzkb9bDDgfs", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uVikwGl9k0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/plnzNgtvvJo", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqHOx5uB4a8"], "publish_date": 1513567295.0, "source": "http://www.playbill.com", "summary": ""}
