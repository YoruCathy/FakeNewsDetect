Various posthumous biographies have mentioned his bisexuality, and Brando himself was quoted in one of those biographies as saying he had \u201chomosexual experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a large number of men, I too have had homosexual experiences and am not ashamed,\u201d Brando was quoted in \u201cMarlon Brando, the Only Contender,\u201d according to the New York Daily News.\n\nThe late Richard Pryor also would not be ashamed of the fact that he and Brando enjoyed one of those experiences, Pryor\u2019s widow Jennifer Pryor told TMZ Wednesday.\n\nThe Brando-Pryor hookup first came to light in Quincy Jones\u2019 candid and wide-ranging interview published Wednesday in Vulture. The legendary music producer said he and Brando were longtime friends. So he said he was aware that the Academy Award-winning actor, who embodied a certain male ideal in \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire\u201d and \u201cOn the Waterfront,\u201d liked to have sex \u2014 lots of sex.\n\nJones added that Brando\u2019s partners included other prominent artists and entertainers including James Baldwin, Marvin Gaye \u2014 and Richard Pryor. When the Vulture writer asked if Brando really slept with these men, Jones laughingly said, \u201cCome on, man. He did not give a (expletive).\u201d\n\nJennifer Pryor, the comedy legend\u2019s fourth and final wife, said her husband was similarly inclined to have sex with lots of different partners, female or male.\n\nThis was especially true in 1970s \u2014 after he emerged from the Berkeley counter-culture to enjoy mainstream success in comedy, on TV and in films.\n\nOne of those partners was Brando, she said about her husband, who died in 2005.\n\n\u201cIt was the \u201970s!\u201d Jennifer Pryor said. \u201cDrugs were still good, especially quaaludes. If you did enough cocaine, (have sex) with a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t specify when this hookup with Brando occurred, whether it was as the actor regained his stardom during \u201cThe Godfather\u201d and \u201cLast Tango in Paris\u201d years \u2014 or in the later 1970s when the actor seemed to just enjoy raking in money and phoning in performances in films like \u201cSuperman,\u201d while putting on weight. Brando died in 2004.\n\nMost of all, Jennifer Pryor told TMZ that Pryor wouldn\u2019t have been ashamed about the liaison, given that he was always open about his bisexuality with friends. His sexual orientation also was documented in Scott Saul\u2019s biography \u201cLaughter Along the Path to Oblivion: Becoming Richard Pryor,\u201d the New York Times reported.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/mercurynews/static/images/noimage.jpg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/richardpryor1977.jpg?w=1024&h=696", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/brandotango.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://i2.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ap_910927046.jpg?w=620&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C9999px&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/richardpryor1977.jpg?w=1024&h=696", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
