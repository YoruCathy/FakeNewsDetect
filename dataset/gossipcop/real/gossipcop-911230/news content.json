Monday night. And while she did talk about her disappearance from Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of ABC's dating show, it was her appearance on a Humboldt County, Calif. missing persons list that was largely on Kimmel's mind.\n\nHumboldt County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Samantha Karges told The North Coast Journal Martinez was reported missing on Nov. 18 by her mother who had not heard from her since Nov. 12. Karges said, \"Martinez had reportedly come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.\"\n\nOffering an explanation as to why she made the missing person's list, Martinez said, \"A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying that I was on a farm when I was actually on The Bachelor, but no. I had already been eliminated from the show, and I just decided to go up to the mountains with some friends for a couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,\" she continued.\n\nMartinez told the late night host that after about a week she felt a strong inclination to return home.\n\n\"I just had this weird feeling on like the sixth or seventh day, I was like, 'I need to go home now,'\" she said. \"So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out only 12 hours before my mother had called the Humboldt (County) Sheriff\u2019s (Office) saying that I was missing.\"\n\nSo what was Martinez doing on a marijuana farm exactly? Trying to spice up her Bachelor lower third in case she appears on the franchise again? Not quite, she explained.\n\n\"To set the record straight, I\u2019m not a weed farmer,\" she said. \"I am still a nanny in L.A., but, yes, my friends have a weed farm up in Humboldt County.\"\n\nAs for how she's doing after getting eliminated, Martinez said, \"I'm hanging in there. It was shocking for me as well, but I'm picking up the pieces as I go along.\"\n\nNeed to catch up on The Bachelor?
