You're over levergenging [sic] Kanye's name & asked Kanye to donate money to u so stop w your fake community politics & lies. Truth is you haven't been able to sustain the foundation.\" The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star added, \"I saw you at our studio a few weeks ago so why didn't you bring this up then @RHYMEFEST ? You were trying to get Kanye to listen to your sub par beats. You have the audacity to use Kanye's mom name to try to shead a negative light on Kanye [sic].\" U haven\u2019t been right since u got kicked out of the studio in Hawaii wearing fake Yeezy\u2019s @RHYMEFEST ?

At the time, she tweeted, \"Mental Health is no joke and the media needs to stop spitting that out so casually.

Kanye is years ahead of his time,\" Kardashian wrote.

So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair,\" she wrote.

Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That's just not fair. He's actually out of the sunken place when he's being himself which is very expressive,\" she wrote. He\u2019s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America?

Most people (including myself) have very different feelings & opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion. I believe in people being able to have their own opinions, even if really different from mine. He never said he agrees with his politics,\" she wrote on Twitter. Now when he spoke out about Trump...

Many took this as a sign that he was deteriorating mentally. \"Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye's mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I'm glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening,\" she wrote.
