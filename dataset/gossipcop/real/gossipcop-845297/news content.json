revealed at the London premiere.\n\nAfter lots of speculation, James Gunn told Newsbeat she's in the new film for \"half a second\".\n\nHe said the wrecking ball singer agreed to voice a new character alongside legendary actor Sylvester Stallone.\n\nThe film is out on 28 April, reuniting the cast from the original movie which came out almost three years ago.\n\n\"Well I can't really tell you guys because it's a spoiler in itself to talk about it,\" the director explained.\n\n\"But, near the very end of the movie, there's a new character introduced for just a moment who speaks for half a second with Sylvester Stallone.\"\n\nJames Gunn said he got the American star to take part simply by phoning her.\n\nHe asked: \"Miley would you like to be a voice in a Guardians of the Galaxy movie?\"\n\nShe said yes.\n\n'I love her voice, I think it's amazing'\n\nHe says he wanted Miley because her voice has \"a great harshness to it that is awesome\" and he thought \"it would be perfect for a robot\".\n\nWhen asked about the third intergalactic blockbuster, the director told Newsbeat we could be seeing more of her character.\n\n\"I would love to see Miley come back and do more stuff with us and I'd love to see that character come back.\n\n\"It's a real fun character, I have good things in store.\"\n\nThe movie brings together the cast of the original including Chris Pratt, who plays lead character Star-Lord.\n\nIt means Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Glenn Close and Karen Gillan return, along with the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper.\n\nThe sequel adds Pom Klementieff as alien hero Mantis to the mix, along with cinema icons Kurt Russell, Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone.\n\nThe first Guardians Of The Galaxy film is one of the most successful Marvel movies ever, making more than \u00a3540m at the worldwide box office.\n\nThat's no mean feat, considering Guardians of the Galaxy was a relatively unknown comic compared to the likes of Captain America and Iron Man.\n\nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat", "images":
