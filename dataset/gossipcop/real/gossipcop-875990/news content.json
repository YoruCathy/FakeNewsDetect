In a sneak peek of Swift\u2019s music video, she can be seen sitting on a throne with the words \u201cET TU BRUTE\u201d etched onto the arm.\n\nLast summer, Swift\u2019s feud with West, 40, exploded after Kim Kardashian West, 36, leaked a phone call between the \u201cShake It Off\u201d singer and her husband on Snapchat. In the edited clips of the call, Swift appeared to give West her blessing over a line referencing her in his song, \u201cFamous.\u201d\n\nHowever, Swift hit back at the couple afterwards on Instagram, saying West never told her he was going to call Swift \u201cthat bitch\u201d in his song. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that bitch\u2019 in front of the entire world,\u201d she captioned her post. \u201cHe promised to play the song for me, but he never did.\u201d\n\nSwift and West have had a complicated relationship since 2009, when the rapper interrupted the singer\u2019s best female video acceptance speech at the MTV Video Music Awards. The duo appeared to have patched up their differences and were seen buddying up at the Grammy Awards in 2014 before Swift presented an award to West at the MTV VMAs later that year.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Ftaylor-swift-kanye-west.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Ftaylor-swift-kanye-west.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-reputation-no-correlation-kanye-west-mother-death-anniversary/", "title": "Taylor Swift Not Purposely Releasing Album on Kanye West Mom Death Anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,Reputation,Taylor Swift", "news_keywords": "Kanye West,Kim Kardashian,Music News,News,Reputation,Taylor Swift", "description": "\"We locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases,\" says a label publicist", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Not Purposely Releasing Album on Kanye West Mom Death Anniversary", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-reputation-no-correlation-kanye-west-mother-death-anniversary/", "description": "\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d makes clear there\u2019s still plenty of bad blood between Taylor Swift and Kanye West, but the pop star is&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Ftaylor-swift-kanye-west.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-reputation-no-correlation-kanye-west-mother-death-anniversary/", "description": "\"We locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases,\" says a label publicist", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Ftaylor-swift-kanye-west.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-reputation-no-correlation-kanye-west-mother-death-anniversary/", "title": "Taylor Swift Not Purposely Releasing Album on Kanye West Mom Death Anniversary", "description": "\"We locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases,\" says a label publicist", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2019%2F08%2Ftaylor-swift-kanye-west.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
