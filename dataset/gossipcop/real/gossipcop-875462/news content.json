It was mortifying,\u201d the post reads. \u201cAnd it was non-consensual. And yet: I still didn\u2019t know that it was rape.\u201d\n\nIt was not until he spoke to a social worker at Planned Parenthood that Ammo became aware that interrelationship rape existed and a crime.\n\n\u201cOn this season on MTV\u2019s The Challenge, fans got to see every step of my journey towards recovery. I did The Challenge to prove to myself that I was strong \u2014 that I could do anything. I wanted to show myself, my ex partner, and the world that I was the master of my mind and my body and that NO ONE could take my spirit away from me.\u201d\n\nAfter the wrestling challenge triggered his PTSD, Ammo returned to the United States from Colombia and says he is getting medical and psychological help.\n\nThe musician \u2014 who first hit television screens in The Real World when he was known as Chris \u2014 has asked fans to donate money to help him with his recovery.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fammo-the-challenge-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1430&h=749&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fammo-the-challenge-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20140'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1430&h=749&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F08%2Fammo-the-challenge-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea White"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/the-challenge-ammo-raped-by-former-partner-ptsd-collapse/", "title": "The Challenge's Ammo Reveals He Was Raped By a Former Partner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "News,reality star,Sexual Assault,TV,TV Watch", "news_keywords": "News,reality star,Sexual Assault,TV,TV Watch", "description": "\"In November of 2016 I was raped in my own bed by my former partner,\" the former Mormon writes. \"I remember saying 'no' and 'I don't want to' but my partner insisted that he was going to 'make me take it' and teach me 'how to be a man.' \"", "og": {"title": "The Challenge's Ammo Reveals He Was Raped By a Former Partner", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/the-challenge-ammo-raped-by-former-partner-ptsd-collapse/", "description": "MTV star Ammo has revealed he was the victim of a sexual assault at the hands of an ex.
