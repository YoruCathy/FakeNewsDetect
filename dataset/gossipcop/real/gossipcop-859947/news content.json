An aimless and depressed A.J. decides to join the Army \u2014 in the middle of the war in Afghanistan, no less \u2014 only for Tony and Carmela to bribe him with a \u201cdevelopment executive\u201d role on a Tony-financed movie. And in a scene that delivers the pathos we\u2019d expect from a beloved and long-lived series saying its goodbyes, Tony comes to terms with the extent of Uncle Junior\u2019s dementia.\n\nYet almost none of these moments made a lasting impression, because none of them drove the show\u2019s audience into as much of a collective frenzy as what came next: nothing. More specifically, 10 seconds of pitch-black silence that blindsided us to the point of wondering if our TVs were malfunctioning. Within hours, theories proliferated (what was with the bathroom guy?), blog posts raged (what a cop-out!), and all the while, the creative team kept their mouths firmly sealed \u2014 an omert\u00e1 creator David Chase still hasn\u2019t broken. Ten years later this Saturday, we\u2019re still feeling the aftershocks. Just as The Sopranos revolutionized our idea of what a great TV series can be, \u201cMade in America\u201d revolutionized our idea of how a great TV series can end.\n\nThe television finale has always been a tricky gambit; a series\u2019 end is a chance to deliver on the one thing TV is expressly designed not to provide: conclusiveness. Television\u2019s goal is to keep going, and its writers will renege on any number of plot developments to meet that goal. Characters can come back from the dead, or reappear in flashbacks, or return for a check-in after being written off; one season\u2019s long-teased romantic payoff can be the next\u2019s beleaguered relationship. Series finales, meanwhile, fight against TV\u2019s every impulse; they are the end of the road, so to speak.\n\nPrior to The Sopranos, finales could shock and surprise, but they always did so in fairly specific, limited ways. There was the infamous \u201cit was all a dream!\u201d maneuver, the instant clich\u00e9 codified by the one-two punch of the ninth season of Dallas in 1986 and St. Elsewhere two years later; this option was jaw-dropping in the moment, but at the expense of cheapening everything the audience had spent months or years investing in. There was the meta grace note: The Cosby Show breaking the fourth wall by panning out to the studio audience, and Newhart retroactively framing itself not just as a dream, but the dream of its star\u2019s last lead sitcom role. And there was Seinfeld\u2019s misanthropic middle finger: sending the central quartet to prison. Sometimes, a show just ran out of source material, as in M*A*S*H\u2019s self-explanatory \u201cGoodbye, Farewell, and Amen\u201d \u2014 the war ends, so the characters say \u2026 goodbye, farewell, and amen. At more than 100 million viewers, M*A*S*H remains the most-viewed series finale in history, and one of the more textbook examples of how to revisit a series\u2019 highlights while closing up shop.\n\nAll those finales conditioned viewers to have certain requirements (self-congratulation, bow-tying for each major character and plot) for a satisfying farewell. \u201cMade in America\u201d proceeded to disregard all of them \u2014 or more accurately, to come close enough to tease the possibility of a more traditional close before yanking it away with a single cut to black. Upon rewatch, the ramp-up to the abrupt silence is as unbearably tense as it was in 2007. If Tony wasn\u2019t headed toward something explosive, why the cutaways to all the other diner customers, as if to implicate them? Why does the camera linger on Meadow\u2019s amateur parallel parking job? Why drop a music cue as pointedly ironic as Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d epic and inspiring in contrast to a scene that was presumably meant to be the opposite? Sure, the episode ends with an anticlimax \u2014 but that anticlimax manages to land with heart-stopping force.\n\nBut tension alone doesn\u2019t explain why \u201cIs Tony dead or isn\u2019t he?\u201d so dominated, and continues to dominate, the discussion surrounding The Sopranos\u2019 ending. A scumbag who\u2019s killed or alienated everyone of real importance to him outside of his nuclear family, Tony Soprano spent six seasons evading the fate most mass-market fiction delivers the wicked. In one last casual shrugging off of TV\u2019s once-bedrock rules, \u201cMade in America\u201d confirmed we\u2019d never see Tony truly suffer for his sins \u2014 at least onscreen. It made sense in context: Why wouldn\u2019t the show that confronted us with a protagonist murdering a man with his bare hands in its fifth-ever episode continue to push the limits of what we find acceptable, even appealing, in its final moments? But to float the idea of karma at long last coming for the crime boss of Northern Jersey and then give him a free pass seemed unthinkable, and so a sizable plurality of viewers has refused to acknowledge it. Tony had to be dead, and the only question was how; hence the 16 million-plus Google results for \u201cman in Members Only jacket,\u201d and the theorizing over jacket man\u2019s motivation (as if Tony Soprano\u2019s killer would need any), or the endless accusations that the cut to black was somehow a dodge. All Chase gave the masses to go on was that everything we needed to know was \u201call there\u201d in the episode itself.\n\nChase\u2019s commitment to keeping his open ending open \u2014 foreshadowed, in retrospect, by the still-missing Russian from \u201cPine Barrens\u201d \u2014 led to a brand-new kind of finale: one with no ending at all. Instead of wrapping the series up in a neat and orderly fashion, The Sopranos flabbergasted viewers by declining to even try. This was the series\u2019 latest \u2014 and perhaps greatest \u2014 innovation. Tony was a mobster unlike any we\u2019d seen before, forcing fans to confront what it meant to romanticize a criminal, but he was still a mobster, and one explicitly positioned in the lineage of pop culture mobsters past. (Sil\u2019s Godfather impression!) \u201cMade in America\u201d had no precedent to tweak. Relinquishing a now-or-never shot at resolution for sustained ambiguity remains The Sopranos\u2019 most radical move among many.\n\nConsequently, the \u201cMade in America\u201d\u2013inspired finale has become as much a signifier of a prestige series as the antihero, the dream sequence, and other Sopranos staples \u2014 both in terms of the actual way series end, and also the way audiences anticipate and dissect those endings. Mad Men, The Sopranos\u2019 literal successor (the show premiered just a month after The Sopranos wrapped) as well as its spiritual one (The Sopranos was writer-producer Matthew Weiner\u2019s bridge from CBS sitcoms to cable dramas) continued what \u201cMade in America\u201d started. That series ends with a shot that\u2019s less jarring but equally ambiguous \u2014 a cut from Don Draper\u2019s enigmatic smile at a seaside meditation retreat far from Madison Avenue to the classic Coca-Cola ad he may or may not have subsequently created. The happy ending instantly curdled into an ambivalent one, a rapid pivot audiences felt more prepared to accept and comprehend thanks to its predecessor. In a pre\u2013\u201cMade in America\u201d world, I doubt we would have been so quick to pick up on the Coke ad as evidence Don had turned his enlightenment into yet another consumer product. But in a world where The Sopranos\u2019 vacuum was intentional, Mad Men\u2019s commercial could be part of a show. And just this month, The Leftovers inspired a fresh round of argument over the deliberately unanswered question of whether heroine Nora Durst had actually solved the mystery of the Sudden Departure or just made up a convenient fiction.\n\nBeyond its influence on subsequent finales, though, \u201cMade in America\u201d changed how we think about finales. Never again will we bring the same expectations into a final chapter that Sopranos viewers did when they turned on their sets 10 years ago. Choosing surprise over closure is now considered a feature, not a bug; it\u2019s now widely accepted that a lack of resolution isn\u2019t mutually exclusive with a lack of satisfaction. And finales are now held up as much against The Sopranos\u2019 ability to keep us on our toes as M*A*S*H\u2019s ability to tie up loose ends.\n\nWhile \u201cMade in America\u201d has its imitators, none have matched its force or impact by so totally rearranging our understanding of what TV is obligated to give us. The Sopranos will always have the competitive advantage of working without precedent where its successors now operate in a TV landscape in which violence, sex, and, yes, mystery are now normalized. More than that, The Sopranos came up with an ending just as murky and disorienting as the 85 hours that led up to it. Rather than betray its ethos by bowing to convention, The Sopranos went out on its own terms.\n\nDisclosure: HBO is an initial investor in The Ringer.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66669845/1194991176.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66669036/1211212226.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42P23udpKCc_d4kB0JAkxUGyLy8=/0x156:3000x1844/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55901189/1_FKx9AlhGjA_OAyd26-KxNg.0.gif", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670109/1197847685.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667177/4_17_Desktop_Thumbnail_1.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667782/claire_toohotothandle_netflix_ringer.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667603/fink_ringer_illo.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42P23udpKCc_d4kB0JAkxUGyLy8=/0x156:3000x1844/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/55901189/1_FKx9AlhGjA_OAyd26-KxNg.0.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alison Herman", "Liz Kelly", "Kate Halliwell", "Chris Vernon", "Kevin O'Connor", "The Jj Redick Podcast With Tommy Alter", "Claire Mcnear", "Oliver Lee Bateman", "Jason Concepcion", "Jun"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/9/16038326/sopranos-finale-influence-10-years-later-d0571c03f088", "title": "Ten Years Later, the \u2018Sopranos\u2019 Finale Is Still Revolutionary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Ringer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ringer/", "published_time": "2017-06-09T08:30:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-09T08:30:15-04:00"}, "author": "Alison Herman", "style-tools": "https://www.theringer.com/style/community/723/739655690adad613b032e69b51e66554/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "The Journey song.
