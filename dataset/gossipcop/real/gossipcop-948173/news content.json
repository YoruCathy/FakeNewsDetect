(Which husband Cory Hardrict picked out!)\n\n\u201cThis is baby Cairo. Her name is Cairo Tiahna Hardrict. Cairo, it basically means victorious. My husband was in the air, flying. He always feels like he\u2019s closer to his mother when he\u2019s up in the air. He said when he was flying, he saw the letters A, I, R, in the sky. He said he wanted the baby\u2019s name to have those letters. Tiahna is spelled T-I-A-H-N-A so it has Tia in there. Tiahna actually means follower of Christ. Also, Tiahna is one of the first African princesses so she\u2019s our little princess here!\u201d\n\nThe actress and The Oath actor announced that they were having baby number two in November 2017 and shared that they\u2019d be welcoming a daughter in January.
