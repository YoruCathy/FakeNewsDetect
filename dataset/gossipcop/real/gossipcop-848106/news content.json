There is still hope that we can find Madeleine.\u201d\n\nMs McCann told the BBC: \u201cI think you know we\u2019ve had so many supporters who are still with us, people that we don\u2019t know who are still there, and I guess I just want them to be reassured that there is progress being made.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Mr McCann, 48, acknowledged it was \u201cdevastating\u201d not to have found Madeleine but said the most important thing was holding on to hope of tracing her.\n\n\u201cWe are still looking forward, I think that\u2019s the most important thing \u2013 we still hope,\u201d he said.\n\nDaily coronavirus briefing No hype, just the advice and analysis you need Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Obviously massive events like this cause a lot of reaction, a lot of trauma and upset.\n\n\u201cBut ultimately you have to keep going \u2013 and especially when you have got other children involved.\n\n\u201cSome of that is subconscious I think \u2013 your mind and body just take over to a certain extent. But if you can\u2019t change something immediately, you have to go with it and do the best that you can.\u201d\n\nAdding that she had tried to ensure her now 12-year-old twins had a normal, happy and fulfilling life, Ms McCann, a former GP, said her return to work in another area of medicine had helped her re-establish as normal a life as possible.\n\n\u201cMy hope for Madeleine being out there is no less than it was almost 10 years ago,\u201d Ms McCann said.\n\nEarlier this week, Ms McCann, aged 49, said in a message on the Official Find Madeleine Campaign Facebook page: \u201cWe are bracing ourselves for the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cTen years \u2013 there\u2019s no easy way to say it, describe it, accept it. And now here we are... Madeleine, our Madeleine \u2013 ten years.\n\n\u201cMost days are similar to the rest \u2013 another day. May 3rd 2017 \u2013 another day. But ten years \u2013 a horrible marker of time, stolen time.\u201d\n\nPress Association", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Cooper"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/madeleine-mccann-parents-vow-to-find-her-kate-gerry-portugal-missing-investigation-latest-a7709591.html", "title": "Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents vow to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to find her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/madeleine-mccann-parents-vow-to-find-her-kate-gerry-portugal-missing-investigation-latest-a7709591.html", "title": "Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents vow to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to find her", "description": "\u2018It might not be as quick as we want, but there\u2019s real progress being made and I think we need to take heart from that\u2019", "updated_time": "2017-04-30T00:01:18+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB"}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/7709591"}, "description": "The parents of Madeleine McCann have vowed to do \u201cwhatever it takes for as long as it takes\u201d to find her as they prepare to mark the 10th anniversary of her disappearance.
