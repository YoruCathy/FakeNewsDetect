Not everyone has watched The Sopranos, The Wire, or Breaking Bad, but the people who have watched those shows treat having a blind spot like it\u2019s a federal offense. Most of the time, you\u2019re just shamed into silence. And there\u2019s nothing more uncomfortable than being among a group of friends theorizing about Lost or something, while you nod silently and consider chiming in, even though you have no clue what they\u2019re talking about. (\u201cSo, yeah \u2026 that polar bear, huh?\u201d)\n\nThis week, I had my own reckoning: You see, I never watched Jersey Shore. I knew the reality series was a massive hit on MTV, and I knew what a \u201cSnooki\u201d and a \u201cthe Situation\u201d was, and I kept their livers in my prayers. But I just never tuned in. And as the cast\u2019s spray tans faded into the sunset and out of the zeitgeist, it seemed like this particular pop culture shame would never be resurfaced.\n\nBut now they\u2019re back. On Thursday night, the Jersey Shore crew\u2014minus Sammi, and, for a moment, Mike \u201cthe Situation\u201d Sorrentino, who is mired in a tax evasion trial\u2014returned for a \u201cfamily vacation\u201d to Miami (because while Floribama Shore and Winter Break: Hunter Mountain are entertaining, everyone just wants to see the thing those shows are copies of). The thing about reboots is they can be pretty good gateways for people who missed out on a particular show at the peak of its popularity\u2014and what better time to finally see what all the Jersey Shore fuss was about? Admittedly, this undertaking was also a bit nerve-racking\u2014enough stories about a man yelling about the arrival of taxis and a woman binge-eating ham will do that to a newbie.\n\nBut Jersey Shore Family Vacation truly surprised me. Sure, the premiere episode still featured drunken tirades, but the reunion was also a group of people reconciling with \u201cgrowing up\u201d and the cruel passage of time that nobody\u2014not even self-described guidos and guidettes\u2014is immune to. Snooki and JWoww each have two children; Ronnie\u2019s first child was born this week; Vinny is skinny; and Pauly D \u2026 all right, he hasn\u2019t really changed\u2014still very much a DJ.\n\nDespite being shockingly relatable, however, watching Family Vacation was still like being dropped into a strange country without any tour guide books. With the premiere in the can, here are 22 of the most pressing questions I had after my Jersey Shore experience.\n\n1. Before the premiere even starts, we get some highlights of the entire reunion along with some obscure quotes from the cast. \u201cThings have changed but they really haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Ronnie, a modern philosopher, says. Then Vinny adds: \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, but put us all together and it\u2019s a shit show.\u201d Guys, I\u2019m completely new to this, but isn\u2019t that all self-explanatory, and kind of the point?\n\n2. Speaking of Ronnie, I literally can\u2019t stop staring at this guy. How does this guy look even beefier than he did almost a decade ago? It\u2019s like if you forced Guy Fieri to only chug creatine powder for three months and spray-tanned over his spray tan.\n\n3. Is it more surprising that JWoww has children, or that Snooki has children? JWoww seems pretty put together for a person whose nickname includes three Ws. \u201cThe fish, don\u2019t kill them,\u201d JWoww proclaims to her dimwitted-looking husband, Roger, before leaving for Miami.\n\n4. \u2026 Can we get an update on the goldfish throughout this season? I just want to be sure they\u2019re OK and that Roger hasn\u2019t killed them. I mean, LOOK AT THIS GUY!\n\nRoger is a sentient bowl of chili.\n\n5. Pretty early on, it\u2019s become clear we\u2019re not going to get to Miami for a while because the show is reintroducing everyone with quick life updates. And now, I know Vinny was \u201cthe relatable one,\u201d but wow\u2014is he the most normcore reality star of all time? The guy doesn\u2019t have a spray tan, speaks at a normal volume, and seems to be living a healthy life out on Staten Island.\n\n6. Wait, Vinny also tweets about climate change?!\n\nPer my last tweet about global warming and ppl saying it\u2019s bad when someone from \u201cjersey shore\u201d educates the president etc.I get the joke but why does having a summer shore house automatically make u stupid?No smart ppl ever partied with friends on weekends? \u2014 Vinny Guadagnino (@VINNYGUADAGNINO) December 29, 2017\n\nWho woulda thunk that \u201cguy from Jersey Shore\u201d would become a more reputable description than \u201cguy from The Apprentice.\u201d\n\n7. OH MY GOD, WAIT: HIS MOTHER LIVES ON THE SAME STREET AND STILL DOES HIS LAUNDRY?! I take back the time I said Vinny was \u201cliving a healthy life.\u201d Vinny, you are 30 years old, what are you doing?\n\n8. So far, Vinny\u2019s preached about maintaining his healthy lifestyle while Ronnie, who has a girlfriend who is seven months pregnant, has talked only about how important it is for him to not mess around in Miami. How much do you wanna bet they both break their vows by Episode 3? Is there any chance Vinny doesn\u2019t hurt his liver and Ronnie doesn\u2019t try to, in colloquial Jersey Shore terms, \u201csmush\u201d?\n\n9. Mike \u201cthe Situation\u201d has this tax-evasion case pending, which he describes as the latest, greatest obstacle he\u2019s faced\u2014when he says this, the show cuts to him banging his head against a wall in a previous episode, and fighting with Ronnie, a much larger person. \u201cThey even have the nickname \u2018the Situation\u2019 in the paperwork,\u201d Mike says of his legal situation. \u201cThe United States v. The Situation.\u201d Is that true? I need that to be true.\n\n10. I don\u2019t mean to judge, but aren\u2019t these folks too old for this vacation? I just watched two moms and a boyfriend with a pregnant girlfriend wish their loved ones goodbye to go live in a villa and drink until they pass out for several weekends. It was truly jarring.\n\n11. Upon seeing their Miami villa, Snooki says, \u201cOh my God, this is like Italy.\u201d Hasn\u2019t she been to Italy?\n\n(Italy is not like this.)\n\n12. Vinny just showed up in a Dodge minivan.\n\nI think I love this man?\n\n13. Pauly D arrives with a blow-up doll. Sorry, perhaps I should explain: It\u2019s a blow-up doll in the likeness of Sammi, the only original Jersey Shore member who isn\u2019t at the villa for a reason other than tax evasion issues. She didn\u2019t want to be part of the reunion, apparently, because she thought the getaway would be toxic and bad for her since she just started a new relationship\u2014though her long, complicated history with Ronnie definitely feels like a factor as well.\n\n\u201cIf I have sex with her, is that still cheating?\u201d Ronnie asks of the doll. I think that quote alone supports Sammi\u2019s decision to not go on this vacation?\n\n14. This doll is seriously creepy. When you press a certain part of it, it blurts out old Sammi quotes. What is Pauly D\u2019s doll budget? Is he just spending all of his DJ money on elaborate, technologically advanced dolls?\n\nThis nightmare doll couldn\u2019t have been cheap.\n\n15. How did Pauly D explain the Sammi doll when he took a flight to Miami?\n\n16. JWoww on the Situation\u2019s tax evasion: \u201cThe IRS is like the mafia: Don\u2019t fuck with them.\u201d Can I get that quote embroidered on a pillow?\n\n17. Snooki tries to move the Sammi doll, but it\u2019s oddly heavy, and this ends up happening:\n\nI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but guys, can you please just go hit the clubs and get blackout drunk? The more time you spend with Doll Sammi, the more terrifying this whole thing becomes.\n\n18. Mid-episode, the Situation\u2019s, well, situation gets figured out. He pleads guilty, and the judge grants him the right to party in Miami for the reunion special. Or \u2026 was that the punishment all along?\n\n19. They do indeed go clubbing. Having not even watched the original show, it\u2019s clear that this feels like a different vibe. Everyone except Pauly D is in some kind of relationship, it seems, which means all non-Pauly partygoers are just half-heartedly fist-bumping and taking shots of tequila, as if it was a contractual obligation (it probably is). I don\u2019t want to jump the gun but, is the cast of Jersey Shore \u2026 tired of partying?\n\n20. Pauly D is grinding on this woman that he\u2019s super infatuated with. As his wingman, Vinny holds the woman\u2019s hand for balance while she twerks on Pauly, because she has a bad back.\n\nIs Vinny the best wingman of all time? I don\u2019t think I need more evidence, honestly.\n\n21. The whole clubbing sequence was oddly eye-opening\u2014not only did everyone except for Pauly seem weirdly out of place, but it was obvious that clubbing culture itself has evolved past them. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone fist-pumps anymore,\u201d Snooki proclaims. \u201cBut we still do. I will always fist-pump till the day I die.\u201d\n\nIs this season going to end with the Jersey Shore crew having an existential crisis?\n\n22. I\u2019m not overthinking this, right? These people have entered a new period of their lives, filled with real responsibilities. It seems like Family Vacation can end in one of only two ways: They\u2019ll either realize this stuff is behind them, or they\u2019ll spiral out of control and lose the lives they\u2019ve built for themselves. Maybe it\u2019ll be a bit of both.\n\nAm I going to stick around to see how it all plays out?\n\nHell yes. #TeamVinny4Life.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DpKRQxoHVMBCQrJTw2uWzDaj5wE=/0x0:1292x724/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1292x724):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599629/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.21.37_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YUcoXf6gTYDBCNZezBaJ6L3U4lI=/0x0:1272x714/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1272x714):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599631/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.22.01_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66669845/1194991176.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66669036/1211212226.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EINEYGqnvMFsGL2UmZbqaYdNVv4=/0x0:3000x2000/1200x800/filters:focal(1260x760:1740x1240)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59292715/jersey_shore.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jw0SV-UVOHJwf7cxnLTkzQWWe-k=/0x0:1276x722/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1276x722):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599623/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.17.29_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vj0VqAr2ov6oAzDN01nNjuAeR-M=/0x0:1286x714/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1286x714):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599637/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.24.25_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599645/Jersey_Shore_2.gif", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599647/Jersey_Shore_1.gif", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpVthlf9DLm24iNzHv7jbimIiro=/0x0:1246x696/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1246x696):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599625/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.19.45_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670109/1197847685.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667177/4_17_Desktop_Thumbnail_1.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667603/fink_ringer_illo.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66667782/claire_toohotothandle_netflix_ringer.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zaFnZSuXzeEVRGo_fcE8yN3IXGE=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599487/jersey_shore.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emNMYLKn1DCGc3KrBIlaiSKF7zU=/0x0:1300x728/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1300x728):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599621/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.15.33_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4OrXO57iFIZ7bLjQFWII4LGcHk=/0x0:1278x716/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1278x716):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599639/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.25.03_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlGUlhGudnumZ0INnptRe8x5B3c=/0x0:1278x728/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1278x728):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599635/Screen_Shot_2018_04_06_at_8.23.29_AM.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zaFnZSuXzeEVRGo_fcE8yN3IXGE=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10599487/jersey_shore.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Miles Surrey", "Liz Kelly", "Kate Halliwell", "Chris Vernon", "Kevin O'Connor", "The Jj Redick Podcast With Tommy Alter", "Claire Mcnear", "Oliver Lee Bateman", "Jason Concepcion", "Apr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theringer.com/tv/2018/4/6/17206046/jersey-shore-family-vacation-premiere-questions", "title": "22 Questions About the \u2018Jersey Shore Family Vacation\u2019 Premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Ringer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ringer/", "published_time": "2018-04-06T10:39:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-06T10:39:59-04:00"}, "author": "Miles Surrey", "style-tools": "https://www.theringer.com/style/community/723/739655690adad613b032e69b51e66554/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "Is Vinny the most normcore reality star of all time?
