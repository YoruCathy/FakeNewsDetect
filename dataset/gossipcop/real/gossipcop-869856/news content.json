She also has two sons from previous relationships: Jace, 7, with ex Andrew Lewis, and Kaiser, 2, with ex-fianc\u00e9 Nathan Griffith.\n\nWhen the MTV star recently went wedding dress shopping, her mother was noticeably absent.\n\nBarbara Evans told PEOPLE she has been left off the guest list for her daughter\u2019s upcoming wedding.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been saying she\u2019s having her wedding, running around with her family of friends, but you know what she says? \u2018My mother Barbara is not invited,\u2019 \u201d the 64-year-old said. \u201cShe\u2019s not inviting me to her own wedding. It\u2019s very painful.\u201d\n\nThe mother and daughter share custody of Jace.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans-david.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F07%2Fjenelle-evans2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/", "title": "Jenelle Evans and David Eason Go Wedding Cake Tasting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Jenelle Evans,News,reality star,Teen Mom,TV,TV Watch,Weddings", "news_keywords": "Jenelle Evans,News,reality star,Teen Mom,TV,TV Watch,Weddings", "description": "The two have been busy planning their wedding but got a brief respite on Thursday", "og": {"title": "Jenelle Evans and David Eason Go Wedding Cake Tasting", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/jenelle-evans-david-eason-wedding-cake-tasting/", "description": "Bring on the cake!
