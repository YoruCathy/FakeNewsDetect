Summer, or some version of it, is still in full swing\u2014and thus, so is your ability to enjoy it. Every year around this time, my family and I prepare for an annual summer tradition of our own: our backyard movie party. Summer must end at some point, but before it does, we break out the A/V gear, fire up the grill, and send it out with a bang. This type of party always goes over well with my outdoorsy crowd. There\u2019s something about a big screen, good company, and good food that makes you appreciate all the awesomeness this time of year has to offer. Thankfully, this level of greatness isn\u2019t difficult to achieve, nor is it as expensive as you may think. Check out our list and let me help you live your best summer.\n\nBefore we jump into in, let\u2019s get some prerequisites out of the way. For starters, lighting and weather conditions cannot be overlooked. Projectors and outdoor displays perform at their best in darkened environments. So, plan to start your party after sundown and in ideal weather conditions. If you have a covered porch or deck, first, I\u2019m jealous, but you may be able to get the party started a little earlier; a dark environment will further enhance the movie experience. When it comes to the weather, the goal isn\u2019t just to protect your guests from the elements, it\u2019s also important to keep your gear safe. Lots of A/V equipment has air-circulation vents that shouldn\u2019t be near water, so be sure to check for a clear forecast. Another worthwhile consideration is space\u2014while you won\u2019t need half an acre to throw a movie party, planning around the real estate you do have is important.\n\nProjector\n\nYour projector is the life of the party, but not necessarily something you should overthink. There are a lot of options out there, but for outdoor viewing, there are two features I always look for: lumens (brightness output) and resolution. Calculating the amount of brightness your space needs can be tough, but I\u2019ve had great results with models in the 3000 \u2013 4000 lumen range, so this what I typically recommend. Keep in mind that lighting conditions are still important. If your projector picks a fight with daylight, daylight will be victorious. When projecting images, resolution is also an important factor. As bad as you may want one, you probably won\u2019t need a 4K projector for your outdoor party. Full HD 1080p typically gets the job done for most screens in the 100-inch range.\n\nThe model I use currently is the BenQ MH733. While it\u2019s technically a multimedia projector, as opposed to Home Theater, its mix of resolution (Full HD) and lumens (4000) proved ideal for my needs\u2014and when it\u2019s movie time, the projector\u2019s Cinema mode dials things in quite nicely. Additionally, it\u2019s 1.15 to 1.5:1 throw ratio fills my 80\" screen from a little more than 8' away, which is great, considering I don\u2019t have a ton of space. Whether we\u2019re watching sports or movies, this BenQ DLP projector has been the anchor of my outdoor A/V system.\n\nBenQ MH733 4000-Lumen Full HD DLP Projector\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that projectors aren\u2019t the only show in town. There is also a wide range of outdoor televisions to choose from. When it comes to screen sizes, projector systems offer more bang for your buck and are typically more portable, but outdoor displays have advantages of their own, such as weather resistance and not having to worry about bulb maintenance.\n\nSunBriteTV Veranda Series 75\"-Class UHD Outdoor LED TV\n\nScreen\n\nOutdoor projector screens come in many shapes and sizes. When deciding between an inflatable option like the Sima XL-72 or a stand-mounted alternative like this 92\" model from Camp Chef, you should take a look at your viewing environment and determine what screen size and installation type you can reasonably accommodate. Is your backyard windy? If so, look for a screen with support anchors. Screen mounting can be a fun part of the outdoor movie experience\u2014in fact I\u2019ve seen some creative installation designs over the years that included screens hanging from trees and mounted on fences. While I typically recommend a safer approach, if you\u2019re so inclined, don\u2019t be afraid to think outside of the box. In some cases, you may not even need a screen if you can project onto a wall or another large surface, although picture quality will vary with this approach.\n\nCamp Chef Backyard Big Screen Lite 92\" Folding Projection Screen\n\nVideo Source\n\nPrioritize ease of use when choosing a video source to pair with your outdoor system. You\u2019re having a party, so don\u2019t spend your summer hours completing a lengthy setup process. Personally speaking, I love my universal Blu-ray player, but taking it outdoors is risky and impractical. If your Wi-Fi connection is good, try something powerful, compact, and wireless like the Roku Streaming Stick. In addition to giving you access to a vast streaming library, it connects directly to your projector or outdoor display\u2019s HDMI input; and if your projector has a compatible-USB port like the previously mentioned BenQ MH733, that port can be used to supply power to your streaming device.\n\nRoku Streaming Stick\n\nWhen a conventional component like a cable/satellite box or optical-disc player is your best option, consider an HDMI transmitter and receiver like this Wireless HD Kit from IOGEAR, or a wired video splitter like this 4-Port Switch. Just keep in mind that wireless performance will vary based on distance and the construction of your home, and the wired switch will likely require you to run cables through windows or doors. The advantage here is that you can keep your video sources safely indoors.\n\nIOGEAR Wireless HD Digital Kit\n\nPowered Speaker System\n\nAs great as my projector is, it\u2019s 10W isn\u2019t sufficient for an outdoor party. In all fairness, this is typically the case for most projectors. Even when used indoors, better (and louder) sound can be achieved when connecting to an external powered speaker system. Speaker shopping is one of my favorite things to do, and when it comes to matching it with a projector, the connectivity is relatively straightforward. If your projector or display has a 3.5mm output, which is a common interface, make sure your powered-speaker has a 3.5mm input, like this 100W powerhouse from ION Audio. An outdoor-rated speaker that includes a microphone and light effects? This speaker screams, \u201cParty!\u201d\n\nION Audio Pathfinder Waterproof Rechargeable Speaker System\n\nThe size of the speaker you choose will also depend on the amount of space you need to cover. In my experience, it\u2019s always better to go bigger because you can easily turn down the volume if needed; making a smaller speaker perform like a bigger one is a more difficult task. Remember, this is supposed to be easy.\n\nThe Little Things\n\nInsect Repellent: I\u2019m convinced that the mosquitoes of 2018 are smarter and more resilient than their ancestors, and I\u2019ve got the bites to prove it. Don\u2019t miss the action because you\u2019re swatting at bugs or scratching bite marks.\n\nGood Neighbors: If you don\u2019t plan to invite them, be considerate if your party runs late into the night. I once threw a late-night boxing party, so I planned ahead and invited neighbors. Nothing unites a community quite like a free pay-per-view event.\n\nReliable Connections: If you have an Internet-connected streaming device like the one I mentioned above, or have long cable runs, make sure your connectivity is solid. Movies that buffer are twice as long and are regrettably distracting. Think about getting a Wi-Fi range extender if your wireless connection doesn\u2019t extend outdoors, or a powered/active-HDMI cable if you\u2019re running a high-resolution signal over a wired connection more than 50'. An outdoor-ready power hub and extension cord like these from 360 Electrical and Milspec may also come in handy.\n\nKanexPro High Resolution HDMI Cable\n\nLess Talk, More Party\n\nSocial media accounts this time of year are flooded with all things outdoors, and if your friends are anything like mine, they\u2019re doing all sorts of cool things like flying drones at the beach and pretending to not get sea sick on boats. Don\u2019t compete with that. Let them have the day; the fun doesn\u2019t stop when the sun goes down.\n\nDo you throw a backyard movie party of your own or need advice getting started?
