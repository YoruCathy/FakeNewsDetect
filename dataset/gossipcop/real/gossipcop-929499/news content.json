Oh no!\u201d a wide-eyed Johansson exclaims.\n\n\u201cHave I just broken y\u2019all up?\u201d DeGeneres quips.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that that\u2019s an image I\u2019ll ever forget,\u201d Johansson admits.\n\nThe action star also opens up about her 3-year-old daughter, Rose, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s true, [motherhood] gets better every day. She\u2019s my little buddy, love her.\u201d\n\nJohannson adds that her daughter is more interested in princesses than her mom's Avengers character, Black Widow.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a very sweet girl, very, very, very girlie -- like, painfully girlie. She wants to wear the princess dress to bed and she wants to wear it to school,\u201d Johansson explains. \u201cIf you ask her what I do for a living, she says, \u2018Mommy\u2019s a superhero.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo will the superhero mom be getting her own Black Widow movie?\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s room for it,\u201d she says of a possible stand-alone Marvel film with her as the leading lady. \u201cI think the only way to do it is if it\u2019s something we\u2019ve never seen before that was really groundbreaking and incredibly bada**\u2026 I think it could be something really special.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, Johansson walked her first red carpet with Jost at the Infinity War premiere.\n\n\u201cIt was alright. It was not bad, you know -- get some laughs in and enjoy it,\u201d she told ET of their first appearance as a couple. \u201cI'm just excited to share this experience with him because I'm so excited to see the film. I haven't seen it before!\u201d\n\n'Avengers: Infinity War': Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans (FULL INTERVIEW) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
