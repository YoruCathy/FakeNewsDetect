And that\u2019s what celebrities do, if we\u2019re doing our job right. We\u2019re picking up the voices of people who can\u2019t be heard and broadcasting their story.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb1a0285a3db395c90c/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb65c7670327c1e55f7/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss08.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb67c22ac258e4f47aa/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss09.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbbaa0285a3db395c90e/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbba85bd6441b19cf5b3/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss11.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb46048371b41b51332/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss07.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbaea0285a3db395c90a/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb0037376305a00f894/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbbc0c2c5233a346e7ec/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb5037376305a00f896/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_400%2Cc_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbae01f7253cf1a1807b/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss02.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbae6048371b41b51330/master/w_400%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_1600,c_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Weaver", "Hilary Weave"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2018/04/celebrity-activists", "title": "Celebrities-Turned-Activists Throughout the Years", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hilary Weaver", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Audrey Hepburn was an ambassador for UNICEF, Elizabeth Taylor fought for AIDS research, and Jane Fonda caused an uproar on her way to making change.
