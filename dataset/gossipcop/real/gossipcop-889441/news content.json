Summer is officially dead and gone, and it\u2019s time to well and truly embrace the autumn.\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019ll be wildly excited about it being autumn. Why? Because autumn means Halloween. And Halloween means Halloween films!\n\nOne of the best films to get you all riled up for All Hallows\u2019 Eve is 1993\u2019s Hocus Pocus.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\nWhich as well as starring Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Omri Katz as Max and Thora Birch as adorable little Dani, you\u2019ll also recall young actor Sean Murray. Or as you\u2019ll more fondly remember him: Thackery Binx.\n\nSo what has lovely Thackery Sean been up to since we last saw him and his billowy white blouse back in the 90s?\n\nWell, as some of you may already know, 41-year-old Sean has played Timothy McGee in NCIS since 2003, so he\u2019s still an actor, which is fun.\n\nAnd sometimes he has a goatee, so that\u2019s super-fun too.\n\nAs well as being an actor and occasional goatee-grower, judging by his Instagram he also\u2026\n\nGoes to the dentist occasionally.\n\nLooks off into the distance wistfully.\n\nWears the hell out of tuxedos.\n\nAnd white suits.\n\nAnd sits on stools; talking about important things in front of nice shrubbery.\n\nWhat a swell guy.\n\nh/t Digital Spy.\n\nFollow Anna on Twitter.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0516xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sites/cosmopolitan/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0516xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Lewis", "News Editor", "Anna Lewis Is The News Editor At Delish Uk", "Which Means She S Always Either Writing About Food", "Cooking Food Or Eating Food."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a12265111/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-now/", "title": "here's what Sean Murray looks like now", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "In case you were wondering, here\u2019s what Thackery Binx from Hocus Pocus looks like now", "description": "Because 26 years can do a lot to a man", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a12265111/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-now/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0516xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 211620818858710}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/cosmopolitanuk", "modified_time": "2019-09-06 02:52:35", "published_time": "2019-09-02 02:50:00", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CosmopolitanUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0516xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Hocus Pocus' Thackery Binx - here's what Sean Murray looks like now", "description": "Here's what has lovely Thackery/Sean been up to since we last saw him and his billowy white blouse back in the 90s.", "keywords": "hocus pocus, thackery binx, ncis, halloween, sean murray, hocus pocus thackery binx, thackery binx actor, hocus pocus where are they now, sean murray actor, sean murray hocus pocus, sean murray ncis, thackery binx now", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=0.666xw:1.00xh;0.0554xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2019-09-02T14:50:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.0516xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hocus-pocus-thackery-binx-1505735872.jpg?crop=0.666xw:1.00xh;0.0554xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "In case you were wondering, here\u2019s what Thackery Binx from Hocus Pocus looks like now", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1567363800.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
