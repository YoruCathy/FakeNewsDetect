And when the boat\u2019s engine caught on fire, the reality stars were left terrified.\n\n\u201cIt was a disaster,\u201d the insider explained. \u201cThe vessel was so shaky and the waters so rocky that the women got really sick. Things began flying off the boat. The engine caught on fire. None of the crew spoke English. None of the women felt safe. Carole and Tinsley got sick and were throwing up overboard. The others were all screaming for help. They were all scared out of the minds. They thought they were going to die out there.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ramona Singer and Sonja Morgan\n\nAnother source close to the cast called it \u201cthe boat ride from hell,\u201d telling PEOPLE that the women \u201csurvived a horror show\u201d that brought them together in the end.\n\n\u201cThey were soaked to the bone, scared s\u2014less and sick by the end,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey were crying out for their lives. \u2026 They thought it was over. \u2026 Any feuds that have been carrying through the season were thrown aside.\u201d\n\nSaid a Bravo spokesperson to PEOPLE at the time: \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York cast was recently on a boat in South America and encountered turbulent water. Thankfully, everyone is fine and was able to continue their vacation as planned. The safety of our cast and crew is paramount and, to that end, we are doing a full investigation.\u201d\n\nRELATED: RHONY Cast \u2018Thought They Were Going to Die\u2019 During Dangerous Boat Trip on Colombian Getaway\n\nJudging from the RHONY midseason trailer, the \u201cboat ride from hell\u201d isn\u2019t the only rough waters the women encounter during their trip to the South American country.\n\nDe Lesseps, 53, butts heads with her longtime ally Medley \u2014 the latter poking fun at de Lesseps\u2019 headline-making divorce and arrest for disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant (to all of which she\u2019s pleaded not guilty).\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare talk to me like that. An ex-countess? You drink some more and get arrested again,\u201d Medley says, pushing a drink in de Lesseps\u2019 face. \u201cGet married again. You\u2019re awful \u2026 I stood for you for everything. I almost got arrested for you.\u201d\n\nRadziwill and Frankel also continue their long feud. \u201cI don\u2019t think you really like me,\u201d Frankel says.\n\n\u201cOkay, maybe that\u2019s it,\u201d Radziwill responds.\n\nPerhaps Frankel summed it all up best: \u201cThis is the worst vacation ever.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.
