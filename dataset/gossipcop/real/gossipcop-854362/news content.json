Kim has been warned she could bleed to death if she tries to have another child.\n\nKris Jenner offered to carry Kim Kardashian\u2019s third baby if it was safe for her to do so.\n\nAnd in the latest episode of \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians,\u201d Kim asks her 61-year-old mother if she\u2019ll carry her baby for her after finding out that Kris is healthy enough to do it.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN: 'I CAN'T TRUST ANYBODY'\n\nShe asked her: \u201cDo you want to carry mine?\u201d\n\nKris replied: \u201cIf I really thought that I could carry it for you and it would be born OK, I would do it in two seconds, I really would. But it\u2019s really dangerous.\u201d\n\nKourtney also offered to be a surrogate for Kim, who has been warned not to get pregnant again due to complications during her last pregnancies.\n\nKourtney chimed in: \u201cI already offered myself so don\u2019t act like you\u2019re the only Mother Theresa in here.\u201d\n\nIt all started when Kris revealed that a mysterious aristocrat got in touch with her asking to use her genes to have a baby.\n\nThe matriarch was told of how they wanted to buy one of her eggs as he believes her \u201coffspring would fit seamlessly into their royal lineage.\u201d\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN POSES IN BIKINI AFTER 'FLU DIET'\n\nKris said she was stunned to receive the letter from \u201ca highly esteemed royal of European descent whose further identity will remain anonymous.\u201d\n\nKris also revealed how a rich European aristocrat wanted to buy one of her eggs and raise the baby as royalty.\n\nThe letter read: \u201cMy client and his wife have tried unsuccessfully for years to have their own children, and request herein the opportunity to speak with you about egg donation.\n\n\u201cYour impressive track record in producing successful and outstanding offspring has attracted my client\u2019s interest in your genetics. He and his wife believe that an offspring with your DNA will fit seamlessly into their royal lineage.\u201d\n\nThe European aristocrat said they would give her a \"generous compensation\" for one of her eggs and they would need physical and psychological evaluations if she agreed to the contract.\n\nKim thought her mom should \"go for it,\" but Kris revealed she's worried about having to get a hip replacement before adding: \"Do you know how old my eggs would be?\"\n\nKris then added: \"I mean, I do have amazing DNA and make amazing children.\"\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN REVEALS SHE CAN'T CARRY MORE CHILDREN\n\nKourtney, 38, thought the whole scenario was \"absolutely ridiculous\" and said: \"It\u2019s definitely a compliment that somebody wants to purchase your eggs \u2014 but she\u2019s 61, I don\u2019t think she has any eggs.\"\n\nKris was completely overwhelmed by the \"fairytale offer\" saying: \"Can you imagine if I had a child that grew up in a castle in Europe and it was royalty? I could design a crest.\"\n\nShe even went to get her fertility checked out by Dr. Huang, who told her that her eggs weren't viable.\n\n\"It was kind of fun to fantasize for a second. I was so flattered by the offer that someone thought that much of me that they would want to do that. I just wanted to go check it out, so silly I know,\" she said.\n\nHowever, her doctor did say she could carry a baby to term prompting Kim, who has been warned not to get pregnant again, to ask if she'll carry her baby.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Sun.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/02/22/640/360/931/524/022216_dotcom_jenner_1280.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/270/152/Jana-Kramer-Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/LA-Premiere-of-5EThe-G_Admi.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/270/152/Gwyneth-Paltrow-GETTY-cropped.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/02/22/640/360/022216_dotcom_jenner_1280.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/270/152/Brad-Paisley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/02/22/640/360/022216_dotcom_jenner_1280.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3618182/kris-jenner-kim-kardashian-surrogate-offer/", "title": "Kris Jenner offers to be a surrogate for Kim Kardashian's third child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Kris Jenner has offered to be Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate for her third child after being told she\u2019s healthy enough to carry a baby.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Kris Jenner offers to be a surrogate for Kim Kardashian's third child", "dcterms.abstract": "Kris Jenner has offered to be Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate for her third child after being told she\u2019s healthy enough to carry a baby.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Kris Jenner has offered to be Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate for her third child after being told she\u2019s healthy enough to carry a baby.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:3118c700-ebc5-5ea9-ac03-e36447601043", "dc.source": "The Sun", "dc.date": "2017-05-22", "dcterms.created": "2017-05-22T12:01:28-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-05-22T12:13:01-04:00", "og": {"title": "Kris Jenner offers to be a surrogate for Kim Kardashian's third child", "description": "Kris Jenner has offered to be Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate for her third child after being told she\u2019s healthy enough to carry a baby.", "type": "article", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/02/22/640/360/022216_dotcom_jenner_1280.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kris-jenner-offers-to-be-a-surrogate-for-kim-kardashians-third-child", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Kris Jenner offers to be a surrogate for Kim Kardashian's third child", "description": "Kris Jenner has offered to be Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate for her third child after being told she\u2019s healthy enough to carry a baby.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2016/02/22/640/360/1024/512/022216_dotcom_jenner_1280.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kris-jenner-offers-to-be-a-surrogate-for-kim-kardashians-third-child"}, "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Babies,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "babies,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
