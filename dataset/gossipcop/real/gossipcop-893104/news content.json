Anderson East and Miranda Lambert have made it clear where they stand on the issue in a social media post.\n\nLate Thursday night (Nov. 9), East posted on social media to explain that he, for one, is not a fan of Brooks' decision: \u201cI keep a lot of my opinions to myself and respect anyone making music but as a person who tries to put on the best and most honest show I can night after night \u2026 this truly offends me,\" he writes.\n\n\"I was told country music is three chords and the truth,\" East adds.\n\nHundreds have commented on East's words, both in agreement with him and in defense of Brooks. Lambert is one of the former.\n\n\u201cHigh five on this babe,\" Lambert writes in a comment. \"If you can\u2019t sing then don\u2019t ... It\u2019s better to be honest than to pretend.\"\n\n\"I think it\u2019s bulls--t,\" she continues. \"My favorite performances in the show were live live. The truth.\"\n\nBrooks admitted backstage at the 2017 CMA Awards that he made the decision to lip-sync because he was feeling under the weather. At the same time, ironically, he praised Lambert for her performance during the awards show.\n\n\"Let me tell you who fought the good fight tonight in my opinion: Miranda Lambert,\" Brooks boasted. \"She\u2019s one of the few females that we play, so you\u2019d think she\u2019d want to play it safe. She came out and she stuck country music in all of our faces tonight -- traditional country music.\"\n\nTop 10 2017 CMA Awards Moments", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/11/Anderson-East-Miranda-Lambert.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/10/theboot-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/11/Anderson-East-Miranda-Lambert.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liv Stecker"], "canonical_link": "https://theboot.com/anderson-east-miranda-lambert-call-out-garth-brooks-lip-syncing-2017-cma-awards/", "title": "Anderson East, Miranda Lambert Call Out Garth Brooks for Lip-Syncing at 2017 CMA Awards", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "theboot_dotcom", "description": "Anderson East and Miranda Lambert speak out about Garth Brooks' decision to lip-sync during his 2017 CMA Awards performance.", "keywords": "garth brooks lip syncing, garth brooks 2017 cma performance, garth brooks li sync 2017 cma performance, garth brooks miranda lambert, garth brooks miranda lambert anderson east, garth brooks anderson east, garth brooks anderson east lip syncing", "fb": {"app_id": 151086041747752, "admins": 59877105906, "pages": 59877105906}, "og": {"title": "Anderson East, Miranda Lambert Call Out Garth Brooks for Lip-Syncing at 2017 CMA Awards", "description": "Anderson East and Miranda Lambert speak out about Garth Brooks' decision to lip-sync during his 2017 CMA Awards performance.", "url": "https://theboot.com/anderson-east-miranda-lambert-call-out-garth-brooks-lip-syncing-2017-cma-awards/", "site_name": "The Boot", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/11/Anderson-East-Miranda-Lambert.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thebootdotcom"}, "sailthru.description": "Anderson East and Miranda Lambert speak out about Garth Brooks' decision to lip-sync during his 2017 CMA Awards performance.", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-10 11:50:34", "sailthru.title": "Anderson East, Miranda Lambert Call Out Garth Brooks for Lip-Syncing at 2017 CMA Awards", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-theboot, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, anderson-east, cma-awards, garth-brooks, miranda-lambert, cmas, country-news", "sailthru.author": "livstecker", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/11/Anderson-East-Miranda-Lambert.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/11/Anderson-East-Miranda-Lambert.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "43sWrlFmliAOb32082dqCQO4JAd-BH-caKisRgljqok", "viewport": "width=1286, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510285834.0, "source": "http://theboot.com", "summary": ""}
