Furthermore, the hacker issued a warning to the HBO officials that if they fail to pay the ransom within a couple of days, the leaked data will be dumped onto the dark web.\n\nWhen FBI was pressed into the probe, it discovered that the data was leaked as soon as the hackers got hold of the email credentials of Leslie Cohen, HBO\u2019s Vice President for film programming.\n\nSince, HBO failed to react to the hacker\u2019s call, few episodes of \u201cGame of Thornes\u201d containing the water mark \u201c HBO is Falling\u201d were leaked to the web. After two days time details such as emails, financial balance sheets, employment agreements and marketing strategies also emerged on the web.\n\nOn Wednesday night this week, a hacking group named \u201c OurMine\u201d gained access to the Twitter accounts of HBO. It left a message to the HBO that \u201c Ourmine is here, we are just testing your security- Please contact us to upgrade the security-ourmine.org\u2192 contact\u201d\n\nA second tweet which surfaced this early morning on HBO\u2019s official twitter page reads \u201cLet\u2019s make #HBOHacked Trending!\u201d\n\nThe other twitter accounts linked to the HBO\u2019s official twitter page were also hacked and that includes the accounts of shows such as \u201cLast week Tonight\u201d, \u201cVeep\u201d, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d, \u201cLooking\u201d, \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d, \u201cTrue Blood\u201d, and \u201cVinyl\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, HBO said that the investigation on its twitter hack is still going on and so asked the press to wait for the latest to publish.\n\nAnd in another incident which stands as a faux pas, one of the upcoming episode of \u201cGame of Thorns\u201d was accidentally aired on HBO Nordic and HBO Espana Platforms for 1 full hour. The channel authorities later learned about the blunder and apologized for the technical blooper created by some of its staff members.", "images": ["https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hacking-Detected-2-2-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Vulnerability_1000x600-1-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cybersecurity_insiders_white_logo.png", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-Identity-and-access-management-report-cover-Simeio-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AdobeStock_315095274-100x70.jpeg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/avatar_294-200x150.jpeg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Threats_1000x600-9-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Untitled-Design-17-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/fotos-imported-on-march-1st-2012-230-3-avatar.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-IAM-Report-Simeio-Cover-100x70.png", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Access-Denied-1-218x150.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ransomware-3-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Vulnerability_1000x600-4-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hacking-Detected-2-2-218x150.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Threats_1000x600-1-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/avatar_294-100x70.jpeg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Report-Cover-100x70.png", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/download_report_ad_3.png", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Access-Denied-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-SIEM-Report-HelpSystems-Core-Cover-100x70.png", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/teams-vs-slack-100x70.png", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hacking-Detected-2-696x418.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Acquisition_1000x600-3-100x70.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cyber-Crime-218x150.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hacking-Detected-2.jpg", "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Access-Denied-218x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hacking-Detected-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Naveen Goud", "Naveen Goud Is A Writer At Cybersecurity Insiders Covering Topics Such As Mergers", "Acquisitions", "Startups", "Cyber Attacks", "Cloud Security", "Mobile Security"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/hbo-twitter-accounts-hacked-after-cyber-attack/", "title": "HBO Twitter Accounts hacked after Cyber Attack!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hacking-Detected-2.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hacking-Detected-2.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "HBO Twitter Accounts hacked after Cyber Attack! - Cybersecurity Insiders", "description": "In July this year, cyber crooks launched a cyber attack on the database of Hollywood Box Office(HBO) to steal 1.5 terabytes of proprietary data which includes few episodes of \u201cGame of Thorns- Season 7\u201d.
