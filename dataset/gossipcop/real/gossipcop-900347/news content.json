Here, we\u2019ve ranked them all, including the much-hyped finale of the Skywalker saga, The Rise of Skywalker, now available to stream at home on digital platforms.\n\nNote: this list only covers theatrically released films in the franchise, so there will be no mention of the 1980s Ewok television movies or the 1978 holiday special (which is for the best). There will be some spoilers for previous movies, but we\u2019ll avoid details when discussing The Rise of Skywalker, so as long as you\u2019re caught up on earlier entries, read on!\n\nIn ascending order, here is our ranking of all 12 theatrical Star Wars movies, including The Rise of Skywalker:\n\n(Lucasfilm Animation/ Warner Bros.)\n\n12. Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\nRoger Ebert summed it up perfectly with the first line of his 2008 review: \u201cHas it come to this?\u201d\n\nSet between the events of Episode II and Episode III, this 98-minute 3D animated novelty served as a big-screen lead-in to the premiere of the TV show of the same name two months later. The popularity and longevity of this decades-old series has a lot to do with how much it appeals to audiences of all ages, bringing families and generations together in passionate fandom. The Clone Wars works best for very young viewers, and this is the only theatrical Star Wars film not to receive a single Academy Award nomination.\n\nReleased four weeks after The Dark Knight broke box office records and captured the zeitgeist, the Saturday morning serial approach of The Clone Wars felt dated and was shrugged off by audiences, grossing $68.3 million worldwide (compare that to Revenge of the Sith\u2018s $849 million haul three years earlier). The cinematic future of the once-towering franchise remained in limbo for half a decade before Disney stepped in to shake things up.\n\nThe best part: The television series received a warmer reception, with positive reviews and an impressive six-season run.\n\nIan McDiarmid and Daisy Ridely in 'The Rise of Skywalker' (Disney/Lucasfilm)\n\n11. Star Wars: Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nTaken at face value, Rise of Skywalker is, easily, by some distance, the worst Star Wars movie ever. One feels uneasy just calling it a \u201cmovie\u201d because that implies cohesiveness. Long-running rumors that eventually became unofficial news stories about this troubled production have proven to be true. Lucasfilm didn\u2019t have a plan for the sequel series\u2013and it shows. Rise of Skywalker feels even lamer in light of the glorious payoff of the same year\u2019s Avengers: Endgame, Hollywood\u2019s ultimate testament to filmmakers planning ahead and staying organized.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this feels like a point-of-no-return move for the integrity of this series. The Rise of Skywalker kowtows to toxic fandom, retconning, quite crassly, the bold decisions of The Last Jedi. This is a submissive, sloppy apology for a terrific movie. This is a series apologizing for itself when it didn\u2019t need to. Which just feels embarrassing.\n\nThe other side of this is: Thanks to all of the ridiculous everything-including-the-kitchen-sink choices that were clearly made by many, many people, The Rise of Skywalker is fitfully maniacally entertaining. The best Star Wars films, the ones that have rendered this series immortal in spite of its low points, are far smarter than the average blockbuster: spiritual, carefully plotted, romantic. Never before has there been a \u201cleave-your-brain-at-the-door\u201d Star Wars entry. If you aren\u2019t dead set on seeing grand entertainment that will move you, and you\u2019re willing to settle for a dumb fireworks show, you could do worse than this.\n\nThe best part: Accommodating performances from a cast of overqualified world-class performers do wonders for this structurally disastrous film. Best of all is Daisy Ridley, who\u2019s more responsible for developing the character of Rey than any of these scripts have been. The scavenger girl\u2019s backstory and arc are convoluted to the point of being flat-out obnoxious\u2013 but this a fantastic actress; she brings real emotion to what often feels like a B-grade video game.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Avengers Endgame Became the Biggest Movie of All Time\n\n(Lucasfilm/20th Century Fox)\n\n10. Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nOf all the live-action films in the franchise, this is the one that feels the most like it was untouched by human hands. Attack of the Clones was the first Hollywood studio feature filmed entirely with digital cameras, and nearly every shot is a special effects shot, every setting a green screen. There\u2019s so much going on in every frame, but all the digital trickery in the world can\u2019t overcome tedious plotting, thin characterization and a script in need of a rewrite (or two).\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate just how rich the writing of the original trilogy was, particularly the dialogue. Penned by Lawrence Kasdan, The Empire Strikes Back has the snappiest and most clever screenplay this side of Casablanca; virtually every line is now considered a classic movie quote. The only line from Attack of the Clones anyone quotes these days is Anakin (Hayden Christensen)\u2019s intended-to-be romantic bit favorably comparing Padm\u00e9 (Natalie Portman)\u2019s skin to sand (and not for the right reasons). The prequels are oft-criticized for having wooden acting, but this really isn\u2019t fair. These movies are filled with world-class actors who\u2019ve all been wonderful elsewhere; no one could have brought dialogue like this to life.\n\nOnce again, the ever-on-point Ebert nailed it in the first line of his 2002 review: \u201cIt is not what\u2019s there on the screen that disappoints me, but what\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nThe best part: In a film that mostly feels like it was made in a laboratory, Ewan McGregor\u2018s sparkling take on Obi-Wan Kenobi stands out. Here\u2019s to the upcoming Disney+ series.\n\n(Lucasfilm/ 20th Century Fox)\n\n9. Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nWhen assessing why the first prequel (possibly the most hyped and breathlessly anticipated movie ever when it was released) didn\u2019t live up to hopes, it\u2019s easy and tempting to just say, \u201cJar Jar Binks,\u201d and be done with it. And though the very existence of the 7-feet-tall motormouth cartoon rabbit boggles the mind, the miscalculations of The Phantom Menace are far more multifaceted and deeply rooted than this.\n\nInspired by Joseph Campbell\u2018s The Hero With a Thousand Faces and centuries of myth, the original trilogy is the epitome of a hero\u2019s journey. The Phantom Menace doesn\u2019t even have a protagonist. We\u2019re introduced to several goodies and baddies, but there\u2019s no central character to follow and no one has an arc. What\u2019s more, the tonal inconsistencies that first sprouted in Return of the Jedi are amplified here. Episode I\u2018s plot is at once far too complicated (trade and taxation are hardly the most exciting jumping-off points for a space adventure), and downright silly at times.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say much about the legacy of The Phantom Menace that hasn\u2019t already been laid out in Red Letter Media founder Mike Stoklasa\u2018s exhaustive 2009 feature-length video review, a unique blend of absurdist humor and astute film criticism. Check it out after the jump.\n\nRelated: Best Star Wars Quotes and Yoda Quotes\n\nThe best part: John Williams\u2018 music in Episode I is characteristically terrific, rousing and lush. \u201cThe Duel of the Fates,\u201d a standout piece performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and a full choir, elevates the highly choreographed, pretty-yet-emotionally-distant climactic lightsaber battle. \u201cThe Duel of the Fates\u201d music video is the only classical music selection ever to appear on MTV\u2019s Total Request Live.\n\n(Copyright: 2017 Lucasfilm Ltd., All Rights Reserved)\n\n8. Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nThere are ingredients for a special film in here: a serviceable story, a solid script, and many terrific actors. But Solo is wildly uneven; jarring moments of meta-humor, like Han speaking Wookie and exhausting myriad winks to the older films, undermine an otherwise respectable narrative.\n\nOn the bright side of things, the cast is uniformly outstanding, and it can\u2019t be overstated how much they help this movie out. Emilia Clarke is a presence as the galaxy far, far away\u2019s first femme fatale. Paul Bettany is a genuinely scary, menacing villain who could have used more screen time. Alden Ehrenreich had virtually impossible shoes to fill and insurmountable hype to live up to, and ultimately\u2014he does a fine job with the role. It\u2019s a winning performance.\n\nJohn Williams didn\u2019t score Solo, and he\u2019s is sorely missed. As is the Force and the spirituality fans have connected with since day one.\n\nThe second half of Solo is overall more entertaining than the first, and it\u2019s no coincidence that this is the part of the movie when Donald Glover\u2019s Lando Calrissian steps in along with his robot partner L3-37 (Phoebe Waller-Bridge). Glover and the Emmy-winning Fleabag star aren\u2019t just having a moment right now; they\u2019re planting the seeds of extraordinary respective careers. Glover and Waller-Bridge aren\u2019t afraid to get weird [in the right ways] and take risks.\n\nThe best part: A train heist in the first act is thrilling and fresh enough to make us wish Lucasfilm had greenlit a standalone heist movie in the Star Wars universe instead of this origin story no one really asked for.\n\n(Lucasfilm/20th Century Fox)\n\n7. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nThe greatest asset of the franchise\u2019s first standalone theatrical film is its huge cast of talented international actors like Felicity Jones, Riz Ahmed and Ben Mendelsohn (just to name a few). They make the most of a script heavy on action and nods to the past, but low on character development.\n\nRogue One\u2018s prioritization of nostalgia and spectacle is most apparent in the computer-generated recreation of late actors Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher. Animated avatars are inevitably in the uncanny valley; no one believes they\u2019re real people. Fisher and Cushing were icons, stars with big personalities and little subtleties no computer could replicate. If Tarkin and Leia even needed to be in this movie at all, audiences would have happily accepted actors with a passing resemblance to the originals. Good actors would have brought a fresh take to the characters to boot.\n\nAlso, the humor in the otherwise grim Rogue One feels forced and shoehorned-in, a far cry from the breezy, effortless banter of the original trilogy, which stemmed from sharply written characters given the time and thought to develop strong personalities.\n\nThe best part: The decision to kill off every major character is unexpected, risky and inspired. It\u2019s a welcome reminder of what\u2019s at stake and the Empire\u2019s massive, mighty threat\u2014and it would have made an even bigger impact if we had gotten to know these people a bit more.\n\n(Lucasfilm/20th Century Fox)\n\n6. Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nThe downfall of Anakin Skywalker might have worked best as a single film (though one could argue Darth Vader was a stronger villain with some mystery and we didn\u2019t even need his backstory), and Revenge of the Sith is the best of the prequels largely because this is when the drama finally kicks in. A notable step-up from its immediate predecessors, particularly when it establishes an emotional connection to the original trilogy in its third act, Sith still bears many similarities: over-reliance on over-produced visual effects, unintentionally humorous bits, and unnaturally literal dialogue that makes the characters sound like androids.\n\nThere are flashes of philosophical Star Wars brilliance here, like Yoda\u2019s wise and foreboding advice to Anakin that going through life avoiding pain is the most dangerous choice one can make, that \u201cthe fear of loss is a path to the dark side.\u201d And props to Portman. Padm\u00e9\u2019s tragic arc should have been more nuanced on the page, and the actress brings a great deal more to it.\n\nThe best part: The film\u2019s unanimously praised standout is Scottish Tony Award-winner Ian McDiarmid, splendid as Palpatine. In the best scene of the entire prequel trilogy, the serpentine, insatiable Chancellor and soon-to-be-Emperor tells Anakin the tragedy of Darth Plagueis, seducing the Jedi with the notion of unnatural and unjust power. Lucas originally intended for this to take place in an office, and it was theater vet McDiarmid\u2019s suggestion to set it in an opera box. In a tonally uneven and occasionally goofy trilogy, this quiet moment comes closest to capturing the threat of the Dark Side that made the original films feel so dangerous.\n\n(Lucasfilm/20th Century Fox)\n\n5. Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nIn the wake of two streamlined and impeccably paced predecessors, Return of the Jedi loses its footing on occasion and has tonal issues, but it\u2019s ultimately a worthy denouement to the first batch. The final confrontation between Luke (Mark Hamill) and Vader (James Earl Jones) is the heart of the film, by far the strongest of several parallel plot threads.\n\nLess involving is what happens on Endor. The toyetic furballs known as Ewoks are the first time Star Wars went out of its way to appeal exclusively to the very young, a precursor to Jar-Jar. Few screen romances in history make us swoon (and laugh) in equal measure like the magic between Han (Harrison Ford) and Leia (Carrie Fisher) in Empire\u2014so it looks like a missed opportunity when they spend the third act of Jedi fixing a door. The climactic space battle on an unfinished second Death Star is still a stunner today, though!\n\nGranted endings are tough, and ending the most popular film trilogy of all time is really tough, but it\u2019s impossible to walk away 100 percent satisfied when a saga of good and evil of galactic proportions wraps up with\u2014in the words of Harrison Ford himself\u2014a \u201cteddy bear picnic.\u201d (Nailed it).\n\nThe best part: A decades-younger McDiarmid playing a decades-older Palpatine under impressively scary makeup nearly walks away with this movie, too, but it\u2019s the moment when Luke finally looks into his father\u2019s eyes as the redeemed dark lord breathes his final breaths that gives Jedi its soul, the payoff this hero\u2019s journey deserved.\n\n4. Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nFew films have opened with as much riding on them as J.J. Abrams\u2018 soft reboot, and The Force Awakens was largely successful in revitalizing the brand and\u2014most importantly\u2014getting the Skywalker saga back on its feet. In setting a solid foundation for future installments, this entry played it safe and left audiences longing for fresh story elements and surprises\u2014fortunately, Rian Johnson delivered this and more in The Last Jedi.\n\nAbrams directed the hell out of The Force Awakens, and every frame crackles stylishly with energy and confident precision. Ford\u2019s tender, funny, grizzled and authentic farewell as Han Solo is a highlight, but the pleasant revelation here was seeing the new stars take off. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver in particular elevate the material every step of the way, giving Rey and Kylo Ren a chemistry worthy of previous franchise peaks.\n\nThe best part: Near the end, as Rey is accepting and exploring her powers, Ren interrogates her, probing the corners of her mind with the Force\u2014then she turns the tables and freaks him out by doing exactly the same. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid,\u201d she says, \u201cthat you\u2019ll never be as strong as Darth Vader.\u201d\n\nThe best part (runner-up): Thanks to a suggestion from his filmmaker friend, Selma director Ava DuVernay, Abrams added a seconds-long, wordless and ultimately invaluable shot of Rey closing her eyes, finding the Force inside of her before she bests Ren with a lightsaber. This fleeting oasis of pure feeling\u2014a subtle echo of Luke using the Force in the Death Star\u2019s trenches\u2014drives this story home, and roots the sequel trilogy in the magic of the Force the prequels lacked.\n\n3. Star Wars: Episode VIII \u2014 The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nGive it some time, and the backlash will subside. The Last Jedi is hands-down one of the best blockbusters of the modern age, and one of the most impressive sci-fi/fantasy films of all time.\n\nTransporting in its artistry, challenging in its deconstructive storytelling, and showcasing the strongest all-around acting in franchise history (far-removed from the gee-whiz line deliveries in 1977), Rian Johnson\u2018s take on Star Wars also raises the pulse with heart-stopping, surprising action sequences. There\u2019s something deeper that sets The Last Jedi apart from, frankly, every other picture on this list: tangible melancholy, themes of regret, loss and failure. It\u2019s powerful stuff that doesn\u2019t go down easy. Such things are nowhere to be found in the laser-brained Rise of Skywalker.\n\nThe Last Jedi isn\u2019t perfect; the cleverness and humor is just too much at times, and a cliffhanger ending would have been a better choice, seeing as this is part two of three and all. Still, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this series hasn\u2019t felt so alive and rife with possibilities since 1980. The most compelling plot point here is that, for the first time in the saga, the Force isn\u2019t exclusive to certain bloodlines. Anyone, from anywhere, can have the power to make a difference. This thread was thrown out the window in Rise of Skywalker, where we\u2019re back to nepotism as usual. What a letdown.\n\nThe best part: The throne room fight is an all-timer, this series\u2019 most stunning combat sequence. The lightsaber duels in the prequels looked like ballet recital. This is brutal, filled with rage, dismemberment, screaming and messy, conflicted emotions. And it\u2019s the immediate aftermath of the picture\u2019s keenest plot twist to boot. Exhilarating.\n\n(Lucasfilm/20th Century Fox)\n\n2. Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope (released as Star Wars in 1977)\n\nLike all the greatest phenomena, Star Wars came out of nowhere. Following the success of 1973\u2019s American Graffiti, USC alum Lucas switched gears and pieced together a space opera with wildly varied inspirations including 1950s sci-fi serials like Flash Gordon, Spaghetti Westerns and Akira Kurosawa samurai pictures like The Hidden Fortress.\n\nEvery movie studio except Fox passed on the unusual project, and though the troubled production made some fear a flop, Star Wars surpassed Jaws to become the highest-grossing film of all time, influencing every blockbuster in its wake.\n\nStar Wars was nominated for 10 Oscars and won six; whether or not the Academy made the right call by awarding Best Director and Best Picture to Woody Allen\u2018s Annie Hall is debatable.\n\nThe best part: Star Wars totally works as a self-contained film, and even on the millionth watch you want to stand up and cheer when reluctant hero Han swoops in and clears the way for Luke and the Force to blow up the Death Star. Check out a 1977 audience\u2019s reaction to the triumphant finale below.\n\n(Lucasfilm/ 20th Century Fox)\n\n1. Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nDecidedly not as exuberant a crowd-pleaser as its predecessor (in fact it plunges headfirst into darkness and despair), The Empire Strikes Back is nevertheless an even better film, and it represents some of the most powerful and sophisticated broad strokes in cinema.\n\nOne of the first sequels commonly regarded as superior to the original, Empire has become something of a template for second installments, with several middle chapters borrowing from it, attempting to crack its code over the decades. Though it is indeed the darkest film in the series, it\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s the funniest, too, made with more time and money than Lucas had for the first, with deeper ambitions and confidence in the visionary material.\n\nIn 2010, Empire was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \u201cculturally, historically, and aesthetically significant\u201d\u2014one of the only sequels ever to obtain the honor.\n\nThe best part: The Empire Strikes Back is such a masterpiece that arguably the best plot twist in film history isn\u2019t even its highest high. The characters in Empire are all so vividly realized, the emotional through-line is so clear and true\u2014yet the film belongs to Yoda. The two-foot-tall green puppet voiced by Frank Oz could have come off as cloying comic relief, but instead he\u2019s the Star Wars series\u2019 most indelible and imaginative creation, expanding the mystery of the Force and guiding Luke\u2019s story in thought-provoking directions only hinted at in the original.\n\nFrom the moment he appears onscreen (first presenting himself as senile and clueless to test Luke\u2019s patience and teach him a lesson about expectations) Yoda breaks down everything we think we know about the Star Wars universe\u2014and maybe ours, too.\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is now on streaming platforms, Blu-Ray March 31.\n\nDo you agree with our ranking of the Star Wars saga on the big screen?
