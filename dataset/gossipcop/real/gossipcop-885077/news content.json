It\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\nThe Dannon statement noted the company perceives Newton\u2019s comments as \u201csexist and disparaging to all women. It\u2019s simply not OK to belittle anyone based on gender. We have shared our concerns with Cam and will no longer work with him.\u201d\n\nCarlin & Reese (@CarlinReeseWIP) Here's the video of Cam Newton saying \"it's funny to hear a female talk about routes\" pic.twitter.com/hd9Kg4CCeu\n\nThe company later clarified: \u201cThe agreement has not been terminated. However, we will no longer work with him and are removing advertising with him in it.\u201d\n\nLater Thursday, Newton apologized in a video posted to Twitter for what he described as an \u201cextremely degrading and disrespectful\u201d choice of words.\n\n\u201cAfter careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to be honest, that was not my intention. If you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man who tries to be a positive role model to my community and tries to use my platform to inspire others. I take ownership to everything that comes with that. What I did was extremely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nDannon inked Newton to sponsor its Oikos brand of Greek yogurt in January 2015, shortly after the quarterback\u2019s maiden playoff victory.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Newton has sponsored Dannon\u2019s Oikos yogurt since 2015.\n\nBy the end of that year, one that saw the quarterback capture MVP honors while leading the Panthers to Super Bowl 50, Newton had become one of the NFL\u2019s most visible pitchmen with an endorsement portfolio including pacts with Gatorade, Under Armour, Beats By Dre, Nickelodeon, Carolina Health Systems and Belk worth an estimated $11m combined.\n\nGatorade also issued a statement Thursday, saying: \u201cCam\u2019s comments were objectionable and disrespectful to all women and they do not reflect the values of our brand. Gatorade fully supports women who compete in, report on, coach for, or play any role in sport \u2013 on or off the field.\u201d\n\nThe NFL added in another statement that Newton\u2019s response to the question was \u201cjust plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league.\u201d\n\nCam Newton's joyful Panthers remind us that football can still be fun Read more\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t appear there will be any punishment handed out to Newton.\n\n\u201cI think there are conversations going on at the club level with the appropriate people, with the Panthers,\u201d NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a conference call Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to anticipate the league stepping in there.\u201d\n\nMike Persinger, the executive sports editor of the Observer, said Wednesday evening that Newton\u2019s comments were \u201cunfortunate and out of line.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press Sports Editors announced that it \u201cagrees wholeheartedly that Mr Newton\u2019s response was out of line\u201d and \u201cwe ask for a formal apology to Jourdan Rodrigue from Mr Newton and the Carolina Panthers organization.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Newton hubbub inadvertently prompted a separate controversy after three tweets Rodrigue posted years ago with racial overtones were discovered by Black Sports Online. The reporter used the word \u201cnigga\u201d in one of the tweets and referenced laughing at racist jokes in the others.\n\n\u201cI apologize for the offensive tweets from my Twitter account from 4/5 years ago,\u201d Rodrigue said on Thursday. \u201cThere is no excuse for these tweets and the sentiment behind them. I am deeply sorry and apologize.\u201d\n\n\n\nNewton, who slumped badly last season after his spectacular MVP campaign in 2015, has passed for 882 yards with five touchdowns and five interceptions in four games this year, leading the Panthers to a 3-1 record and a tie for first place in the NFC South.", "images": ["https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DLYzj1aXkAgOe4D.jpg",
