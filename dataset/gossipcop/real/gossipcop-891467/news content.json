Later that month, police said they were looking into another claim of sexual assault in 2005, also in Lambeth. A third allegation about a 2005 incident in Westminster came to light in January.\n\nThe claims are being investigated by Scotland Yard\u2019s Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command.\n\nIn mid-November, the Old Vic said it had received 20 allegations of inappropriate behavior by Spacey and admitted there was a \u201ccult of personality\u201d around the actor and that his \u201cstardom\u201d and \u201cstatus\u201d might have prevented people \u2014 in particular junior staff or young actors \u2014 from speaking up.
