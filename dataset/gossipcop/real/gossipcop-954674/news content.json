See it, here.\n\nAfter Demi Lovato, 25, was rushed to the hospital for an alleged overdose, her ex, Joe Jonas, 28, shared his shock over the distressing news. \u201cLike all of you I am thinking of @ DDLovato right now. She needs our prayers and support. We all know how strong you are Demi. # prayfordemi,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. His message comes after it was reported that Demi was found \u201cunconscious\u201d in her Hollywood Hills home before she was administered Narcan and then taken to a nearby hospital.\n\nCurrently, she\u2019s \u201cawake and with her family who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support. Some of the information being reported is incorrect and they respectfully ask for privacy,\u201d her rep said in a statement given to TMZ. That \u201cincorrect\u201d information seems to stem from reports that claimed Demi overdosed on heroin. TMZ now claims it was not heroin that landed Demi in the hospital. As to what drug she may or may not have overdosed on \u2014 that information has not yet been released.\n\nDemi had a well documented struggle with substance abuse for years. Up until recently, she had been sober from alcohol, cocaine, and Oxycontin for six years. However, last month, she released a song called \u201cSober\u201d, revealing she no longer had a hold on her sobriety. Joe, who dated Demi at the peak of her issues with substance abuse, was with her the night was taken to rehab her first time. While struggling on their joint tour, she punched one of the backup dancers and was put into a facility that night. Fans hadn\u2019t seen much of the pair together for some time, but after Joe announced his engagement to Sophie Turner in October 2017, Demi was one of the first to congratulate him. \u201cHuge congrats!!!!! Sooooo happy for the both of you!!!!\u201d she wrote on the Instagram announcement.\n\nLike all of you I am thinking of @DDLovato right now. She needs our prayers and support. We all know how strong you are Demi. #prayfordemi \u2014 J O E J O N A S (@joejonas) July 25, 2018\n\nLike Joe, Nick Jonas also commented on the situation, saying, \u201cLike all of you I am reeling at the news about Demi. All of us love her and need to pray for her to get well. She is a fighter. #prayfordemi.\u201d", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F24%2Fjoe-jonas-reacts-demi-lovato-overdose-prayers-support%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3251566", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mothers-day-gifts-etsy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/sofia-richie-scott-disick-penelope-reign-cute-pics-love-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/joe-jonas-reacts-to-demi-lovato-heroin-overdose-ftr.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Long-Days-Journey-1-\u2013-PHOTO-by-BAI-LINGHAI.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/joe-jonas-reacts-to-demi-lovato-heroin-overdose-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/glowing-skin-cleanser.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/megan-thee-stallion-goes-makeup-free-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i0.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monsta-x-members.png?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/denise-richards-sets-record-straight-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/swat-season-3-finale-schedule.jpg?resize=230%2C135"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/joe-jonas-reacts-to-demi-lovato-heroin-overdose-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dina Sartore-Bodo Chris Rogers", "Dina Sartore-Bodo", "Chris Rogers", "Justina Huddleston", "Lana Parker", "Matt Webb Mitovich", "Tim Chan", "Ryan Lattanzio"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/24/joe-jonas-reacts-demi-lovato-overdose-prayers-support/", "title": "Joe Jonas Is \u2018Thinking Of Demi Lovato\u2019 After Alleged Overdose: \u2018She Needs Our Prayers & Support\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Joe Jonas reacts to Demi Lovato's apparent overdose in a sweet message on Twitter.
