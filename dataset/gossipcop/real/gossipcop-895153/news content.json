Every season of that show is leaving Netflix next month.\n\nThe Man From Snow River, an excellent Australian film with some of the best horse-riding cinematography out there, is also riding off into the sunset (we just watched this and the kids loved it. I watched it as a kid many times.)\n\nSee what's coming to Netflix in December, and what to watch, here.\n\nHoles, Nightcrawler and Lucky Number Slevin are also leaving and are all worth a viewing. And finally, toward the end of the month, the one truly good Pirates of the Caribbean---The Curse of the Black Pearl---will set sail never to be seen on Netflix again.
