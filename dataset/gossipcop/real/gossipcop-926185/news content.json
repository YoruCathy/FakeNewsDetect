Burke is also mom to daughters Sierra, 16, and Neriah, 18, from her previous marriage to Garth Fisher.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been separated for a couple of months and tried as hard as they could to make their marriage work, but at the end of the day they have to do what\u2019s right for them and their family,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE.\n\nImage zoom Chad Hurst/Getty\n\nThe former Dancing with the Stars host and Melrose Place alum \u201cmet in Mexico, and it was the perfect example of right guy, wrong time because we had this beautiful affair, came back to L.A. and just stayed friends,\u201d Burke told Health for its April 2014 cover story.\n\n\u201cIf we had gotten together then, we wouldn\u2019t have made it,\u201d she said of meeting two decades ago. \u201cWe had to grow up and then we found each other much later in life, and it was the right time.\u201d\n\nFollowing a five-year engagement, the couple tied the knot in a secret St. Barts wedding in August 2011. \u201cIt is not often that you get to plan a very special occasion, and have it play out just as you imagined in your mind,\u201d Burke wrote in a blog post for her parenting website, Modern Mom. \u201cEven the weather was perfect.\u201d\n\nDescribing the wedding as a \u201csecret mission,\u201d she added, \u201cWe told no one \u2013 no friends, not even our mothers. We broke the news to our children just days before our departure.\u201d\n\nBurke and Charvet were married on a sailboat anchored off of a private beach, while music they had handpicked played in the background. \u201cI felt incredibly peaceful, certain, and blissfully happy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn my soul, I was already married. Making the spiritual commitment to exchange vows in our favorite place, in front of our four children, with my soulmate seemed like a real life fairytale.\u201d\n\nOf keeping their connection alive, Burke told Health in 2014, \u201cWe believe in romance. We hold hands. We cook together. We still make out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fiery passionate people, so when we fight, it\u2019s like the 4th of July!\u201d she added.\n\nTMZ first reported the news.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fbrooke-burke.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1345&h=704&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fbrooke-burke.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1345&h=704&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fbrooke-burke.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Stone", "Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorcing/", "title": "Brooke Burke and David Charvet Divorcing After Nearly 7 Years of Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Brooke Burke,Divorce,Marriage,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Brooke Burke,Divorce,Marriage,News,TV", "description": "The couple wed in August 2011", "og": {"title": "Brooke Burke and David Charvet Divorcing After Nearly 7 Years of Marriage", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/brooke-burke-david-charvet-divorcing/", "description": "After nearly seven years of marriage, Brooke Burke and David Charvet are divorcing, PEOPLE confirms.
