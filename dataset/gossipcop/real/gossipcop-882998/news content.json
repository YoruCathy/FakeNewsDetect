The fact that Virgil\u2019s come this far. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s like a symbol. Like, they made it. They did it. They\u2019re taking over the fashion world when everyone told them they couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nImage zoom West and Kim in Paris in June.

Like he had to be there.\u201d\n\nThough Kim admitted, \u201cFor a second, I was like, I was so stressed out over my security, just the movement of everyone. But other that, it was fine. I didn\u2019t really have a lot of anxiety.\u201d\n\nThe reality star even believed she could go back for a longer visit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever really forget my experiences in Paris \u2014 the good or the bad \u2014 and I think that\u2019s okay,\u201d Kim said in an on-camera interview. \u201cIt all has made me who I am.
