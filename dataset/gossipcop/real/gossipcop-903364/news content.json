Being pregnant, it's a whole different type of self-care,\" the Revenge Body health and fitness guru explains. \"I still exercise to maintain my sanity and also to feel good about myself, but my workouts are not as intense as they once were. I'm also eating differently because, of course I have cravings, but I want to make sure I'm supplying my baby with the proper nutrients.\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm focused on being healthy mind, body and soul for myself and the baby -- but man, I can't wait to be a beast in the gym already, LOL,\" she adds. \"Still, for as active as I have been during my pregnancy, I feel great. So my new year's resolution will be to stay as healthy mentally and physically as I can!\"\n\n\n\nThe post comes following the backlash Kardashian received last month from fans shaming her for working out with a little one on the way.\n\n\n\n\"For the ones who think they are physicians all of a sudden,\" she tweeted. \"MY doctor and I communicate and my workouts are cleared and highly recommended. Thanks kiddos! Don't make me stop sharing s**t.\"\n\nFor the ones who think they are physicians all of a sudden \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but MY doctor and I communicate and my workouts are cleared and highly recommended.
