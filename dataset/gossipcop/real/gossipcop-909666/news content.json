There, they met with Syrians who fled the violence of the ongoing civil war in the country, including girls around Jolie\u2019s daughters\u2019 ages who were part of the TIGER (These Inspiring Girls Enjoy Reading) project, which focuses on education and empowerment even in displacement.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nThe trip was Shiloh\u2019s third visit to a refugee camp and the first for Zahara.\n\nOne girl told Jolie and her daughters, \u201cWe believe if the adults can make peace now, we young women will build on that peace and help.\u201d\n\nThe project, in partnership with International Relief and Development, is designed to fight the epidemic of refugees dropping out of school, with only 20 percent completing a secondary school education. TIGER works with Syrian female coaches to help the girls build confidence.\n\nImage zoom Ivor Prickett/UNHCR\n\nImage zoom Shadi Nsoor/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nGirls at the Zataari refugee camp wrote their dreams on small pieces of paper, which they put in balloons and released. One said, \u201cI want to be one of the balloons outside of the box.\u201d\n\nJolie, 42, spoke to the refugees about how they inspired her and gave her hope.\n\n\u201cAfter seven years of war, most Syrian refugees have exhausted any savings they had. The vast majority of them already live below the poverty line, on less than three dollars a day. Imagine what that would mean for your family,\u201d she said in a speech. \u201cHere, it means families going without sufficient food; children unable to get medical treatment; young girls vulnerable to early marriage; and many Syrians facing their seventh winter without proper shelter.\u201d\n\nRELATED: All About Angelina Jolie\u2019s Connection to Cambodia That Led to Her Golden Globe Nominated Film\n\nThe actress added, \u201cHumanitarian aid is not a long-term solution. And to be clear, no one wants to get off aid relief more than Syrian families.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Ivor Prickett/UNHCR\n\nImage zoom Ivor Prickett/UNHCR\n\n\u201cFor such an educated, capable people, it is soul-destroying to be made this dependent. So I would urge the Security Council members to come to the region, to visit the camps and the urban refugees, and find a way to finally bring the full weight of the UN and international community to bear to solve this conflict.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Angelina Jolie Attends U.N.
