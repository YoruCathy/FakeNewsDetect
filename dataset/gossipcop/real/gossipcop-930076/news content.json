Downey was joined by a former Russian spy (Scarlett Johansson), a God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth), and one who \u201cfought in World War II,\u201d (Chris Evans).\n\nIn comes Chris Pratt, claiming Star-Lord as \u201cthe greatest to ever walk the Earth, by far.\u201d Anthony Mackie and Benedict Cumberbatch sang their own introductions \u2014 a falcon and a magic doctor, respectively \u2014 while Chadwick Boseman kept it sweet and simple, singing, \u201cWakanda Forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo then one day all the heroes were assembled, to fight a villain who packed much more than a punch,\u201d the cast chorused. \u201cAnd this group was labeled the Avengers, that\u2019s the way we all became the Marvel Bunch.\u201d\n\nThe super crew got a last minute addition from the one and only Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who punctuated the song with a signature \u201cHello, brother,\u201d thrown Hemsworth\u2019s way. \u201cShut up!\u201d Hemsworth pitched back from his own Brady Bunch box.\n\nWatch the Avengers croon their new theme song above.", "images":
