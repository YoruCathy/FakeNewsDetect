With Whedon's help, the movie is still on track for its Nov. 17 release date.\n\nSnyder\u2019s daughter Autumn Snyder died by suicide in March at age 20. Her death has been kept private, with only a small inner circle aware of what happened, even as the movie was put on a two-week break for the Snyders to deal with the immediate effects of the tragedy. Zack Snyder says he initially was eager to return to the film, which stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I thought it was a cathartic thing to go back to work, to just bury myself and see if that was the way through it,\u201d said an emotional Snyder in an interview Monday in his office on the Warner Bros. lot, with Deborah sitting by his side. \u201cThe demands of this job are pretty intense. It is all-consuming. And in the last two months, I\u2019ve come to the realization \u2026 I\u2019ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me. They are all having a hard time. I\u2019m having a hard time.\u201d\n\nThe studio is fully behind the move. \u201cWhat they are going through is unimaginable, and my heart \u2014 our hearts \u2014 go out to them,\" says Warner Bros. Pictures president Toby Emmerich.\n\nOne of the first things the studio floated was the possibility of pushing back the release date of the movie, but the Snyders decided against that. Warners also extended Snyder's first-look deal to give him time to work on other planned projects when he returns to work.\n\nSnyder, after screening a rough cut of Justice League for fellow filmmakers and friends, wanted to add additional scenes, so he brought Whedon on board to write them. But as he prepared to shoot the scenes in England, Snyder realized it was not the time to leave home. \u201cThe directing is minimal and it has to adhere to the style and tone and the template that Zack set,\u201d says Emmerich. \u201cWe\u2019re not introducing any new characters. It\u2019s the same characters in some new scenes. He\u2019s handing the baton to Joss, but the course has really been set by Zack. I still believe that despite this tragedy, we\u2019ll still end up with a great movie.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Warner Bros. has had to deal with the unthinkable affecting a high-profile DC movie. In 2008, Heath Ledger passed away after shooting had wrapped for The Dark Knight but prior to the movie being finished and released. The tragedy put the studio and filmmaker Christopher Nolan in a very delicate position of balancing mourning with the demands of releasing a tentpole.\n\nThe internet and comic book movie fans being what they are, Snyder already is anticipating what some DC loyalists may think.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, I never planned to make this public,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought it would just be in the family, a private matter, our private sorrow that we would deal with. When it became obvious that I need to take a break, I knew there would be narratives created on the internet. They\u2019ll do what they do. The truth is \u2026 I\u2019m past caring about that kind of thing now.\u201d\n\nThe death of Autumn, Zack's daughter from his first marriage, to Denise Snyder (in addition to Autumn, he and Deborah have been raising seven kids and step-kids), has brought a new perspective and a new focus for him. \u201cI want the movie to be amazing, and I\u2019m a fan, but that all pales pretty quickly in comparison,\" he says. \u201cI know the fans are going to be worried about the movie, but there are seven other kids that need me. In the end, it\u2019s just a movie. It\u2019s a great movie. But it\u2019s just a movie.\"\n\nAutumn, who was attending Sarah Lawrence College, loved \u201cto write, to write, to write,\u201d says Deborah. Their daughter had written a sci-fi fantasy novel in the first person. It featured a character who was an outsider and who had trouble fitting in.\n\nDeborah is holding on to the thought that she was the first person her daughter gave the book to read, even now as the story takes on a new meaning under the circumstances. \u201cYou\u2019re hearing her voice,\u201d Deborah says, fighting back tears.\n\nThe Snyders would like to some day see that manuscript published, with the proceeds going to a charity. \u201cIn the end, she didn\u2019t make it, but her character does, and I think there would be something cathartic for people,\u201d says Zack.\n\nThe thought of his daughter\u2019s writing prompts Zack to recall another memory. Autumn had a quote that she included in everything she wrote. (\u201cEvery. Single. Thing,\u201d chuckles Zack.) It\u2019s from author Chuck Palahniuk: \u201cWe all die. The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that will.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe this helps,\u201d says Zack.", "images": ["https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2020/01/star_trek_voyager_9-h_2020.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/blogs/promoflag-thr-latest-news.png?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-grey.png?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/homepage-icons/heat-vision-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/768x433/2017/05/zack_snyder_deborah_snyder_.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/zack_snyder_deborah_snyder_.jpg", "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/block_landscape_450_253/2020/04/hikari_molly_smith_metzler__cover_art_of_dan_and_sam_split-h_2020.jpg", "https://assets.hollywoodreporter.com/assets/1576792252/images/brand/thr-logo-white.svg?abfebfb5f298762e7c71"], "top_img": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/zack_snyder_deborah_snyder_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Borys Kit", "Phil Pirrello", "Richard New", "Graeme Mcmillan", "Ryan Parker", "Lesley Goldberg", "Katie Kilkenny", "Sheri Linden", "Ashley Cullins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455", "title": "Zack Snyder Steps Down From 'Justice League' to Deal With Family Tragedy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The filmmaker's daughter died by suicide in March, prompting him to take a break from work and hire Joss Whedon to finish the Warner Bros. superhero pic: \"I\u2019ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me.\"", "twitter": {"site": "@THR", "creator": "@THR", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455", "domain": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/", "title": "Zack Snyder Steps Down From 'Justice League' to Deal With Family Tragedy", "description": "The filmmaker's daughter died by suicide in March, prompting him to take a break from work and hire Joss Whedon to finish the Warner Bros. superhero pic: \"I\u2019ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/NFE_Landscape/2017/05/zack_snyder_deborah_snyder_.jpg"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "title": "Zack Snyder Steps Down From 'Justice League' to Deal With Family Tragedy", "description": "The filmmaker's daughter died by suicide in March, prompting him to take a break from work and hire Joss Whedon to finish the Warner Bros. superhero pic: \"I\u2019ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me.\"", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/05/zack_snyder_deborah_snyder_.jpg", "width": 1296, "height": 730, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "sailthru.title": "Zack Snyder Steps Down From 'Justice League' to Deal With Family Tragedy", "sailthru.description": "The filmmaker's daughter died by suicide in March, prompting him to take a break from work and hire Joss Whedon to finish the Warner Bros. superhero pic: \"I\u2019ve decided to take a step back from the movie to be with my family, be with my kids, who really need me.\"", "sailthru.author": "Borys Kit", "sailthru.channel": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.vertical": "Heat Vision", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-22 14:51:53", "sailthru.tags": "Heat Vision, Movies, Zack Snyder, Justice League"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495435913.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
