Beyonce would continue to reign \u2013 which she most certainly did, with her Coachella headlining performance, On The Run II tour with Jay-Z and her surprise new album. Drake would have a big summer, like he has the past few years \u2013 and that also came true, with his various singles from his \u201cScorpion\u201d album ruling the airwaves this summer into fall. And, Kanye West would continue to be unpredictable \u2013 which definitely happened, from his roller coaster of political involvement to his musical output, including his seven-song album \u201cYe\u201d and his surprise hit single \u201cI Love It\u201d with Lil Pump.\n\nIt was the other acts this year that kept things interesting, from surprise rising acts to pop stars that released career-best albums or shone even brighter than we expected. Read on for a list of acts that pleasantly surprised us in 2018.\n\nMore:Here are USA TODAY's best albums of 2018\n\nCardi B\n\nAfter breaking through last year with \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d Cardi B was one of music\u2019s biggest question marks this year, concerning whether she\u2019d be able to follow her hit single with something similar and how she\u2019d continue to build on her success. As it turned out, Cardi fans had nothing to worry about \u2013 the rapper more than exceeded expectations with her stacked debut album \u201cInvasion of Privacy,\u201d which charmed critics and spawned a number of successful singles, including \u201cI Like It,\u201d which racked up the kind of numbers to outperform \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d a feat that naysayers never would\u2019ve believed last year.\n\nSince the release of \u201cInvasion of Privacy,\u201d she\u2019s remained one of the most visible stars of her genre, contributing one guest feature after another to both hip-hop songs and Spanish-language tracks. All this, and she gave birth to her first child, daughter Kulture, in July.\n\nMore:Cardi B's unapologetic pregnancy deserves to be celebrated\n\nReview:Cardi B is a star on debut album 'Invasion of Privacy'\n\nAriana Grande\n\nLet\u2019s start with what wasn\u2019t surprising about Grande this year: that she released one of the year\u2019s best pop albums, \u201cSweetener,\u201d since anyone who\u2019s been following the singer\u2019s career would know that she\u2019s capable of producing excellent work. What was surprising were Grande\u2019s creative choices, the most interesting of her career, which she continued to pull off even as she survived yet another incredibly rocky summer. Last year, she persevered after the tragic bombings at her Manchester concert, her struggles of that period helping to inspire the material on \u201cSweetener,\u201d on which she recruited Pharrell Williams to help take her sound in a newer, weirder direction.\n\nThen came this summer\u2019s death of Mac Miller and her breakup with Pete Davidson, which she addressed with her No. 1 single \u201cThank U, Next,\u201d a song that managed to graciously thank her exes and also serve as her public statement of perseverance. Grande was always one of pop\u2019s most talented stars; in 2018, she emerged as one of its smartest, most fascinating and all-around best.\n\nReview:Ariana Grande's 'Sweetener' reconciles the saddest, happiest events in her life\n\nLil Wayne\n\nThe 2018 release of \u201cTha Carter V\u201d, the rapper\u2019s endlessly-delayed fifth album, is surprising enough. Even Wayne\u2019s most die-hard fans have to admit that the rapper hasn\u2019t had the strongest few years of output recently, which along with his various health issues fueled speculation that \u201cTha Carter V\u201d would never see the light of day. But \u201cTha Carter V\u201d didn\u2019t just see an official release date this year but flourished, debuting at No. 1 and winning over skeptical critics who never thought they\u2019d hear Wayne rap at that level again.\n\nThe big talker of the album was \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d a hip-hop opera condensed into a few minutes of music, featuring Kendrick Lamar playing multiple characters and adopting a series of wild voices, with Wayne holding his own through it all. Even without \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d \u201cTha Carter V\u201d is a feat that shows the danger of ever counting him out of the music race.\n\n'Carter V is Everything!!!':Twitter completely melts down over Lil Wayne's new album\n\nElla Mai\n\n2018 had many breakout stars, but the 24-year-old singer was one of the year\u2019s sweetest surprises, with an underdog story worth rooting for. After a failed audition for \u201cThe X Factor\u201d and an EP that didn\u2019t make waves, Mai began posting clips of her singing to Instagram, where she was discovered by megaproducer DJ Mustard, who signed her to his label and released a series of EPs in 2016 and 2017. Her breakthrough single, \u201cBoo\u2019d Up,\u201d came out in February 2017 but steadily gained traction and finally took hold in early 2018, where it became one the year\u2019s most memorable songs of the summer. Follow-up single \u201cTrip\u201d came next, as did her self-titled debut album in October and an \u201cSNL\u201d performance in November, with her success showing few signs of slowing down for now.\n\n'Boo'd Up':How newcomer Ella Mai made the most swoon-worthy love song of the summer\n\nReview:The five best songs from Ella Mai's new album that aren't 'Boo'd Up' or 'Trip'\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nShe finally did it. Taylor Swift, famous for keeping politics out of her well-curated public image, finally broke her silence in October to endorse Democratic political candidates in Tennessee during the 2018 midterms. It was a move that many Swift fans had been hoping for \u2013 and one that some of her conservative followers didn't exactly appreciate. Yet detractors aside, her public statement was the right move for a star who's vocally supported women\u2019s issues and LGBTQ rights, proving that she's willing to work toward advancing those causes by publicly supporting candidates who've backed those policies.\n\nAnd ending her year with news of her new record label deal with Universal Music Group, in which she lobbied for the label's artists to receive fair compensation should UMG sell its Spotify shares, gave Swift fans further faith that their idol is fighting the good fight.\n\nMore:Taylor Swift's political statement is a redeeming moment for the star\n\nRead on:Taylor Swift reveals she signed a new record deal and used it to boost other artists' pay", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/usatsports/247WallSt.com-247WS-510578-cardi-b.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/usatsports/247WallSt.com-247WS-510578-cardi-b.jpg?width=1365&height=768&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/usatsports/247WallSt.com-247WS-510578-cardi-b.jpg?width=1365&height=768&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/12/24/best-surprises-2018-music-cardi-b-taylor-swift-ariana-grande/2127629002/", "title": "The biggest and best surprises of 2018 music: Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and more", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "The biggest and best surprises of 2018 music: Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and more", "description": "From their music to their activism, these acts pleasantly surprised us in 2018.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/12/24/best-surprises-2018-music-cardi-b-taylor-swift-ariana-grande/2127629002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/usatsports/247WallSt.com-247WS-510578-cardi-b.jpg?width=1365&height=768&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1365, "height": 768}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Maeve McDermott", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "From their music to their activism, these acts pleasantly surprised us in 2018.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2b05a4ab25f4fca0316459e1c7404c537a89702/c=0-0-1365-768/local/-/media/2018/12/11/USATODAY/usatsports/247WallSt.com-247WS-510578-cardi-b.jpg?width=1365&height=682&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "The biggest and best surprises of 2018 music: Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande and more", "description": "From their music to their activism, these acts pleasantly surprised us in 2018."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545580800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
