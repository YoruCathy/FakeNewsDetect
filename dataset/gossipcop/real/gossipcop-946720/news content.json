We have learned that Prince Harry headed for a \u2018private visit\u2019 to Pitseng, Lesotho in South Africa without his new bride Meghan Markle.\n\nApparently, Harry is set to be in attendance at the opening of a brand new dining hall at the Phelisanong Children\u2019s Centres on behalf of the charity he co-founded with close pal Prince Seeiso back in 2006.\n\nOne spokesperson for the charity Sentebale (\u2018forget me not\u2019) released the following statement: \u2018The Duke was on a private visit to view the work of Sentebale at a camp for helpless children and youngsters, as well as other projects funded by the same charity. During this private working visit to Sentebale, the Duke visited one of its community-led partners for the opening of a brand new dining hall. This was funded by the charity and is set to provide a space for kids to eat together and have indoor space to play.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, on the charity\u2019s official webpage it can be read that \u2018Sentebale supports the mental health as well as the well-being of kids and young people affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana. Our programs of education and care provide the tools and knowledge that this vulnerable generation needs to live long, happy, healthy lives in the future.\u2019\n\nAccording to Kensington Palace, Harry will also be part of a board meeting of a conservation charity named Africa Parks, that he is an advocate for.\n\nHowever, it turns out that his little trip is set to end pretty soon as he also has to be there for Queen\u2019s Young Leaders at Buckingham Palace reception on Tuesday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan Markle will be in attendance as well.", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mama-june-and-Geno-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ashley-Mitchell-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Camilla-Parker-Bowles-and-Prince-Charles-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-Are-Not-Wanted-Back-In-The-UK-As-Royals-According-To-New-Poll-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-Baby-Archie-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/prince-harry.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/prince-harry.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Mitchell", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/prince-harry-goes-on-solo-charity-trip-to-africa-without-meghan-161855/", "title": "Prince Harry Goes On Solo Charity Trip To Africa Without Meghan!", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Ashley Mitchell", "news_keywords": "meghan markle, prince harry, royal family,", "keywords": "celebrity news, meghan markle, prince harry, royal family,", "description": "This marks the royal\u2019s first official public appearance on his own since the wedding.
