Even without the 40-year-old rapper\u2019s daily musings, the Twitterverse remained as addictive and corrosive as ever, thanks in large part to it having become, under the 45th president, a flashpoint for international diplomacy, partisan combat and ruthless trollery. But this past weekend, seemingly out of nowhere, Yeezy returned to the site where he once admitted to getting \u201cemotional over fonts\u201d, declared The Life of Pablo \u201cthe album of the life\u201d and wondered about the providence of a water bottle he discovered while on an airplane.\n\nThe rise and rise of Kanye West\u2019s influence on fashion Read more\n\nHaving deleted all those old tweets, West started anew on Sunday with a remarkably on-brand, and predictably existentialist, message. \u201cSome people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,\u201d he wrote, following it up with photos of forthcoming Yeezy footwear and the word \u201cSaint\u201d, West\u2019s son\u2019s name, in various typefaces.\n\nKANYE WEST (@kanyewest) often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends\n\nFollowing a 24-hour break, he returned again on Tuesday with a string of aphorisms: \u201cAs a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency,\u201d read one tweet. \u201cTry to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas,\u201d he wrote in another, which the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes called \u201cextremely good advice\u201d. West went on to call distraction \u201cthe enemy of vision\u201d and instructed his 7.6 million followers to \u201cmake decisions based on love not fear\u201d.\n\nAll these tweets made more sense once West, in a Hollywood Reporter interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt, revealed plans to release a philosophy book called Break the Simulation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this new concept that I\u2019ve been diggin\u2019 into,\u201d he said, describing his Barthesian thesis about photography. \u201cI\u2019ve got a concept about photographs, and I\u2019m on the fence about photographs \u2013 about human beings being obsessed with photographs \u2013 because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future.\u201d Time, West added, \u201cis our most valuable resource\u201d.\n\nTo his longtime fans, the preoccupation with lofty ideas like time, capitalism and consciousness are just about the least surprising thing about the 21-time Grammy winner\u2019s return to Twitter. He\u2019s always been hip-hop\u2019s pre-eminent and most brazen sage. What may come as a surprise, though, is the fact that West\u2019s latest tweets are the book, as he revealed on Wednesday morning. \u201cOh by the way this is my book that I\u2019m writing in real time,\u201d West wrote. \u201cNo publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write.\u201d\n\nKANYE WEST (@kanyewest) let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.\n\nOf course, a tweet-stream-of-consciousness book is not the only thing on West\u2019s plate. The rapper-cum-designer is also reportedly working on his eighth studio album, his first since 2016\u2019s The Life of Pablo, which was dropped during an elaborate listening session at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden. In a since-deleted tweet from 2016, West said his next album would be called \u201cTurbo Grafx 16\u201d, a title that\u2019s presumably gone through a few iterations since, as West changed the name of his seventh album several times before settling on Pablo.\n\nIn March, E! News reported that West, along with several of his collaborators, was recording at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where \u201che is in the zone to get things done\u201d. Rumored visitors of West\u2019s, gleaned from Instagram posts and sightings in the Jackson area, reportedly included the Dream, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and the Chicago rapper King Louie.\n\nNevertheless, exactly when West plans to release new music is unclear. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a third child, Chicago, in January, and he\u2019s also hard at work on the latest collection for his clothing line, Yeezy. But if West\u2019s insightful and reliably zany return to Twitter is any indication, he is not wanting for consciousness-shifting ideas.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=d428b9f867971d47cefc14e030c755ca", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56ceecb31263917dc8382e43816d6d1e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Kanye+West%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CHip-hop%2CRap%2CPhilosophy+books%2CBooks%2CKim+Kardashian+West%2CTwitter%2CInternet%2CTechnology", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56ceecb31263917dc8382e43816d6d1e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Nevins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/18/kanye-west-twitter-return-philosophy-book", "title": "Kanye West returns to Twitter, writing a philosophy book 'in real time'", "meta_data": {"description": "The rapper made an unexpected return to the platform, sharing a book involving time and photography and advice for creatives", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Jake Nevins", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=55829dbd15d3a07113987ee8dca2fd33", "keywords": "Kanye West,Music,Culture,Hip-hop,Rap,Philosophy books,Books,Kim Kardashian West,Twitter,Internet,Technology", "news_keywords": "Kanye West,Music,Culture,Hip-hop,Rap,Philosophy books,Books,Kim Kardashian West,Twitter,Internet", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/18/kanye-west-twitter-return-philosophy-book", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=56ceecb31263917dc8382e43816d6d1e", "description": "The rapper made an unexpected return to the platform, sharing a book involving time and photography and advice for creatives", "type": "article", "title": "Kanye West returns to Twitter, writing a philosophy book 'in real time'", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jake-nevins", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-04-18T19:55:37.000Z", "tag": "Kanye West,Music,Culture,Hip-hop,Rap,Philosophy books,Books,Kim Kardashian West,Twitter,Internet,Technology", "modified_time": "2018-04-23T09:35:43.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/apr/18/kanye-west-twitter-return-philosophy-book?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/apr/18/kanye-west-twitter-return-philosophy-book?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/18/kanye-west-twitter-return-philosophy-book", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/apr/18/kanye-west-twitter-return-philosophy-book?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9c67bc391b477148487b8e24af63575492ff087/0_88_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=92a098e45c6188f366502aa540656d07", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jhnevins", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523980800.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
