The 22-year-old nanny called out race car driver Luyendyk for privately tweeting her last month after he had already chosen his bride.\n\n\u201cDM\u2019ing your ex on twitter is a great look, too, @ariejr,\u201d Martinez wrote alongside screenshots of the alleged exchanges. One image showed a picture of Martinez\u2019s Bachelor headshot on a milk carton, a meme that went viral after it was revealed that she had been on a missing person\u2019s list in November.\n\n10 Times \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Made Our Heads Explode!\n\n\u201cThis may just win the internet,\u201d he allegedly wrote on February 2. \u201cSuch a shame they didn\u2019t use your license photo.\u201d\n\n\u201cLol! I made that,\u201d she replied. \u201cSo there was no way in hell I was using the license photo . . . hahaha.\u201d\n\nLuyendyk responded: \u201cSo good. You seriously crack me up. Hope all is well.\u201d\n\nBut the ABC reality star wasn\u2019t done. He allegedly reached out the following day with another musing. \u201cJust realized you were born the same year as my first 2-on-1,\u201d he wrote, referencing their 14 -year age difference.\n\nAfter putting Luyendyk on blast, Martinez admitted she wasn\u2019t sure of his intentions. \u201cYeah arie was probably being friendly but guess what I DON\u2019T CARE HAHAHA,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cBOY BYEEEE.\u201d\n\nMartinez also used her Twitter account to offer words of support to 27-year-old Kufrin. \u201c@ariejr is the biggest f\u2014king tool i\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she wrote. \u201cbeck is a queen. a goddess. thank the LORD he\u2019s out of her life.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/147657_5027_arie-luyendyk-jr-bekah-martinez-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/147657_5027_arie-luyendyk-jr-bekah-martinez-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C119px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/147657_5027_arie-luyendyk-jr-bekah-martinez-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bekah-martinez-arie-luyendyk-jr-dmed-me-after-bachelor/", "title": "Bekah Martinez: Arie Luyendyk Jr. DM'ed Me After \u2018Bachelor\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bekah Martinez shared the messages Arie Luyendyk sent her after season 22 of \u2018 The Bachelor\u2019 had wrapped \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bekah Martinez Shares Messages Arie Sent Her After \u2018The Bachelor\u2019", "description": "Bekah Martinez shared the messages Arie Luyendyk sent her after season 22 of \u2018 The Bachelor\u2019 had wrapped \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bekah-martinez-arie-luyendyk-jr-dmed-me-after-bachelor/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-06T19:44:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/147657_5027_arie-luyendyk-jr-bekah-martinez-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/147657_5027_arie-luyendyk-jr-bekah-martinez-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-06T14:09:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-06T19:44:55+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bekah Martinez shared the messages Arie Luyendyk sent her after season 22 of \u2018 The Bachelor\u2019 had wrapped \u2014 find out more", "title": "Bekah Martinez Shares Messages Arie Sent Her After \u2018The Bachelor\u2019", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/147657_5027_arie-luyendyk-jr-bekah-martinez-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520345395.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
