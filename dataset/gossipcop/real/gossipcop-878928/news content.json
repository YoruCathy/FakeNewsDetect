Do we write it off as a statistical anomaly? Wow! Who would\u2019ve thought? Is it just Mother Nature in a bad mood? I don\u2019t know how you think about it but I think it could be something much more than all of that.\u201d\n\nHe then quoted a section from the Bible and said that hurricanes are \u201ca spectacular display of God\u2019s immense power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he puts his power on display, it\u2019s never without reason,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a purpose. And we may not always understand what that purpose is, but we know it\u2019s not random and we know that weather is sent to cause us to respond to God in humility, awe and repentance.\u201d\n\nThe video has been shared more than 5,000 times and has attracted more than 3,000 comments, some agreeing with his opinion, others dissenting strongly.\n\n\u201cAmazing. He actually thinks a god murders people with weather events, in order to teach them humility. Kirk has an impressively twisted mind,\u201d one wrote.\n\n\u201cTape your mouth shut idiot,\u201d another commented.\n\n\u201cGod doesn\u2019t cause hurricanes Dave,\u201d another wrote. \u201cHeat, wind and water do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let me get this straight, your magical sky wizard sent the hurricanes that HAVE ALREADY KILLED PEOPLE as a display of his love? #notmygod,\u201d another commenter wrote.\n\nThe death toll from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated Houston and dumped several feet of rain on southeast Texas, has risen to at least 70.\n\nIrma has swept through the Caribbean, killing at least 23 people and bringing catastrophic devastation to several islands including Barbuda, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla, the Virgin Islands and Cuba. Six million Florida residents were ordered to evacuate before the first effects of Irma were felt in the Florida Keys on Saturday, bringing winds of 125 mph. The eye of the storm is expected to hit the Sunshine State on Sunday.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gettyimages-615552952-f3a78264-fb04-4c31-b420-f7b21548d008.jpg?crop=0px%2C70px%2C1401px%2C787px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gettyimages-615552952-f3a78264-fb04-4c31-b420-f7b21548d008.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C1401px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gettyimages-615552952-f3a78264-fb04-4c31-b420-f7b21548d008.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C1401px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kirk-cameron-criticized-for-controversial-hurricane-irma-comments-w502129/", "title": "Kirk Cameron Criticized for Controversial Hurricane Irma Comments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Former \u2018Growing Pains\u2019 star Kirk Cameron was criticized on social media after making controversial comments about Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kirk Cameron Criticized for Controversial Hurricane Irma Comments", "description": "Former \u2018Growing Pains\u2019 star Kirk Cameron was criticized on social media after making controversial comments about Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kirk-cameron-criticized-for-controversial-hurricane-irma-comments-w502129/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:33:54+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gettyimages-615552952-f3a78264-fb04-4c31-b420-f7b21548d008.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C1401px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gettyimages-615552952-f3a78264-fb04-4c31-b420-f7b21548d008.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C1401px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-09-09T22:04:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:33:54+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Former \u2018Growing Pains\u2019 star Kirk Cameron was criticized on social media after making controversial comments about Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey \u2014 read more", "title": "Kirk Cameron Criticized for Controversial Hurricane Irma Comments", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/gettyimages-615552952-f3a78264-fb04-4c31-b420-f7b21548d008.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C1401px%2C736px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504994644.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
