Actress Scarlett Johansson, giving her second barn-burning speech at a Women\u2019s March in as many years, called out Globe winner James Franco on Saturday saying: \u201cI want my pin back, by the way.\u201d\n\nIn addition to winning a Golden Globe two weeks ago, Franco, who wore a Time\u2019s Up pin while claiming his prize, also garnered a lot of attention thanks to some comments on social media during the ceremony including some pointed, since-deleted tweets from actress Ally Sheedy. A few days later, the L.A. Times printed a report of five women accusing Franco of sexual misconduct. Franco denied the allegations. The actor has now been publicly addressed by Johansson, one of the original signers of the Time\u2019s Up announcement letter and a major donor to the cause.\n\nThough she didn\u2019t name him directly during her speech in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, a rep for Johansson later confirmed to the L.A. Times that the actress was indeed referring directly to Franco when she said: \u201cHow could a person publicly stand by an organization that helps to provide support for victims of sexual assault while privately preying on people who have no power?\u201d Pausing for effect, she then asked Franco for her pin back. Her comments start at the 1:25 mark.\n\nJohansson posed further questions on much-debated topics such as abuses of power and what some deem grey areas of consent before saying she felt a \u201crage\u201d bubbling up inside her on behalf of women who have been abused and also, she admitted, on behalf of herself.\n\nJohansson then related her own personal experience: \u201cSuddenly I was 19 again and I began to remember all the men who had taken advantage of the fact that I was a young woman who didn\u2019t yet have the tools to say no, or understand the value of my own self-worth,\u201d said Johansson who appeared in her first film at the age of 10. \u201cI had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative that I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out, and that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more pandering,\u201d Johansson concluded. \u201cNo more feeling guilty about hurting someone\u2019s feelings when something doesn\u2019t feel right for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have made a promise to myself to be responsible to my self, that in order to trust my instincts I must first respect them.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a52dede3122f97519bc9224/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ally-sheedy-james-franco.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a576e1a4c609b6180fdd7a7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/NUP_181312_0478.JPG", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a5781c2042f6f0c122738a2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/james-franco-inappropriate-behavior.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a5908c4a751ec04a440ef48/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/the-deuce-james-franco.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson", "Joanna Robinso", "Yohana Dest", "Laura Bradle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/01/james-franco-scarlett-johansson-womens-march-speech", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Calls out James Franco in Women\u2019s March Speech", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "\u201cI want my pin back.\u201d", "id": "5a640ebc522d2433237667ba", "keywords": "celebrity,scarlett johansson,james franco,sexual misconduct,time,red carpet", "news_keywords": "celebrity,scarlett johansson,james franco,sexual misconduct,time,red carpet", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a640ebc522d2433237667ba", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cI want my pin back.\u201d\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cI want my pin back.\u201d", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Calls out James Franco in Women\u2019s March Speech", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/01/james-franco-scarlett-johansson-womens-march-speech"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "\u201cI want my pin back.\u201d", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a641448ed2de0661578746d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/scarlett-johansson-james-franco.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Calls out James Franco in Women\u2019s March Speech"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/GcZvORB_b1o?ecver=2"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
