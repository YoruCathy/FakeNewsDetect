Luckily for those diehard Arizona Robbins fans, ShondaLand has revealed that the character will be getting her very own spinoff!\n\nLike Private Practice, the new series (which is still untitled) will follow Arizona as she sets off on a new adventure. This time, Arizona will be moving to New York to be closer to her daughter who had moved there with Callie.\n\nAs seen on Grey\u2019s Anatomy, Sofia was having a hard time returning to Seattle to visit Arizona. It clearly made things harder for both mother and daughter. This will lead to Arizona deciding to move to New York.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if this means that Arizona will also try to rekindle things with her ex-wife, given that Sara Ramirez has seemingly moved on from her character of Callie. But fans can always hope!\n\nEither way, we\u2019re excited to hear that Jessica Capshaw won\u2019t be leaving the Grey\u2019s Anatomy universe after all!\n\nMeanwhile, Scandal may air its final episode on April 19, but the Gladiators aren\u2019t going anywhere!\n\nExpected to release in the fall of 2018, the Scandal spinoff, Gladiator Wanted will return as a web-only series. Airing new episodes each Thursday (is there really any other day), the series will pick up the pieces following the series finale.\n\nBack in 2016, the series produced a limited digital-only spinoff starring some of the original cast. With the focus on elections, Olivia Pope\u2019s family, and other more pressing matters in the West Wing, it\u2019s easy for Scandal to forget about the little guys. Namely those who make the series what it is \u2013 the Gladiators.\n\nWhile casting is under wraps (can\u2019t spoil who will or will not survive the current season), we expect that some familiar voices and faces may appear in front of and behind the camera. Could Darby Stanchfield, who directed all six episodes of Gladiator Wanted return? Recently she made her Scandal directorial debut with season 7\u2019s \u201cThe Noise.\u201d\n\nWho else will stop by for another bite of Scandal? Should they survive, our money is on Huck (Guillermo Diaz), Charlie (George Newbern), and Quinn (Katie Lowes). Seeing as they were involved in the first spinoff, and are the heart of the current QPA operation, it makes sense that they would swing by for a guest spot or two!\n\nThe only original cast member we\u2019re speculating will not return is Marcus, played by Cornelius Smith Jr. He made a nice pitch for his character to eventually head over to HTGAWM during the crossover event.\n\nAre you excited the Gladiators are not hanging up their white hats just yet?\n\nApril Fools!", "images": ["https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/themes/hypable_redesign/img/app2.png", "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Greys-Anatomy-scandal-spinoffs.jpg", "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TGIT.jpg", "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/themes/hypable_redesign/img/hypable_logo_circle_icon_small.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://trkn.us/info/?sid=4fc59976-8e24-4b18-9416-5971cd4ba741"], "top_img": "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Greys-Anatomy-scandal-spinoffs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//www.hypable.com/greys-anatomy-scandal-announce-new-spinoffs/", "title": "Spinoff alert: 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Scandal' announce new series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 209289309100902}, "msvalidate.01": "762B221D658703FF83E16F287E9DE924", "description": "Big news for fans of Scandal and Grey\u2019s Anatomy as ShondaLand announces two new spinoffs featuring Jessica Capshaw and Darby Stanchfield!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Spinoff alert: 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Scandal' announce new series | Hypable", "description": "Big news for fans of Scandal and Grey\u2019s Anatomy as ShondaLand announces two new spinoffs featuring Jessica Capshaw and Darby Stanchfield!", "url": "https://www.hypable.com/greys-anatomy-scandal-announce-new-spinoffs/", "site_name": "Hypable", "updated_time": "2018-04-02T14:02:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Greys-Anatomy-scandal-spinoffs.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Greys-Anatomy-scandal-spinoffs.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/hypable", "tag": "zedited", "section": "News", "published_time": "2018-04-01T13:04:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-02T14:02:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Big news for fans of Scandal and Grey\u2019s Anatomy as ShondaLand announces two new spinoffs featuring Jessica Capshaw and Darby Stanchfield!", "title": "Spinoff alert: 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Scandal' announce new series | Hypable", "site": "@hypable", "image": "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Greys-Anatomy-scandal-spinoffs.jpg", "creator": "@hypable"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.hypable.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cropped-hypable_logo_circle_icon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522587897.0, "source": "https://www.hypable.com", "summary": ""}
