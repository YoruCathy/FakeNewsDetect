Public data released six weeks after his death showed he died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50 times more powerful than heroin.\n\nPrince's final days: few clues pointed to secret behind star's untimely death Read more\n\nA confidential toxicology report provides some insight into just how much fentanyl was in his system. Experts who are not connected to the Prince investigation said the numbers leave no doubt that fentanyl killed him.\n\n\u201cThe amount in his blood is exceedingly high, even for somebody who is a chronic pain patient on fentanyl patches,\u201d said Dr Lewis Nelson, chairman of emergency medicine at Rutgers New Jersey medical school. He called the fentanyl concentrations \u201ca pretty clear smoking gun\u201d.\n\nThe report says the concentration of fentanyl in Prince\u2019s blood was 67.8 micrograms per litre. Fatalities have been documented in people with blood levels ranging from three to 58 micrograms per litre, the report says.\n\nIt adds that the level of fentanyl in Prince\u2019s liver was 450 micrograms per kilogram, and notes liver concentrations greater than 69 micrograms per kilogram \u201cseem to represent overdose or fatal toxicity cases\u201d.\n\nBefore the purple rain: Prince in 1970s Minneapolis \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nThere was also what experts called a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl in Prince\u2019s stomach. Dr Charles McKay, president of the American College of Medical Toxicology, said the findings suggest Prince took the drug orally, while fentanyl in the blood and liver suggest it had some time to circulate before he died.\n\nExperts say there is no \u201clethal level\u201d at which fentanyl can kill. A person who takes prescription opioids for a long time builds up a tolerance, and a dose that could kill one person might help another.\n\nSearch warrants released about a year after Prince\u2019s death showed authorities found numerous pills in various containers around his home. A lab report shows many of the pills tested positive for fentanyl. Information released publicly indicates the source of those drugs has not been determined.\n\nLast week, the lead prosecutor in the county where Prince died said he was reviewing law enforcement reports and would make a decision \u2018in the near future\u2019 on whether to charge anyone.\n\nMinnesota officials have announced plans to install a tribute fence inside Paisley Park, Prince\u2019s home and studio, in preparation for fans returning on the second anniversary of his death. The fence will display fan messages and artefacts archived by Paisley Park.", "images": ["https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Prince%2CDrugs%2CMusic%2CHealthcare+industry%2CHealth", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf691e46ef7f2bfa94c3eaf96641aad8c1b1bd2/0_144_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b91db5cd74f7bf94c0c0e7f94c7184c", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf691e46ef7f2bfa94c3eaf96641aad8c1b1bd2/0_144_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3e093581a51da7c29cfd717636531dee"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf691e46ef7f2bfa94c3eaf96641aad8c1b1bd2/0_144_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b91db5cd74f7bf94c0c0e7f94c7184c", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died", "title": "Prince had \u2018exceedingly high\u2019 level of fentanyl in body when he died", "meta_data": {"description": "Lead prosecutor will make decision \u2018in the near future\u2019 on whether to charge anyone over Prince\u2019s death", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf691e46ef7f2bfa94c3eaf96641aad8c1b1bd2/0_144_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=68ce749646da0d1e5669395690dc50ff", "keywords": "Prince,Drugs,Music,Healthcare industry,Health", "news_keywords": "Prince,Drugs,Music,Healthcare industry,Health", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf691e46ef7f2bfa94c3eaf96641aad8c1b1bd2/0_144_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9b91db5cd74f7bf94c0c0e7f94c7184c", "description": "Lead prosecutor will make decision \u2018in the near future\u2019 on whether to charge anyone over Prince\u2019s death", "type": "article", "title": "Prince had \u2018exceedingly high\u2019 level of fentanyl in body when he died", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "Associated Press", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-03-27T00:32:11.000Z", "tag": "Prince,Drugs,Music,Healthcare industry,Health", "modified_time": "2018-03-27T21:00:42.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287, "pages": 516977308337360}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/mar/27/prince-had-exceedingly-high-level-of-fentanyl-in-body-when-he-died?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf691e46ef7f2bfa94c3eaf96641aad8c1b1bd2/0_144_2658_1595/master/2658.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=9c889e21c51f4dc738b1d2f38016f3b3", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image", "dnt": "on"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522080000.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
