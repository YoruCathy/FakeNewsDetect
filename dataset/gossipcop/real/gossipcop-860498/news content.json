Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nThe artist behind one-hit wonder \"Laffy Taffy\" attempted to extend his fame beyond music with the Oxygen show \"All My Babies' Mamas,\" which featured all 11 of his children and all 10 of their biological mothers.\n\nOxygen had high hopes for the series, but it was inundated with criticism regarding the show title. The public became skeptical about the intentions of the show after Sabrina Lamb, author of a Change.org petition, criticized the show for contributing to stereotypes of African-Americans.\n\nLamb slammed the show and said that it was \"about kids who had no choice in how they came into the world. This show sets them up to be ridiculed and made fun of. None of us should be OK with that.\"\n\nAdditionally, conservative group Parents Television Council started their own petition and did plan on boycotting the show as well. Oxygen eventually canceled the series.\n\n\"As part of our development process, we have reviewed casting and decided not to move forward with the special,\" an Oxygen rep told ABC News.\"We will continue to develop compelling content that resonates with our young female viewers and drives the cultural conversation.\"", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5941a9417916fb20008b459e?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0d97fe5e48ec43008b4593?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5941677bc6b3f9fa298b4615?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5942bb0e7916fb332c8b459c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59443ab133623445008b4625?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0d97fe5e48ec43008b4593?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5942c6a91a944225008b456d?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5942b7af7916fb6f328b457c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5941958c4fb37d24008b4570?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5944478d1a944223058b4615?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0db2c45e48ec1b008b45bb?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0da8a15e48ec19008b45c9?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0455045e48ec4a008b45c0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5944401c33623454008b464b?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0dae525e48ec1f008b45d4?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/594423871a94421e008b461d?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b0db84f5e48ec22008b45e1?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/controversial-tv-shows-canceled-2018-5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b0455045e48ec4a008b45c0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Singh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/controversial-tv-shows-canceled-2018-5", "title": "15 TV shows that were canceled because of controversies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "15 TV shows that were canceled because of controversies", "date": "2018-05-29", "news_keywords": "Features, Reality TV, TV, Controversy, Roseanne, Olivia Singh", "description": "ABC's \"Roseanne\" reboot was abruptly canceled after Roseanne Barr's controversial and racist comments, but that's not the only time a TV show has been canceled due to controversies.", "author": "Olivia Singh", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Culture", "og": {"title": "15 TV shows that were canceled because of controversies", "description": "ABC's \"Roseanne\" reboot was abruptly canceled after Roseanne Barr's controversial and racist comments, but that's not the only time a TV show has been canceled due to controversies.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/controversial-tv-shows-canceled-2018-5", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5b0455045e48ec4a008b45c0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "15 TV shows that were canceled because of controversies", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-29", "sailthru.tags": "Features, Reality TV, TV, Controversy, Roseanne, Olivia Singh", "sailthru.description": "ABC's \"Roseanne\" reboot was abruptly canceled after Roseanne Barr's controversial and racist comments, but that's not the only time a TV show has been canceled due to controversies.", "sailthru.author": "Olivia Singh", "sailthru.verticals": "culture", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5b0d97da5e48ec24008b4597?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5b0d97da5e48ec24008b4597?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "15 TV shows that were canceled because of controversies": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"bi8-lazy-load": 250, "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "control", "post-breadcrumbs": "control", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "variant", "subscribe-smallest-price": "control"}, "viking-id": "59415a86c6b3f94b008b47e1", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.insider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527523200.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
