Because I've already done it once and the kid doesn't resent me, so I was like, \u2018OK, I think I can do this.'\"\n\n\u201cI also need to enlist help,\u201d she adds. \u201cWorking full-time, my husband has moved his company here, so he works full-time. We needed help.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Kathryn Hahn Reveals Sweet Way She Convinced Susan Sarandon to Join 'Bad Moms Christmas'\n\nLife as a working mom is certainly made easier when Kunis is able to have her family with her while filming on location around the world. Describing her clan as a \u201cmobile tribe,\u201d she was thrilled to have them nearby while shooting A Bad Moms Christmas in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nThe sequel -- which also stars Susan Sarandon, Christine Baranski and Cheryl Hines as well as returning co-stars Kristen Bell and Kathryn Hahn -- hits theaters on Nov. 3., and Kunis made the most of her downtime from the set with fun family activities.\n\n\u201cI can write you a book on kid-friendly activities anywhere in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause that's what we do. We used to be like, \u2018What's the coolest club?\u2019 and [now] I'm like, \u2018Let me tell you about the zoo in Atlanta and the bouncy house.\u2019 There's not one kid activity that I haven't done yet with my child!\"\n\n\u201cWe have a public library card everywhere we go,\u201d Kunis continues. \u201cWhen it is really hot outside, we go to the library and read books.\u201d\n\nLibrary visits are important for the kids, with Kunis and Kutcher endeavoring to raise open-minded children.\n\n\u201cYeah, we're not gonna raise a**holes. There's enough a**holes in this world!\u201d Kunis says. \u201cWe don't need to contribute. But, you know, there's some nice people.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Justin Hartley Talks Getting Naked for 'Bad Moms Christmas' and 'This Is Us' Season 2\n\nIn between filming and keeping her kids entertained, Kunis has also been working hard to stay in shape following Dimitri\u2019s birth.\n\nThe former That \u201870s Show star admitted that maintaining a post-baby body takes effort.\n\n\u201cLots of gym-ing,\u201d she says. \u201cI hate someone who's like, \u2018This is all natural.\u2019 Bullsh**. It's not natural.\u201d\n\nWith the holidays coming up, Kunis also got candid about her evolving experience with Christmas and her family\u2019s latest traditions.\n\n\u201cI come from communist Russia, where you're not allowed to be happy, so my holiday traditions are \u2018be quiet,\u2019\u201d Kunis shares. \u201cComing to America is when you realize Christmas has a magical quality to it. In Russia, back in the day, it was a very religious holiday, so you don't celebrate Christmas if you're not Christian and if you're not at Mass. So, I being Jewish, was like, \u2018Christmas is not for you.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe come to America and we're like, \u2018Christmas is so inclusive,\u2019\u201d Kunis recalls. \u201cWe literally bought a Christmas tree. So as far as tradition goes, my family's big on any excuse to get the family together and get drunk. Whether it's Easter, which we've now all accepted into our Jewish household, or Christmas, it doesn't matter. It's all family time, but having kids, we're building up our own little versions of tradition.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Bad Moms Christmas' First Look! Meet Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell's On-Screen Moms\n\nKunis explained how Wyatt and Dimitri have previously been spoiled with presents by their grandparents, which fueled her and Kutcher\u2019s new rule.\n\n\u201cSo far, our tradition is no presents for the kids,\u201d she says. \u201cWe're instituting it this year because when the kids are [younger than] one, it doesn't really matter. Last year when we celebrated Christmas, Wyatt was two and it was too much. We didn't give her anything -- it was the grandparents. The kid no longer appreciates the one gift. They don't even know what they're expecting; they're just expecting stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe've told our parents, \u2018We're begging you -- if you have to give her something, pick one gift. Otherwise, we'd like to take a charitable donation, to the Children's Hospital or a pet [or] whatever you want.\u2019 That's our new tradition.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of traditions, there\u2019s another custom Kunis enjoys -- Monday nights with The Bachelor and its various spinoffs! Every week, Kunis pours a glass of white wine and Kutcher grabs a vodka tonic before the pair enjoy their \u201cguilty pleasure.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Kristen Bell Shares Motherhood Advice, Talks 'Bad Moms 2' and Rebooting 'The Good Place'\n\nThey even appeared on a recent episode of ABC\u2019s The Bachelorette, helping Rachel Lindsay in her search for a husband.\n\n\u201cThe reason we did it was because we became genuine fans of hers,\u201d Kunis says. \u201cYes, I love the show and yes, I got my poor husband hooked on it. But genuinely love her.\u201d\n\nCheck out the trailer for A Bad Moms Christmas below.\n\n'A Bad Moms Christmas' Trailer: Mila, Kathryn and Kristen Are Back With More NSFW Antics This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
