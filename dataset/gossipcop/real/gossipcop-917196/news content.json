Here are all of Meryl Streep's Oscar outfits from years past.\n\n1979 - Nominated for best supporting actress for \"The Deer Hunter\"\n\nMeryl Streep and husband Don Gummer in 1979.

She wore a black Donna Karan ballgown-style skirt and off the shoulder top. She paired the look with a four-strand pearl choker.\n\n1991 - Nominated for best actress for \"Postcards from the Edge\" (Not present)\n\nThe actress didn't attend the ceremony in 1991, so all we can do is imagine the glamorous gown she would have worn to celebrate her ninth nomination!\n\n1996 - Nominated for best actress for \"The Bridges of Madison County\"\n\nMeryl Streep arrives wearing a Donna Karan gown on March 25, 1996.

Bob Riha Jr. / WireImage\n\nFour years later, Streep returned with another statement necklace. The star received her 14th nomination for her work in \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" and we can only hope her fashionista character Miranda Priestly would give this look an approving nod.\n\n2009 - Nominated for best actress for \"Doubt\"\n\nMeryl Streep arrives at the Oscars on Feb. 22, 2009.

The hem of the skirt parted in a dainty, subtle slit that showed off her strappy silver sandals.\n\n2012 - Won for best actress for \"The Iron Lady\"\n\nMeryl Streep poses with Oscars number three on February 26, 2012. S. Granitz / WireImage\n\nIt's hard to believe this powerhouse has only won three Oscars, but Streep took home her most recent statuette in a gathered Lanvin gown that matched her shiny new trophy. Gold seems to bring the star good luck! The best part about this dress? It's made completely from eco-certified fabric, which makes it a very chic win-win.\n\n2013 - Presenter\n\nMeryl Streep enters the press room during the Oscars in 2013.

She paired the look with a bejeweled belt and simple accessories.\n\n2015 - Nominated for best supporting actress for \"Into the Woods\"\n\nJordan Strauss / AP\n\nIn 2015, Streep went for a sleek and sophisticated tuxedo-style suit. She paired the tailored separates with a loose fitting blouse and structured black and silver belt.
