Though Netflix has yet to officially renew 13 Reasons Why for a third season, if it does, the teen drama\u2019s central character, Hannah Baker, will apparently be absent. Actress Katherine Langford, who plays Hannah, broke the news to Entertainment Weekly on Friday.\n\n\u201cFor me, we told Hannah\u2019s story so fully in Season 1,\u201d Langford said, adding that her character was basically in purgatory during Season 2. \u201cThen being able to officially say goodbye to her\u2014it definitely felt like time. For me, letting Hannah go was in Season 1; Season 2 was for Clay to let her go.\u201d Representatives for Netflix declined to comment on the status of the show\u2019s renewal or cancellation, but confirmed that Langford\u2019s involvement with the series will officially end with Season 2.\n\nLangford made her on-screen debut in 13 Reasons Why, so the series will always be special to her, she said. Looking forward, however, Langford said she\u2019s also excited about what\u2019s yet to come: \u201cEven though the show is so huge, and I\u2019m so thankful to have had the opportunity to play Hannah, it still is just one thing that I\u2019ve done, and since then I feel very grateful to have been a part of Love, Simon, and I have another film, Spontaneous. But I think ultimately, I feel like playing Hannah was such a small part of me that was magnified, and I\u2019m just really excited to, over the next few months or years, show the rest of me.\u201d\n\nThe series can certainly survive without Hannah, considering she\u2019s been dead since Season 1. Her constant presence was one of the lower points of Season 2, if only because it felt forced; the show\u2019s plot also ground to a halt every time Clay began to converse with her newly present ghost.\n\nStill, her loss will alter the alchemy of the series, stripping it of the mysterious storytelling element that differentiated the first season\u2014and some of the second. Season 1 was structured around a series of tapes that revealed the exact circumstances that led Hannah, already dead, to commit suicide. In Season 2, fans learned about other aspects of Hannah\u2019s life that retrospectively shifted her story into a new light. With that layer of mystery gone, what\u2019s left will likely be a far more standard teen drama\u2014not necessarily a bad thing, but almost certainly a factor Netflix will consider as it weighs whether to renew the series. Given that cliffhanger ending in the finale, however, a junior year for 13 Reasons Why still seems likely.", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b04217d00a4b452371c21ab/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/13-reasons-why-tyler.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aff40cb5a321c45546e1133/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/13-reasons-why.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b0310ad456e673c388915b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/13-reasons-why-season3-.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.7b6624f3aa336c67441a33a3e19289ee14eaf5c7.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley", "Laura Bradle", "Sonia Saraiy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/13-reasons-why-season-3-hannah-baker-katherine-langford-leaving", "title": "13 Reasons Why: Hannah Baker Isn\u2019t Coming Back for Season 3", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Assuming the teen drama gets renewed for a third season, actress Katherine Langford will not be involved.", "id": "5b0859c20a43323fcc013a63", "keywords": "television,13 reasons why,netflix", "news_keywords": "television,13 reasons why,netflix", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b0859c20a43323fcc013a63", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Assuming the teen drama gets renewed for a third season, actress Katherine Langford will not be involved.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Assuming the teen drama gets renewed for a third season, actress Katherine Langford will not be involved.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "13 Reasons Why: Hannah Baker Isn\u2019t Coming Back for Season 3", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/13-reasons-why-season-3-hannah-baker-katherine-langford-leaving"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Assuming the teen drama gets renewed for a third season, actress Katherine Langford will not be involved.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b085a5d4f9cf15aa81ce409/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-reasons-hannah-baker.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "13 Reasons Why: Hannah Baker Isn\u2019t Coming Back for Season 3"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526140800.0, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
