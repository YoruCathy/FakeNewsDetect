After all of those margaritas, dancing crabs, date cards, and rectangle-covered buttocks, three couples have emerged on solid ground after the finale, while some other pairings may have had the word \u201cparadise\u201d forever tainted for them \u2014 and that sucks, because it\u2019s such a nice noun! Since we know you\u2019re (secretly) dying to know which Paradise couples are still smooching in sun-kissed harmony, here\u2019s the lowdown on all of the duos who decided to show up to the after-show finale. If only they were all success stories. But where would be the drama in that?\n\nJohn and Olivia\n\nStatus: Parted ways, not too amicably.\n\nDespite frequent calls, video chats, and a trip together, the couple broke up a few weeks after Paradise ended, citing distance as the main factor. Well, John did, anyway \u2014 because as Olivia says, John chose to \u201cpublicize\u201d a relationship with fellow Paradise-er Chelsea on social media over her. Twist! \u201cFor me, I felt like our different lifestyles couldn\u2019t make that work right now,\u201d John explained. \u201cBut then, when I saw you were publicizing other relationships \u2026 you were FaceTiming her, when you could\u2019ve been FaceTiming me,\u201d Olivia responded. \u201cAnd that was a slap in my face.\u201d\n\nColton and Tia\n\nStatus: They\u2019re friends, and they really want us to know it.\n\nOur long national nightmare is over \u2014 or rather, just beginning \u2014 with Colton being anointed as the next Bachelor. (We personally love our proud, messy virgin!) It should come as no surprise that Colton and his on-again-off-again-on-again-off-some-more-maybe-back-again-okay-officially-over gal, Tia, are putting on a unified friendship front to America, saying they\u2019re happy to be pals and that the romance is definitely, absolutely fizzled. \u201cWe were never on the same page, and despite all of the crying and everything that happened, I think it was all worth it to get to this point,\u201d Tia said with a laugh. \u201cTo know that we tried and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Colton echoed the sentiment: \u201cShe\u2019s an incredible woman and someone I\u2019ll always be friends with and I\u2019ll consider a friend for a very long time. It\u2019s nice to say finally we\u2019re on the same page and we\u2019re good friends.\u201d Don\u2019t worry. Tia won\u2019t actually be showing up on The Bachelor. Lord bless!\n\nAstrid and Kevin\n\nStatus: Back together. Thank God!\n\nParadise\u2019s most popular couple did a relationship 180 and reconciled in front of the studio audience \u2014 even though they continued to talk via text message when they returned home from Mexico. (With Bibiana as their meditator, no less.) \u201cIt didn\u2019t really become clear to me until I went home. I spoke to my family, I went back to therapy, and I realized it was my own fault and it was my own baggage,\u201d Kevin explained, noting that the pressure to go to the \u201cfantasy suite\u201d triggered him from his previous experience with Ashley I. \u201cI brought baggage to Paradise, and she got blamed for it. I feel terrible about it and it was definitely hard to watch.\u201d As for Astrid, she forgave Kevin\u2019s apology. They exchanged I love yous in front of everyone, and the future is looking bright for these two.\n\nKendall and Joe\n\nStatus: Also back together. Thank God!\n\nKendall, just a few days after breaking up with Joe and leaving Paradise, decided to hightail it to Chicago in the hopes of winning back her man and expressing how much she regretted her decision. Despite some initial pushback from Joe about if his feelings were still there \u2014 \u201cI felt in my heart that she felt she made a mistake,\u201d he put it \u2014 Kendall\u2019s emotional breakthrough helped ease his pain and encourage him to give her another chance. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but feel a bunch of regret. I was projecting how I actually was,\u201d she said during their Chicago meet-up. \u201cI was the one actually holding back \u2026 I know it doesn\u2019t justify it, but the reason why I had fear and the reason why I was pulling my back so much was that I am in love with you.\u201d The duo have since visited each other multiple times and are in a stable relationship.\n\nKamil and Anneliese\n\nStatus: Oh, honey, we all knew this wasn\u2019t going to last.\n\nKamil decided to breakup with Anneliese during the after-show \u2014 hasn\u2019t he learned anything from Arie? \u2014 setting her off into a spiral of despair and tears, and wailing about how they won\u2019t be able to share their Airbnb in Los Angeles anymore. \u201cI just don\u2019t really know what to say still,\u201d she said, after he was banished from the stage. \u201cI really tried.\u201d Kamil just said the post-Paradise bubble made him realize they weren\u2019t meant to be together: \u201cI don\u2019t want to string you along. I think it would be best for us to slowly part ways.\u201d\n\nChris and Krystal\n\nStatus: Still engaged, and super cute.\n\nThese two! The former franchise villains are going incredibly strong with their engagement, and plan on moving in with each other as soon as possible. (Yes, he met her dogs, and yes, they love him. Also yes, one of them will serve as a dog ring-bearer.) \u201cWe\u2019re so excited. We\u2019ve been waiting a long time to be here and be a couple,\u201d Krystal said, with Chris \u201cthe Goose\u201d adding through tears: \u201cI\u2019m crying not only that I\u2019m happy, but I\u2019m so thankful that I have such an incredible woman who saw potential in me and helped transform me in Paradise. Their moms have also become \u201cthe best of friends, like sisters,\u201d and are looking forward to a \u201cflock of baby geese.\u201d Redemption cycle, complete.\n\nJordan and Jenna\n\nStatus: ??????\n\nBy all indication, these crazy blondes continued to be livin\u2019 la vida loca with their engagement, even setting a date for a televised wedding at those Paradise Mexican shores on June 9, with ordained minister Chris Harrison officiating. \u201cHe broke down all of my walls and made me fall so hard,\u201d Jenna explained of Jordan during the after-show. \u201cBut also terrible, because he realized I don\u2019t ever want to live without him.\u201d There was a fun montage video of them scrapbooking, for goodness sake!\n\nHowever, a bombshell report from Reality Steve emerged on Tuesday afternoon, claiming, among other things, that Jenna is a prolific cheater who was only using Jordan to get publicity for her business. (You can read the report here.) In it, allegedly verified screenshots show Jenna texting a man she\u2019s been recently dating \u2014 yes, while engaged to Jordan \u2014 and she writes how their relationship is \u201call for my business\u201d and nothing more. \u201cYou know how much I need the money \u2026 he means nothing to me and never has,\u201d she put it bluntly. Jenna has since denied the \u201callegations\u201d as \u201csimply untrue\u201d to People, while Jordan, sadly, stated he\u2019s inclined to believe they\u2019re true in the same People piece. We\u2019ll see how this evolves over the next few days.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/09/11/bip/11-bachelor-in-paradise-3.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/09/11/bip/11-bachelor-in-paradise-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/09/11/bip/11-bachelor-in-paradise-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bachelor-in-paradise-season-5-where-did-the-couples-end-up.html", "title": "Bachelor In Paradise Season 5: Where Did the Couples End Up?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Where Did Bachelor in Paradise\u2019s Couples End Up?", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/bachelor-in-paradise-season-5-where-did-the-couples-end-up.html", "description": "Oh God, poor Annaleise.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/09/11/bip/11-bachelor-in-paradise-3.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Where Did Bachelor in Paradise\u2019s Couples End Up?", "description": "Oh God, poor Annaleise.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/09/11/bip/11-bachelor-in-paradise-3.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@devonsaysrelax", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-12T09:34:35.288-04:00", "tag": "the bachelor, bachelor in paradise, bachelor in paradise season 5, tv, abc, bachelor nation, reality tv", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "With Season 5 drawing to a close, we look at where Colton & Tia, Jordan & Jenna, Chris & Krystal, Kendall & Joe and Kamil and poor Annaleise ended up.", "sailthru.tags": "the bachelor, bachelor in paradise, bachelor in paradise season 5, tv, abc, bachelor nation, reality tv", "author": "Devon Ivie", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536759275.288, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
