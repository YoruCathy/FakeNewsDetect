The 24-year-old performer known for roles on The Foster\u2019s and MTV\u2019s Faking it, just made her big-screen debut Friday in Ricardo de Montreuil\u2019s Lowriders.\n\nIn the new film, she portrays he nerdy Claudia, who is torn between wanting to pursue her passion and her family\u2019s roots in East L.A.\u2019s macho car culture.\n\nThe young girl said her favorite thing about L.A. is that it\u2019s close to her home. She hails from Lawndale, California.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had family visit me on set, so it\u2019s really nice to be able to show them what I\u2019m working on without having to fly out.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she had a particular moment in her mind that had her totally flabbergasted she recalled her meeting with celebrity Eva Longoria.\n\n\u201cI walked up to her, and Demian Bichir introduced me and was like, \u2018this is Yvette.\u2019 She looked at me and said, \u2018Aw, you\u2019re so pretty,\u2019 and I nearly fainted but said thank you!\u201d\n\nThe young actress said she was feeling a bit awkward afterward.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I was awkward and just stared at her until she walked away. I freaking love her.\u201d\n\nDespite being starstruck, Monreal does just fine amongst all the \u201cmacho\u201d men and the cars.\n\nShe said being around people who owned and cherished their cars was a great experience for her.\n\nThe meticulous hard work that is put into their cars creates a unique culture that is not just about materialism, but rather values like loyalty, trust, camaraderie, and friendship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first Hollywood production that centers around cars. The immensely popular Fast And The Furious series was predicated upon the culture surrounding modified cars!", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Eva-Longoria-felicity-huffman-700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Yvette-Monreal-e1494355591224.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Eva-Longoria-Felcity-Huffman-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Phaedra-Parks-Sons-Piano-1-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c01e394878d7c931a7670ca7de341af2?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Toya-Johnson-282x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sophie-Turner-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/rs_600x600-181115140701-600-p-diddy-somber-me-11518-300x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/media-15-276x300.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Eva-Longoria-BlogSpot.com--700x466.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Yvette-Monreal-e1494355591224.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/lowriders-yvette-monreal-says-she-almost-fainted-when-meeting-this-celebrity-for-the-first-time-37148/", "title": "Lowriders\u2019 Yvette Monreal Says She Almost Fainted When Meeting This Celebrity For The First Time!", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "eva longoria, Lowriders, yvette monreal,", "keywords": "celebrity news, eva longoria, Lowriders, yvette monreal,", "description": "Yvette Monreal's career is taking off!
