The news was revealed on the most recent episode of E! Network\u2019s Total Divas.\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t know...\n\nDancing With The Stars is an American television show, and the concept is fairly obvious given the name. A string of celebrities swap their regular lives for the dancefloor in an attempt to impress the judges and take home the title at the end of the season. Some fans may be familiar with the show courtesy of Chris Jericho\u2019s stint on it a few years back.\n\nThe heart of the matter\n\nOn the aforementioned episode of Total Divas, Nikki had the following to say to her agent when it came to actually accepting the opportunity.\n\n'I'm ... I'm gonna pass. I know it's an amazing opportunity, but I just ... I really want my comeback to be in that ring and nowhere else.''\n\nGiven when the show was filmed we have yet to see her actual return to the ring which, as we all know, has now taken place.\n\nAlso read: 5 Reasons why Nikki Bella is the greatest female WWE Superstar of all time\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see whether or not they show Nikki getting back inside the squared circle before the end of the season, but in terms of her current trajectory, there\u2019s a chance that The Fearless One could end up on DWTS after all. It seems as if she\u2019s taking even longer off from the ring this time round, so a run on the show wouldn\u2019t be entirely out of the question.\n\nAuthor\u2019s take\n\nIt seems as if Nikki going on DWTS would\u2019ve suited her down to a tee, but we\u2019re glad that she decided to return to the ring instead. She got a series of good pops during her latest run, and no matter what anyone else says, the proposal at WrestleMania was a heart-warming moment for fans of Total Divas and Nikki herself.\n\nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com", "images": ["https://statics.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/share/whatsapp-color.png", "data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 723 385\"></svg>", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/944895441/?guid=ON&script=0", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/logo/brand_logos/Full_Logo_-smaller.png", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/share/twitter-color.png", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=13438550&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://q.quora.com/_/ad/12c34363cef24c8385111cecc6ca7c3e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/share/facebook-color.png", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/header/btn-menu.svg", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/images/breadcrumb-home.svg", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pm83djp-1493286541-800.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=952063904834769&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/assets/app/app-download-anim.gif", "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/skm/assets/share/share-forward.svg"], "top_img": "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pm83djp-1493286541-800.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Harry Kettle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-news-nikki-bella-turned-down-dancing-with-the-stars", "title": "WWE News: Nikki Bella turned down \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "fb": {"admins": 1020623816, "app_id": 394687130715834, "pages": 664341660330270}, "google": "notranslate", "google-site-verification": "jfoGxhn0lKDnzaezDsDeBPtaRA1TcLJHYpboESjADWw", "al": {"android": {"url": "android-app://com.sportskeeda.topic/http/www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-news-nikki-bella-turned-down-dancing-with-the-stars", "package": "com.sportskeeda.topic", "app_name": "Sportskeeda Live"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"googleplay": "Sportskeeda Live"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.sportskeeda.topic"}, "url": {"googleplay": "android-app://com.sportskeeda.topic/http/www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-news-nikki-bella-turned-down-dancing-with-the-stars"}, "country": "India"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@sportskeeda", "creator": "@HJKettle", "title": "WWE News: Nikki Bella turned down \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019", "description": "Nikki shows her dedication once again.", "image": "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pm83djp-1493286541-800.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SportsKeeda", "published_time": "2017-04-27T15:01:00+05:30", "modified_time": "2017-04-27T15:25:56+05:30"}, "news_keywords": "News, WWE, John Cena, Nikki Bella", "keywords": "News, WWE, John Cena, Nikki Bella", "og": {"title": "WWE News: Nikki Bella turned down \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019", "type": "article", "image": "https://statics.sportskeeda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pm83djp-1493286541-800.jpg", "url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-news-nikki-bella-turned-down-dancing-with-the-stars", "description": "Nikki shows her dedication once again."}, "title": "WWE News: Nikki Bella turned down \u2018Dancing With The Stars\u2019", "description": "Nikki shows her dedication once again.", "author": "Harry Kettle"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493285460.0, "source": "https://www.sportskeeda.com", "summary": ""}
