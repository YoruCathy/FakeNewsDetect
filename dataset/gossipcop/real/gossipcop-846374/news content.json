(Warner Bros.)\n\nTroy L. Smith, cleveland.com\n\nSummer Movie Preview\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio \u2013 For the past several years, summer movie season has been all about superhero movies, adaptations and sequels challenging each other at the box office.\n\n2017 is all that much different with titles like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\u201d \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d \u201cBaywatch\u201d and \u201cDespicable Me 3\u201d leading the way. But this summer will offer up some fresh material.\n\nChristopher Nolan is delivering his first war epic with \u201cDunkirk.\u201d Guy Ritchie taking the classic King Arthur story. And a new biopic will tell the story of one of hip-hop\u2019s greatest icons.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (May 5)\n\nSummer movie season begins here, with the follow-up to Marvel\u2019s surprise blockbuster \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy.\u201d This time around we get the big reveal of Star-Lord\u2019s father (Kurt Russell), as the team of heroes (including Baby Groot) try to save the world again with the help of a few frenemies.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword (May 12)\n\nDirector Guy Ritchie teams up with Charlie Hunnam (\u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d) for a stylish take on a classic story that turns to chaos once Arthur pulls that sword from that stone.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nSnatched (May 12)\n\nAmy Schumer plays a mess of a woman (shocker) who goes on vacation with her equally messed up mom (Goldie Hawn) for an adventure in a tropical paradise.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAlien: Covenant (May 19)\n\nRidley Scott will look to make up for the puzzling 2012 film \u201cPrometheus\u201d with yet another \u201cAlien\u201d prequel aimed to explain the franchise\u2019s origins. When will people in movies learn to stop going to outer space?\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nBaywatch (May 26)\n\nDwayne Johnson and Zac Efron lead a cast of beautiful people in a film adaptation of one of the most popular TV series of all time. \u201cBaywatch\u201d wisely takes the raunchy comedy route that both Johnson and Efron have fared well at.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (May 26)\n\nShould the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise be over already? I guess we\u2019ll find out when Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) takes on a group of ghost sailors, led by Javier Bardem, in the latest installment.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nWar Machine (May 26)\n\nNetflix enters the summer movie game with \u201cWar Machine.\u201d Brad Pitt plays a four-star general during the war in Afghanistan, only to find himself in the news for all the wrong reasons.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nWonder Woman (June 2)\n\nWarner Bros./DC will look to get back in moviegoers\u2019 good graces this year and \u201cWonder Woman\u201d may be the perfect movie to kick things off. The throwback story looks to tell the origins of the greatest female comic-book hero with a vibe similar to that of Marvel\u2019s \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger.\u201d\n\nDon't Edit\n\nThe Mummy (June 9)\n\nThis isn\u2019t the fun adventure story the previous \u201cMummy\u201d franchise was made to be. Tom Cruise stars in the edgy reboot that turns up the terror thanks to an ancient queen.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nCars 3 (June 16)\n\n\u201cCars\u201d sometimes gets a bad rap as Pixar\u2019s weakest franchise (and maybe rightfully so). But the third installment could change that, as Lightning McQueen finds himself as the veteran racecar looking to hold on to his top spot.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nRough Night (June 16)\n\nAn all-star cast of actresses \u2013 Scarlett Johansson, Zoe Kravitz, Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell and Ilana Glazer \u2013 lead \u201cRough Night,\u201d the story of a bachelorette party gone bad after the women accidentally kill a male stripper.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nThe Book of Henry (June 16)\n\nYoung actor Jacob Tremblay follows up his standout turn in \u201cThe Room\u201d with \u201cThe Book of Henry.\u201d Tremblay plays one of two brothers in a suburban town, raised by their single mother (Naomi Watts).\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAll Eyez on Me (June 16)\n\nFresh off the induction of Tupac Shakur into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, fans will get a mainstream movie documenting the late rapper\u2019s life and death. \u201cAll Eyez on Me\u201d looks to carry the same vibe as other hip-hop biopics like \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and \u201cNotorious.\u201d\n\nDon't Edit\n\nTransformers: The Last Knight (June 23)\n\nOptimus Prime as a bad guy? That looks to be the case in the fifth \u201cTransformers\u201d film. Michael Bay brings together parts of the casts from his two versions of the franchise, with Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci and others joining Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nOkja (June 28)\n\nThe hype surrounding Bong Joon-ho\u2019s new Netflix movie has a lot do with how great his pervious feature, \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d was. \u201cOkja\u201d centers on a young girl who goes to great lengths to keep a corporation from kidnapping her BFF, which happens to be a massive creature.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nBaby Driver (June 28)\n\nEdgar Wright\u2019s \u201cBaby Driver\u201d is one of the most intriguing films of 2017. It certainly has the cast \u2013 Jamie Foxx, Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm and more \u2013 to back it up. The movie centers on Baby (Elgort) a getaway driver who meets his dream girl and wants to start a new life.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDespicable Me 3 (June 30)\n\nThe \u201cDespicable Me\u201d franchise looks to continue its lucrative winning streak, as Gru takes on a former child star turned adversary as well as his twin brother Dru.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nThe House (June 30)\n\nTwo of comedy\u2019s most reliable players join forces when Amy Pohler and Will Ferrell play a couple who starts an underground casino to pay for their daughter\u2019s college tuition.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (July 7)\n\nAll signs point to Tom Holland as the right choice to revive the Spider-Man film franchise. This time around, high school student Peter Parker must come to terms with his powers with help from Iron Man as they battle Vulture (Michael Keaton).\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nWar of the Planet of the Apes (July 14)\n\nThe latest version of the \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d franchise has quietly featured some of the most satisfying action films in recent memory. \u201cWar of the Planet of the Apes\u201d will move things even further as Caesar leads his apes against an army of humans.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDunkirk (July 21)\n\nChristopher Nolan\u2019s war epic promises to be one of the biggest moves of the year. The acclaimed director tells the story of Allied troops stranded on a beach in France during World War II and the heroics required to barely stay alive.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nValerian and the City of Thousand Planets (July 21)\n\nBased on the popular comic book series \"Valerian and Laureline,\" the Luc Besson directed film is set in the 28th century and focused on two operatives looking to keep the peace in a world that visually should blow you mind.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAtomic Blonde (July 28)\n\nCharlize Theron goes into full action mode as a member of Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Intelligence Service with all the skills necessary to (hopefully) survive the most dangerous mission of her career.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nThe Emoji Movie (July 28)\n\nIf they can make a movie out of Angry Birds, why not emojis? \u201cThe Emoji Movie\u201d dives into the fictional world of the playful faces you use to punctuate your text messages.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (July 28)\n\nWith President Donald Trump willing to cut funding for green initiatives, a sequel to Al Gore\u2019s landmark documentary seems appropriate at this time. Gore continues travelling the world to educate people about climate change.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nThe Dark Tower (Aug. 4)\n\nFingers crossed \u201cThe Dark Tower\u201d finally comes out. The film based on the Stephen King novels of the same name has been delayed several times. Still, fans are eagerly anticipating the project, which stars Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nAnnabelle: Creation (Aug. 11)\n\nThese days, if you deliver one good horror film, you take it and run with it. That\u2019s been the case with the successful \u201cThe Conjuring\u201d franchise, which has featured the story of the creepy doll Annabelle. We\u2019ll get her origin story this summer.\n\nDon't Edit", "images": ["https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/UU5EzRTJGdtgF-SojsTd-JgKxIc=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width2048/img/ent_impact_home/photo/wonder-woman-c9c13d5ba4ec3d08.jpg", "https://www.cleveland.com/pf/resources/images/cleveland/logos/logo_main_sm.svg?d=235", "https://www.cleveland.com/pf/resources/images/common/ps-images/ad-choices-arrow.png?d=235", "https://www.cleveland.com/pf/resources/images/common/icons/Arrow_back.svg?d=235", "https://www.cleveland.com/pf/resources/images/common/footer-logo-advance.svg?d=235", "https://www.cleveland.com/pf/resources/images/cleveland/logos/logo_main_inverse.svg?d=235", "https://www.cleveland.com/pf/resources/images/common/icons/sign-out-lock.svg?d=235", "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/rj2-TQVIe_aCLVjWhDu_nx_OQYc=/450x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width2048/img/ent_impact_home/photo/22588109-standard.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/UU5EzRTJGdtgF-SojsTd-JgKxIc=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width2048/img/ent_impact_home/photo/wonder-woman-c9c13d5ba4ec3d08.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Troy Smith", "Tsmith Cleveland.Com", "Troy L.
