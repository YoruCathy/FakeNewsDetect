Her catchphrase\u2014\"How rude!\"\u2014is still requested by fans.\n\nSynopsis Jodie Sweetin was born on January 19, 1982, in Los Angeles, California. After booking several national commercials, she was cast in a guest spot on the series Valerie. At age 5, she debuted as Full House's Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister of three. Sweetin continues to perform, appearing in the big-screen releases Small Bits of Happiness (2008), Redefining Love (2009) and Port City (2009).\n\nEarly Life Jodie Lee Ann Sweetin was born on January 19, 1982, in Los Angeles, California. Sweetin was adopted by Sam, a handyman, and Janice, a wedding coordinator. Her acting talent was evident early on and, at the urging of family friends, Janice brought her 4-year-old to meet with a talent agent. After booking several national commercials, Sweetin was cast in a guest spot on the popular series, Valerie. Her precociousness and winning smile caught the eyes of Thomas Miller and Robert Boyett, producers who were then putting together the framework of the sitcom Full House.\n\nFull House At the age of 5, Jodie Sweetin debuted as Full House's Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister of three. Her catchphrase\u2014\"How rude!\"\u2014is still requested by fans. That same year, she was cast in Jim Henson Presents: Mother Goose Stories. Although she quickly bonded with her Full House family, Sweetin had a difficult time adjusting to school. A strong student, Sweetin was teased by classmates for her burgeoning fame. She spent her grammar and middle school years trying to embrace a normal life and separate herself from her on-screen persona. At the age of 13, she entered Los Alamitos High School. That year, Full House was canceled, and Sweetin experienced her first brushes with alcohol abuse. After graduating in 1999, Sweetin temporarily capped her acting career with a two-episode role on Party of Five. She began attending Chapman University in Orange, California, and although she had an academic scholarship, she rarely attended classes. Instead, Sweetin's hard-partying ways earned her a .9 GPA, and stanched her scholarship. Sweetin returned to her parent's house to break her ties to drugs and alcohol, and to refocus her life.", "images": ["https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NTU2MzE2MDMxMTkwNTM5/dana-plato-248617-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxOTA1ODExOTgx/jennifer-jason-leigh-16460654-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTU0OTcxNjI0NDIzMDQwNzA1/elisabeth-moss-arrives-at-the-24th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards-at-the-shrine-auditorium-on-january-21-2018-in-los-angeles-california-photo-by-steve-granitz_wireimage-square.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzE2MDkxODc2ODc1/jodie-sweetin-466892-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU1MjI1MDc1MjE1/christina-applegate-9542531-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NTU2MzE2MjcxOTY5ODAz/diane-keaton-9361481-2-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNzQzMzYzMDg2/drew-barrymore-9542167-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTM0MTQ5NzA3NDQxNzE5/navbarwhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1280/MTY4Mjc5OTY4NzQ3ODg5ODI5/black-background.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU1MzkwNjg0Njg3/0206130350dp-pni00207-met-arias.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwNTI0ODAwNTI2/jodie-foster-9299556-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NTU2MzE2MDA2NDgzNDY3/katey-sagal-222537-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTE5NTU2MzE2MDkxODc2ODc1/jodie-sweetin-466892-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_458/MTQ1NTMzOTkyNDA0MjY0NTAz/sitelogowhite.png"], "top_img": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzE2MDkxODc2ODc1/jodie-sweetin-466892-1-402.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/actor/jodie-sweetin", "title": "Jodie Sweetin", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "address=no", "google-site-verification": "Rw9Z4UJK89QUjgFzrFI2QbZmTRyWu_Cuy15hu4Y1MXw", "msvalidate.01": "565AA37CB662E60BF24DDCABEC686D8F", "generator": "Tempest - www.saymedia.com", "pinterest": "nohover", "description": "Jodie Sweetin debuted as <i>Full House</i>'s Stephanie Tanner at age 5, and soon became known for the catchphrase, 'How rude!'
