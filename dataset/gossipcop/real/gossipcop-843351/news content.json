She\u2019s taking a gap year to headline a spinoff of her ABC series \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d in which her character, Zoey Johnson, heads to college herself.\n\nZoey is far less ambitious than the actress who plays her.\n\n\u201cOftentimes I\u2019m developing two characters at the same time, figuring out who Yara is and who Zoey is,\u201d Shahidi said from the Disney Studios, where she\u2019s sprinting back and forth between the sets of the Emmy-nominated \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d which returns Tuesday, and her new show \u201cGrown-ish,\u201d tentatively scheduled to premiere in January on cable's Freeform.\n\n\u201cHow do you make that separation, and embrace this idea that your character is not going to agree with you but still has a valid point of view? It\u2019s been actually kind of fantastic,\u201d she added before slipping in a reference to the rebellious teen in \u201cThe Catcher in the Rye,\u201d a novel she first read when she was 14. \u201cI kind of see Zoey as my personal-life Holden Caulfield, because you\u2019re allowed to be somebody that you\u2019re not. As a teenager you really don\u2019t have that privilege in many other spaces.\u201d\n\nEven if her new series flunks out with viewers, Shahidi\u2019s future shines bright.\n\nYara Shahidi arrives at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards on Sept. 17 at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles.\n\nMichelle Obama was so impressed by the young star\u2019s contributions to her Let Girls Learn Initiative that she wrote Shahidi a college recommendation letter.\n\nThe accolades \u2014 a BET Award, an invitation to speak at a United Nations summit, an Essence Magazine Women in Hollywood Award \u2014 have come largely from her political activism rather than her acting ability. In August, she was recognized at a Black Girls Rock ceremony alongside Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Wall Street power broker Suzanne Shank.\n\n\u201c \u2018White\u2019 taught me what \u2018black\u2019 was not,\u201d the 17-year-old said in her acceptance speech. \u201c \u2018Male\u2019 taught me what \u2018female\u2019 was not. \u2018Straight\u2019 taught me what \u2018gay\u2019 was not. \u2018Sad\u2019 taught me what \u2018happy\u2019 was not. \u2018Law\u2019 taught me what \u2018equality\u2019 and \u2018equity\u2019 were not.\n\n\u201cBut our charge is not to live within this negative space of who we are not to be. Who are we not to be, after all?\u201d\n\nAmong those blown away by her poise and eloquence is Laurence Fishburne, the Oscar-nominated veteran actor who plays her grandfather on \u201cBlack-ish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t become president of the United States, something\u2019s wrong,\u201d Fishburne said. \u201cPeople like to talk about child actors who don\u2019t do well. Makes better copy, I suppose. But Yara, like Ronnie Howard and Jodie Foster, is really gifted, talented and beautiful. She was kind of born with everything.\u201d\n\n\u2018She gives me hope\u2019\n\nWhile other teen stars use social media to promote their latest projects, Shahidi is busy retweeting the Dalai Lama, Pakistani female education activist Malala Yousafzai and Rep. Ilhan Omar, DFL-Minneapolis. She announced her plans to attend Harvard to her 1.2 million Instagram followers by quoting James Baldwin.\n\n\u201cEvery time I talk to her, I realize I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. I need to go grab a book or something,\u201d said comic Wanda Sykes, a frequent guest star on Shahidi\u2019s series. \u201cShe gives me hope.\u201d\n\nShahidi left Minnesota at age 4, but her work ethic and passion for activism are deeply rooted in the Twin Cities, where her father worked as Prince\u2019s personal photographer and her grandfather still runs a Persian rug store in Uptown. People who tour Paisley Park can see a picture of the young Yara on a table in Prince\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe travel to London and Hawaii set a precedent for how amazing my childhood was,\u201d said Shahidi during a lunch break from her shooting schedule, which can keep her on set for up to 17 hours a day. \u201cIt literally opened so many doors.\u201d\n\nIt would have been easy to grow up thinking she was born with a purple spoon in her mouth. But backstage access had just the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of a grounded family,\u201d said her dad, Afshin Shahidi, whose book, \u201cPrince: A Private View,\u201d will be published this month. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make anyone seem extra-special because of what they did.\u201d\n\nYara\u2019s mother, Keri Shahidi, laid down the law at home, restricting the amount of television her three children could watch. Her oldest daughter was so naive about pop culture that before securing the role as Eddie Murphy\u2019s daughter in the 2009 film \u201cImagine That,\u201d she had no idea she would be screen-testing with a comedy legend.\n\n\u201cI told her that she was auditioning with the man who voiced the donkey from \u2018Shrek\u2019 and that he looked like my brother,\u201d Keri Shahidi said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know him otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe two \u2014 who recently staged an impromptu dance party in Yara\u2019s trailer on the \u201cGrown-ish\u201d set \u2014 are working on a book about mother-daughter relationships.\n\n\u201cWe kept all media out of the house,\u201d Keri Shahidi said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I was raised, and I just carried that tradition on. In our house, quoting James Baldwin is sexy. The correlation between [Voltaire\u2019s] \u2018Candide\u2019 and the existentialism movement, that\u2019s sexy. We were on the beach during family vacation, and the kids were debating socialism, fascism and capitalism.\u201d\n\nFamily on the set\n\nThe parents made sure that family ties transferred to the \u201cBlack-ish\u201d workplace, where Shahidi has been employed since she was 14. After school, her brothers would join her on set, where they took advantage of the free snacks and played football, helping to normalize their sister\u2019s upbringing.\n\n\u201cI helped pick them out when they were babies,\u201d said the show\u2019s star, Anthony Anderson, of the four young actors who play his kids. \u201cAnd so with that comes the job of teaching them personally and professionally. I\u2019m with these children more than I\u2019m with my own. It\u2019s an added responsibility that I welcome. It\u2019s been amazing watching Yara grow. She\u2019s going to run the world someday, if that\u2019s what she decides to do.\u201d\n\nIt also helped to be surrounded by veteran cast members like her on-screen mom, Tracee Ellis Ross \u2014 the daughter of Diana Ross \u2014 and grandma Jenifer Lewis, who debuted on Broadway in 1979.\n\nNot that Shahidi isn\u2019t taking advantage of the more posh benefits of being a Hollywood scene stealer. She consistently makes the best-dressed lists on red carpets. At the Emmys two weeks ago, she wowed the fashion police in her beige Prada gown, embellished with green sequins.\n\n\u201cShe revels in the fact that clothes can show your personality more than your body parts,\u201d Keri Shahidi said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the gown. It\u2019s the human in the gown. Her eyes are sparkling and you know she\u2019s having the time of her life.\u201d\n\nYara Shahidi may be swamped, balancing two shows at once, but she\u2019s still finding time to read during her gap year. Baldwin\u2019s poetry collection \u201cJimmy\u2019s Blues,\u201d Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \u201cGal\u00e1pagos\u201d and the Zadie Smith novel \u201cSwing Time\u201d are all on her nightstand.\n\nShe\u2019s also hoping to make her directorial debut with a short film she\u2019s co-writing, inspired by \u201cThe Red Balloon.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, I\u2019ve got the privilege to have this accessible to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI came into this as an all-around creative person, not just an actress. One thing I\u2019ve learned is that anything is possible.\u201d", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8428425&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_158712876279187.jpg?h=91&w=145&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "https://assets.startribune.com/static/img/navigation/eedition-filled.svg?d=1587070169", "http://apps.startribune.com/circulars/images/blank.gif", "https://assets.startribune.com/static/img/navigation/cogwheel-filled.svg?d=1587070169", "https://assets.startribune.com/static/img/navigation/user-filled.svg?d=1587070169", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-0fEc9CMkDiJ2g.gif", "https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_158712887942724.jpg?h=91&w=145&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_158713551395155.jpg?h=91&w=145&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_150663945662923.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "https://stmedia.stimg.co/daytons041920-mike-01.jpg?h=91&w=145&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "https://apps.startribune.com/most_popular/?cmd=inc&type=view&section=%2Fvariety%2Ftv&story_id=448564263", "https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_150663948126045.jpg?w=600&h=600&format=auto%2Ccompress&cs=tinysrgb"], "top_img": "https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_150663945662923.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Neal Justin", "Njustin Startribune.Com", "Richard Shotwell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-born-black-ish-star-yara-shahidi-is-ready-for-world-conquest/448564263/", "title": "Minnesota-born 'Black-ish' star Yara Shahidi is ready for world conquest", "meta_data": {"app-env": "prod", "app-platform": "desktop", "app-revision": "V20200416", "bugsnag-api-key": "57098e87943fb0b8bcf51a8ffc9ca41a", "feature toggles": "[\"Comments\",\"Ads\",\"WelcomeScreen\",\"Meter\",\"lazy load\",\"Array Cache\",\"Show Minified Assets\",\"Zone 3\",\"Imgix\",\"User Platform Digital Access\",\"user-platform-account-registration\",\"Homepage The Stream\",\"Snowplow\",\"Recommendations\",\"User State Speed Increase\",\"Nativo\",\"Elections Article Banner\",\"Elections Results Dashboard\",\"Elections Results Dashboard - All Templates\",\"Optimizely\",\"Resonate\",\"Keywee\",\"Grazers\",\"Auto-Advance\",\"Index\",\"Amazon\",\"Use Personalization API\",\"emma lightbox\",\"Gtm\",\"grazers-zedo-video\",\"Bounce-X\",\"Obituaries Always Remembering Pages\",\"Obituaries Always Remembering Draft Preview\",\"Enhanced Obituaries\",\"Rubicon\",\"Header Bidding\",\"Prebid\",\"Obituaries Viafoura JS V2 Upgrade\",\"Ads Toggle\",\"Obituaries Always Remembering Links\",\"Zedo Ads\",\"Product Refresh Cookie\",\"CommentCount\",\"Obituary Guestbook\",\"BulkRedirect\",\"Eedition Credentials Check\",\"Facebook Authentication\",\"Day Pass\",\"Day Pass Facebook Login\",\"Bidphysics\",\"Outbrain\",\"Example Active\",\"Analytics\",\"Confiant\",\"Cron Status Pages\",\"Data Layer\",\"CmsApiCache\",\"Delay Asset Modified Cache Keys\",\"Product Refresh Cookie Javascript\",\"Set Session Cookie\",\"TSN Sports\",\"Mobile Overlay\",\"Prediction.IO\"]", "route-name": "content", "section-path": "/variety/tv/", "content-id": 448564263, "content-type": "story", "main-media-type": "gallery", "is-most-read": "false", "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "description": "The 17-year-old actress has crushed TV, the red carpet and social media.
