One is convinced that he\u2019s seen her in something, but his douchey buddy won\u2019t pay up until she delivers a line from one of her past roles.\n\n\u201cThat is a risk I\u2019m willing to take, Lieutenant, because last I checked all citizens are entitled to legal counsel,\u201d Megan says. \u201cEven vampires.\u201d\n\nEvangelista plays Megan as effortlessly cool \u2014 confident, with just a hint of vulnerability \u2014 and she\u2019s the main reason that the new E! scripted series is a delight to watch. The 10-episode drama, which premieres Sunday, is a thinly veiled spin on one of the biggest mysteries of our time: the whirlwind relationship between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, which some speculate was arranged by the Church of Scientology.\n\nFollowing a bizarre audition process, Megan is plucked from the obscurity of her side hustle and thrust into the limelight as the new girlfriend of superstar Kyle West (Josh Henderson), whose acting career is micromanaged by the Institute for the Higher Mind, a self-help organization clearly meant to evoke Scientology.\n\nKyle credits the institute, led by Terence Anderson (an oh-so-serious Michael Vartan), for his rise to fame, which followed family tragedy and months of sleeping in his car. When he meets Megan, he\u2019s fresh off a broken engagement to an A-list actress, whose path he will cross while promoting his latest film at the Venice Film Festival. The institute sets out to find Kyle a new leading lady, ostensibly for his next blockbuster, \u201cThe Kill Plan.\u201d Terence\u2019s wife, Deann (Lexa Doig), a producer on the film, has her eyes on Megan.\n\nAt her audition, Megan is asked three questions designed to reveal her \u201ctrue character.\u201d Assuming she flopped, Megan prepares for a weekend getaway with her boyfriend. But their plans are scrapped when a woman shows up to his house in tears, announcing that she\u2019s pregnant with his child. Reeling from her own unexpected breakup, Megan gets drunk with her two besties, and is surprised \u2014 and hung over \u2014 when her agent calls to tell her she will soon be reading opposite Kyle.\n\nMegan pulls it together and offers a raw, emotional (perhaps nausea-induced) performance. Impressed, Kyle runs after her and their whirlwind courtship begins with a paparazzi-dodging motorcycle ride, lunch at his favorite taco spot and a trip to a romantic Mexican bungalow.\n\nBy the end of the first episode, Megan has landed a contract proposal \u2014 but it\u2019s not for \u201cThe Kill Plan.\u201d The contract lays out the terms of what would eventually become a marriage \u2014 with a cool $10 million wrapped into the deal. \u201cThere\u2019s no big secret,\u201d Kyle insists. The contract is about his reputation and, he says with a wince, his brand. Despite warnings from her lawyer friend, Megan agrees to consider the offer \u2014 first accompanying Kyle to the film festival \u2014 because it beats waiting tables, and because she actually likes him.\n\nDespite the puppet strings attached to their union, Kyle and Megan have genuine chemistry. In fact, they can\u2019t keep their hands off each other, which presents a rather salacious theory for Cruise\u2019s crazy, couch-jumping appearance on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d in 2005. \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d may be on basic cable, but there\u2019s a reason it doesn\u2019t come on until 10 p.m.\n\nDespite their connection, Megan and Kyle\u2019s relationship is complicated by interference from the institute \u2014 full of sinister motives that remain intriguingly obscure three episodes in \u2014 and the fact that Terence isn\u2019t sold on the pairing. But it\u2019s fun to watch their relationship unfold. In Italy, Megan is amused to learn that a tabloid has dubbed them \u201cKygan.\u201d When Deann says the moniker will undoubtedly lead to babies named Kygan, Megan replies, bewildered, \u201cThat\u2019s so saaaad.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s tension in the fact that, despite her aspirations, Megan doesn\u2019t appear to take her craft \u2014 or fame \u2014 as seriously as Kyle does. But it also seems that Megan, like pretty much everyone else in her orbit, is hiding something.\n\n\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d isn\u2019t top-tier television, but it\u2019s sharper than one might expect from the celebrity-obsessed network that brought us \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d and that weird Glambot thingamajig that forces the stars to strut their stuff in slow motion on awards show red carpets. (I\u2019ve never watched the network\u2019s other scripted series, \u201cThe Royals,\u201d but it gets fairly solid ratings).\n\nThat said, you will never, ever forget that \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d is an E! show. The opening scene is a faux E! news report about Kyle, featuring real-life reporters Zuri Hall and Jason Kennedy, who resurface in subsequent episodes.\n\nAnd the network has gone all out in building a backstory for the drama. A few days ago, in the name of research, I cued up a YouTube video of Cruise\u2019s infamous \u201cOprah\u201d appearance. The pre-roll ad was for an \u201cE! True Hollywood Story\u201d installment about (the fictional) Kyle West. Algorithms, smalgorithms \u2014 I prefer to think of it as me and the universe sharing an inside joke.\n\nBut honestly, \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d doesn\u2019t need all those cross-promotional bells and whistles. It\u2019s pretty delicious on its own.\n\nThe Arrangement (1 hour) Sunday, March 5 at 10 p.m. on E!", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/03/02/Style/Images/NUP_174905_0334.JPG?t=20170517", "https://me.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yAFxThroW-CI5t-yu8Q6FsF7kHI=/1x1/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/03/02/Style/Images/NUP_174905_0334.JPG?uuid=qJ6ALv-fEeaZtJ5hOv6wnw"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/03/02/Style/Images/NUP_174905_0334.JPG?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bethonie Butler", "Reporter Covering Television", "Pop Culture", "March", "Bethonie Butler Writes About Television", "Pop Culture For The Washington Post.
