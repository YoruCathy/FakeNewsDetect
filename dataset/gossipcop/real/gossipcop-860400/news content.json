Photo: Suzanne Tenner/SHOWTIME\n\nA few steps in to \u201cPart Six\u201d, we\u2019re finally given some sweet relief. Not only is a cliffhanger from \u201cPart Four\u201d resolved, but we finally have our first look at Diane some 9,926 days after she was first mentioned in the series premiere of Twin Peaks. The moment occurs when Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) ducks out of a rainy, cold night and heads into a sultry bar named Max Von\u2019s, where he comes face to face with David Lynch\u2019s longtime go-to lead, Laura Dern. Now, if you recall, the set up to this began at the end of \u201cPart Four\u201d, when Gordon Cole (Lynch) told Albert that, before they move ahead with their investigation into Cooper\u2019s reappearance in South Dakota, they need to get him in front of one specific person. When Gordon asks Albert if he still knows where this person lives, he responds, \u201cNo, but I know where she drinks,\u201d which made me think beyond the shadow of a doubt that they were talking about Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie). Nope. Turns out that Special Agent Dale Cooper\u2019s (Kyle MacLachlan) secretary, who until now has only been seen in the form of a tape recorder, enjoys a cocktail or two herself. But, let\u2019s back up a bit, because there\u2019s a lot to piece together here, including some newly recovered diary pages, which we\u2019ll certainly touch upon..\n\n\u201cPart Six\u201d opens where \u201cPart Five\u201d closed, with an increasingly bewildered Cooper standing near the cowboy statue outside the office complex that houses his workplace, Lucky 7 Insurance. A policeman patrolling the area attempts to shoo him away, but Cooper is unresponsive, tugging at the sleeve of his jacket and reaching out to touch the officer\u2019s badge as if he\u2019s two hours into an acid trip. The cop is nice enough to drive him home and his wife Janey (Naomi Watts) opens the door and confirms it\u2019s her husband. Granted, the fact that she uses her husband\u2019s full name \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s my husband, Dougie Jones\u201d \u2014 is a bit odd, but the officers don\u2019t appear phased in the slightest, likely because the night itself has been odd to say the least. Soon enough, Janey brings Cooper into the house and makes him a sandwich and even gives him a little bag of chips like he\u2019s a child. She then insists that he go upstairs to say goodnight to his (would-be) son Sonny Jim (Pierce Gagnon), to which Cooper bumbles his way up each step and eventually sits on Sonny Jim\u2019s bed, continuing to munch away on his bag of chips. In a classic case of Lynchian humor, Cooper offers a chip to Sonny Jim, who refuses it, citing his own clean teeth, and slowly places the chip on his cowboy-themed blanket. It\u2019s all so perfectly ridiculous, and also a welcome reprieve from the madness \u2014 kind of like the daytime scenes in a horror movie.\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t last long. Almost immediately, Janey screams for Dougie/Cooper to come back downstairs, and then shows him a file folder that had appeared on their front porch earlier, back when the cops brought him in. Inside the folder is a picture of Dougie and his sex worker pal Jade (Nafessa Williams), who he seems happy to see, saying Jade\u2019s name out loud to an increasingly disgruntled Janey, who is sniffing and shaking like a rabid horse. Watts really shines in this role, and \u201cPart Six\u201d allows her to stretch her comically abrasive legs as a woman unhinged yet still in charge, a familiar archetype of Lynch\u2019s oeuvre. As she prods her husband over Jade, Janey gets a call on their yellow kitchen phone, which is, of course, a landline because, again, what is time? It\u2019s hard to hear exactly who\u2019s on the other end, but Janey quickly lets us know it\u2019s the thugs looking to collect on Dougie\u2019s gambling debt, which has led to over $20,000 in debt. Because she\u2019s all kinds of resilient \u2014 could you imagine running that household? \u2014 Janey agrees to meet the thugs in a nearby park at \u201cnoon 30.\u201d It\u2019s another strange detail that\u2019s so oddly funny.\n\nFollowing this, Janey implores Dougie/Cooper to finish his work, lest he lose his job, and leaves him with his case files. Before he attends to his work, however, Cooper looks over to see a flash message from MIKE (Al Strobel), who\u2019s in the Red Room of the Black Lodge and feeling around in the air with his one arm as though he\u2019s looking for a hidden window. When he sees Cooper, he pleads, \u201cYou have to wake up! You have to wake up!\u201d and then, after a beat, he insists: \u201cDon\u2019t die! Don\u2019t die!\u201d The significance of this scene is to remind us, in case we forgot, that Cooper is trapped in the life of Dougie Jones, so that Cooper\u2019s evil doppelg\u00e4nger can remain on the loose in this time shifting earthy realm. If Cooper dies, then Evil Cooper, still under the influence of the parasitic Bob, will have free reign. After receiving this message from MIKE, Cooper goes through the claim forms he brought home from work and scribbles all over them with a pencil. He circles some things, draws what looks like a ladder, and then presses the tip of his pencil into a few heavy circles. As he\u2019s doing this, pin points of green laser light \u2014 yes, the same green laser light that ousted Tom Sizemore\u2019s character in \u201cPart Five\u201d \u2014 appear on the pages, and on his arm, as though it\u2019s guiding what he\u2019s doing.\n\nNow, comes the aforementioned moment, when Albert makes his way in the rain to meet someone at a place called Max Von\u2019s Bar, whose sign looks a hell of a lot like the neon Bang Bar Bar sign hung outside of the Roadhouse in Twin Peaks. (By the way, I\u2019ll now take a few personal liberties in saying that I really wish other recaps of this new season would stop referring to the Roadhouse as the Bang Bang Bar. Have you ever heard a character from the show refer to it as such? No. Then you shouldn\u2019t either.) As previously discussed, it\u2019s Diane, sitting with her back to the camera for maximum effect, with a flapper-esque white blonde bob that slowly turns to greet Albert after he says her name. Everything about this is perfect and it will be very interesting to see what happens when they get her in front of Evil Cooper.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the ranch that is Twin Peaks, Richard Horne (Eamon Farren) is doing drug business with Red (Balthazar Getty) in an empty warehouse riddled with bullet holes. The character Red is one of many seemingly obvious tributes to Dennis Hopper\u2019s Frank Booth from Blue Velvet and his mix of humor and malevolence is very effective. \u201cHave you ever studied your hand,\u201d Red asks Richard while twitching around and performing a series of Elvis-like karate moves. He flips a dime into the air that seems to spin there forever before impossibly appearing in Richard\u2019s mouth, and then back in Red\u2019s hand. This isn\u2019t the last instance of a coin being used as a thematic marker for an important event in \u201cPart Six\u201d. We\u2019ll come across another one with Deputy Hawk later on.\n\nFor the first time since Fire Walk With Me, we make our way back to the Fat Trout Trailer Park and see Carl Rodd (Harry Dean Stanton) taking his daily car ride into town. For what purpose, we don\u2019t know yet. A neighbor (played by Jeremy Lindholm) asks if he can ride along and while they sit together, Carl asks him about his wife Linda. It\u2019s hard to not recall \u201cPart One\u201d here, specifically when the Giant told Cooper in the black and white lodge to \u201cremember 430, Richard, and Linda.\u201d Already, we\u2019ve met a Richard of obvious importance (Richard Horne), but no Linda yet. Could this be her? Let\u2019s keep it in mind for later. True to Stanton\u2019s style, Carl lights up a cigarette in the car and, seeing his neighbor eyeing it, offers him one, which he doesn\u2019t take because he quit a year ago. Carl laughs at this and tells him he\u2019s been smoking every day for 75 years, and then flashes his veneers, which, as a person currently trying to quit, enables me to quit quitting myself. Eventually, Carl makes his way to what must be his favorite park bench, where he enjoys another cigarette and a cup of coffee while staring up at the trees. Nearby, a young mom (Lisa Coronado) and her son engage in a strange game of tag and he watches them with a smile.\n\nA short distance away, however, Richard is ramming around in his truck, still enraged from his meeting with Red, and in an intersection that looks exactly like the one where MIKE confronted Leland Palmer in Fire Walk With Me, runs a stop sign and mows the little boy down. He races away and a teacher (Sarah Jean Long), who we earlier saw enjoying two pieces of cherry pie at the RR Diner (in a snarky meta jab at the fans), gets a clear view of his face as he speeds past her. Carl goes over to comfort the mom of the dead boy and sees the boy\u2019s spirit rise into the sky in the form of a yellow ball of light. From here, there\u2019s a cut to a wood pole with the number 6 on it, which is located near his trailer and was previously highlighted in Fire Walk With Me. What\u2019s the significance of spending so much time showing this particular numbered sign? Well, if you read your Secret History of Twin Peaks, you\u2019d know there\u2019s more to Carl than we think (keyword: abduction).\n\nFrom here, we\u2019re back in the high-rise building, where Duncan Todd (Patrick Fischler), a man presumably hired by Evil Cooper, sits at his desk typing on a laptop. As he\u2019s typing, a red square appears on his screen and he clicks it away and then uses a tissue to retrieve a file from his safe. The file, which he places on the desk like it\u2019s a disgusting turd, has a black dot on it. We briefly flash from here to Rancho Rosa to see the cops investigating Dougie\u2019s burnt up car, and then back to the folder with the dot on it, which a creepy short man in a hotel has now received. Before receiving the file he\u2019s playing some manner of dice game and then marking things down in a notebook, as though he\u2019s calculating the many number of ways the dice can land. Slowly, he removes a picture of Lorraine (Tammie Baird) from \u201cPart Five\u201d and another of Dougie, using an ice pick to stab both in an obscene matter. Of course, it\u2019s a classic case of foreshadowing, as we soon watch the man use that same ice on Lorraine and her co-workers in what\u2019s arguably one of the most violent scenes in the revival so far.\n\nOnce again, over at the Lucky 7 Insurance building, the elevator doors open to Cooper, only now he\u2019s in his trademark black suit. Sadly, he\u2019s not back to his true form just yet, but seeing this suit again gives us hope that maybe the days of blubbering Dougie will soon be behind us. As expected, he gets called into his boss\u2019 office, where he\u2019s initially yelled at for scribbling all over his claim forms like a child, but then, after going through them for awhile, the scribbles seem to take on some meaning and his boss actually winds up thanking him. The two end their meeting by \u201cagreeing\u201d to keep this discovery between them and with what might be the weirdest and most awkward hand shake of all time.\n\nBack at the Twin Peaks Sheriff Department, Deputy Hawk (Michael Horse) is using the restroom when a coin falls from his pocket and rolls into a stall next to him. He goes to retrieve it and sees that it\u2019s an Indian head nickel. Remember how the Log Lady told him that his heritage will help him piece all this together? Well, he also hasn\u2019t forgotten and he holds onto this nickel for dear life while, at the exact same moment, he sees an Indian on a manufacturer\u2019s plaque on the bathroom stall door (specifically, his family tribe, the Nez Perce) and knows right then and there that he\u2019s being led to something by the cosmic forces overseeing so many of that town\u2019s many mysteries. He goes and gets a ladder and a tool to pry the top layer of metal off the stall door and reaches down to pull out a couple pages of folded paper. Are these the missing pages from Laura\u2019s diary that are mentioned many times in the original series, as well as Fire Walk With Me? Many signs point to yes, but we\u2019ve been pointed to yes and arrived at no before. So, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\n\nDamn Fine Quotes\n\n\u2014 Cooper: \u201cJade give two rides.\u201d Janey: \u201cI bet she did.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Albert: \u201cFuck Gene Kelly, you motherfucker!\u201d\n\nNext Week On Twin Peaks\n\n\u2014 Further advancements from Deputy Hawk\n\n\u2014 Some clarity on the depressing family history of Sheriff Frank Truman\n\n\u2014 Audrey??\n\n\u2014 Cooper wakes up?\n\nTonight At The Roadhouse\n\nSharon Van Etten performs \u201cTarifa\u201d off her 2014 album, Are We There\u2026", "images": ["https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-15517-r.jpg?quality=80", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-21355-r.jpg?quality=80", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/themes/consequenceofsound/img/1x1.trans.gif", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-15729-r.jpg?quality=80", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-09721-r.jpg?quality=80&w=807", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/themes/consequenceofsound/img/icon-radio-cos.svg", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-02058-r.jpg?quality=80", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/close-icon.png", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-13097-r.jpg?quality=80"], "top_img": "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-13097-r.jpg?quality=80", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelly Mcclure"], "canonical_link": "https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/06/recapping-twin-peaks-the-return-part-6/", "title": "Recapping Twin Peaks: The Return: Part 6", "meta_data": {"msvalidate.01": "8CABEAF0C9CE91FCEDBFB11C38206EE5", "fb": {"app_id": 434175690014, "pages": 19875021647}, "description": "David Lynch and Mark Frost offer an outstanding number of revelations...", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Recapping Twin Peaks: The Return: Part 6", "description": "David Lynch and Mark Frost offer an outstanding number of revelations...", "url": "https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/06/recapping-twin-peaks-the-return-part-6/", "site_name": "Consequence of Sound", "updated_time": "2017-07-31T13:13:35-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-13097-r.jpg?quality=80", "secure_url": "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-13097-r.jpg?quality=80"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/consequence/", "tag": "Twin Peaks", "section": "TV", "published_time": "2017-06-12T06:50:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-31T13:13:35-04:00", "categories": "TV,TV Reviews,Twin Peaks Week"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "David Lynch and Mark Frost offer an outstanding number of revelations...", "title": "Recapping Twin Peaks: The Return: Part 6", "site": "@consequence", "image": "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rr-09721-r.jpg?quality=80", "creator": "@consequence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=971967886", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/cosfavicon.png?w=80"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/WiwsQSXivmI?version=3&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1497264653.0, "source": "https://consequenceofsound.net", "summary": ""}
