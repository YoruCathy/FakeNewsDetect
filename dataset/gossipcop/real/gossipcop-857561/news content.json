Tivan will be showing off his latest acquisitions, the Guardians of the Galaxy, in customized display cases. However, Rocket has secretly escaped his case and asks the guests for help. Guests will then board a gantry lift, where they help Rocket try to free the other Guardians.[1]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_-_Mission%2C_Breakout_Concept_Art.jpg/290px-Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_-_Mission%2C_Breakout_Concept_Art.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b1/Fastpass_availability_icon.svg/20px-Fastpass_availability_icon.svg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108im_/https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161010020108/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_%E2%80%93_Mission:_Breakout!", "title": "Guardians of the Galaxy \u2013 Mission: Breakout!", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.28.0-wmf.21", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
