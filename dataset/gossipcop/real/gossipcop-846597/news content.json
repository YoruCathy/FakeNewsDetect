For starters, the \u201cFalcon Crest\u201d and \u201cRenegade\u201d actor was already involved with someone else.\n\nThe 31-year-old actress and model was first introduced to the 59-year-old through a friend in Los Angeles, who suggested the pair should date.\n\n\u201cLorenzo said, \u2018Oh, I would love to, but I have a girlfriend,\u2019\u201d Craig told Fox News. \u201cSo it was kind of an awkward transition. I thought we could be friends.\u201d\n\nWHY 'SECOND WIVES CLUB' SHIVA SAFAI TURNED DOWN 'REAL HOUSEWIVES OF BEVERLY HILLS'\n\nBut a week after the initial meeting, the two saw each other again \u2014 and this time the actor made a move.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019d like to take you out on a date, if that\u2019s OK,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, you have a girlfriend and I would never do that.\u2019 Then he said, \u2018I actually broke up with her because it wasn\u2019t a serious relationship. I wanted to be honest with you and start things off properly with you. That\u2019s all buttoned up now and I would like to take you out.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd after three months of dating, Lamas proposed.\n\n\u201cHe showed me the ring. And I said, \u2018Oh, no, no, no,'\u201d said Craig. \u201cI mean, it had only been three months\u2026 [but] we were engaged for a little over a year and then got married in Mexico. It was great.\u201d\n\nBut marrying the actor wasn\u2019t all glitz and glamour. Lamas, who was previously married four times and has six children, was faced with financial issues.\n\nIn 2015, Lamas told Fox News he didn\u2019t have his former wives sign prenuptial agreements because \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re almost professing failure at the outset.\u201d In addition, he grew tired of waiting for a phone call to \u201cget me on another B-movie,\u201d prompting him to pursue a new role as a commercial pilot.\n\nStill, Craig insisted Lamas\u2019 past didn\u2019t make her think twice about the marriage.\n\n\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t make me question anything because he\u2019s such an honest, good person and my best friend, first and foremost,\u201d she explained. \u201c[But] it did bother me. I just felt like he had spent all of his time, energy, and resources on these people who I didn\u2019t really feel had his best interest at heart and didn\u2019t love him as much as I love him unconditionally.\n\n\"So it would always make me sad that he struggled with his finances\u2026 I thought, \u2018I wish our lives had started off easier where we can have fun and enjoy each other' instead of, from the very beginning, be stressed with all the things that come along with being with Lorenzo. But that\u2019s something I\u2019ve always struggled with. It has gotten better in the last year or so, but\u2026 I would get very said about it and I cried. It was hard.\u201d\n\nCraig recently chronicled their relationship in front of cameras for E!\u2019s \u201cSecond Wives Club\u201d where she, along with three other celebrity wives, reveal what their high-profile marriages are really like. She believed discussing her husband\u2019s finances made them more relatable to audiences.\n\n\u201cI think the way that was put together, I didn\u2019t really say it exactly the way it came across,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt is definitely an issue because he\u2019s got three kids that are still young and he\u2019s taking care of them\u2026 but I think a lot of people go through that. Sometimes finances are great, sometimes it\u2019s hard. I think that\u2019s really relatable. There\u2019s no shame in struggling\u2026 I think that\u2019s just life.\u201d\n\nViewers also learned how Craig willingly took on the role of step-mom despite not wanting children of her own.\n\n\u201cIt was never something Lorenzo said I needed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a lot for one person to handle, especially a single dad\u2026 My mom was a single mother and the girls were really young when I came into Lorenzo\u2019s life. I just thought they needed guidance, structure, and stability. I knew I could provide that to them. It made me happy to do that. I\u2019m really proud of it.\u201d\n\nCraig particularly bonded with 31-year-old Shayne Lamas. When Lamas\u2019 eldest daughter suffered a near-fatal miscarriage in 2014 that resulted in a full hysterectomy, Craig volunteered to become her surrogate.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to have children of my own. I always knew I wanted to help in some form,\u201d said Craig. \u201cI started out as an egg donor and I did that many times. And all the couples were able to have children because of it. I thought, \u2018I\u2019m not going to be doing egg donations for much longer, I would love to carry a child.\n\n\"I offered my assistance to Shayne and [her husband] Nik. They were hesitant about it. I said, \u2018Take your time and think about it. If this is something you\u2019d like to move forward with, I\u2019m here.\u2019 And so week later, they called me and said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it, we\u2019re on board.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe couple welcomed their second child together on July 4, 2015. Craig enjoyed every moment of carrying the baby boy named Lyon.\n\n\u201cHonestly, if I could be pregnant my whole life, I would,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI love being pregnant, it\u2019s so much fun. I know that sounds crazy, but I love it. Shayne is so happy and feels very fulfilled on having a little boy and girl. She\u2019s definitely got her hands full.\u201d\n\nStill, Craig stressed she and her husband have zero plans to have children of their own.\n\n\u201cWe actually thought about in vitro for about a week,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do it.\u2019 He was kind of upset about it, but he looks back and goes, \u2018Thank you so much. I\u2019m going to get a little bit of my life to do my own thing. And if we had kids, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d been raising kids my whole life.\u2019 It\u2019s definitely not something I see for myself. Being a surrogate? I\u2019m positive I\u2019ll do it at least once or twice more.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/Mafia-Hit-Man.jpg?ve=1&tl=1",
