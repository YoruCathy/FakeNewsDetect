People don\u2019t like to wear their wedding dresses again do they?\u201d Hurley told the publication.\n\n\u201cI think you couldn\u2019t look better in it second time around. I mean, 24 years on, you could end up feeling slightly depressed, so, no!\n\n\u201cThat dress is definitely for someone 20 years younger than me.\u201d\n\nHurley was attending the 1994 film screening on the arm of the romantic comedy\u2019s star Hugh Grant and quickly shifted the spotlight from the actor, who she was dating at the time.\n\nWhile relatively conservative by today\u2019s red carpet standards, her dress made the front page of newspapers and Hurley a household name.\n\nToday Hurley is still making headlines, this time for the age-defying photos she shares on Instagram, which she admits are mostly taken by her 16-year-old son Damien.", "images": ["https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/4e06f78adf94477b9428aa9391e89fd3",
