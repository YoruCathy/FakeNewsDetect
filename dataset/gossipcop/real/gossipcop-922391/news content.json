I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is necessary and long overdue.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Amy Schumer on Aziz Ansari Allegation \u2014 Everyone Needs to Learn What \u2018Behavior Is Not Acceptable\u2019\n\nImage zoom Aziz Ansari and Lena Waithe\n\nWaithe, 33, previously touched on the Ansari allegation in an interview with KPCC\u2019s The Frame.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth \u2014 in every situation, it\u2019s not always black-and-white,\u201d she said last month. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s simple for people, and it\u2019s easy for people to [ask], \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 There are no sides, really, in some of these scenarios.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1553&h=813&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1553&h=813&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Faziz-ansari-lena-waithe-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "title": "Lena Waite Reflects on Aziz Ansari Sexual Misconduct Allegation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Aziz Ansari,Master of None,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Aziz Ansari,Master of None,News,TV", "description": "\"We need to be more attuned to each other, pay more attention to each other, in every scenario,\" says Waithe", "og": {"title": "Lena Waithe Reflects on Aziz Ansari Allegation,\u00a0Hopes We 'Educate Ourselves' About Sexual Consent", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "description": "Lena Waithe has weighed in on the sexual misconduct allegation brought against her&nbsp;Master of None&nbsp;costar Aziz Ansari.
