on Friday 10 November, Taylor Swift has been forced to release its track list after it unexpectedly leaked online last night.\n\nEarlier this morning, the 27-year-old posted a black and white close-up image of herself with the track list, featuring hits such 'Ready For It?', 'Gorgeous' and 'Call It What You Want'.\n\nShe captioned the post: '3 days until #reputation.'\n\nThe singer's announcement came shortly after identical photos of the album and the backside of its cover art surfaced on the internet.\n\nFrom the looks of it, Reputation will be the singer's second-longest album behind her 2012 album Red with a whopping 15 tracks in total.\n\nTaylor's BFF Ed Sheeran and rapper Future also feature as artists on the single 'End Game', while her friend Jack Antonoff is listed as a producer on the album.\n\nOther track titles include 'I Did Something Bad,' 'Don't Blame Me,' 'Delicate,' and 'Dancing With Our Hands Tied.'\n\nAnd yes, we're already coming up with many a theory as to the meaning behind such intruiging track titles.\n\nOf course, it didn't take long before Swift's fans learned of the singer's track list release.\n\nMy jaw is still on the floor from @taylorswift13's revealing the reputation tracklist and also THE ED SHEERAN COLLAB \u2014 Taylor Robinson (@TaylorElaine94) November 8, 2017\n\n@taylorswift13 @taylornation13 I love that the track list is printed on the left side of her face as opposed to the right on the cover: her side of the story vs. The media's #Reputation #Reputationtracklist pic.twitter.com/yizRYkdIQZ \u2014

Liberties Union (ACLU) after demanding a blogger remove and retract an article suggesting the the singer is an icon of white supremacists.", "images":
