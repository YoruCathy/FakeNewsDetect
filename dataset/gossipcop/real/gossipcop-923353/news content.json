These are just some of TV\u2019s best and brightest making unexpected returns to the airwaves decades after the fact, to say nothing of renewed revivals like Will & Grace, Arrested Development and more. The TV industry\u2019s gone revival-crazy, and we\u2019ve got twenty (!) ranked examples of the last decade or so to prove it.\n\nFor purposes of this inalienable ranking, we\u2019ve laid out a few ground rules: A TV revival needn\u2019t keep its original series\u2019 name, but at least a majority of characters (or stars) and premise. As such, we\u2019re not counting reboots or re-imaginings, or TV series continuations of famous films (sorry, Wet Hot American Summer).\n\nYou\u2019re warned of at least a few revival spoilers in the interim, but did your favorites make the list?", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/01/Best-TV-Revivals.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/04/screencrush-high-rez.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6665296&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/01/Best-TV-Revivals.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Fitzpatrick"], "canonical_link": "https://screencrush.com/best-tv-revivals-ranked/", "title": "TV Show Revivals Ranked, From Worst to First", "meta_data": {"description": "From 'Twin Peaks' to 'Arrested Development,' we take a look at the twenty best (and worst) TV show revivals of the last ten years.
