Amber Portwood left fans wondering if she had secretly wed boyfriend Andrew Glennon after she referred to the cinematographer as her \u201chubby.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a fan in a live Q&A session on Instagram on Friday, November 9, about whether she had heard about the California wildfires, the Teen Mom OG star, 28, gave an unexpected response.\n\n\u201cYes, I have heard about the fires in Malibu and Calabasas, and my, my hubby is freaking out because his mom\u2019s house is in Malibu and he has a lot of family that lives in that area, he\u2019s freaking out because he\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who met while Portwood was filming Marriage Boot Camp with ex-boyfriend Matt Baier, celebrated their first anniversary in August. \u201cOne year from yesterday I met this amazing man and it is truly a dream!\u201d she wrote on Instagram at the time.\n\nThe reality star and the cameraman, 34, made their red carpet debut at the MTV Video Music Awards in August 2017. Nine months later, they welcomed son James.\n\nPortwood, who has also struggled with borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder and drug addiction, gushed about her man\u2019s parenting skills to Us Weekly in June. \u201cHe is such an amazing man and loves taking care of James,\u201d Portwood told Us. \u201cHe was afraid of postpartum depression, so he\u2019s always checking up on me. He just wants to make sure I\u2019m loved. It\u2019s almost perfect.\u201d\n\nThe MTV personality also shares 10-year-old daughter Leah with her ex-fianc\u00e9, Gary Shirley.", "images": ["https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon-Teen-Mom-Hubby.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1334px%2C753px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon-Teen-Mom-Hubby.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon-Teen-Mom-Hubby.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Briese"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-hints-she-might-be-married-to-boyfriend-andrew-glennon/", "title": "Amber Portwood Hints She Might Be Married to Boyfriend Andrew Glennon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Amber Portwood referred to boyfriend Andrew Glennon as her \u201chubby\u201d in an Instagram Live video on Friday, November 9 \u2014 is she married?", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Amber Portwood Married?", "description": "Amber Portwood referred to boyfriend Andrew Glennon as her \u201chubby\u201d in an Instagram Live video on Friday, November 9 \u2014 is she married?", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-hints-she-might-be-married-to-boyfriend-andrew-glennon/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon-Teen-Mom-Hubby.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon-Teen-Mom-Hubby.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-11-11T19:21:55+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Amber Portwood referred to boyfriend Andrew Glennon as her \u201chubby\u201d in an Instagram Live video on Friday, November 9 \u2014 is she married?", "title": "Is Amber Portwood Married?", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Amber-Portwood-Andrew-Glennon-Teen-Mom-Hubby.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C1334px%2C701px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541964115.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
