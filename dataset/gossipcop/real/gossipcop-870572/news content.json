I liked the fact that I knew the people at the helm.\u201d\n\nDid she attack the role of Leslie Abramson with any significant differences to how she played the equally fierce Sally Bell? \u201cI don\u2019t know that I did,\u201d she said. \u201cI think so much is in the script, and all you have to do is what\u2019s in front of you.\n\n\u201cA lot of the testimony was taken straight from Abramson\u2019s words, so you approach it [the] way that you would any role.\u201d\n\nThe series may be called Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but the show makes Abramson the star. It\u2019s Falco who is front and center on the show\u2019s poster, and the story is partly told through her eyes as she finds out about Lyle and Erik Menendez and then becomes the lead attorney in their trials.\n\nOf course, Edie Falco has been the main draw of a program before; she was critically acclaimed for the title role in Showtime\u2019s Nurse Jackie, too. She\u2019s used to being the headliner, so she didn\u2019t mind getting top billing in this particular project.\n\n\u201cI figure if they want me to do it and I agree to do it,\u201d she explained, \u201cWe\u2019re all capable, and I understand the motivation behind the person that I\u2019m playing. It\u2019s become less of a deal.\u201d\n\nWith everything that she\u2019s done over her career, from Nurse Jackie to Broadway, from Law & Order to The Sopranos, Edie Falco has been there and done that in the TV world. She\u2019s one of the small screen\u2019s best actresses, so we asked her to tell us what about being Leslie Abramson in Menendez Murders could possibly challenge her.\n\n\u201c[There was] a great deal of frustration, just over the actual story,\u201d she reflected. \u201cI do hope at the end, viewers will understand that there were so many things involved in this trial\u2014and I venture to guess other trials as well\u2014that were politically based.\n\n\u201cIt was the climate in Los Angeles at the time, it was relationships between lawyers, and all this stuff that had nothing to do with these guys and their parents.\u201d\n\nLaw & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.
