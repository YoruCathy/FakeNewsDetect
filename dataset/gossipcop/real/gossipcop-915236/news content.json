Still parading modeling daughters around. This time, it\u2019s Camille wanting \u201cMason to shine.\u201d Man, it seems like a lot of these mommas are living vicariously through their kids.\n\nWhile Camille swoons over her model daughter, the rest of the ladies head into the limo van to come to the fashion show. It is the most awkward car ride ever. \u201cI did not know that Dorit was capable of not talking for this long. Which is making me a lot more uncomfortable.\u201d You and me both, Kyle. Dorit claims that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t wanna be here,\u201d but no one truly wants to miss THE fashion show at the Intrepid.\n\nThe ladies roll up to support Camille\u2019s daughter, Mason, who kinda looks like a possessed doll as she stomps down the runway. \u201cI can relate so much to what Camille is going through\u2026because of my own daughters.\u201d Ah, yes. It was only a matter of time before Rinna had to bring up her wanna-be Haddid daughters. So classic. Erika claims that Mason looks fabulous, although I am not quite sure how she is even seeing anything with those shades on. It is cute to hear how proud Camille is and it is quite refreshing to hear a mother talk like a mother, and not like a Rinna. #solidwork. As the ladies pile back into the van post fashion show, the tension is so thick you could cut it with a knife.\n\nNo time to waste- everyone has to get ready for the evening\u2019s festivities. Watching Erika prep for a night out is my most favorite thing ever. Mainly because I love Mikey, her creative director. Erika legit has 37 people styling her for Kyle\u2019s \u201cin-store\u201d and you would almost think that it was for the Oscar\u2019s. Apparently everyone needs a village to get ready. Kyle is even feigning short hair because #NewYork.\n\nRinna pops in to find out exactly what is happening to cause all the silence in the van. She was too wasted the night before to truly know what the heck happened to cause the rift in the group. Kyle tells Rinna how she tries to defend Lisa all of the days and Rinna tells Kyle that she is a good friend. \u201cGuess what Kyle? You would throw yourself in front of a f*cking bus for (LVP).\u201d Rinna is finally catching on and states that \u201cthreesomes don\u2019t work.\u201d Ah yes, Rinna. Truer words have never been spoken. Kyle, Dorit, and LVP REALLY have to figure out their issues.\n\n\u201cI always dress according to my mood, so I am wearing a vampire shirt because I feel like there was blood drawn last night. And it was mine\u201d- Dorit explaining her cool t-shirt. She decides it would be best to talk to LVP and try to get back on her good side. It doesn\u2019t seem likely that things will ever be the same again for LVP and Dorit. Dorit very clearly knows she is in the dog house with LVP, especially when LVP says she feels \u201ca little bit hurt\u201d by Dorit. Lisa lays into her and reminds Dorit of alllllllll the things she has ever said. \u201cYou\u2019re needy and jealous\u2026.\u201d Blah, blah, blah. LVP feels that it is \u201cderogatory\u201d and I don\u2019t blame her. She also tells Dorit that just because her AND Kyle talked smack about Lisa doesn\u2019t make it any better. Amen, sister. Lisa states that she loves Dorit, mainly cuz she loves Dorit\u2019s husband, so therefore she cannot spoil this relationship. OUCH\u2026After a lot of back and forth, the two of them decide to not have someone (KYLE) come between their friendship.\n\nOver at Kyle\u2019s New York store\u2019s trunk show, Kyle shares that she feels super weird now that her friendship is strained with LVP. Instead of heading to the store early with LVP, Kyle is stuck with Teddi-the-dud. Teddi fakes interest in the kaftans and the \u201camazing creations\u201d Kyle\u2019s 19 year-old godson designed. Everyone is at the trunk show. The Fat Jewish. Bethenny Frankel!!!! How cool is Kyle for getting the most fabulous party guests?\n\nBethenny\u2019 s intensity is a lot for Teddi to handle, so it\u2019s a blessing that the rest of the ladies finally make it to the trunk show\u202645 minutes late. Blame Dorit. Notice that she always seems to have a problem arriving places on time?? \u201cNow Kyle has Bethenny as a back-up\u201d and clearly LVP is uncomfortable going against this firecracker. I would be, too. LVP states that she is \u201ca bigger person so, there\u2026thuck you\u2026I mean thank you.\u201d Bethenny forces LVP to apologize to Kyle and it is incredible. That is why I love New York. None of this Beverly Hills fake business.\n\nLater, the ladies awkwardly model colorful fur jackets and Erika tries to woo Bethenny with her upcoming business ventures. Bethenny is not quite impressed. Erika describes Bethenny as \u201cone of those big dogs who like to pee all over everything.\u201d HA! Kyle later explains to Rinna that she is done kissing LVP\u2019s a*s. Yea. I\u2019ll believe it when I see it. Just like Kyle is over Dorit\u2026until she has a one on one with her. Kyle explains that she \u201cadores\u201d Dorit. \u201cThe three of us together have the best time,\u201d explains Dorit and she states that \u201csomething like this\u2026 we can\u2019t let it\u2026\u201dtear us apart. So much back and forth.\n\nThe gang all returns home back where they belong. We all know they couldn\u2019t hang in NYC much longer- they are just not cut out for it. LVP invites Teddi over for some tea\u2026aka a chance for them to catch up and hear about LVP\u2019s upcoming birthday party. They also share their feelings about their NY trip and Teddi states that the issue is Dorit\u2019s lack of ownership when she says something wrong. LVP describes Dorit as being \u201cvery vocal\u201d and still does not hold her accountable for her trash talking. Teddi does a fabulous job explaining how Kyle went to bat for LVP and I have decided that Teddi is a friend I would want to have- she seems to be the only one who can get through LVP\u2019s thick British skull.\n\nRinna\u2019s segment is of course about her children\u2026oh and her adorable pup. It is kinda sweet seeing Rinna and HarryHamlin act like real parents\u2026until HarryHamlin tries to compare Delilah\u2019s NYC move to movie sets and tv shows. Sigh. Modeling. TV. Movies. This family. Thank GOD HarryHamlin and Rinna have \u201cexperience in the business\u201d to help their kids.\n\nFinally, the meeting we have all been waiting for! LVP and Kyle. Together again out to dinner. Kyle claims she is \u201coverwhelmed\u201d and LVP tries to alleviate her pressure by pouring her a heavy glass of rose. Lisa lets Kyle know that she is worried about her relationship with Dorit because Lisa holds PK\u2019s friendship in high regard. Kyle is totally annoyed by LVP trying to justify why she is not angry at Dorit. She also feels like her ten year friendship has taken a back seat, all because Dorit\u2019s hubby is tight with LVP and Ken, her husband.\n\nAfter a whole lotta whining and finger pointing, finally Kyle hears what she\u2019s been wanting to hear: LVP says, \u201cI do want to apologize for this and I mean it 1,000%. I am sorry that I have neglected you and I didn\u2019t realize you were that upset.\u201d And there ya have it, guys. Give the lady a little rose and wam-o\u2026friends again. Who knew it could be that easy?! Note: Always have a supply of rose around\u2026for those times you need to butter up the one and only LVP.\n\nTELL US \u2013 WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE RHOBH RECAP & LATEST EPISODE?
