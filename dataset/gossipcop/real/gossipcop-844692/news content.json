The two have a playful rivalry in which they jockey for position in their mother\u2019s (recurring guest star Jenifer Lewis) rankings that are released every December. Yet, despite her closeness to Dre, she just won\u2019t be the first one to bridge the sexuality gap between them. She\u2019s happy to follow her older brother\u2019s lead.\n\nThe openly gay That\u2019s So Raven alum, who recently appeared on Empire, will appear in an episode aptly titled \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Ask, Please Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d which will air later this season.\n\nBlack-ish airs Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
