baby No. 4, PEOPLE confirmed in January 2019.\n\n\"We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care,\" the reality star wrote on her website after the January 2018 birth of daughter Chicago.\n\nGiving birth again isn't an option for Kardashian West, who suffered from placenta accreta during both of her pregnancies with son Saint and daughter North.", "images":
