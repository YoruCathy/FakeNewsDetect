I feel better now.\"\n\nThe star was wearing grey jogging bottoms, a dark sweater and appeared to have a hospital tag around his left wrist.\n\nHe gave a quick thumbs up before walking through the door of his gated house, where a white Toyota sports car and white Audi were also parked on the drive.\n\nCowell had been at a Little Mix concert and had woken up at 6.45am, according to reports.\n\nHe was ill this summer, when he was forced to pull out of X Factor's London auditions. He also missed his own charity ball in June last year when he was struck down by flu.", "images":
