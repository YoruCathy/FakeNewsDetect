Not only has her wedding prep put a strain on her friendship with Margaret Josephs, but it has also put a microscope on some of the challenges in her relationship with her groom, Marty Caffrey.\n\nSpecifically, Danielle's revelation in Wednesday night's episode of RHONJ that she doesn't get along with Marty's three children left the rest of the Garden State crew speechless. \"I command respect,\" Danielle shared during the episode. \"If you're not going to respect me, stay out of my space.\"\n\nMarty then said that no one is responsible for how this situation turned out, and he concluded the conversation by expressing how painful it has been to see his kids and his future wife at odds. \"I chose you at the detriment of them and my relationship with them,\" he said to Danielle on RHONJ. \"And therefore, we have to move on. Life is short. That's all I have to say.\"\n\nDanielle addressed her comments about Marty's children in an Instagram post published in advance of the episode airing on Wednesday, December 19. \"Here\u2019s my message. I love all children of all ages! Keep in mind [that] his kids are well into their 30s. They are adults living on their own,\" Danielle wrote in an Instagram post that featured a photo of herself with Margaret, Melissa Gorga, and Teresa Giudice while they were in Bimini in the Bahamas for her wedding. \"They should\u2019ve respected their father and not made him choose between us! I enforced and supported his relationship [with] them. He chose not to speak to them and I won\u2019t shoulder his decision or theirs!\"\n\nThe other members of the RHONJ squad offer up their take on this tense dinner moment in The Real Housewives of New Jersey Season 9 After Show, which you can check out, above.\n\nDanielle and Marty tied the knot on May 5, and two months later, reports began to surface of trouble in the RHONJ couple's marriage. It was then reported that the couple had filed temporary restraining orders against one another following an incident at their home in August, which were eventually dropped.\n\nMarty filed for divorce from Danielle in August. Danielle spoke out about her split on The Wendy Williams Show in October. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how I saw certain things happening, but you just believe, especially with the perception around us, getting engaged would make it better \u2026 getting married would make it better,\" she shared. \"It doesn\u2019t get better, ladies. If it\u2019s falling apart, it\u2019s broken. You can't fix that.\u201d\n\nThe couple continued to live together following their breakup. It was later reported that Marty had put their New Jersey home on the market, which Danielle only found out about after the fact online.\n\nEarlier this month, Danielle was reportedly spotted getting cozy with R&B singer Al B. Sure in New York City.\n\nLook back on Danielle and Marty's destination wedding trip, below.", "images":
