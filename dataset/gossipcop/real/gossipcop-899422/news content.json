Also, Brie Bella began her journey back to a WWE ring, and Jim Neidhart was a terrible tenant. Also also, everyone still kind of generally thinks Lana is the pits. This becomes important later.\n\nAlso, I can\u2019t help but wonder how differently some of the ensuing hijinks would have been affected HAD Nia been around to witness them and/or intervene.\n\nI have no idea why Jax couldn\u2019t make this trip, so Alexa is rolling solo, but gets some quality bonding time with Nikki, as they\u2019re the first two to arrive in Cabo. It goes without saying that we are massive, MASSIVE fans of real-life besties Nia and Alexa, but it\u2019s also nice to see how Alexa rolls with situations without her looking-out-for-Lexi\u2019s-best-interests muscle around.\n\nDuring a photo shoot for BirdieBee, Brie lets Nikki in on the plan that she\u2019s throwing her an engagement party in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. This is the scene-setting for the entirety of this episode, which gets out of control extremely quickly. The Divas are going to _____! is a tried and true Total Divas trope, but this one might go down as being the most infamous. Everyone but Nia Jax heads down to Cabo in various groups, which brings us to our next point of order.\n\nShe Thinks She\u2019s Quentin Tarantino\n\nBefore the Smackdown crew of Carmella, Naomi, Lana and Nattie get down to Cabo, they have to wrestle on Smackdown. While Nattie and Carmella are getting their makeup did, Nattie starts ranting about Lana, once again calling back the screaming argument Lana had with everyone in Florida about how they should work harder to get better at promos. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s Quentin Tarantino,\u201d says Nattie to Carmella, and it legit took me 30 seconds to understand what the hell she meant by that. At first I thought it was because of all the cussing Lana did. Then I thought maybe Lana was secretly super into feet. It finally dawned on me that Nattie was mocking Lana insisting she\u2019s super good at words/talking/writing, and picked QT as the example that came to her mind as an example of that. Incredible.\n\nWhile Nattie is shit-talking, Lana overhears and strolls up to Nattie, who doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s there. Nattie\u2019s makeup lady cringes for a while before Nattie finally looks at who\u2019s standing next to her AS SHE SAYS \u201cLana is just so much drama \u2014 \u201d and looks suitably shocked before giving her an \u201co hai.\u201d\n\nJust as a word of warning: this episode marks the turning point where Nattie becomes the greatest villain in television history. And yes, I listened to Byron Saxton on Smackdown Live this week.\n\nBag Full Of Penis Things\n\nCarmella brought an entire \u201cbag\u201d of \u201cpenis things\u201d to Cabo, because she was under the mistaken impression that this was Nikki\u2019s bachelorette party, and apparently things in the shape of dicks are for that and definitely not for engagement parties. The best thing is Nikki acting offended like, \u201cJesus, you think five days at a mansion in Cabo San Lucas would be for something as important as my bachelorette party? Get a clue, Carmella.\u201d\n\nTo their credit, everyone rolls with the penis stuff anyway, and none of it gets blurred. Maybe this is the best timeline after all.\n\nCan Lana And Nattie Coexist? (Spoiler: No)\n\nIn this one (1) episode, here is a list of things that Lana does to Nattie:\n\nContinually try to get along with Nattie\n\nEnlist Naomi to good-naturedly (and half-assedly) TP Nattie\u2019s room\n\nBe (subjectively) annoying\n\nAgain insist she\u2019s good at promos\n\nPossibly play-slap Nattie, possibly after Nattie slapped her first\n\nBy comparison, in this one (1) episode, here is a list of things that NATTIE does to LANA:\n\nShit-talk Lana behind her back, and fail to realize Lana is standing next to her as she continues to shit-talk\n\nContinually ignore Nikki\u2019s repeated and earnest requests to get along with Lana so it doesn\u2019t ruin Nikki\u2019s engagement party weekend\n\nMove Lana\u2019s things out of Lana\u2019s chosen resort room and into a room on the ground floor because she finds Lana irritating\n\nWhip Lana with flowers when she catches Lana and Naomi TPing her room\n\nBlame Lana for ruining said flowers\n\nPublicly announce Lana is pregnant (she is not)\n\nDefinitely slap Lana several times, hard, while dancing onstage at a club\n\nThreaten to beat Lana\u2019s f*cking ass\n\nThrow a glass of $800 champagne at Lana as a means of proving a point\n\nThrow Lana\u2019s suitcase and cell phone off the side of a cliff\n\nRun and lock herself in her room when Lana asks if anyone has seen her phone\n\nHide in her room as Lana makes threats at the door, after repeatedly saying she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to lay Lana out if provoked\n\nI should note Lana did throw the rest of the bottle of $800 champagne on Nattie, but that was a pretty sensible retaliation, I feel. Anyway, Nattie is absolutely insane in this episode, and Naomi tries to blame it on \u201cRed Wine Nattie.\u201d The episode ends with Lana threatening to shave Nattie\u2019s head, and to strip naked so the producers can\u2019t use the footage if Nattie doesn\u2019t open the door immediately. The episode ends on a mid-season cliffhanger!\n\nI hope when the show returns, Nattie is replaced by one of Teddy Hart\u2019s cats and they never mention it. Not even one of Nattie\u2019s cats. She doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "images": ["https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/moxley-chair-aew.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/themes/uproxx/assets/images/logo-prowrestling.png?v=1.0.8", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/smackdown-triple-threat.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/royal-rumble-1999-logo.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/braun-strowman-black-sheep.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/charlotte-flair-smackdown-2020-grid.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/peoples-party-2.jpg?w=719&h=272&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/nikki-bella-grimace.jpg?w=650", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/timothy-thatcher-nxt-debut.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/nikki-bella-grimace.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Hanstock", "Brandon Stroud", "Emily Pratt", "Contributing Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/total-divas-season-7-episode-6-recap-midseason-finale/", "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2018Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "meta_data": {"description": "In which Nattie lives long enough to see herself become a villain.", "keywords": "prowrestling, sports, total divas, total divas recap, wwe total divas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index,follow", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPROXX", "creator": "@UPROXX", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2018Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week"}, "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "qc": {"post": "total-divas-season-7-episode-6-recap-midseason-finale", "author": "Bill Hanstock", "section": "prowrestling", "primary_tag": "total-divas"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2019Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "url": "https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/total-divas-season-7-episode-6-recap-midseason-finale/", "description": "In which Nattie lives long enough to see herself become a villain.", "site_name": "UPROXX", "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/nikki-bella-grimace.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 400}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_GB"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-14T21:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-03-19T10:53:54+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "app_id": 117400151618132, "pages": 116548701336}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513286100.0, "source": "https://uproxx.com", "summary": ""}
