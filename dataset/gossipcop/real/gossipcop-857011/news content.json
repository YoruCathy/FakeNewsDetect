Just a bagel, muffin, and cup of coffee. But this modern-day convenience backfired. Her bag contained just a muffin and the bagel. Coffee? Nonexistent. Cream cheese? Not a schmear in sight.\n\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Frankel says, lifting her hands in the air at her SoHo apartment as she reaches for a piece of vegan sushi. \u201cI\u2019m still mad.\u201d\n\nWhether in business or in life, Frankel, 47, expects perfection. In fact, that may be the secret to her success. The brash Real Housewives of New York City star\u2019s relentless hustle has lifted her from a financially insecure childhood spent around racetracks throughout New York to her current status as a multimillionaire entrepreneur.\n\nAnything less than the best gives her a headache. In 2011, when she sold her Skinnygirl cocktail line to Beam Global for a reported $100 million, she was careful to retain the right to license the brand name for other products, a move that allows her to profit from a constantly growing line of Skinnygirl spinoffs.\n\nFrankel\u2019s famous work ethic has helped her forge an unusual path to riches. She\u2019s a businesswoman who demands to be taken seriously\u2014and a reality star who trades in quips and jabs (\u201cBethenny-isms,\u201d as her fan base calls them) on a television show not exactly known for serious business. Her daily Instagram stories track this dichotomy. One minute, she\u2019s in full glam, commanding the Skinnygirl offices in Manhattan; the next, she\u2019s at home in bed with her dogs, stripped of her makeup, her hair in a messy bun. When we met this summer, Frankel seamlessly displayed these complexities\u2014with her desire for flawlessness shining through more than anything else.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not going to give it my all, then I\u2019m not doing it,\u201d Frankel tells me, draped in T.J. Maxx sweats inside her apartment. \u201cIf I make you a drink, I\u2019m going to be sure it\u2019s the best drink you\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nShe sets her sights on what is immediately in front of her.\n\n\u201cWhoever made this brownie,\u201d she says of her post-sushi dessert, \u201cdoes not share my philosophy. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the greatest result of this consistent drive toward greatness is what Frankel calls her \u201cfinancial freedom.\u201d Looking back on a career that saw her parlay an appearance on The Apprentice into a starring role on Housewives and now a coveted guest-investor gig on Shark Tank, Frankel laid out for MONEY the four most important steps to financial independence.\n\nShe\u2019s still hustling\u2014and she wants others to learn to do the same.\n\nDaily Money Sign up to receive the latest updates and the smartest advice. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nControl Your Debt\n\nFrankel couldn\u2019t be the businesswoman she is today if she hadn\u2019t learned a lesson or two about debt. For much of her adulthood, she says, debt hindered her from becoming her best self.\n\n\u201cUntil my late thirties, everything was just an anxiety and a struggle,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the way people feel when they eat something and they don\u2019t feel good about it.\u201d There were awkward dates where she didn\u2019t want to pay any part of the bill. She felt shame while shopping, with pangs of guilt coursing through her every time she bought a new item, even if it was on sale. All told, she says, she had $20,000 in credit card debt and was no stranger to bouncing checks. \u201cI\u2019d be on the phone begging to get the [fees] reduced,\u201d she recalls.\n\nFrankel at Boston University in 1988 courtesy of Bethenny Frankel\n\nBefore Frankel found financial security, she could barely afford her New York City rent. She would walk to events rather than take a cab or the subway and had no money management skills, aside from simply trying not to spend too much.\n\nFrankel\u2019s skewed approach to spending left her throwing money away on frivolous items. If she had cash in her purse, she says, it would find its way to street vendors, balloons at a fair\u2014anything, really. \u201cSomehow, all the cash would go,\u201d she says.\n\nThat mentality devolved into a nasty habit with credit cards\u2014a mechanism Frankel once thought would make spending easier and, ultimately, cursed her with guilt. \u201cI used to think the credit card didn\u2019t count,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I consolidated all my credit cards and got a strategic plan to pay more than the minimum each month. That was a concerted effort.\u201d\n\nNow that she has more money than she could ever have imagined, Frankel still hears that \u201cmoney noise,\u201d as she likes to call it\u2014it\u2019s just not that loud. Her biggest advice, to herself and to others, is to stay out of the red whenever possible. And when you do take on debt, you should have a large enough safety net to be able to pay those bills\u2014whether a monthly mortgage or credit card balances\u2014at a moment\u2019s notice. \u201cYou can\u2019t put yourself in a position where, if the s\u2013t hit the fan, you couldn\u2019t pay all of your bills at one time,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the world came to an end, I would be able to pay for everything. I might not be left with much, but I can afford what I have.\u201d\n\nAs for many of her Housewives costars? Frankel isn\u2019t optimistic. \u201cThey can\u2019t afford the lives they\u2019re living,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd if the music stops, they\u2019re going to get in some trouble.\u201d\n\nBethenny Frankel with the cast of The Real Housewives of New York City in 2009 Andrew Eccles\u2014Bravo TV/Courtesy of Everett Collection.\n\nMake Work Work for You\n\nFrankel\u2019s philosophy toward work is quite simple: Work hard, and don\u2019t waste anyone\u2019s time. That\u2019s easy enough, theoretically, but Frankel says most employees can fall into a trap of becoming lazy or procrastinating. \u201cMost people are moving papers around a desk, pretending they\u2019re working,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are a really hard worker, you know it. And you will soar.\u201d\n\nNowadays, Frankel\u2019s best employees get the job done accurately and quickly; those working overtime aren\u2019t impressing anyone. She learned that when she worked at an event production company owned by Merv Griffin, where a former colleague would stick around until 9 p.m. because he procrastinated all day. \u201cThe owner used to say, \u2018Why are you leaving? He\u2019s still here,\u2019 \u201d Frankel scoffs. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018It\u2019s because he didn\u2019t get his work done.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t lollygag,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou know if you\u2019re that person who\u2019s really going to be Michael Phelps and not look to the left or to the right and just get to that wall before anybody else.\u201d\n\nWorking efficiently also makes you a more valuable asset to any business you\u2019re working for or any project you\u2019re working on\u2014and could result in faster promotions and better wages. But mobility within your own career has a lot to do with pushing to get what you want and knowing your worth. \u201cTry to create a situation where you add value, and the whole thing comes from a place of yes,\u201d she says of asking for a raise or promotion. And reading the room is critical. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come in and ask me for too much, too often,\u201d she says. \u201cAsking for a raise is a very psychological and emotional thing. It has to be done at a reasonable time.\u201d\n\nMaking work work for you isn\u2019t just about negotiating a raise or getting that long-awaited promotion. It\u2019s finding that perfect combination of a job you enjoy\u2014and something you\u2019re good at. Even if you feel stuck in the same old nine-to-five, there are still ways you can make it your own and speed past your coworkers. \u201cMost people are lazy, sit back, and wait for things to happen for them, and complain when they don\u2019t get them,\u201d Frankel says. \u201cSo don\u2019t be that person.\u201d\n\nFrankel on the L.A. set of 'Saved by the Bell' as a production assistant Courtesy of Bethenny Frankel.\n\nFrom gig to gig throughout her adulthood, Frankel took each job seriously and consistently searched for ways to impress others. It was the early experience at the event production company that made her realize she was good at working hard, making money, and doing so with little oversight. She managed multimillion-dollar budgets and didn\u2019t work typical days in an office environment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I really started to blossom,\u201d she recalls.\n\nInvest in Your Hustle\n\nWhen Frankel was approached to join the cast of what would become The Real Housewives of New York City, she wasn\u2019t the typical New York City socialite. And as an unmarried woman, she was certainly not a housewife. But Frankel saw Housewives as a one-of-a-kind business opportunity, long before anyone else thought to do the same with reality television as a platform.\n\nWhile paid just $7,250 for the show\u2019s first season in 2008, Frankel made a key decision that set the stage for her financial success. She refused to sign a portion of the contract that would have required her to give TV network Bravo a percentage of the profits she earned from the businesses she promoted on the show. Though neither she nor Bravo knew it at the time, that excised portion of her contract\u2014now known as the \u201cBethenny clause\u201d\u2014made Frankel\u2019s Skinnygirl fortune all the more lucrative.\n\n\u201cEverybody else just had to try to play catch-up after they saw what I did,\u201d Frankel says proudly.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t an out-of-the-box fluke.\n\nFrankel was born into a hustler\u2019s paradise. She quite literally grew up on the racetracks, with a father and stepfather both horse trainers, surrounded by gambling and \u201cunsavory characters.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re prepared for anything,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s competition there; there\u2019s speed; there\u2019s money; the stakes are high.\u201d\n\nThat intense environment set the tone for Frankel\u2019s career. Whether it was charging a fee at the door for high school parties or opening her own baking business years later, Frankel has always tried out new projects and businesses. It wasn\u2019t until Skinnygirl, a brand she developed in her late thirties, that she crossed the finish line, in a sense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve failed so many times,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always learned more from my mistakes.\u201d\n\nIf one business didn\u2019t work out, then it was on to the next one. If she was presented with a not-so-perfect opportunity, she would turn it into one. When she came in second on Martha Stewart\u2019s version of The Apprentice in 2005 before appearing on Housewives, it only drove her further to push idea after idea and, eventually, to develop the right recipe for success. As a guest investor on Shark Tank, she now encourages others to do the same. On the show, she focuses on investing in women- and minority-run businesses, whose owners tend to receive significantly less in venture capital funding than their white male counterparts.\n\nStill, despite that $100 million deal with Beam Global under her belt and millions more coming in each year that could easily fund Frankel for the rest of her life, she\u2019s setting the bar high for herself. When we spoke about Skinnygirl\u2019s expansion into other products\u2014snacks, seltzers, and, most recently, size-inclusive jeans\u2014Frankel was eager to hype \u201cpossibly the biggest business deal\u201d to date for Skinnygirl down the road\u2014but wouldn\u2019t disclose the exact details. In true hustler fashion, she\u2019s keeping her cards close to her chest on this one.\n\nSpend Wisely \u2014 and Give Back\n\nFinding financial freedom isn\u2019t as simple as controlling your debt, finding success at work, and keeping your hustle mentality alive. Spending your money wisely is paramount\u2014and when you do splurge, do so responsibly.\n\nFor Frankel, who came into a lot of money very quickly, she\u2019s been careful about what she spends it on\u2014and what she invests in. She still considers herself frugal and hates frivolous spending. \u201cEven if it\u2019s buying a diamond\u2014which I\u2019ve done\u2014I\u2019d like to be able to get a good deal on it,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be robbed.\u201d\n\nFor her, the ultimate cornerstone of financial freedom is having the agency to invest in experiences or products that make her life and those of her loved ones more enjoyable, without the headache or anxiety spending once brought her. She\u2019s constantly on the hunt to find fun, new adventures for her and her 8-year-old daughter, Bryn. She brings her along to events that can double as a work/life excursion, like an appearance she booked at Disneyland. And the jacuzzi she installed at her home in the Hamptons? That\u2019s for her daughter to enjoy with her friends\u2014and Frankel to relax in after a workout. \u201cThe best money I ever spent,\u201d she says.\n\nFinancial freedom for her also means giving those without it a possible leg up. Last year, Frankel\u2019s B Strong charity program partnered with Delivering Good, a New York City\u2013based nonprofit, to charter more than 50 planes and bring millions of dollars\u2019 worth of food, water, gift cards, and emergency supplies to those affected by the hurricanes in Puerto Rico. In the fall of 2017, she used Twitter to ask fellow celebrities and fans for larger donations and traveled to Puerto Rico several times herself, donning a shirt from her charity that read \u201c#thisisacrisis.\u201d She has continued to work on relief efforts in recent months, visiting Guatemala after that country was devastated by a deadly volcanic eruption.\n\nFrankel in 2017 in Puerto Rico, where she has spearheaded relief efforts through her charity Courtesy of Bethenny Frankel.\n\nIn raising money for relief efforts, Frankel worried that donors would be concerned about where exactly their money was going. To give them financial empowerment, she says, her team would provide donors with a list detailing how the charity was spending the money. And Frankel says that just enticed them to give more.\n\n\u201cPeople now are so much more educated, and they want to know where their money is going. Even if it\u2019s a dollar. Is it a bottle of water, a nail, a piece of wood? And I gave them that,\u201d Frankel says. \u201cI gave them that financial freedom and power to say you\u2019re giving money, and here\u2019s where it\u2019s going.\u201d", "images": ["http://time.com/images/newsletter-money.png", "http://time.com/img/navigation/subscribe-icon.svg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/180807-bethenny-frankel-featured.jpg?quality=85", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/180807-bethenny-frankel-real-housewives-new-york-city.jpg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/180807-bethenny-frankel-saved-by-the-bell.jpg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/money-cover.jpg?quality=85", "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/money-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/180807-bethenny-frankel-puerto-rico.jpg", "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/180807-bethenny-frankel-boston-university.jpg"], "top_img": "https://moneydotcomvip.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/180807-bethenny-frankel-featured.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Calfas"], "canonical_link": "https://money.com/bethenny-frankel/", "title": "'Everything Was a Struggle.'
