Meg Ryan clams up on Michael Parkinson\n\nYou can\u2019t blame Meg Ryan for not warming to British talkshow host Michael Parkinson. She admitted during a 2003 appearance on Parkinson that she didn\u2019t enjoy the spotlight, before launching into a butt-clenchingly awkward demonstration. Eventually things got so bad Michael asked Meg what he should do, and her advice came as a relief to everyone watching: \u201cWrap it up.\u201d\n\n9. Dame Helen Mirren leaves Stephen Colbert speechless\n\n\u201cI suddenly can\u2019t remember any questions.\u201d Those are the first words Stephen Colbert uttered after receiving a rather seductive kiss on the lips from Helen Mirren during her appearance on his show in 2016, proving there really is nothing like a dame.\n\n8. The Bee Gees walk out on Clive Anderson\n\nThe Bee Gees\u2018 1997 appearance on Clive Anderson Talks Back turned out to be much shorter than anticipated, when the brothers Gibb took umbrage at the talk show host\u2019s odd line of questioning. First Barry walks off, then Robin, until just Maurice is left on stage. Awks.\n\n7. Kanye West cries in front of Jay Leno\n\nKanye West has never been one to hide his emotions, but his 2009 appearance on The Jay Leno Show took the cake. Days after he\u2019d invaded the stage and interrupted Taylor Swift\u2018s acceptance speech at the VMA Awards, he appeared on the show looking contrite and visibly chastened \u2014 and then Jay brought up his recently deceased mother.\n\n6. Hugh Grant \u2018fesses up on Jay Leno\n\nHugh Grant was slated to appear as a guest on The Tonight Show in 1995 to promote new movie Nine Months. The trouble was, just two weeks before he\u2019d been caught in a rather, uh, compromising position on Sunset Boulevard, while he was still dating Elizabeth Hurley. Jay started with the question that was on everyone\u2019s mind: \u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d\n\n5. Mark Ruffalo challenges Jon Stewart\n\nThe Daily Show\u2018s erstwhile presenter Jon Stewart had many strengths, but watching his guests\u2019 films or reading their books before interviewing them was not one of them. During one of his final shows in 2015, Jon was surprised by Mark Ruffalo, who introduced a video collecting all his fake compliments together, before giving him a taste of his own medicine.\n\n4. Mark Wahlberg sits on Graham Norton\u2019s lap\n\nWhen Mark Wahlberg appeared on The Graham Norton Show in 2013, many assumed he\u2019d become a little too, uh, refreshed from the show\u2019s famously generous, um, beverage allowance for interviewees. As fellow guest Sarah Silverman gamely tried to finish her story about a childhood sleepover, he shifted along the sofa, got up, and eventually ended up on Graham\u2019s knee.\n\n3. Drew Barrymore flashes David Letterman\n\nSay what you like about Drew Barrymore, but she\u2019s good at gift giving. In a notorious 1995 Late Show appearance, she got on top of David Letterman\u2018s desk, danced for him, and flashed him in honor of his 48th birthday. Now that\u2019s a nice present.\n\n2. Nicole Kidman admits she once tried to hook up with Jimmy Fallon\n\nIt\u2019s not often Jimmy Fallon is rendered speechless, but when guest Nicole Kidman revealed in 2015 that he\u2019d passed up on the chance to date her, not only was he unable to speak, but he also went bright red and had to take a lie down.\n\n1. Tom Cruise jumps on Oprah\u2019s sofa\n\nNicole\u2019s ex Tom Cruise was positively giddy when he appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005. The reason? His burgeoning romance with Dawson\u2019s Creek star Katie Holmes, whom he eventually married and had a daughter with. The pair may have split since, but his happiness here is palpable \u2014 if a little disconcerting. Just watch Oprah\u2019s face from 09:33.\n\nWhich moment will you be watching over and over for years to come?", "images": ["http://www.bbcamerica.com/wp-content/plugins/bbca-app-banner/img/app-icon.png", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/anglo_2000x1125_katearnell_coffee_shoreditch-320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/BBCA_PlanetEarthII_320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Anglo_Logo-white.png", "http://www.bbcamerica.com/wp-content/plugins/amcn-mvpd-auth/assets/img/close.svg", "http://www.bbcamerica.com/wp-content/plugins/bbca-ie-advisory/assets/images/warning-exclamation-icon.png", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DEADWATER-FELL-150x150.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Renee-Zellweger-Joaquin-Phoenix-320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1280x720_alanrickman_alittlechaos-320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BBCA_LifeStory_320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BBCA_SWOP_320x180.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/grahamnortonreturn1-320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BBCA_KEs3_320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/she-walks-with-apes-150x150.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BBCA_TGNS_320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The_Graham_Norton_Show_S21_E07_Sneak_Peek_1_Nicole_Kidman_YouTubePreset_1920x1080_950393923855-e1522774637254-1600x720.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Liverpool-320x180.jpg", "https://cdn.amcnetworks.com/common/images/logotrains/AMCN_CorpHoriz9.2019_KO.svg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/BBCA_DWs12_320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BBCA_StarTrekDS9_320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The_Graham_Norton_Show_S21_E07_Sneak_Peek_1_Nicole_Kidman_YouTubePreset_1920x1080_950393923855.jpg", "http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/a73185d00e6e12b9537fda685d01a573?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Killing-Eve-PCP-150x150.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/anglo_2000x1125_sandraohgolden2-e1546978120990-320x180.jpg", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jodiecomerthirteen-320x180.jpg", "http://www.bbcamerica.com/wp-content/themes/bbca/assets/images/placeholders/transparent-320-180.png", "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alan-Rickman-320x180.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?cv=2.0&cj=1&c1=2&c2=18334160&c4=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbcamerica.com%2Fanglophenia%2F2017%2F10%2F10-times-a-talk-show-guest-left-their-host-speechless&c5=post&c6=none&c7=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbcamerica.com%2Fanglophenia%2F2017%2F10%2F10-times-a-talk-show-guest-left-their-host-speechless&c8=unknown&c9=", "http://www.bbcamerica.com/wp-content/themes/bbca/assets/images/placeholders/transparent-800-450.png"], "top_img": "https://images.amcnetworks.com/bbcamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The_Graham_Norton_Show_S21_E07_Sneak_Peek_1_Nicole_Kidman_YouTubePreset_1920x1080_950393923855.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kat Sommers"], "canonical_link": "http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2017/10/10-times-a-talk-show-guest-left-their-host-speechless", "title": "10 Times a Talk Show Guest Left Their Host Speechless", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1089249069", "description": "The one and only Graham Norton\u00a0returns to BBC America\u00a0(October 7), airing on Saturdays\u00a0at 10/9c,\u00a0a show famous for its relaxed chat and formidable line-ups.
