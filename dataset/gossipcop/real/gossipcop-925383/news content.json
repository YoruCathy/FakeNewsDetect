News: \u201cYou know, I would, if there was something to remove cellulite I would totally do it\u2026It doesn\u2019t exist though.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old explained that she \u201calways had cellulite\u201d and it continues to be an \u201cinsecurity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I walked down the Victoria\u2019s Secret runway, I always covered my butt. Always,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople used to think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s one of the top angels. That\u2019s why she has a long train or extra.\u2019 No, I was covering up my cellulite. Thank you Victoria\u2019s Secret for working with me, they knew why I was doing it.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Christopher Polk/Getty\n\nUltimately, Banks is hoping to encourage a more honest conversation about looks.\n\n\u201cFix it or flaunt it \u2014 I think women should be able to do both,\u201d she recently told PEOPLE. \u201cThere is a boundary line, either you\u2019re super natural or you live at the plastic surgeon. It\u2019s okay to hop back and forth over that line. You want a hair weave? Fine. You want permanent eyebrows? Fine. We as women need to stop judging.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1264&h=662&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Ftyra-banks.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Ftyra-banks.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1264&h=662&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F03%2Ftyra-banks.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Ward Trainor"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/tyra-banks-cosmetic-surgery-cellulite/", "title": "Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Bodies,Celebrity Bodies,Health,Health News,Plastic Surgery,Tyra Banks", "news_keywords": "Bodies,Celebrity Bodies,Health,Health News,Plastic Surgery,Tyra Banks", "description": "Tyra Banks opens up about having cellulite, and said she would get it removed if she could", "og": {"title": "Tyra Banks Reveals Cellulite Has Always Been an 'Insecurity'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/health/tyra-banks-cosmetic-surgery-cellulite/", "description": "Tyra Banks continues to get candid about cosmetic surgery.
