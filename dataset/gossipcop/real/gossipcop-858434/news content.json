As producers, for us the challenge is getting access to what we know is the real story. Lauren would forever say, \u2018I\u2019m not mentioning Heidi\u2019s name,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m not doing the show if she\u2019s on the show.\u2019 We were so sympathetic to that, but at the same time, you had Heidi wanting to make up with Lauren, still wanting to be a part of the show. And [you had] the sex tape rumors that Lauren didn\u2019t want to talk about, yet that was a betrayal that was so important and such a big elephant in the room that we just had to work with Lauren and say, \u2018Alright, so what are we going to do? We are going to have to access this somehow.\u2019 It\u2019s always a discussion\u2026 Lauren didn\u2019t want to confront Heidi. That was a catch-the-drama moment. As reality TV producers, we are hoping these two [will] meet up, you know? We were lucky enough to be there at the nightclub where we thought Heidi and Spencer might show up. We knew Lauren was there, and I think we knew they might show up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the specifics of [the sex tape rumors] just because that\u2019s their story, but from what we got on tape, it all just kind of came to a head at that nightclub. We were at Les Deux, [and] Heidi ended up showing up with Spencer, and [Lauren and Heidi] got into it outside. We weren\u2019t even aware that they were [fighting]. I mean, you can see at the beginning of that scene that we\u2019re scrambling to get our cameras there. There\u2019s even a shot of cameras, which we go to great lengths to avoid, but because it was happening in real time and it really went down, it erupted and happened so quickly that we just hustled to get it.\u201d Justin Bobby Brescia is the anti Spencer Pratt on The Hills. He\u2019s still a shitty reality TV boyfriend (please refer to the times Audrina caught him making out with other women while she was at the same club), but he has this seductive power that makes it easy to see why Audrina returns to him time after time. Justin Bobby speaks in ridiculous platitudes, like \u201cTruth and time tells all,\u201d which now sound like everything spewed on The Bachelor, but back then were unique in their somehow grounded inanity. It\u2019s hard to believe that he isn\u2019t putting on an act for cameras or behaving a certain way due to producer intervention. Both DiVello and Travis insist that it didn\u2019t take any special editing to depict Justin Bobby\u2019s essence to audiences, nor did much of his footage wind up on the cutting room floor.\u201cWe knew Audrina was dating Justin Bobby. All of season 2, we were thinking, \u2018Oh my gosh, Audrina has no story. All she does is go on dates with these guys, these funny characters.\u2019 But then we knew she had this boyfriend, and we weren\u2019t getting access to this story line. [We said to her], \u2018We know this is happening. We know you\u2019re dating this guy.\u2019 It took a lot of work, and I think it was [producer] Sara Mast, who came on in season 3; she was able to get Justin to trust us.\u201d\u201cJustin\u2019s such a genuinely nice person off camera to our crew and to all of us. He never gave us a problem. He was always very polite and thankful\u2026 I think Justin was a surprise each week, because he was like, \u2018I\u2019m starting to look like such an ass on the show. Can you not make me look so bad?\u2019 We weren\u2019t doing any of it. We kept explaining to him, \u2018You\u2019re doing this all to yourself. You\u2019re just seeing this on camera, but this is how you are.\u2019 I think he was such a great character, and he was such a natural on camera.\u201d\u201cIn Audrina and Justin\u2019s case, that was the relationship [in which] he was the bad [guy] who was really charming. She was always trying to break up with him or get away from him and his seductive power. Every time she would want to do it, if she broke up with him off camera, we would want her to at least have a conversation with him on camera so we could see that process, and inevitably they would get back together. So that turned out to be a long, drawn-out story line. What\u2019s interesting, too, [is that] you do a lot of shooting with cast members, and then some of the best stuff makes the cut, but with Justin, he was so unwilling to shoot. It was very hard. He would give us so little of his time, and I think that there aren\u2019t any shoots we did with Justin Bobby that didn\u2019t make it to air. I think every single scene we shot with him is on television.\u201d Lauren Conrad\u2019s mascara tears during her fight with Audrina in season 4 have become the GIF that keeps on GIF-fing from The Hills. In 2013, Conrad told Cosmopolitan that producers had slowed down her single tear to make it even more dramatic, and that, \u201cWhoops,\u201d she wasn\u2019t wearing waterproof mascara. The producers actually received letters asking why she didn\u2019t think to apply makeup that would withstand her tears.\u201cThe mascara thing just happened, and it became a thing. Most of the time when we were shooting, we would be sitting on their balcony, like six or seven of us crammed on this tiny little balcony. You\u2019re watching little monitors, and when you get that like black eyeliner roll, you\u2019re just like, \u2018Damn, this is so great,\u2019 because again, we don\u2019t have those [to-camera] confessionals \u2014 those OTF\u2019s we call them in the business \u2014 so we have no other device to tell stories other than something like a black mascara line running down her face. You clearly notice she\u2019s upset, and that\u2019s so far and few between. Other than the help of music, that\u2019s really all we have, so those were extremely helpful to us and they kind of became Lauren\u2019s hallmark\u2026 We got so many letters that were like, \u2018Why didn\u2019t she wear waterproof mascara?,\u2019 and I never could answer that. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cI think it might have been slowed down in the trailer, but not in the show. It would be a little strange in the episode when we\u2019re supposed to be in a kind of real-time scene for [the tear] to slow down. We would joke that we\u2019d have these scenes where Lauren is finally going to talk to Audrina, and we would swear that Lauren would wear the runny mascara where because of that, she would literally \u2018win\u2019 the scene. They\u2019re both crying, and Audrina\u2019s mascara wouldn\u2019t run, and Lauren\u2019s would. Therefore, our hearts would go out to Lauren. We thought, \u2018Does she do it on purpose? Does she wear the runny mascara because she wants to [win]?\u2019 I mean, I don\u2019t think so. She tries so hard not to cry. She used to say, \u2018Guys, I'm so tired of crying on the show.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a899ed2b6826791e2b8dd7b2901f3668.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/563283d1407bc6df5095935bc30a3daa.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/e0a9b3381492f1a143fc3d5144778c26.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94ef6f5acdd752723f8644874464d07a.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/94aebf5b5499306ab207a2b4f13e34a8.svg", "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/bff/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1580497/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg"], "top_img": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/bff/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1580497/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shannon Carlin", "Ariana Brockington", "Martha Sorren", "Ariana Romero", "Leah Marilla Thomas", "Ineye Komonibo", "Elena Nicolaou", "Kaitlin Reilly", "The Hills Reality Show Real Or Fake"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/05/108339/the-hills-mtv-drama-fake-reality", "title": "The Hills Producers Finally Tell Us What Was Real & What Was Fake", "meta_data": {"title": "The Hills Reality Show Real Or Fake", "description": "Was MTV's \"The Hills\" real or fake?
