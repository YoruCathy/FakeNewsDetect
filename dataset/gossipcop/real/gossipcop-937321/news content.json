The bride's veil was embroidered with flowers representing the countries of the Commonwealth, the California poppy, in honour of Meghan Markle's home state of California, and wintersweet, a flower that grows at Kensington Palace[2].\n\nPre-wedding speculation [ edit ]\n\nThe engagement of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry was announced on 27 November 2017, but the speculation about the bride's dress had started even earlier.[3] Some commentators suggested that Markle would not wear a white wedding dress as she had been married previously.[4] In December 2017, Israeli designer Inbal Dror was asked to submit designs for a wedding dress.[5][6] It was rumoured that Erdem and Ralph & Russo were also contenders.[1] By January 2018, British designer Stewart Parvin was the bookmakers' favourite.[7] Betting was suspended after Alexander McQueen attracted a large amount of wagers.[8] Markle had commented on wedding dress styles in 2016, as her character was getting married in Suits, saying that she preferred simple styles.[9] Meghan Markle, long a vocal admirer of the style of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, described Kennedy's wedding gown as \"everything goals\".[10][11] It was also reported that Markle herself would pay for the bridal gown, but she did not.[12][13]\n\nDesigner [ edit ]\n\nMarkle chose designer Waight Keller because she \"wanted to highlight the success of a leading British talent who has now served as the creative head of three globally influential fashion houses \u2014 Pringle of Scotland, Chlo\u00e9, and now Givenchy.\"[14]\n\nShe chose Keller to create her wedding dress due to the designer's \"elegant aesthetic\" and \"relaxed demeanour.\"[15] Waight Keller has been Givenchy's creative director since 2017.[16] The dress was made in Paris by \"a small team of ateliers\".[17] There was only five months to have the dress and the veil manufactured, and Waight Keller and Markle met for eight fittings.[18]\n\nMarkle and Waight Keller worked closely together to design the dress, which shows a \"timeless minimal elegance\", according to a Kensington Palace announcement.[19] The two contacted each other through discreet texts and phone calls, before and after nondisclosure agreements were signed, with Waight Keller unable to tell anyone that she had been selected to design the dress.[20]\n\nWaight Keller stated that the dress sought to \"convey modernity through sleek lines and sharp cuts\", while paying homage to the history of the Givenchy house.[21]\n\nDress details [ edit ]\n\nThe design of the simple white dress and the name of its maker were revealed only when the bride got out of the car and entered St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle for the wedding service. The dress was made of silk with three-quarter-length sleeves, an open boat neckline and a train with built-in triple silk organza underskirt.[19] Waight Keller helped develop a double bonded silk cady for the construction of the dress, which featured only six seams.[22] The dress was without lace or any other embellishments.[23] A piece of the blue dress from Markle\u2019s first date with Prince Harry was stitched into the bridal gown.[24]\n\nDress display [ edit ]\n\nVeil [ edit ]\n\nThe dress is augmented by a long 5 metre (16-ft) veil, hand-embroidered with a variety of flowers on its hem, and symbolic crops of wheat.[1][25] It was 3 metres wide.[26] The veil took longer to create than the dress itself,[27] and the embroiderers spent 500 hours on completing it, washing their hands every 30 minutes to make sure that the veil would remain immaculate until the wedding day.[28][29] Markle chose two favourite flowers \u2013 wintersweet (Chimonanthus praecox), which grows outside Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace, where she and Harry lived, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica), from where she was born \u2013 along with individual flowers representing the 53 countries of the Commonwealth,[1][25] reflecting the couple's interest in the work of the Commonwealth. The countries and flowers are:[25]\n\nAcacia pycnantha (Australia) (Australia)\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nElizabeth Emanuel, co-designer of Diana, Princess of Wales's wedding gown, thought that the gown made a \"really solid fashion statement\" and thought that Waight Keller \"should be pleased because Meghan looked absolutely stunning and beautiful.\"[30] Waight Keller stated that Prince Harry told her \"Oh my God. Thank you. She is absolutely magnificent.\"[31]\n\nQueen Elizabeth was reportedly surprised by the colour of the dress, since Markle was married before, and traditionally white wedding dress were worn by first-time brides only. [32]\n\nAustralian media have noted similarities between the dress and that worn by Mary Donaldson at her wedding to Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark.[33] It has also been compared to a Givenchy dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the film Funny Face.[34] Emilia Wickstead claimed that the dress was \"identical\" to one of her designs.[35] Unfavorable comparisons of Meghan's wedding dress in comparison to Catherine Middleton's wedding dress were proclaimed online and in the press, with Catherine's wedding dress being proclaimed as the \"victor\", as if there was an unspoken competition.[36] On the more positive but admittedly unironic and snarky end of the spectrum, critics also noted that Markle's dress seemed an attempt to mimic the late fashionista Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy.[10] Meghan Markle's wedding dress was compared to a formal dress Bessette-Kennedy once wore during her life, and her reception dress had similarities to Bessette-Kennedy's now-classic 1990s-era slip dress, although Meghan Markle's reception dress was a 1990s-style halter dress.[37]\n\nMarkle's wedding dress received mixed reviews from the public, some saying it was \"beautiful\" and \"stunning\" while others described it as \"boring\", \"baggy\", and \"ill fitting.\" Celebrity commentators, fashion editors, internet influencers, and Twitter commenters criticized the dress, calling it \"boring\", \"ill-fitting\", and \"too big\",[39] criticizing the cut, the shape,[40] and even the matte satin fabric, calling the finish \"dull\", criticizing a perceived lack of tailoring on the sleeves and waist,[41] and others declaring the overall effect as \"heavy\". Fashion experts noted that the silk cady fabric would have been difficult to move in if the dress had been more form-fitting.[42] Critics mocked the veil style and length, going so far as to create an Internet meme comparing it to a CVS receipt.[43]\n\nRobin Givhan of The Washington Post noted in her review of the gown that \"It was not a Hollywood red-carpet statement...it was not a Disney-princess fantasy...the dress was a backdrop; it was in service to the woman.\"[23] Desiree Cooper of the Detroit Free Press unfavorably compared the dress to a costume \"straight from The Handmaid's Tale\", but conceded, \"She could have been wearing a paper bag (which she nearly was) and it wouldn't have mattered an iota. That girl was just plain stunning.\"[44]\n\nLess than a week after the wedding, dresses based on Markle's were being sold.[45]\n\nThe dress, veil and tiara were exhibited by the Royal Collection Trust at Windsor Castle from October 2018 until February 2019, and then at Holyrood Palace from June 2019 to October 2019.[46][47]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Chaconia_UWI_2005b.jpg/220px-Chaconia_UWI_2005b.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Nymphaea_nouchali5.JPG/220px-Nymphaea_nouchali5.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/Coat_of_arms_of_Meghan%2C_Duchess_of_Sussex.svg/120px-Coat_of_arms_of_Meghan%2C_Duchess_of_Sussex.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/VandaMissJoaquim.jpg/220px-VandaMissJoaquim.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Guaiacum_officinale.jpg/220px-Guaiacum_officinale.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Acacia_pycnantha_Golden_Wattle.jpg/220px-Acacia_pycnantha_Golden_Wattle.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Markhamia_zanzibarica_-_flower_%288444618290%29.jpg/220px-Markhamia_zanzibarica_-_flower_%288444618290%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_dress_of_Meghan_Markle", "title": "Wedding dress of Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
