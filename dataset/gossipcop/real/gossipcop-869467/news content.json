The second time she went there was on a UNHCR field trip. Soon after that, in 2001, Angelina went back to Cambodia, this time with Billy Bob Thornton, who was her husband at the time, and that is when they saw Maddox Jolie-Pitt in an orphanage in Battambang. Soon afterward they started the adoption process. In the spring of 2002, the actress took Maddox, who was only 7 months old, from the orphanage.\n\nAngelina was thinking of adopting a child for a while but didn\u2019t want to take any action before she made sure what did Loung Ung think about the whole situation. She and Loung Ung became friends shortly after the actress came across her memoir First They Killed My Father, and she wanted to know what is Loung\u2019s opinion of her adopting a Cambodian baby.\n\n\u201cI asked her as a Cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, [to do that], or if that would be a nice thing,\u201d the actress shared with Vanity Fair\u2018s September issue. \u2018\u2019Loung, of course, was thrilled by the proposal.\n\n\u201cAngie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. I wanted her to adopt me. I was orphaned when I was 8 years old, and so I think, when you\u2019ve gone through experiences like that, there\u2019s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life,\u201d the author said.\n\nIf Loung had said otherwise, Angelina says it \u201cmight have changed\u201d her mind. As she was looking around the orphanage, she recalled: \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a connection with any of them. They said, \u2018There\u2019s one more baby.\u2019\u2019\u2019 As soon as she locked eyes with Maddox, she remembers \u2018\u2019I cried and cried.\u2019\u2019\n\nDuring that time, the actress was a resident in her house in Cambodia. In 2003, Angelina started a project that is now known as the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, which is concentrating primarily on the Asian country\u2019s environmental conservation, education, health, and infrastructure.\n\nIn the following years, Angelina found Brad Pitt, and together they have had five more children. Besides her acting career, Angelina finds happiness in working as a filmmaker and being a U.N. ambassador.\n\nMaddox, who is now a teenager, is going after his mother. He wanted, with Angelina\u2019s help, to let the whole world know Loung\u2019s story. \u201cHe was the one who said, \u2018It\u2019s time to do it,'\u201d she shared with the magazine. Maddox put faith in his mother to proceed with historical horror justice, and now its time for Angelina to put the faith in her son to help her during the filming. As soon as Maddox said he will take part in this, it came to her mind that he will be \u201cwatching horrors that his countrymen did to each other. [So] he had to be ready.\u201d\n\nPax Jolie-Pitt took part as a still photographer, during which time the rest of the Jolie-Pitt kids were on set every day.\n\nIt was time for Angelina and Loung to start planning the scenario, and Maddox helped them by looking into some of the drafts they made, analyzing them and then giving them his thoughts on how certain aspect of the scenario should develop. The actress gave it to Netflix, and Ted Sarandos, the chief creative officer, fell in love with it immediately. \u201cIn the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be. The film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the Khmer Rouge had killed all things beautiful, the color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life,\u201d Ted said. \u201cThat\u2019s what hooked me more than anything.\u201d\n\nAlongside with the Cambodian moviemaker, said that the only way she will proceed with the making of this movie is if the Cambodian residents don\u2019t have a problem with them doing it. \u201cIn a country like Cambodia, respect is very much elevated\u2014respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders,\u201d Loung shared with Vanity Fair. \u201cAngie walks in Cambodia with this respect.\u201d Cambodians gave their support, and the country administered the usage of certain locations and allowed them to use 500 soldiers from its corps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a poetic thing to say\u2014[this film] was made by the country,\u201d told the actress; around 3,500 citizens participated in the movie. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a person who was working on the movie who didn\u2019t have a personal connection. They weren\u2019t coming to do a job. They were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it\u2026It completed something for them.\u201d\n\nWhile in the making of the movie, everybody was looking at Maddox, they all knew who he and his mom were. \u201cIt was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,\u201d said Angelina, who didn\u2019t know how Maddox was going to take everything that was happening to him, and around him. She was exceptionally happy when one day Maddox asked for her permission to stay the night in his house with his friends. By \u2018his house\u2019 he meant the house Angelina bought back in 2002. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard him refer to it that way. You can\u2019t push it. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this great?\u2019 You just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.\u201d\n\nWhile Maddox was Angelina\u2019s fidus Achates on set, that is not what is happening back home, not since Angelina is going through a custody battle with Brad Pitt. \u201cI do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it\u2019s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them,\u201d she reveals to Vanity Fair. \u201cThey need to know that everything\u2019s going to be all right even when you\u2019re not sure it is.\u201d\n\nEven though her first boy has burdened himself with a lot more things than an average teenage boy has, with taking care of his younger siblings, he doesn\u2019t have that big of a desire to became an adult yet. \u201cI\u2019m conscious that the boys are teenage boys, and maybe they\u2019d rather be watching TV with their friends, and they\u2019ve been to Africa, and they may not be as excited as the little ones,\u201d she commented, regarding their travels. \u201cBut they don\u2019t really challenge me. They just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say, \u2018What are we going to do there?'\u201d And she takes them on all these amusing things they could do, for example, sandboarding. \u2018\u2019Either way, they know that it\u2019s important, and they know that mom thinks that it\u2019s going to be important when they\u2019re older.\u201d\n\nVia Eonline", "images": ["https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/angelina-jolie-first.jpg", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/angelina-jolie.jpg", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/penci2-holder.png", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-did-Maddox-become-Angelina-Jolie\u2019s-aide-scaled.jpg", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/angelina-jolie-aide.jpg", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Cool-Profile-Pictures-150x150.jpg", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/penci-holder.png", "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Frisky-Logo.png"], "top_img": "https://thefrisky.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/How-did-Maddox-become-Angelina-Jolie\u2019s-aide-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Wendy Stokes"], "canonical_link": "https://thefrisky.com/how-did-maddox-become-angelina-jolies-aide/", "title": "How did Maddox become Angelina Jolie\u2019s aide?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "During the making of the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Angelina visited Cambodia for the first time.
