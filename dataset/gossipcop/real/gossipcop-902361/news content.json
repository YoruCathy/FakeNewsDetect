You get warning signs, and then you realize that you are not a tank, as (my wife) Ali says. Edge has this thing that he says about me, that I look upon my body as an inconvenience.\"\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

It's one thing if you were talking about it in a place of record like Rolling Stone, but by the time it gets to your local tabloid it is just awful. It becomes the question that everyone is asking.\"\n\nIt was the latest scare for Bono, who told Rolling Stone that doctors wanted to biopsy him for throat cancer in 2000 but thankfully everything ended up being fine. He also broke his arm in a bicycle crash in 2014 that he called a \"comic tragedy.\"\n\n\"But the thing that shook me was that I didn't remember it,'' he said about the accident. \"That was the amnesia; I have no idea how it happened. That left me a little uneasy, but the other stuff has just finally nailed me. It was like, 'Can you take a hint?'''\n\nHis undisclosed health issue meshed with themes he was already exploring on the latest album.\n\n\"Well, strangely enough, mortality was going to be a subject anyway just because it is a subject not often covered,'' he said. \"And you can't write 'Songs of Experience' without writing about that. And I've had a couple of these shocks to the system, let's call them, in my life. Like my bike accident or my back injury. So it was always going to be the subject. I just didn't want to be such an expert in it.\"\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_mor_bono_141120.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/151207/tdy_mor_u2_151207.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306948/bono-today-tease-171228_0df9241ef00468fae1e5ecd9ec98b7a8.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/tdy_1_smith_life_121208.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306948/bono-today-tease-171228_0df9241ef00468fae1e5ecd9ec98b7a8.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/bono-reveals-he-almost-died-while-recording-latest-u2-album-t120579", "title": "Bono reveals he almost died while recording the latest U2 album", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/bono-reveals-he-almost-died-while-recording-latest-u2-album-t120579", "title": "Bono reveals he almost died while recording the latest U2 album", "description": "The U2 frontman revealed to Rolling Stone magazine that he had a near-death health scare during the making of \"Songs of Experience,\" which explores themes of mortality.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306948/bono-today-tease-171228_0df9241ef00468fae1e5ecd9ec98b7a8.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306948/bono-today-tease-171228_0df9241ef00468fae1e5ecd9ec98b7a8.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306948/bono-today-tease-171228_0df9241ef00468fae1e5ecd9ec98b7a8.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Bono reveals he almost died while recording the latest U2 album", "description": "The U2 frontman revealed to Rolling Stone magazine that he had a near-death health scare during the making of \"Songs of Experience,\" which explores themes of mortality.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Bono revealed to Rolling Stone that he had a near-death health scare during the making of U2's \"Songs of Experience,\" which explores themes of mortality.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_52/1306948/bono-today-tease-171228_0df9241ef00468fae1e5ecd9ec98b7a8.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514472000.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
