Which\u2026feels more like a trick than a treat.\n\nThe Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live-action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene-stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals\u2019 Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline.\n\nBut it seems like in addition to the cast, none of the original crew are involved in the remake either, despite Hocus Pocus co-writer Mick Garris excitedly discussing the prospect of a Hocus Pocus sequel earlier this week. Director Kenny Ortega \u2013 who has since helmed massive Disney Channel hits like High School Musical and Descendants \u2013 isn\u2019t involved either.\n\nThis news is a little disappointing for fans of the Sanderson Sisters, especially since the promise of a fully reunited Hocus Pocus 2 had been bouncing around Hollywood for decades \u2014 and as recently as yesterday!\n\nIt\u2019s taken so long that Midler\u2019s enthusiasm for the project waned, saying in 2015, \u201cAfter all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.\u201d But as of 2016, Parker was still on board to return should she be asked, saying, \u201cI would love [to do a sequel]. I think we\u2019ve all been fairly vocal about being very keen but that hasn\u2019t created any groundswell of movement.\u201d\n\nAnd in his recent interview in which he mentioned that the sequel would be made for TV, Garris said that he expected the three original actresses to return: \u201cIf they don\u2019t do that I think it would be a big mistake because all three of them are still so incredibly potent and powerful and great performers and who else can recreate those characters?\u201d\n\nAlas, it is not meant to be, and we\u2019ll likely see some younger and more Disney Channel-friendly stars step into those crooked, magical dancing shoes. Let\u2019s hope if they do a musical sequence, it can live up to Bette Midler\u2019s iconic rendition of \u201cI Put a Spell On You.\u201d", "images": ["https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/hocus-pocus-e1506611572143-700x340.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/siteimages/pm-comments.jpg", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/authors/43.jpg", "https://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?1648144&101", "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/hocus-pocus-e1506611572143.jpg"], "top_img": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/hocus-pocus-e1506611572143.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hoai-Tran Bui"], "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/hocus-pocus-remake-no-original-cast/", "title": "Hocus Pocus Remake in the Works Without the Original Cast", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"app_id": 254451208349115}, "description": "Disney Channel is developing a Hocus Pocus remake helmed by Kenny Ortega without original stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy.", "news_keywords": "bette midler, hocus pocus, kathy najimy, kenny ortega, mick garris, sarah-jessica-parker, scarlett lacey, movies, film, tv", "original-source": "https://www.slashfilm.com/hocus-pocus-remake-no-original-cast/", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hocus Pocus Remake in the Works Without the Original Cast", "description": "Disney Channel is developing a Hocus Pocus remake helmed by Kenny Ortega without original stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy.", "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/hocus-pocus-remake-no-original-cast/", "site_name": "/Film", "updated_time": "2017-09-28T08:55:55-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/hocus-pocus-e1506611572143.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/hocus-pocus-e1506611572143.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 679}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/slashfilm", "tag": "Scarlett Lacey", "section": "Remakes", "published_time": "2017-09-28T09:00:38-07:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-28T08:55:55-07:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Disney Channel is developing a Hocus Pocus remake helmed by Kenny Ortega without original stars Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy.", "title": "Hocus Pocus Remake in the Works Without the Original Cast", "site": "@slashfilm", "image": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/hocus-pocus-e1506611572143.jpg", "creator": "@slashfilm"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/cropped-ZZ46A5EC75-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaC-WDrvmUQ?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1506614438.0, "source": "https://www.slashfilm.com", "summary": ""}
