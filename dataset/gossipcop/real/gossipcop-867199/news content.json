Teen Mom OG stars Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra are celebrating 12 years together, and Baltierra commemorated the anniversary on Saturday, July 15, with a sweet Instagram post.\n\nAlongside a split collage featuring a recent photo and a throwback photo of the couple, the doting husband wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that today marks 12 years together with you @catelynnmtv, babe you literally are the greatest gift this live has given me! We were only kids when we fell in love, but we were kids who knew what we wanted out of life & who we wanted to get it with. Not a lot of people get that opportunity or blessing at such a young age. Even though we were so young, I wish I could go back as far as I could just to love you longer!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI am just so happy & honored to be your husband. I love you SO much!\u201d ending the post with the hashtags #HappyAnniversary, #12YearsStrong, #SoulMates and #MiddleSchoolSweetheart.\n\nThe pair found fame on MTV\u2019s Teen Mom in 2009 as high school students exploring an open adoption for their firstborn child, Carly, now 8. Through the years, viewers have witnessed the tight-knit couple experience many hardships, including Baltierra\u2019s father, Butch, being incarcerated, dealing with the emotional repercussions of giving up Carly for adoption and Lowell\u2019s battle with depression. Through it all, the couple remained strong support systems for one another and stayed committed to their relationship.\n\nLowell and Baltierra, who tied the knot in August 2015, also share 2-year-old daughter Novalee.", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-9cad66b9-bfb2-45bd-b9e0-c11765ce825d.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1428px%2C750px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-9cad66b9-bfb2-45bd-b9e0-c11765ce825d.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C1428px%2C802px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-9cad66b9-bfb2-45bd-b9e0-c11765ce825d.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1428px%2C750px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/catelynn-lowell-andtyler-baltierra-celebrate-12-year-anniversary-w492574/", "title": "Catelynn Lowell and Tyler Baltierra Celebrate 12-Year Anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Teen Mom OG\u2019s Tyler Baltierra posted a sweet tribute to wife Catelynn Lowell on Instagram to celebrate their 12-year anniversary \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Catelynn Lowell and\u00a0Tyler Baltierra Celebrate 12-Year Anniversary", "description": "Teen Mom OG\u2019s Tyler Baltierra posted a sweet tribute to wife Catelynn Lowell on Instagram to celebrate their 12-year anniversary \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/catelynn-lowell-andtyler-baltierra-celebrate-12-year-anniversary-w492574/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:50:59+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-9cad66b9-bfb2-45bd-b9e0-c11765ce825d.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1428px%2C750px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-9cad66b9-bfb2-45bd-b9e0-c11765ce825d.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1428px%2C750px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-07-16T15:34:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:50:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Teen Mom OG\u2019s Tyler Baltierra posted a sweet tribute to wife Catelynn Lowell on Instagram to celebrate their 12-year anniversary \u2014 read more", "title": "Catelynn Lowell and\u00a0Tyler Baltierra Celebrate 12-Year Anniversary", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-9cad66b9-bfb2-45bd-b9e0-c11765ce825d.jpg?crop=0px%2C57px%2C1428px%2C750px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500219240.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
