Constand had been contemplating a career change and Cosby, who had been mentoring her for months, said he wanted to discuss her plans.\n\nConstant said Cosby offered her something to help her relax that night.\n\nTrending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY.

And he put his hand out and I said, \u2018What are those?\u2019 And he said, \u2018They'll help you relax,'\" she recalled. \"And I said, \u2018Are they natural? Are they, like, a herbal remedy?\u2019 And he said, \u2018No, they're your friends. Just put them down.\u2019\u201d\n\nConstand said she ended up taking the pills because Cosby was the one who gave them to her.\n\n\u201cI trusted that they would maybe just help me feel a little more relaxed,\u201d she said.\n\nBut within half an hour, she started slurring her words and could no longer walk. As she testified in court, Constand said Cosby helped her to a couch and then assaulted her.\n\n\u201cMy mind is saying, \u2018Move your hands. Kick. Can you do anything? I don't want this. Why is this person doing this?\u2019 And me not being able to react in any specific way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I was limp. I was a limp noodle.\u201d\n\nConstand said she drifted in and out of consciousness.\n\n\u201cI was crying out inside, in my throat, in my mind, for this to stop. And I couldn't do anything,\u201d she said.\n\nAndrea Constand recalls details about the night she was assaulted by Cosby, while sitting next to her mother, Gianna Constand. Dateline NBC\n\nConstand awoke hours later, embarrassed by what had happened. She said Cosby gave her some breakfast \u2014 tea and a muffin \u2014 and Constand drove herself home. She took a shower, had a good cry and went on to work.\n\nBut she didn't tell anyone about the assault until a year later when she opened up to her mother. Constand said she feared that no one would believe what had happened to her \u2014 that the renowned actor, whose fame skyrocketed as Dr. Huxtable, the goofy pediatrician he portrayed on the popular sitcom, \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d had just assaulted her.\n\nMore than a dozen years later, Constand's claims were the basis of a criminal trial in 2017 ended with a hung jury. A retrial earlier this year resulted in a guilty verdict.\n\nCosby\u2019s attorneys, who declined NBC Dateline\u2019s request for an interview, said they plan to appeal the conviction.\n\nThe Dateline special, \"Bringing Down Bill Cosby: Andrea Constand Speaks,\u201d which also includes interviews with four other Cosby accusers, will air Friday.", "images":
