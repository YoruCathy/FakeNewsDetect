A helmer of giant blockbusters (like \u201cDeep Impact\u201d) and intimate dramas (like \u201cThe West Wing\u201d), Leder expertly transformed Damon Lindelof\u2019s wild words \u2014 \u201cHe has a lot of huevos,\u201d Leder said \u2014 into a unique vision that brought them to life like no one else could. And she did it with incredible insight into everything from what makes each character tick to what the audience needed to see in order to access those characters.\n\nSpeaking to Indiewire shortly before starting production on Season 3, Leder dug into how the series developed over its first two seasons, what she brought to the table as a director and why one big scene didn\u2019t make the cut for the brilliant \u2014 and nearly feature-length \u2014 finale.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018The Leftovers\u2019: An Oral History of the Finale\u2019s Karaoke Scene, from Damon Lindelof & Justin Theroux\n\nPopular on IndieWire\n\nYou came onboard \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d as a director and then you moved into the role of co-EP, correct?\n\nDamon asked me to come direct an episode, and I directed \u201cGladys\u201d how I thought the show should be. It was a brand new show, so \u2014 when I came on \u2014 I felt very close to it. I felt like I somehow understood it on a much deeper level. Then, while I was editing it, they asked me to stay. There were some growing pains in the beginnings of \u201cThe Leftovers.\u201d That\u2019s no secret.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about what changed and what didn\u2019t change between Season 1 and Season 2.\n\nMy perspective is that Damon and Tom Perrotta were really discovering what the show was about. You write a story and then your story starts to speak to you, and I believe that they had some growing pains in the beginning. \u201cWho\u2019s point of view is this?\u201d They started doing point of view stories, which they discovered were very successful \u2014 which it always is because it\u2019s from your character\u2019s point of view. You immediately, as an audience, get sucked in.\n\n\n\nI think that these point of views became stronger. The visual language \u2014 that maybe I brought to it, especially in the second season \u2014 helped to define what that was. The first season was very muted, very claustrophobic. And in the second season, we were moving to Austin, Texas, to this little town called Miracle. And I thought it was really important to expand the color palette, to find rich, deep colors to help express our characters\u2019 emotions. I also thought opening up the show visually was important: wider shots, showing the environment more because the environment was very pertinent to the story. So, that\u2019s what I think I helped bring to the show.\n\nIt\u2019s those details that elevate things in such a big way, but it\u2019s hard to just point to it and say, \u201cWell hey, this is what really helped it evolve.\u201d\n\nYou know, it ultimately is a show about family and what it\u2019s like to lose your family \u2014 to lose everything in your life that is special to you. And so, how do you visually explore that? How do you dive deep into someone\u2019s soul? We use close-ups very regularly. We get in there, but we also drop back to see the body language. For me, it\u2019s really important to really dig deep into a character\u2019s heart and try and find what\u2019s between those lines. What are those moments when the actor isn\u2019t speaking? What are those moments that help express and take you to the next level? It\u2019s a real privilege to work on this show because of Damon\u2019s writing, and his team of writers are an extraordinary group of thinkers who attach meaning to everything. I am on the continual search for the right look, the right light, the right environment to express that.\n\nDirecting the Season 2 premiere, did you feel it was important for you to be the one to set that tone when you\u2019re starting over, in a way, for Season 2?\n\nOh, absolutely. I mean, I started to open up the show at the end of the first season. I didn\u2019t want it to look like a whole new show. I just wanted it to breathe more, and I think we did that. We had the camera breathe more. We did bigger and bolder things. The most successful shots are ones that you feel and not ones that you are watching. It\u2019s better when you just feel them, and they speak to you.\n\nWhen you were getting ready to shoot or when you were on set shooting \u201cI Live Here Now,\u201d the Season 2 finale, were you at all considering that this could be the series finale? That this could be the end?\n\nYou know, I personally did not think it would be the end, but if it was the end, I felt it was very satisfactory in terms of a man\u2019s journey \u2014 Kevin\u2019s journey home to his family. And it certainly could\u2019ve been the end, but I never felt like it was resolved. Personally, I felt there were so many great moments in the finale \u2014 I\u2019m sounding egotistical, I don\u2019t mean to \u2014 and so many heartbreaking moments.\n\nThat one scene, for example, when Kevin is in the infirmary and John Murphy comes in and finds him and he looks at him and he goes, \u201cI killed you.\u201d And he goes, \u201cNope.\u201d That scene, to me, was so much about how we live and get through life. Oftentimes, we never know what\u2019s happening. We just don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get through life\u2019s challenges.\n\n\n\nThe finale is just packed full of vital scenes. There\u2019s nothing extraneous. There\u2019s no fat on it whatsoever. And yet, it\u2019s almost feature length. It\u2019s about 73 minutes long.\n\nAnd I shot it in 13 days.\n\nThat\u2019s crazy.\n\nIt was so challenging, but we were so organized and so in tune with each other. Just that bridge sequence \u2014 the charging of the bridge was obviously emotional, but it was a physically difficult scene to do. That was one of the most heartbreaking scenes to film with hundreds of extras around you, but was that really what is was about? The scene was about Nora saving her baby\u2019s life and holding onto the only thing that felt real to her. So, the scenes for me are always about what the characters are feeling and what they\u2019re expressing.\n\nDid you have to cut anything from the finale?\n\nThere was one scene we cut, but I knew we were going to cut it before I even shot the scene. [laughs] I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to tell you these things.\n\nI\u2019ll make sure HBO is cool with it. [They are.]\n\nAfter that scene in the infirmary, Kevin and John come out and we had a scene where people had tied the pillar to a truck and were trying to pull it down. And so basically, it was John and Kevin saving the pillar-man from fighting those guys \u2014 kind of saving him together.\n\nEmotionally, it just didn\u2019t feel right. I knew it on the page. They need to go from the infirmary to walking up the street [as they do at the end of the episode]. And that\u2019s how I presented it. I mean, I shot the scene, but I presented my cut to Damon without the fight scene in it. He saw the fight scene and he agreed. But rarely does that happen. We do not do reshoots. We never did a reshoot on this second season, and not much is ever cut.\n\nAnd you know, by the way, when we\u2019re filming, we are crying! We are so into it. I look next to me, to my director of photography, Michael Grady \u2014 who\u2019s this beautiful big burly guy, tough as can be \u2014 and he has tears coming out of his eyes. It\u2019s the most gratifying show to work on because it\u2019s really about something. It really is about something that matters. It\u2019s been a privilege to be a part of it.\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: Indiewire\u2019s Consider This campaign is an ongoing series meant to raise awareness for Emmy contenders our editorial staff and readership find compelling, fascinating and deserving.
