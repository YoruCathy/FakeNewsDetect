To mark the occasion, we\u2019ve rounded up some things about Selener that you might not have known about this talented triple threat. From her love for McDonald's to her forthcoming album, check out this list of all things Selena Gomez.\n\n1. Selena loves her thrills and chills.\n\nBy now, Selenators have surely seen Selena\u2019s ultra-creepy \u201cFetish\u201d music video, directed by friend and frequent collaborator Petra Collins. What you might not know is how deep her obsession with scary stuff goes. In their July 2017 interview with Dazed, Selena and Petra explained how the project came to be.\n\n\u201cDo you think people would be shocked to know that \u2018Fetish\u2019 came out of our discovery that we are both avid horror fans, which I didn\u2019t know about you?\u201d Petra asked Selena. \u201cUntil you came over in the middle of the day and found me in my living room sitting on a big teddy bear watching Chucky so casually and then you came and laid with me,\u201d Selena replied.\n\nLater, the two collaborated again on A Love Story, a nightmarish short film for IGTV. As Petra explained to Vanity Fair, \u201cI love The Exorcist and the things that come from inside you,\" Petra told the mag. \"The things that are a little more subtle, and things that you deal with from inwards, and I feel like it's something Selena and I both love talking about...that topic is sort of dear to us.\"\n\n2. She loves McDonald's. Like, a lot.\n\nSelena\u2019s love of fast food is incredibly well-documented. Famously, her assistant held her half-eaten cheeseburger while she walked the red carpet at the Jingle Bell Ball in 2015. But that\u2019s not the only time we\u2019ve seen homegirl throw down for a Micky D's and a Happy Meal. Before her performance at the 2015 Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show, she ate McDonald\u2019s backstage. And in the middle of her 2016 appearance on Carpool Karaoke with Late Late Show host James Corden, she ordered a No. 7 and a medium Coca-Cola off the drive-thru menu. It turns out that her lyrics for \"Love You like a Love Song\" were on the cups at the time. Some of Selena's other favorite foods? Pickles, Hot Cheetos, and whole lemons (sometimes with salt).\n\n3. Her first kiss happened on screen with Dylan Sprouse.\n\nDuring a guest appearance on the second season of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Selena kissed Dylan in front of a live studio audience.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b54952f2337b62062e1df0f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b54952ae4fe7304e7107d9f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-header.a32c5f649a1140996fd12f4a5ee1d0638ce23dc6.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b54952f2337b62062e1df0f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hanna Lustig", "Hanna Lusti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-things-you-didnt-know", "title": "11 Selena Gomez Facts You Might Not Have Known", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Hanna Lustig", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "In celebration of Selena Gomez's birthday on July 22, here are 11 things about the triple threat you might not have known.", "id": "5b537e9bca647a58f07317a7", "keywords": "culture,selena gomez", "news_keywords": "culture,selena gomez", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b537e9bca647a58f07317a7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In celebration of Selena Gomez's birthday on July 22, here are 11 things about the triple threat you might not have known.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b549527791e581de9a00d58/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b549527791e581de9a00d58/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "This is how we're celebrating Selena's birthday.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b54952f2337b62062e1df0f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "11 Things About Selena Gomez You Might Not Have Known", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-things-you-didnt-know"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "This is how we're celebrating Selena's birthday.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b54952f2337b62062e1df0f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "11 Things About Selena Gomez You Might Not Have Known"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
