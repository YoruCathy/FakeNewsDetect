In addition to the song, Ferrell gave the graduating students sound advice: \u201cI just told them to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground and reach for the stars \u2014 which I read on the back of a cereal box.\u201d\n\nThe decision may have been spawned in part by nerves, after all Ferrell isn\u2019t typically asked to preside over serious situations. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been put in that position before because usually I just make fun of things,\u201d Ferrell said, who graduated from USC in 1990 with a degree in sports information. \u201cA program so difficult, so arduous, that they discontinued the major eight years after I left,\u201d he said during the commencement address where he received an honorary USC doctorate, thus requiring that his wife and children address him as \u201cDr. Ferrell.\u201d \u201cThere will be no exceptions,\u201d he joked, noting, \u201cI think my fellow doctorates would agree, based on our achievements, we are all on equal footing.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.
