(Kylie was probably too busy having a baby to make it to the photoshoot, TBH.)\n\n\n\nRevolve\n\nSHOP NOW Classic Bikini Top, KENDALL + KYLIE X REVOLVE, $78\n\nSHOP NOW Classic Bikini Bottom, KENDALL + KYLIE X REVOLVE, $68\n\nIn addition to bikinis, the line also includes a rainbow stripe cutout one piece, classic one-pieces, and cover-ups and sarongs in matching prints.\n\n\n\nSHOP NOW Cutout One Piece, KENDALL + KYLIE X REVOLVE, $148\n\nThe sisters\u2019 new swimwear collection, available now on revolve.com, starts at $58 for bikini bottoms and goes up to $148 for a one-piece swimsuit.\n\nIf spending more than a $100 on a swimsuit seems a bit extreme to you, there\u2019s some good news. Several pieces from Kendall and Kylie\u2019s original swimwear collection with Revolve are still on sale, including the red one-piece seen here, which is marked down to $45 from $125 and is still available in size small and large.\n\nSHOP NOW USA One Piece, KENDALL + KYLIE X REVOLVE, $45", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lyndsey Matthews", "Freelance Writer", "Lyndsey Matthews Is The Destination News Editor For Afar", "Previously She Was A Lifestyle Editor Across All Of Hearst Digital Media'S Brands", "A Digital Editor At Martha Stewart Weddings", "Travel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a19719072/kendall-kylie-jenner-revolve-swimwear/", "title": "Kendall and Kylie Jenner\u2019s Sexy New Swimwear Collection Is Here", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Kendall and Kylie Jenner\u2019s Sexy New Swimwear Collection Is Here", "description": "Kendall looks like a total Baywatch babe in the ad campaign.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a19719072/kendall-kylie-jenner-revolve-swimwear/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-05-07 05:36:50", "published_time": "2018-04-09 03:52:00", "section": "Style", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Kendall and Kylie Jenner Release New Swimwear Line for 2018", "description": "Kendall and Kylie Jenner just launched their second swimwear collection with online retailer Revolve.", "keywords": "Kendall + Kylie, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Swimsuits, Swimwear", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Beauty & Style,style-beauty,fashion,Kendall + Kylie,Kylie Jenner,Kendall Jenner,swimsuits,Swimwear", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-09T15:52:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kendall-kylie-x-revolve-1523287443.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kendall and Kylie Jenner\u2019s Sexy New Swimwear Collection Is Here", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523217120.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
