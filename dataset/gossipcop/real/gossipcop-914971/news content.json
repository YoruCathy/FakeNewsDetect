She even added a pair of black gloves to her look. Wintour had on her signature shades and a floral dress as she sat next to the monarch.\n\nImage zoom Queen Elizabeth and Anna Wintour Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP\n\nThe pair were seen chatting before the Richard Quinn show began. And in true royal form, the Queen even received a comfy cushion to sit on!\n\nImage zoom Queen Elizabeth and Anna Wintour Mike Marsland/WireImage\n\nImage zoom Mike Marsland/WireImage\n\nThe monarch was on hand to present the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design. The special award, initiated in recognition of the role the fashion industry plays in society and diplomacy, will be awarded annually to an emerging British fashion designer who shows exceptional talent and originality, while demonstrating value to the community and/or strong sustainable policies, according to the palace.\n\nImage zoom Tristan Fewings/BFC/Getty\n\nImage zoom Queen Elizabeth Neil Mockford/GC Images\n\nLondon-born designer Richard Quinn was the very first recipient of the award. The Queen attended his show before presenting him with the award in a special ceremony. Quinn established his namesake label in 2016 after graduating from the Fashion MA course at Central Saint Martins.\n\nImage zoom Mike Marsland/WireImage\n\nImage zoom Tristan Fewings/BFC/Getty\n\nTaking to the catwalk to address the audience, the Queen said: \u201cIt is a great pleasure to be here at London Fashion Week today. From the tweed of the Hebrides to Nottingham lace, and of course Carnaby Street, our fashion industry has been renowned for outstanding craftsmanship for many years, and continues to produce world-class textiles and cutting edge, practical designs.\n\n\u201cAs a tribute to the industry, and as my legacy to all those who have contributed to British fashion, I would like to present this award for new, young talent. I would like to thank the British Fashion Council for selecting the first winner \u2013 Richard Quinn.\u201d\n\nThe Queen\u2019s visit to the London Fashion Week headquarters had been kept secret and her low-key arrival caused a ripple of astonishment among attendees.\n\nShe began by viewing a millinery exhibition curated by the legendary Stephen Jones. She then made a beeline for Harvy Santos, a \u201cnew wave\u201d hat maker who had created a crown out of leather and studs based on Queen Victoria\u2019s traveling crown.\n\nImage zoom Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP\n\nHe said he was shaking as he met the monarch and said afterwards: \u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe it. I took my hat off and barely knew what to say. But she was just lovely.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Queen Elizabeth Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP\n\nPhilippine-born Santos, a former ballet dancer continued: \u201cShe was just lovely and so softly spoken. She was interested in my crown and what inspired me. I also told her about my former career as a dancer and she joked, \u2018That must have been quite a leap,\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was the only Queen here, but I have been dethroned today! I couldn\u2019t have been happier about it,\u201d he added.\n\nImage zoom Queen Elizabeth Yui Mok/PA Wire/AP\n\nQueen Elizabeth isn\u2019t the only royal supporting London Fashion Week.
