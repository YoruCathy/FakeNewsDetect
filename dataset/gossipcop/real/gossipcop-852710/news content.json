Jarrett is black. The tweet in late May read: \u201cmuslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\u201d\n\nABC canceled her show a day later, and President Channing Dungey called her tweet \u201cabhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\u201d Trump appeared to reference the cancellation days later, calling it a \u201cdouble standard\u201d for conservatives after comedian Samantha Bee made a vulgar comment about his daughter, Ivanka.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBarr later apologized and blamed Ambien for her tweets. Her representative did not return a request for comment.\n\nBut months after the fallout, Goodman revealed a shock that still lingers. The popular show revitalized legendary characters dormant for two decades, and nearly as quickly as it came back, the show ended.\n\n\u201cI was surprised. I\u2019ll put it this way, I was surprised at the response,\u201d he told the Sunday Times. \u201cAnd that\u2019s probably all I should say about it.\u201d\n\nHe paused for a long moment and thought about all that came before. \u201cI know, I know, for a fact that she\u2019s not a racist,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new show, \u201cThe Conners,\u201d will premiere in October. It will feature the core Conner family, but Barr will have no financial or creative ties to the series, ABC has said.\n\nAD\n\nIt may be difficult for Barr to see her characters on screen without her control. \u201cRoseanne\u201d was one of the biggest shows of the 1990s, and it brought Barr commercial and critical acclaim with her depiction of a struggling working-class family.\n\nAD\n\nIn the closing minutes of the series finale, after she revealed that Dan had died and that she wielded the power of the characters\u2019 fate like a god, Roseanne wrote in her book that love is stronger than hate. But she also wrote more prescient words: \u201cI learned that no one can stop me but me.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/72f3d4da-482a-43b3-a5d7-2a8a93819de7.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2ND3BJV66MZURHPJTN3UNKGLFY.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xI8AMPFNZYUAWCPdK7lw9nyAFhA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTAUMRTJFA3RBPTHGSPMQLEDCM.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xI8AMPFNZYUAWCPdK7lw9nyAFhA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTAUMRTJFA3RBPTHGSPMQLEDCM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/08/28/john-goodman-reveals-roseanne-will-be-killed-off-in-the-conners-spinoff/", "title": "John Goodman reveals Roseanne will be killed off in \u2018The Conners\u2019 spinoff", "meta_data": {"description": "\"The Conners\u201d will debut in October with John Goodman and the original cast, but Roseanne will not be among them.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/08/28/john-goodman-reveals-roseanne-will-be-killed-off-in-the-conners-spinoff/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/xI8AMPFNZYUAWCPdK7lw9nyAFhA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PTAUMRTJFA3RBPTHGSPMQLEDCM.jpg", "title": "John Goodman reveals Roseanne will be killed off in \u2018The Conners\u2019 spinoff", "description": "\"The Conners\u201d will debut in October with John Goodman and the original cast, but Roseanne will not be among them."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "John Goodman reveals Roseanne will be killed off in \u2018The Conners\u2019 spinoff", "description": "\"The Conners\u201d will debut in October with John Goodman and the original cast, but Roseanne will not be among them."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-08-28T15:23:17.376Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535385600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
