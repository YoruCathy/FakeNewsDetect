We all felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!\u201d\n\nOne of the two new songs that resulted, called I Still Have Faith in You, will feature in a TV special to air in December.\n\nThe statement concluded: \u201cWe may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.\u201d\n\nAbba\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus revealed details of the band\u2019s forthcoming project in Brussels earlier this week. The centrepiece is the two-hour TV show co-produced by NBC and the BBC, which will see the band perform as computer-generated avatars. Ulvaeus said the band had been digitally scanned and \u201cde-aged\u201d to look like they did in 1979, when they performed their third and final tour.\n\nThe avatars are then set to tour the world from next year.\n\nAbba formed in Stockholm in 1972. They comprised two couples: Ulvaeus and Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog; and Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, all of whom had enjoyed musical careers in Sweden. The group burst on to the international stage after winning the Eurovision song contest in Brighton in 1974 with their song Waterloo.\n\nFrom the mid-70s until they split, Abba built up a formidable arsenal of global hits including Knowing Me, Knowing You, Take a Chance on Me, Dancing Queen and The Name of the Game \u2013 all of which reached No 1 in the UK.\n\nF\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad were the lead singers; Andersson and Ulvaeus composed the songs. Never less than impeccably produced and performed, Abba\u2019s records were critically disdained at the time, but their popularity has endured. Their 1992 compilation Abba Gold has sold 30m copies \u2013 more than 5m of those in the Britain \u2013 and spent 833 weeks in the UK album charts.\n\nTheir jukebox musical Mamma Mia! debuted in the West End in 1999 and is still running both in London and worldwide; its website claims that it has been seen by 60 million people in 440 cities.\n\nThe stage show was adapted into a film in 2008, which grossed $615m (\u00a3447m) worldwide. A sequel, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, will be released in June. The actor Lily James \u2013 who is set to appear alongside the cast of the first film including Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth \u2013 told the BBC last week: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of songs in there, lots of new ones. Lots of ones, actually, that weren\u2019t in my repertoire of Abba and I think they\u2019re going to be huge hits again, and reawaken the love of Abba.\u201d\n\nAbba\u2019s split in 1983 followed the divorces of both couples. Ulvaeus and Andersson went on to write two musicals, including Chess \u2013 a revival by the English National Opera opens on Friday in London \u2013 before largely devoting themselves to Abba\u2019s legacy. F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad have kept much lower profiles, though F\u00e4ltskog \u2013 long claimed to be a recluse \u2013 returned to pop music with an album, A, which was released in 2013.\n\nThe group have long held out against lucrative offers to reform \u2013 they were reported to have been offered $1bn to play a concert in 2000. In 2014, Ulvaeus told Billboard: \u201cyou will never see us on stage again \u2026 we don\u2019t need the money, for one thing.\u201d\n\nPeter Robinson, editor of Popjustice, described the announcement as \u201cthe biggest pop news of the 21st century. Most fans grudgingly admired Abba\u2019s refusal to record new music, but I think we all sometimes daydreamed about the band possibly, maybe, one day having a rethink at the right time, on the right terms and for the right reasons, which seems to be what\u2019s happened here.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a pop miracle.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f30f0efb699454a1c07bc7678f9c8451ba18565/206_296_5265_3158/master/5265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6d51594f87deab7fb0c79919b7f1fee6", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Abba%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CPop+and+rock%2CMamma+Mia%21+Here+We+Go+Again", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pv.gif", "https://phar.gu-web.net/count/pvg.gif", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f30f0efb699454a1c07bc7678f9c8451ba18565/206_296_5265_3158/master/5265.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=47ba003d2b538bac8c1db58107ff5976"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f30f0efb699454a1c07bc7678f9c8451ba18565/206_296_5265_3158/master/5265.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6d51594f87deab7fb0c79919b7f1fee6", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Needham"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/27/abba-announce-first-new-songs-for-35-years", "title": "Abba announce first new songs for 35 years", "meta_data": {"description": "Swedish four-piece take to Instagram to announce two releases that will form part of an \u2018avatar tour project\u2019", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "application-name": "The Guardian", "msapplication-TileColor": "#052962", "theme-color": "#052962", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/023dafadbf5ef53e0865e4baaaa32b3b/windows_tile_144_b.png", "author": "Alex Needham", "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f30f0efb699454a1c07bc7678f9c8451ba18565/206_296_5265_3158/master/5265.jpg?width=620&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=e04cafadcfac14c2b0b5032742fd6859", "keywords": "Abba,Music,Culture,Pop and rock,Mamma Mia!
