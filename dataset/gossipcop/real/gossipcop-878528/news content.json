The professional skateboarder\u2019s parents, April and Phil Margera, also guest-starred on the episode to reflect on their son\u2019s ordeal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on camera a lot, people have a lot to say,\u201d April noted. \u201cHe always wanted to have this very slim, slim look. A lot of it happened when he became friends with Ville Valo.\u201d\n\nThe Jackass actor later hinted that his friendship with the HIM rocker, 40, may have affected his health and contributed to the development of his disease.\n\n\u201cI remember when me and Ville Valo were out in London and he woke up at noon, opened up the mini bar and cracked open a beer. That was the first time I was introduced to day drinking,\u201d Margera recalled. Added April, \u201cVille drank a lot\u2026 He\u2019s the loveliest man ever, but he never ate. He just drank. I think Bam started sipping on a beer because he liked the way it looked.\u201d\n\nThe Viva La Bam alum\u2019s mother explained that her son\u2019s drinking precipitated his bulimic tendencies. \u201cWe would go out for dinner and he would immediately excuse himself to go to the bathroom,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Are you throwing up?\u2019 And he says, \u2018Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I throw up and that way I\u2019m not gonna get fat.\u2019\u201d\n\nMargera blamed the limelight for his self-harming actions. \u201cI didn\u2019t officially start drinking until maybe 24 or 25,\u201d he revealed. \u201cThen the rockstar life and drinking spun out of control.\u201d\n\nApril also shared that, although her son is now recovered and lives in Spain with his pregnant wife, Nicole Boyd, his situation has made a long-lasting impact on her. \u201cIt really hurts me when people make comments,\u201d she remarked. \u201c\u2018You look like you gained some weight there.\u2019 I don\u2019t respond but I feel like saying, \u2018He was drinking alcohol and he was bulimic. And that\u2019s why he was thin.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bam-margera-02-7186d6f0-8fc8-41fe-915c-d383555dda01.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bam-margera-ebc30f70-05b9-4924-aba0-e10499150627.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C643px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bam-margera-ebc30f70-05b9-4924-aba0-e10499150627.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C643px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bam-margera-reveals-struggle-with-bulimia-w502010/", "title": "Bam Margera Reveals Struggle With Bulimia", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Bam Margera opened up about his battle with an eating disorder in the early 2000s \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bam Margera Reveals His Struggle With Bulimia", "description": "Bam Margera opened up about his battle with an eating disorder in the early 2000s \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bam-margera-reveals-struggle-with-bulimia-w502010/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:34:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bam-margera-ebc30f70-05b9-4924-aba0-e10499150627.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C643px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bam-margera-ebc30f70-05b9-4924-aba0-e10499150627.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C643px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-09-08T20:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:34:02+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bam Margera opened up about his battle with an eating disorder in the early 2000s \u2014 find out more", "title": "Bam Margera Reveals His Struggle With Bulimia", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bam-margera-ebc30f70-05b9-4924-aba0-e10499150627.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1223px%2C643px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504901280.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
