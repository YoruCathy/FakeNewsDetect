LOLz!\n\nTo be clear, the American Idol alum confirmed she and Brandon and \u201cdone having kids!\u201d\n\nIn a more sentimental moment, the Stronger artist added:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re great, though. They say something and you\u2019re like, \u2018Damn.\u2019 They\u2019ll call you out. And they teach me. I know it sounds really silly, but kids teach you to be a better human because they\u2019re watching every moment. Not only me at home, but me sitting here with y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nAdding:\n\n\u201cI think when you\u2019re younger and, especially in this kind of industry where everybody\u2019s always applauding you or even if they\u2019re talking bad or good, they\u2019re still talking about you. It\u2019s so hard to not drink your punch, and I think a lot of people fall prey to that \u2026 I think that [my children] taught me to just look around me and notice the things that are really important, even if it\u2019s just hanging with them, playing on their little piano or taking the time. Because I think in life, as adults, it\u2019s very hard for us to be still. It\u2019s very hard for us to enjoy the moment.\u201d\n\nAs for what she wants to teach her kids, Kelly explained:\n\n\u201cI hope with our two girls and our two boys, they see their parents as successful, loving and respectful people because that\u2019s what we want for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all you can hope for!\n\n[Image via Instagram.]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20118%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20111%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20244%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20112%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20188%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-hilton-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20225%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20113%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20352%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20538%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20162%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20322%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20275%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20163%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20449%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20466%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2083%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20101%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20311%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg"], "top_img": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/kelly-clarkson-wine-raising-four-children/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Jokes \u2018Wine Is Necessary\u2019 When Raising Four Kids!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "8jhNuv6mCy23T6U62W5nXupmY4X1fumTlO3sRfrF0Oc", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Jokes 'Wine Is Necessary' When Raising Four Kids! - Perez Hilton", "description": "We can always count on Kelly Clarkson to tell it like it is.
