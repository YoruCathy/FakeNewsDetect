Their demanding work schedules were reportedly the cause of the split, although neither party confirmed what happened. Flash-forward a few years + a major rebound and they\u2019re back together! Here\u2019s how it all went down.\n\n\n\nGiphy\n\nApril 2015\n\nBella and Abel become more than friends after hanging out at Coachella, where he performed. A source tells E! News they were \u201cflirting lots\u201d while a second source reveals Coachella is \u201cwhere they really clicked.\u201d Us Weekly reveals that the new couple had gone on double dates with Gigi and (then-boyfriend) Cody Simpson as well as Miley Cyrus and Patrick Schwarzenegger (MEMORIES!).\n\nMay 2015\n\nThe new couple remains quiet about their relationship but fans go wild over this tweet:\n\ndon't go around breaking young girls' hearts. \u2014 The Weeknd (@theweeknd) May 2, 2015\n\nJuly 2015\n\nAbel is featured in the New York Times, and when asked if he\u2019s in love, offers this: \u201cI don\u2019t know, to be honest with you. I don\u2019t think so. Maybe. It\u2019s no, it\u2019s yes, it\u2019s maybe.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\nAugust 2015\n\nBella and Gigi go on another double date with their beaus Abel and Joe Jonas, respectively, hanging out at L.A. hotspot The Nice Guy. According to People, Taylor Swift is also there.\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nBella and Abel are spotted at New York Fashion Week holding hands.\n\nGetty\n\nOctober 2015\n\nAbel buys Bella a puppy named Hendrix for her 19th birthday.\n\nThey spend her birthday weekend in New York City, along with Gigi and Joe Jonas.\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Abel says he first approached Bella for work and work only. \u201cI actually asked her to be on the artwork for Beauty Behind the Madness. My motive was literally to work with her.\u201d Bella initially declined, leading him to suggest a \u201cface-to-face\u201d meetup. In the RS interview, he points out that their relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked if it happened two years ago (\u201cshe couldn\u2019t\u201d), possibly alluding to the fact that she would have been 16 at the time. \u201cBut if I\u2019d met someone two years ago, I probably would\u2019ve fucked it up. But I\u2019m more\u2014how do I say it?\u2014clear-thinking now.\u201d\n\nDecember 2015\n\nBella plays a femme fatale in Abel\u2019s new video for \u201cIn the Night.\u201d There\u2019s a beautiful shot of them riding on a motorcycle together.\n\n\n\nBefore the end of the year, E! News reports that the couple is taking a break due to their busy schedules. \u201cThey are still in each other\u2019s lives though, just not in the same exclusive capacity,\u201d says one source. They spend Christmas apart.\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nBella and Abel make their red carpet debut as a couple at the 58th Grammy Awards.\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nMarch 2016\n\nAbel supports Bella at the Daily Front Row\u2019s Fashion Los Angeles Awards. They\u2019re too cute for words.\n\nGetty\n\nMay 2016\n\nBella and Abel attend the 2016 Met Gala looking like a million bucks in his-and-hers Givenchy.\n\nGetty\n\nAugust 2016\n\nBella opens up about her boyfriend to Glamour magazine, saying that she often thinks about him when she\u2019s modeling and that when they\u2019re together, he\u2019s \u201cAbel\u201d and not his stage name. \u201cI\u2019m proud of The Weeknd and the music he makes, but I really love Abel.\u201d\n\nShe also reveals why they decided to make their couple debut at the Grammys. \u201cIt was a big night for him. He has worked so hard, and he did so well that night. As a girlfriend, I wanted to be there to support him. Seeing him so happy when he won a Grammy made me so happy.\u201d (He was nominated for seven and won two that night).\n\nGetty\n\nOctober 2016\n\nBella and Abel fly off to Tokyo and have the Instagram vacation of your dreams.\n\nUpon their return, the couple celebrate Bella\u2019s 20th birthday. No puppy this time though.\n\nNovember 2016\n\nPeople reports on November 10 that Bella and Abel have split. One source says their schedules, once again, are to blame and that Abel is \u201cfocusing on finishing and promoting his album\u2026They still have a great deal of love for one another and will remain friends.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, The Weeknd\u2019s new album Starboy is released. Bella and Abel reunite onstage at the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show, with her making her VS debut and him performing on the show for the second year in a row. \u201cThere is no awkwardness,\u201d she tells E! News before hitting the stage. \u201cHe is my best friend, and I am excited because I am walking during his performance.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\nBella gives a shout-out to her ex the following day on Instagram, writing, \u201cThank you @theweeknd for being the best and most incredible performer on the planet. You KILLED it, as always.\u201d No awkward feelings here. Nope.\n\n\n\nJanuary, 2017\n\nTMZ publishes photos of Selena Gomez and Abel making out by a dumpster in Santa Monica. Bella quietly unfollows Selena on Instagram, but everyone notices.\n\nOn January 12, photographer Mert Alas posts\u2014and quickly deletes\u2014a sultry pic of Selena wearing nothing but gold hoops, a matching thong, and a towel. The original photo also included a tag for The Weeknd along with a heart emoji.\n\nThe next day, Bella shares a sexy sideboob selfie (say that three times) on Instagram. Make of this what you will\u2026\n\n\n\nPeople reports that Bella is \u201churt and pissed\u201d that her ex has moved on with Selena. This is according to a \u201csource close to the supermodel,\u201d so do read it with a grain of salt. In the same vein, a \u201cHadid pal\u201d tells Us Weekly that Bella has reached out to Abel \u201ca few times and told him Selena is using him,\u201d as it\u2019s believed the rumored new couple are working on new music together. Meanwhile, this appears on Bella\u2019s Instagram.\n\n\n\nOctober 2017\n\nWhile appearing on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Bella\u2019s mom Yolanda reveals that her daughter no longer cares that The Weeknd is dating Selena Gomez. \u201cNot anymore, I think,\u201d she says.\n\nNovember 2017\n\nAbel is photographed leaving Bella\u2019s apartment in New York City, sparking rumors that the two are friendly again. The sighting comes weeks after news broke that Abel and Selena\u2019s relationship had come to an end and that she might have rekindled things with Justin Bieber.\n\nMarch 2018\n\nThe Weeknd releases a new EP, My Dear Melancholy, which features \u201cCall Out My Name,\u201d a song that\u2019s definitely, maybe about ex-girlfriend Selena. \u201cWasted Times,\u201d which is also on the EP, also raises eyebrows thanks to the lyric, \u201cYou were equestrian, so ride it like a champion.\u201d You know who\u2019s had a pretty solid equestrian career? Bella.\n\nApril 2018\n\nThe Weeknd and Bella cause a stir after reportedly kissing at Coachella. Per Us Weekly, the former couple \u201cwere completely all over each other\u201d during Travis Scott\u2019s set at Poppy nightclub\u2019s Coachella pop-up, where they were \u201ccanoodling and being affectionate as she sat on his lap.\u201d The location of this reported hookup is an interesting one, considering it\u2019s where Selena and Abel made their Instagram debut approximately one year earlier.\n\nKYLE GRILLOT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBella is quick to shut down the rumor, however, taking to Instagram to clear the air. Responding to an E! caption, the model writes, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d along with a shrugging emoji and detective emoji.\n\nScreenshot\n\nMay 2018\n\nThe Weeknd and Bella are spotted kissing\u2014for real this time, because there\u2019s photographic evidence\u2014at the Magnum x Alexander Wang VIP Party in Cannes. \u201cBella kept coming over and whispering in his ear and kissing his neck,\u201d according to one Daily Mail source. \u201cThey certainly weren\u2019t keeping it a secret. They were standing out on the beach in front of hundreds of people.\u201d\n\nJune 2018\n\nTo further stir the Bella x Weeknd love pot, the rumored on-again couple are spotted on a date in Paris. And there\u2019s Instagram proof! Here\u2019s Bella saying, \u201cYou\u2019re taking a video of the bubble\u201d over Abel\u2019s Insta video of um, the bubble.\n\nHere\u2019s Bella hanging out at a second restaurant that same day with roses and jars of tomato sauce (click through for the tomato sauce photo):\n\nAnd here\u2019s an Instagram Story shared by Abel of his view post-dinner. Note the jars of tomato sauce nearby.\n\nScreenshot\n\nIf you still don\u2019t think they\u2019re hanging out at this point, consider this appearance by Bella\u2019s nails on Abel\u2019s Instagram Story of a packet of sugar. Look at Bella\u2019s Instagram from the same day. Now go back to the sugar. See?\n\nScreenshot\n\nOne day later, the pair are spotted walking arm in arm through the streets of Paris.\n\nBest Image/BACKGRID\n\nJuly 2018\n\nFlash-forward about a month and your faves are spotted on a ~romantic date~ in Tokyo, and this time they get caught on camera:\n\nOctober 2018\n\nAbel celebrates Bella\u2019s birthday with the most romantic Instagram post in the history of romantic Instagram posts. Oh, and he shares a bunch of intimate never-before-seen moments from their relationship while he\u2019s at it.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nAbel and Bella spend the holidays together, and he casually shares a picture of her in a bra:\n\nThat said, all that really matters here is their massive Christmas tree.\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nAbel fully wins Valentine\u2019s Day by treating Bella to about a million red roses in their apartment:\n\nA few days later, Bella and Abel celebrate his birthday in matching outfits. Because the couple that wears camo together, stays together! Or something.\n\nMarch 2019\n\nAt this point, things between Bella and Abel seem to be going pretty strong. It\u2019s never a bad sign when a S.O. comes over to spend time with the parents, amirite? In her Instagram Stories, Bella posts a picture of her spending time at Abel\u2019s family home for his mother's birthday and writes his mother a super sweet message. \u201cHeaven...happy birthday angel Samra I cherish you forever,\u201d Bella writes. The cute snap features Abel\u2019s mother looking overcome with emotion, while the rest of her family surrounds her and the birthday cake.\n\n@bellahadid Instagram\n\nMay 2019\n\nBella attends the Met Gala sans Abel. I mean, it\u2019s totally fine, though, because she only attended the gala with him once in 2016.\n\nBella at Met Gala 2019. Karwai Tang Getty Images\n\nBella and Abel at Met Gala 2016. Kevin Mazur Getty Images\n\nAugust 2019\n\nAfter a few months of silence from the couple, it appears that Bella and Abel have called it quits again. According to an E! source, things between the pair haven't worked out because of distance and very separate schedules. \u201cThey are in different places right now, physically and mentally. Bella is prepping for her fashion week commitments and Abel is working on his music and his upcoming acting debut,\u201d the source said.\u201cThey have been arguing a lot recently....[They] haven\u2019t spent quality time together in months.\u201d\n\nEven though the breakup news is admittedly really sad, there\u2019s still a sliver of hope that Bella and Abel could get back together at some point. \u201cThey hope to get back together at one point but for now are focusing on themselves and their projects,\u201d the source added. Fingers crossed for these two!\n\nOctober 2019\n\nJust two months after Bella and Abel split, it looks like they're are talking again. A source tells E!, \"There is no bad blood between the two and they are on good terms right now. There isn\u2019t any chance of them getting back together right now, but Bella never wants to have any anger or resentment toward anyone.\"\n\nBut then Abel showed up to Bella's 23rd birthday party, sparking rumors that things are very much back on between then. According to another E! source, \"He was with her the entire night and they left together to go back to the apartment they both shared. You could tell that they were definitely in love and they both looked very happy being around each other.\"\n\nSo does that mean that they're dating once more? Nope! A rep for the Weeknd clarified that he only attend Bella's party as a friend. So for now, these two are still broken up.\n\nThat brings us up to date, but something says 2019 has a bit more in store for these two.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0722xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0722xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peggy Truong", "Entertainment Writer", "Peggy Is Cosmopolitan.Com S Entertainment Writer", "Specializing In Leonardo Dicaprio", "This Is Us", "The Royals."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a8615679/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-dating-timeline/", "title": "A Definitive Timeline of Bella Hadid and The Weeknd\u2019s Relationship", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "A Definitive Timeline of Bella Hadid and The Weeknd\u2019s Relationship", "description": "Tell your friends.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/a8615679/bella-hadid-the-weeknd-dating-timeline/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0722xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2019-10-12 08:03:54", "published_time": "2019-10-12 08:02:00", "section": "Celebrities & Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0722xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Bella Hadid and The Weeknd Dating Timeline - A Definitive Look at Bella and Abel's Relationship History", "description": "Here's everything to know about Bella Hadid and The Weeknd's mostly quiet relationship, from their Coachella encounter to their Victoria's Secret reunion after breaking up.", "keywords": "bella hadid, the weeknd, timeline, bella hadid the weeknd, bella hadid the weeknd relationship timeline, bella hadid the weeknd relationship, bella hadid the weeknd dating history, bella hadid the weeknd dating timeline", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=0.669xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,bella hadid,timeline", "sailthru.date": "2019-10-12T20:02:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0722xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-528598290-1511151669.jpg?crop=0.669xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "A Definitive Timeline of Bella Hadid and The Weeknd\u2019s Relationship", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1570838520.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
