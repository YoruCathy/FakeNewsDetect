But this year, wedged between the saccharine Hallmark films and tree-lighting specials, is a slew of prestige programs that are bowing just in time to make a mark with Golden Globes voters.\n\nGiven the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.\u2019s history of celebrating new, underdog and sometimes populist programming, it\u2019s no wonder. The body has a proven track record of putting emerging series and actors on the map for awards consideration.\n\nLook no further than the 2018 Globes darling, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d which secured a comedy series win for Amazon and comedy actress victory for its leading lady Rachel Brosnahan. Although the pilot dropped in spring 2017, the rest of its first season came at the end of last November. And after the HFPA recognized the show in January, the Television Academy followed suit with the Emmys in September, awarding Amy Sherman-Palladino\u2019s series eight trophies.\n\n\u201cI have always seen a correlation between new shows that were honored at the Golden Globes and shows that went on to secure Emmy nominations \u2014 not always wins, but certainly acknowledgement,\u201d says Richard Licata of Licata & Co., whose company worked with Amazon on awards strategies. \u201cThe HFPA is inadvertently almost offering a service to Academy members who are overwhelmed by the voluminous programming out there by saying, \u2018You can watch a lot of other shows, but these are five shows that you probably should not miss. These are five performances that you probably should not miss.\u2019 And that kind of takes the pressure off.\u201d\n\nThis time, Amazon is releasing the second season of \u201cMaisel\u201d just one day ahead of Globe nominations in December, allowing it to squeeze into consideration just under the wire. The streamer is certainly offering up plenty to grab Globe voters\u2019 attention, having released the Julia Roberts starrer \u201cHomecoming\u201d in early November, and Matthew Weiner\u2019s star-studded followup to \u201cMad Men,\u201d \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d in mid-October.\n\nThat lineup will face tough competition from the other streamers as well. Netflix typically boasts a robust year-round release strategy, but its highly anticipated Emma Stone and Jonah Hill vehicle \u201cManiac\u201d dropped at the end of September \u2014 weeks before some of its other high-profile releases, including \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d with \u201cMad Men\u201d alum Kiernan Shipka and the final, Kevin Spacey-free season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d which puts Robin Wright front-and-center.\n\nThe prestige cablers are also getting in on the game: HBO dropped Jennifer Garner\u2019s \u201cCamping\u201d in October, followed in November by the adaptation of Elena Ferrante\u2019s bestselling \u201cMy Brilliant Friend,\u201d whose international flair will certainly spark HFPA voters\u2019 interest. Showtime is offering up Ben Stiller\u2019s directorial foray into scripted drama with the Patricia Arquette and Benicio Del Toro-led \u201cEscape at Dannemora.\u201d And it also has \u201cKidding,\u201d starring Jim Carrey.\n\nAccording to Showtime\u2019s executive vice president of research, program planning and scheduling, Kim Lemon, awards eligibility and getting in front of voters is sometimes a consideration when scheduling a premiere, as was the case when Showtime moved the release of \u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d up slightly in order to hit the Emmy eligibility deadline. But it\u2019s not the primary driver of his scheduling strategy.\n\n\u201cIt is a happy coincidence; we aren\u2019t really scheduling to have a show hit right before the awards,\u201d Lemon says. \u201cMy situation has become a lot more complicated over the last couple of years. We used to roll out shows four times a year quarterly to premiere our big tentpoles, but over the last couple of years we\u2019ve gone to a monthly strategy that factors it all in.\u201d\n\nLemon admits that getting Globe recognition is great promotion for both the network and its programming, and that awards success drives a spike in viewership. But when it comes to launching shows later in the year \u2014 and specifically with \u201cDannemora\u201d \u2014 the strategy also reflects the hope of capturing year-end binge viewers.\n\n\u201cI love having it available over the holidays because I think we\u2019re going to have a very long tail of viewers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also great that the show is going to be in front of the Globes; it hopefully will get a lot of attention as well. So that\u2019s kind of the perfect storm and a great example of everything working together.\u201d\n\nHow the Globes and the Emmys work together in the bigger picture, however, is still contested. Some feel it\u2019s the 90-odd HFPA members that work to influence the 22,000 or so Emmy voters, while others argue the Emmys actually have more influence on the Globes, as was seen in the way the first season of Hulu\u2019s \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d played out on the awards circuit. Whether the winners match up or not, however, there\u2019s no discounting that by bowing at the top of the year, the Globes certainly set the tone.\n\n\u201cI have never worked with a television network or client that wasn\u2019t concerned about getting in front of the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.,\u201d adds Licata. \u201cIt seems like everybody knows that that is the first stop on the awards train.\u201d", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-escape-at-dannemora.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fawards%2Fmarvelous-mrs-maisel-escape-at-dannemora-golden-globes-1203031192%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1203031192", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-escape-at-dannemora.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Dowling"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/awards/marvelous-mrs-maisel-escape-at-dannemora-golden-globes-1203031192/", "title": "How the TV Schedule Can Be Key for Golden Globe Nominations", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Networks don't necessarily intentionally schedule prestige premieres just ahead of Golden Globe noms but the timing can help their chances.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1203031192, "author": "Amber Dowling", "pmc-category": "Awards,Features", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-11-21T10:15:52"}, "pmc-tag": "Escape at Dannemora,Golden Globes,House of Cards,The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel", "title": "How the TV Schedule Can Be Key for Golden Globe Nominations", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "Awards", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How the TV Schedule Can Be Key for Golden Globe Nominations", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/awards/marvelous-mrs-maisel-escape-at-dannemora-golden-globes-1203031192/", "description": "By December, the tv schedule is often dominated by holiday specials.
