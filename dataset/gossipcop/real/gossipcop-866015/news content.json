We\u2019re going to court ... White v. Kardashian et al. #staytuned #blacchyna,\" Mosely wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of him with Chyna, 30.\n\nAfter Instagram users responded with negative comments, Mosley clapped back at one who had replied, \"Shame in the both of u. Signed: Karma.\"\n\nKARDASHIANS' ATTORNEY FIRES BACK AT BLAC CHYNA LAWSUIT CLAIMS\n\n\"Just doing my job here. There is no shame in being a lawyer,\" Mosley responded.\n\nThis prompted the user to try and further attack Mosley. \"There are children involved,\" the user wrote. \"Shame on you for partaking in her mess. And making a scene of it all. Posting this on IG. Is for clout. So please miss me with your terrible lawyer talk.\"\n\n\"You do realize Kylie and Rob sued Chyna first \u2026 refused to serve her through her lawyer and instead did a public serving to embarrass her,\" Mosley replied. \"Just make sure you\u2019re \u2018keeping up'. This is just a counter suit \u2026 so let's talk about the kids why don\u2019t we.\"\n\nBlac has a 2-year-old daughter, Dream, from her rocky relationship with Rob Kardashian.\n\nTHE BIGGEST KARDASHIAN-JENNER MOMENTS OF 2018\n\nDuring their time together, the couple starred in an E! reality series, Rob and Chyna, and in October 2017, Blac filed a lawsuit against Rob, as well as Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, claiming they hurt her career by canceling the series.\n\nAccording to Chyna's lawsuit, the \"Kardashian-Jenner family became media predators, slut-shaming her on social media and killing her hit television show ['Rob & Chyna']\" as a form of \"revenge\" for leaving her relationship with Rob. The suit also alleged that Rob verbally and physically assaulted Blac.\n\nRob has denied the assault allegations, and in December 2017, the Kardashian family's attorneys filed a demurrer, which challenged the basis of Blac's lawsuit and asked for a dismissal of her case.\n\nLast month, Blac\u2019s attorney, Lisa Bloom, claimed victory after writing on Twitter that the court had \"rejected the Kardashian family's request to strike Chyna's entire lawsuit.\"\n\nROB KARDASHIAN HAS 'TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND' FOLLOWING 'LIFE OR DEATH' ULTIMATUM, SOURCE SAYS\n\nHowever, at the time the Kardashians' attorney, Shawn Holley, told ET that the reality television clan had \u201csuccessfully chipped away at Ms. White\u2019s outlandish claims since her lawsuit was filed, culminating in today\u2019s hearing -- a hearing at which the Court invited counsel for the Kardashians to seek attorney fees against the Bloom Firm for their failure to support Ms. White\u2019s spurious allegations with actual evidence.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a source recently told ET that Rob was turning his life around, and has made his health and Dream a priority while living at one of Kylie's houses.", "images":
