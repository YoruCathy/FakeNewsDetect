Back in England after their first royal tour of Ireland together, Prince Harry and Duchess of Sussex kicked off their latest public engagement on Tuesday at the Centenary Exhibition set up at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in the Southbank Center. It was a special visit as the couple had the opportunity to meet several prominent figures connected to the late South African president, including his granddaughter Zamaswazi Dlamini-Mandela. 22 years earlier, Harry's beloved mother met with Zamaswazi's famed grandfather in South Africa just five months before her death. Whether unintentional or otherwise, Markle even seemed to channel the former Princess of Wales sartorially, donning a sleeveless double-breasted blush trench dress by Canadian label, NONIE\u2014a modern version of the button-down dress Diana opted for all those years ago. It appears both women had buttons in mind for the occasions.\n\nAP Photo/Sasa Kral This isn't the first time Prince Harry has crossed paths with members of Mandela's family. In 2015 during his own trip to South Africa, the royal met with his widow Graca Machel and visited his Robben Island cell and Johannesburg office, where a photo of Mandela's meeting with Diana was on display. \"She will be sadly missed as a warm, compassionate and caring person,\" Mandela said at the time of her death. \"I vividly recall our meeting when she visited South Africa last year and her burning desire to assist HIV positive children in Africa. Princess Diana had indeed become an Ambassador for victims of landmines, war orphans, the sick and needy throughout the world.\" The couple also met 92-year-old Andrew Mlangeni, a close friend of Mandela's who was sentenced to life in prison on Robben Island at the Rivonia Trial. After being released 27 years later, he served as a member of parliament for the African National Congress. Similarly, the royals mingled with Paul and Adelaide Joseph, anti-Apartheid activists and close friends of Mandela and Winnie Mandela.", "images": ["https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/legal.svg?v=2", "https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/screenshot_aplication.png", "https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/sidebar_statistics.svg", "https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/flag_dark.svg?v=2", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018617/rs_634x814-180717055847-634-Nelson-Mandela-Princess-Diana-LT-071718.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018610/rs_600x600-180710143404-600-4meghan-markle-prince-harry-ireland.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/main_logo.svg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018617/rs_634x1024-180717055715-634-Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-Nelson-Mandela-Exhibit-London-LT-071718.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/world.svg", "https://theworldnews.net/ui/images/paper.svg"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018617/rs_634x814-180717055847-634-Nelson-Mandela-Princess-Diana-LT-071718.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Channel Princess Diana at Nelson Mandela Exhibit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Neil Mockford/GC Images  's legacy lives on in her son and his new wife.\u00a0Back in England after their first royal tour of Ireland together, Prince Harr", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Channel Princess Diana at Nelson Mandela Exhibit", "image": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018617/rs_634x814-180717055847-634-Nelson-Mandela-Princess-Diana-LT-071718.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "description": "Neil Mockford/GC Images  's legacy lives on in her son and his new wife.\u00a0Back in England after their first royal tour of Ireland together, Prince Harr", "site_name": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Channel Princess Diana at Nelson Mandela Exhibit"}, "twitter": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Channel Princess Diana at Nelson Mandela Exhibit", "description": "Neil Mockford/GC Images  's legacy lives on in her son and his new wife.\u00a0Back in England after their first royal tour of Ireland together, Prince Harr"}, "google-site-verification": "U1-hTM45Vi-2FXgAe9yiO34XFJryFRyuNImiqKdV6EQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://theworldnews.net", "summary": ""}
