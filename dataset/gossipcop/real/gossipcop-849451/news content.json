Thx for the love & support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got,\u201d Kimmel wrote alongside a photo of his smiling baby boy.\n\nBilly is 3 months old & doing great.

The newborn underwent a successful open-heart surgery at just three days old and returned home six days later.\n\n\u201cBefore 2014, if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was,\u201d Kimmel explained at the time, \u201cthere was a good chance you\u2019d never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition.\u201d\n\nThe speech quickly went viral as the Republican-dominated Senate debated repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a new health care plan that threatens to cut funding for millions, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHe also revealed that his son will likely needed an additional surgery somewhere between the ages of 3- and 6-months-old.\n\n\u201cIf your baby is going to die and it doesn\u2019t have to, it shouldn\u2019t matter how much money you make,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s something, whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/585bf1641800002c00e44166.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc855a6240000090c524d4f.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59738dcd2100003400fc832c.png?cache=lydkssw6bn&ops=1778_1000", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59738dcd2100003400fc832c.png?cache=lydkssw6bn&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-shares-adorable-health-update-after-sons-heart-surgery_n_59737ac5e4b09e5f6ccfb1c6", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Shares Adorable Health Update After Son's Heart Surgery", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The 3-month-old is \"doing great.\"", "keywords": "Health and Medicine,Babies,Jimmy Kimmel,Congenital Heart Disease", "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel Shares Adorable Health Update After Son's Heart Surgery", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59738dcd2100003400fc832c.png?cache=lydkssw6bn&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59738dcd2100003400fc832c.png?cache=lydkssw6bn&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-kimmel-shares-adorable-health-update-after-sons-heart-surgery_n_59737ac5e4b09e5f6ccfb1c6", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The 3-month-old is \"doing great.\""}, "article": {"tag": "Health and Medicine,Babies,Jimmy Kimmel,Congenital Heart Disease", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-07-22 14:30:32 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-07-22 14:30:32 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Shares Adorable Health Update After Son's Heart Surgery", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59738dcd2100003400fc832c.png?cache=lydkssw6bn&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The 3-month-old is \"doing great.\"", "creator": "cdelbyck"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59737ac5e4b09e5f6ccfb1c6", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500748232.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
