Vogue\u2019s editor-in-chief, who was awarded for her services the fashion industry, looked the picture of elegance in a dusty pink Chanel Haute Couture double-breasted coat. Anna accessorized her outfit with a jewelled choker necklace, a pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos and her signature black sunglasses. In terms of makeup, the 67-year-old opted for a natural look, enhancing her lips with a touch of red lipstick, while her eyes were highlighted with a flick of black eye-liner and layers of black mascara. As always, her hair was perfectly styled in her trademark bob.\n\nAnna is considered one of the most influential people in the fashion industry, and could have had her pick of the world\u2019s leading designers when it came to selecting an outfit for the special occasion. However, the editor-in-chief often opts for Chanel, wearing two other dazzling outfits by the luxury French brand earlier in the week.\n\nOn Monday, Anna turned heads on the red carpet as she stepped out to enjoy an evening of entertainment at the Met Gala 2017\u2013 one of the biggest nights of the fashion calendar. Wearing a sequin embellished gold gown created by Karl Lagerfeld, the ensemble featured delicate feathers mid-way down the design. This was accessorised with a silver necklace. Meanwhile, at the Chanel Cruise 2018 show in Paris on Thursday, she dressed her slender figure in a form-fitting cream tweed dress.\n\nAnna has worked as editor-in-chief at Vogue since 1988, and recently opened up about her role in reflecting modern times in the industry to Business of Fashion. \u201cWhat I see happening now is that it is so much easier today for young talent to emerge and be recognised and to find a customer. If you are talented and you use a modern way to communicate and you do all the things that you need to do, you can be established so much more quickly.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.himgs.com/css/hello/img/logo.png", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=HS7uq1SZw320l9", "https://ca.hellomagazine.com/fashion/02017050535550/\nhttps:/www.facebook.com/tr?id=1728383620790976&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2017/05/05/000/462/679/featured_5_3.jpg", "https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hello-canada/common/sjc-black.png"], "top_img": "https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2017/05/05/000/462/679/featured_5_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hello"], "canonical_link": "https://ca.hellomagazine.com/anna-wintour-made-dame-by-queen", "title": "Anna Wintour made a dame by the Queen at Buckingham Palace", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Anna Wintour made a dame by the Queen at Buckingham Palace | HELLO!
