Just three days after 17-year-old Jacob Staudenmaier posted his viral La La Land-inspired promposal on Twitter, his celebrity crush, Emma Stone, responded with a heartfelt reply.\n\nStaudenmaier, a Phoenix, Arizona, native, read Stone\u2019s message on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Friday, April 7. The Oscar winner wrote: \u201cJacob, thanks for making the greatest proposal I have ever received. I can\u2019t tell you what an honor that was and how much I smiled through that entire beautifully orchestrated video. I\u2019m in London working, but I hope you have the best time at prom, and I\u2019m grateful you thought of me. Thank you. P.S. I do see Gosling around the eyes. Love, Emma.\u201d\n\nDespite being turned down by Stone, he assured the GMA hosts that he\u2019s looking forward to attending prom. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a great time still with all my friends,\u201d Staudenmaier told them.\n\nThe teen also spoke with ABC on Wednesday, April 5, explaining that he was originally inspired by a former student from his high school, who asked Miley Cyrus to prom back in 2013. \u201cShe didn\u2019t actually go to prom with him, but he was invited to one of her concerts and he got to go up on stage with her so I think it worked out,\u201d Staudenmaier said.\n\nAs previously reported, the young Ryan Gosling look-alike posted his creative promposal to Twitter on Tuesday, April 4. \u201cIM ASKING EMMA STONE TO PROM,\u201d the 17-year-old wrote in all caps, \u201cand decided to recreate the opening scene from la la land.\u201d\n\nThe video, which is set to the tune of La La Land\u2019s opening number, \u201cAnother Day of Sun,\u201d has over 20,000 retweets and 44,000 likes on Twitter as of Friday, April 7, and took the ambitious teen two weeks to create from start to finish.", "images":
