The clip immediately went viral and viewers quickly took to social media to criticize the singer. Pink took to Twitter to address the incident.\n\n\u201cYes. THIS. Christina f--king killed it tonight for one of our favorite singers ever. This about Whitney, and I am in awe of Christina's talent. Show the clip where I'm in tears, you negative Nancy's,\u201d Pink tweeted.\n\nHer comment included a retweet of Fuse TV\u2019s Mark Sundstrom tweet, saying: \u201c@Pink and @Xtina deaded their beef last year and have been FRIENDS since, respecting each other\u2019s amazing talent as grown women. stop creating something out of nothing @TheShadyFacts.\u201d\n\nPink and Aguilera had a famous ongoing feud early in their music careers, but made amends and even worked together on the singing competition \u201cThe Voice\u201d in 2016. Pink tweeted in August: \u201cI [heart] Xtina, we've made amend.\u201d\n\nPink also opened up to Andy Cohen on \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d in October about clashing with Aguilera.\n\nShe said, \u201cShe\u2019s so talented and deep down I\u2019ve had bad days, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a really sweet person. We made up on 'The Voice.' I mean, it was funny, I laughed. I hadn\u2019t seen her in years and years and years,\u201d Pink said. \u201cWe became moms. We grew up. We hugged it out. It\u2019s that simple. I feel so good about that.\u201d\n\nPink also received praise for her AMA performance with Kelly Clarkson Sunday night.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/270/152/joe-rogan-now.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/348/196/elvispresleyreuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/06/270/152/ContentBroker_contentid-2a3b7e0246f54c32a6cd1da89f3ef154.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/meghan-markle-red.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/348/196/em-rata-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap17324021416753.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/ap17324021416753.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/270/152/AP20104012734692.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/348/196/liz-hurley.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Lorenzo-twitter.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/348/196/lauren-sanchez-jeff-bezos.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/348/196/Screen-Shot-2020-03-17-at-9.39.14-AM.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/e4bdc6f3-8d06-4623-b934-f4a25899cb6c/dc192956-9929-4f64-abb4-d9b8827a6fac/1280x720/match/270/152/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/ap17324021416753.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
