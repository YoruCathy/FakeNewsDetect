The women who star on The Platinum Life may be new the reality TV scene, but they definitely aren\u2019t strangers to the drama \u2014 and In Touch Weekly has exclusively obtained a sneak peek at Sunday\u2019s upcoming episode that proves it! In the clip, the drama erupts between Shantel Jackson and La\u2019Myia Good while the entire cast is attending a dinner party at Nazanin Mandi\u2019s. Check out the clip below to see the tensions erupt!\n\nThe Platinum Life \u2014 which is in its first season \u2014 follows seven ladies who are deeply invested in LA\u2019s music scene, thanks to their husbands and boyfriends. The show stars Alycia Bella (Ty Dolla $ign\u2019s ex of more than 10 years), La\u2019Myia Good (Eric Bellinger\u2019s wife), Asiah Collins (Kid Ink\u2019s wife), Shantel Jackson (Nelly\u2019s girlfriend), Crystal Smith (Ne-Yo\u2019s wife), Lola Monroe (King Los\u2019 partner), and Nazanin Mandi (Miguel\u2019s fianc\u00e9e).\n\nWhile the ladies have it great in some ways \u2014 they get to live the luxurious life, with access to vacations and parties most of us can only dream of \u2014 there are some down sides to being with a musician: namely, all the time they spend on tour. Fortunately, the ladies are showing the ups and downs on the show \u2014 and we know we\u2019ll be watching every second of it!\n\nNew episodes of The Platinum Life air Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on E!.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IT2319_cover_cn3_View.jpg?w=300", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Married-at-First-Sight-Star-Mindy-Shiben-Says-Husband-Zach-Justice-Betrayed-Her-and-Marriage.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Jamie-and-Doug-Season-1-MAFS.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C750px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Derek-and-Katie-on-Married-at-First-Sight-Season-10-Still-Together.jpg?crop=0px%2C348px%2C3000px%2C1699px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-07-at-12-37-45-pm.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Danielle-Jbali-Claps-Back-Anna-Campisi-Amid-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Cheyenne-Floyd-Cory-Wharton-Can-Do-Better-Than-Taylor-Selfridge-09.jpg?crop=0px%2C212px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-platinum-life.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/farrah-abraham-blowin.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-mid-nuptial-agreement-.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Who-Are-Kobe-Bryants-Wife-and-Kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C69px%2C3150px%2C3150px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Meghan-Markle-Hated-Royal-Dress-Code-Shes-Much-More-Comfortable-Wearing-Casual-Clothes.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/cheyenne-single-feature-e1587066460129.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3337px%2C1890px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Duggar-Girls-Wearing-Pants-and-Jeans.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiger-King-Star-John-Finlay-Wont-Wear-a-Suit-to-His-Western-Wedding-to-Stormey.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lori-loughlin-and-daughters.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C3120px%2C1767px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-platinum-life.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jennifer-Garner-Hasnt-Seen-Much-of-Boyfriend-John-Miller-Due-to-Coronavirus-Outbreak.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Screen-Shot-2020-01-27-at-4.09.35-PM.png?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chanel-west-coast-corona-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C5203px%2C2947px&resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-platinum-life.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Sitzer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/shantel-jackson-lamyia-good-the-platinum-life-145143/", "title": "Things Are Getting Dramatic Between Shantel and La\u2019Myia on The Platinum Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Leave it to these ladies to take everything to the next level!
