We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nAll Beauty\n\nLaunched in 2004, All Beauty is the go-to site for discounted beauty products. Ideal for savvy shoppers, the site sells all the best big beauty brands at the lowest possible with everything from fragrance and skincare to haircare up for grabs. They also offer a price match service against retailers like Boots, Debenhams, Harrods and Superdrug.\n\nVisit shop\n\nASOS\n\nYou might know ASOS as a go-to destination for fashion but as of last year it also launched its very own collection of in-house beauty products, relaunching the ASOS beauty section as ASOS Face + Body. As well as its own makeup and skincare including lipsticks, highlighters and budge-proof eyeliners, it also sells products from a number of leading brands including Smashbox, Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Illamasqua.\n\nVisit shop\n\nBeauty Bay\n\nMore than a retailer, Beauty Bay is packed with make-up tutorials, colour trend reports, get the make-up look tips with product recommendations, and tried and tested reviews. With over 10,000 products available from the very best UK and International brands \u2013 think Jeffrey Star, Sigma and Anastasia Beverly Hills \u2013 you\u2019ll be hard pressed to leave this site empty handed.

The digital-only make-up brand cuts out the middleman and the mark-ups, allowing you to buy direct from factories that also supply the majority of luxury beauty brands. For just \u00a310 a month, you\u2019re given a shopping allowance of up to \u00a3100 retail price but you only pay factory cost. For example, Beauty Pie\u2019s Precision Eyeliner Marker is valued at \u00a316 retail cost (and looks suspiciously like Kat Von D\u2019s Tattoo Liner) but it will only set you back a mere \u00a31.50.
