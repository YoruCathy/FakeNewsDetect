Anti-ageing also encompasses a range of different skin concerns; erasing fine lines are a priority for some, while others want to combat dullness or hyperpigmentation \u2013 the list goes on when trying to hit your most youthful notes.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s tempting to lather your skin in as many products promising anti-ageing benefits as possible, combining too many may have a less than desirable effect. You need to consider which ingredients work best for your skin, and which products work in harmony together.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing to invest in wisely for your regime it\u2019s a top notch serum. Nestling ever so nicely between your toner and moisturiser, this is the hardworking hero of your collection. Reason being, a serum can, and should, have the most concentrated of ingredients to target your specific concerns. Meaning not only does a little go a long way, but you can expect results sooner rather than later.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried and tested a range of serums to find the best of the bunch, catering for a multitude of different skin types and concerns.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice.
