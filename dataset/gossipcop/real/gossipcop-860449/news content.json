Jedediah Bila and her fianc\u00e9, Jeremy Scher, are married, Us Weekly can confirm.\n\nCelebrity Weddings of 2018\n\nThe 39-year-old former View cohost and her love tied the knot in Huntington, New York, on Saturday, February 17.\n\n\u201cAs 60 of their closest family and friends filled the room, Jedediah walked down the aisle as Jeremy beamed with joy \u2014 you could truly feel the love in this magical evening!\u201d wedding planner Michael Russo tells Us.\n\nThe glowing bride opened up to Us and shared exclusive details of the happy couple\u2019s fairytale wedding. \u201cI\u2019m super excited. Super, super excited,\u201d Bila told Us. \u201cI always wanted to get married, but I never thought I would do the big wedding dress and the beautiful venue. I always thought I was gonna be on a beach somewhere, just a couple of friends, doing it really casual. So it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nThe star, who donned a Rivini lace ballgown and earrings from Susan Hanover, selected a white gold eternity style wedding band with wraparound diamonds. Scher, for his part, sported a traditional tuxedo and chose a plain yellow gold band.\n\nCelebrity Engagement Rings of 2017: See the Bling!\n\n\u201cEveryone always thinks of me as the rule breaker and the troublemaker,\u201d the former Fox News contributor said. \u201cEven in my politics, I don\u2019t fit into a box, I break rules. But my wedding has so many traditional components, it\u2019s so funny.\u201d\n\nOf the ceremony, which was attended by 60 people including View host Sunny Hostin, the New York native gushed: \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking forward to the most [about my wedding day] is that moment of walking down the aisle and seeing him and having him see me and having that moment where we\u2019re in front together. And we\u2019re just looking at each other. I\u2019ll be in my dress and he\u2019ll be in his tux. It\u2019s just one of those once in a lifetime moments that I kind of want to hold onto.\u201d\n\nCelebrity Engagements of 2018\n\nShe continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve been living together for a while and we go through the daily grind and all that, but I think there\u2019s only one moment in your life where you\u2019re in front of the minister and you\u2019re saying your vows. And you\u2019re like, \u2018My life is gonna be different from here on and I\u2019m gonna be married.\u2019 It\u2019s really exciting and warm and wonderful. I think that moment, that one \u2026 I\u2019m gonna take a pause and just kind of absorb it all before I \u2026 \u2019cause you can\u2019t quite get it back the same way ever again.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo help coordinate the affair, the Daytime Emmy Award winner tapped Michael Russo Events \u2014 wedding planner to the stars \u2014 who arranged retro tunes from Richie Hart Events and flowers from Pedestals. \u201cThe venue is dripping in garden roses and hydrangea,\u201d a designer from Pedestal\u2019s told Us. \u201cJedediah wanted a whimsical and garden feel.\u201d The couple\u2019s dinner offering included filet mignon and seared Atlantic salmon followed by a custom designed vanilla and chocolate wedding cake with mousse filling.\n\nWith reporting by Marc Lupo", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jedediah-bila-and-jeremy-scher-wedding.jpg?crop=72px%2C19px%2C1213px%2C637px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jedediah-bila-and-jeremy-scher-wedding.jpg?w=214", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jedediah-bila-and-jeremy-scher-wedding.jpg?crop=72px%2C19px%2C1213px%2C637px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-views-jedediah-bila-marries-jeremy-scher/", "title": "The View\u2019s Jedediah Bila Marries Jeremy Scher", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Former cohost of \u2018The View\u2019 Jedediah Bila married her fianc\u00e9, Jeremy Scher, on Saturday, February 17 \u2014 get the details!", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The View\u2019s Jedediah Bila Marries Jeremy Scher: Details", "description": "Former cohost of \u2018The View\u2019 Jedediah Bila married her fianc\u00e9, Jeremy Scher, on Saturday, February 17 \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/the-views-jedediah-bila-marries-jeremy-scher/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-06T00:37:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jedediah-bila-and-jeremy-scher-wedding.jpg?crop=72px%2C19px%2C1213px%2C637px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jedediah-bila-and-jeremy-scher-wedding.jpg?crop=72px%2C19px%2C1213px%2C637px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marc.lupo.9", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-02-17T23:15:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-06T00:37:02+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Former cohost of \u2018The View\u2019 Jedediah Bila married her fianc\u00e9, Jeremy Scher, on Saturday, February 17 \u2014 get the details!", "title": "The View\u2019s Jedediah Bila Marries Jeremy Scher: Details", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jedediah-bila-and-jeremy-scher-wedding.jpg?crop=72px%2C19px%2C1213px%2C637px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@Marcandrewlupo"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518909329.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
