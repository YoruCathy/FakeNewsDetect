Meghan againpulled focus in a stunning olive green dress with a high neckline and classic fit.\n\nThe baptism was attended by William\u2019s father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla; William\u2019s brother Prince Harry and his new wife Meghan; plus Louis\u2019 siblings George and Charlotte.\n\nFrom the duchess\u2019s side, Kate\u2019s parents Michael and Carole, brother James, pregnant sister Pippa and her husband James Matthews were there.\n\nQueen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, however, did not attend.\n\nThe monarch, 92, and her 97-year-old husband had attended the christenings of Louis\u2019 older siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte.\n\nMembers of the Royal Family arrive at St James's Palace for the christening of Prince Louis. pic.twitter.com/3pDk4D898C \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) July 9, 2018\n\nHowever, the decision for them not to attend Louis\u2019 baptism at St. James\u2019s Palace in London was understood to have been mutually agreed by the sovereign and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge some time ago, and was not health-related.\n\nLouis is fifth in the line of succession to the British throne after his grandfather Prince Charles, his father William, George and Charlotte.\n\nHe is one of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s seven great-grandchildren.\n\nBefore the ceremony, Kate told Archbishop of Canterbury that Louis was \u201cvery relaxed and peaceful\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope he stays like this.\u201d\n\nWelby used the Lily Font, commissioned by Queen Victoria for the baptism of her first child in 1841 and baptised Louis by pouring holy water from the River Jordan over his head.\n\nLouis wore the replica of the royal christening robe, first used in 2008. The original, retired in order to preserve it, was worn for all royal baptisms since 1841.\n\n\u2018COURT JESTER\u2019\n\nThe six godparents, who also attended with their spouses, are all friends or family of William and Kate.\n\nThey include Guy Pelly, once dubbed the \u201ccourt jester\u201d to William and Harry for his wild ways that were often cited as a bad influence on the brothers in their youth, running their favourite drinking haunts.\n\nLouis\u2019 other godparents are: Nicholas van Cutsem, whose family is close to the royals; William\u2019s school pal Harry Aubrey-Fletcher; Laura Meade, who is married to William\u2019s close friend James Meade; Kate\u2019s schoolfriend Hannah Carter; and the duchess\u2019s cousin Lucy Middleton.\n\nWilliam and Kate hosted a private tea afterwards. As after George and Charlotte\u2019s baptisms, guests will be served slices of the duke and duchess\u2019s wedding cake.\n\nPrince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge was born on April 23 \u2014 St. George\u2019s Day, England\u2019s national day \u2014 at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in central London weighing 3.8kg.\n\n\u2014 with The Sun", "images":
