I always say that there\u2019s a lot more good in the world than there is bad, and I continue to believe that. And that is what we have to focus on.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Jason Aldean on World After Las Vegas Massacre: 'I'm Afraid to Raise My Children'\n\nTo provide comfort for her viewers, DeGeneres played a six minute montage of people who have appeared on her show who do good in the world \u2014 from simple acts, like a diner waitress serving breakfast on the house to two firefighters, to a crowd of people lifting a burning car to rescue a man trapped underneath.\n\n\u201cThe world is full of amazing people,\u201d DeGeneres reassured her audience. \u201cGood will always win. Love will always win.\u201d\n\nWatch Ellen\u2019s speech in the clip above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg",
