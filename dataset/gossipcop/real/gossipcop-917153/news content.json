But this week\u2019s controversial closer had an unprecedented ending, which has since stirred an uproar.\n\nOn Monday night\u2019s finale, \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d Arie Luyendyk Jr. proposed to Becca Kufrin and the couple was engaged. However, over the next two months, after the season had wrapped, Luyendyk had a change of heart and realized he made the wrong choice and was actually in love with runner-up Lauren Burnham, so he broke up with Kufrin \u2014 and the entire thing was caught on film.\n\nABC\u2019s cameras followed Luyendyk as he broke off his engagement to Kufrin, and the network aired the scene completely unedited, showing exactly what happened between the pair during the difficult conversation.\n\nThe following night on \u201cAfter the Final Rose,\u201d Kufrin was named ABC\u2019s next leading lady who will star in \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d and her journey to find love again began last night on \u201cAfter the Final Rose.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Luyendyk sat down with Burnham on \u201cAfter the Final Rose,\u201d as the glowing couple told America about their rekindled relationship over the past two months, and then Luyendyk proposed to Burnham. The two are now engaged, and have embarked on a mini media tour, sitting down with Jimmy Kimmel, and making appearances today on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan.\u201d\n\nThe dramatic two-part finale has garnered overwhelming support for Kufrin, but has caused a social media outcry in response to Luyendyk\u2019s behavior.\n\nHere, ABC\u2019s executive in charge of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise, Robert Mills, senior VP of alternative series, specials, and late-night programming, talks to Variety about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited \u2014 plus, what he thinks about Kufrin as the next \u201cBachelorette.\u201d\n\nLooking back on the entire season, what do you think overall?\n\nI liked this season. I think it\u2019s pretty clear we made a conscious decision to do a more straightforward season of \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d and I liked that because at the end of the day, we really believe in this concept and really want it to be about finding love and making connections. I\u2019m really proud of it, creatively. I\u2019m not blind that the ratings are down, so that\u2019s a bit of a disappointment, and I wish that the audience had liked this season a little better. We\u2019ve seen some negativity both toward Arie and the some of the people in this season and the show in general, so every season when the show ends, me and the producers take a look at what worked and what didn\u2019t and we will work to make a phenomenal season of \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d\n\nWhat went into the decision to film Arie and Becca after the proposal? You had never done that before.\n\nIt lends credence to the fact that \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d is not just over the top because one of the problems [with the show] is that you\u2019re dating people in a way that you never would in real life, and then you have to start a life with this person, and so in the finale, you actually see what happens in the real world. It\u2019s incredibly relatable and it\u2019s a place we\u2019ve all been. The stuff you see here is stuff that we\u2019ve all done and we\u2019ve all been through. There\u2019s heartbreak and there is hope, but it is riveting and it\u2019s why we watch \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d because when good or bad things happen, we all want to relate that these things happen to other people. When the show really does that, it\u2019s when it\u2019s at it\u2019s best.\n\nWhat was your reaction when Arie started having second thoughts, and wanted to break up with Becca to get back together with Lauren?\n\nYou go to the place where you say this will be great, riveting TV, but you\u2019ve got to realize that these are real people \u2014 not just Becca, but Arie and Lauren \u2014 and this could happen to anyone, so I think that makes it really difficult. Part of the importance of doing this on camera is it\u2019s sort of a contract with the audience that you\u2019re going to see the whole relationship from beginning to end on TV, and you\u2019re taking that journey with them, and it\u2019s important to understand the whole thing because now there will be no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind what the reason is [that Arie and Becca broke up]. People can feel how they want to after seeing it, as opposed to just hearing about it.\n\nYou have never shown footage of a couple after the proposal, and in this case, you filmed for an additional two months. In future seasons, will you be continuing to film couples after the proposal?\n\nThe things we\u2019ve learned with \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d is that it has to constantly evolve. Like you see with the fantasy suite, now you see the morning after, and that\u2019s really important because it\u2019s a totally different phase of the relationship and those conversations inform how all of the decisions are going to be made. So this change is the same thing, and I think you\u2019ll start to see more of this now, as we keep evolving the show.\n\nWas it just a coincidence that the first time you decided to continue to film after the proposal, that this bombshell breakup happened?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t purposeful. A lot of the stuff was shot on iPhones and it\u2019s just stuff that we had of them being together and being kind of goofy together. It was interesting watching it and getting to see how these people are in real life, so I am glad it gave us a reason to use that [iPhone footage], and I think we\u2019ll look at how we can implement that more in seasons going forward. But it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh my god, thank god we had this footage.\u201d It just worked itself in organically into the fabric of the finale.\n\nCan you clear up the timeline of the proposal and the breakup, and Lauren starting to date Arie?\n\nThe proposal happened right before Thanksgiving and then the breakup happened in January, so it was almost two months in between, and that\u2019s when Arie asked Lauren for a second chance, just so they can date. And that was two months ago, and things are going incredibly well.\n\nHow long after the breakup did ABC ask Becca to be \u201cThe Bachelorette?\u201d\n\nYou have to be respectful. You can\u2019t say, \u201cYou just had your heart broken. Do you want to meet 25 new guys?\u201d It was a very slow process. Fortunately, we had time because this was mid-January and the finale doesn\u2019t air until mid-March. I know two months doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, and the feelings are still raw, but she still just wanted to keep trying. I think when you\u2019ve had great tragedy in your life, like she\u2019s had, there is a resilience that starts to come in, and you realize that for better or worse, life goes on and you\u2019re better off taking a chance. So we moved slowly [asking her to be \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d], but when she came around to it, it got really exciting. It started very slowly and then it got very serious in the middle of February. She actually hadn\u2019t signed until basically a couple of days ago, so it was definitely a lot of thinking. She\u2019s also very close with her family and I don\u2019t know if her family wanted her to jump right back into a show that caused her so much heartbreak, but they are supportive and that\u2019s fantastic.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion surrounding the lack of diversity with leads on \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise, and just last year, Rachel Lindsay was the first-ever African American lead on \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d What went into the decision naming Becca next season\u2019s lead?\n\nI\u2019m super proud of this cast [from Arie\u2019s season]. We look at everything, and diversity is not only ethnicity, but also it\u2019s the types of women that we had, and I was really happy that we had a lot of types of different women. We had a lot of professional women and strong women who are their own women. With Becca, it was really a no-brainer decision. I think everybody, after they see how this plays out, they\u2019re going to want to see her get her happy ending. This is a girl who\u2019s been through so much \u2014 she lost her dad to brain cancer, her mother had a battle with breast cancer. She\u2019s really strong and resilient, and you really root for her after the finale.\n\nEarlier in the season, Becca\u2019s boyfriend from her past showed up, and a lot of people on Twitter criticized that scene for seeming staged, solely to create drama. He obviously didn\u2019t just pop up in Peru, so how did he show up?\n\nI\u2019m really glad you asked that. We sit down at the end of every season and we look at things and we say, \u201cThis is good, this worked, people didn\u2019t like this, or people responded to this.\u201d For me and the producers, something that really didn\u2019t sit right was when DeMario\u2019s [Jackson] girlfriend came back in Rachel\u2019s [Lindsay] season \u2014 it just felt completely fake and it felt like this woman had a speech prepared and was ready to go \u2014 so when you see all of that, if it plays as false, then it pulls on a sweater thread and the whole thing can fall apart because it all seems false, and it\u2019s not. So in this case, this guy reached out to production and said he heard Becca was on the show and he was really upset and wanted to see her. And as a producer, you think, \u2018That\u2019s a great storyline, if it\u2019s authentic.\u2019 But at the very least, we had to make sure that this guy was willing to put up the money to get to Peru, and see if this guy is genuine and didn\u2019t want to just get on TV \u2014 and he did. So once we realized that this guy really has feelings for Becca and he wants to go, we did it. This was a guy that Becca had spoken about many times on the show as the one big relationship that she had, and seven years, that\u2019s a long time. So that\u2019s how it all came to be.\n\nWhy did you originally cast Arie as this season\u2019s lead? Is it because he is a bit older, and perhaps ready for a real relationship?\n\nIt\u2019s funny because Arie is the same age as Nick [Viall], but I think the reason why Arie comes off as older is because he has a more mature lifestyle. Nick Viall almost feels like an early-to-mid 20-something who is still figuring himself out and moved to L.A. Arie lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., where he\u2019s showing houses, and he\u2019s even slowed down with the racing. He\u2019s a grown-up. I think that\u2019s the difference, and that\u2019s part of what went into the decision-making. I thought Nick\u2019s season was great and I absolutely love Nick, but you watched that finale last year and he got engaged to Vanessa [Grimaldi], and it should have been this full-circle moment for him because he got so close with Andi [Dorfmann] and then he got so close with Kaitlyn [Bristowe] and then he finally found this person and it just felt like this thing is going to last for five minutes \u2014 and that\u2019s what ended up happening. And everyone has to do their own thing so I\u2019m not decrying anything that he did. But it just felt like we really wanted to find someone who was going to leave the spotlight after this was over, and that\u2019s Arie. He was never one of those people that was really on social media and stayed in \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d circle. He was just living his life.\n\nIt seems like the intention in casting Arie was to make this season the most authentic it could possibly be when it comes to looking for love, so why do you think ratings were down this season?\n\nI don\u2019t know, but I will tell you that I was surprised when the ratings were up when Nick [Viall] was \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d so sometimes you just don\u2019t know. Nick was a roll-of-the-dice because he\u2019d been on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d which is not usually the breeding ground for the lead, so sometimes you can\u2019t put your finger on these things. When Sean Lowe was \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d it really came down to him and Arie, and it was down to the wire because people really wanted to see Arie be \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d because he was so heartbroken by Emily [Maynard] so when we were making \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d this year, it was surprising how many people said they didn\u2019t know who he was. I know five years is not yesterday, but it\u2019s also not so long ago. He was somebody who always remained in the conversation with fans \u2014 maybe not as many as I thought, but I thought there was a lot of appeal for Arie, and it was fascinating to see that we had to re-educate people [on Arie] on I think Arie also had to re-educate himself what it\u2019s like to be on this type of show. I think he has a lot of personality, and it\u2019s really on us for not showing more of that. You saw on \u201cThe Women Tell All\u201d that he is really very funny, and I think if we had maybe shown more of that, maybe that would have helped. Also, we premiered on New Year\u2019s Day and then the next day was the college football championship game and then you had the Olympics, so we had a lot of strikes against us. But it still felt like people cared \u2014 I heard a lot of chatter about the season online.\n\nSo you believe the numbers being down are due to competing programming and perhaps the lack of awareness for Arie \u2014 not any sort of \u201cBachelor\u201d fatigue among audiences?\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s \u201cBachelor\u201d fatigue. The people that are watching, certainly all seem to like it and live for it. They might not like certain elements, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone say, \u201cI\u2019m done watching \u2018The Bachelor.\u2019\u201d But it is an interesting time right now in the world, and there might be people who say, \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like I can get an escape right now because the world is in a weird place.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side of that, do you think the political climate and intense news cycle serve as a benefit to the show because it can be an escape for viewers?\n\nI think that\u2019s right. Even when things are horrible on the show, as we\u2019ve seen in this finale, there still is a measure of hope. At the end of the day, we are trying to make a version of a fairytale here and there is something about love that is hopeful, even when it is love that\u2019s lost. There\u2019s always going to be hope at the end of the day. There is something hopeful and escapist about this show. We\u2019ve all made a fool of ourselves or gotten dumped, so I think there\u2019s so much relatability to show.\n\nWhat do you expect Becca\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d to be like?\n\nThis could be one of the stranger seasons of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d because she might not truly be over Arie and it may not work \u2014 I certainly hope it does, and we will do everything we possibly can to make sure it does, but you just don\u2019t know. It certainly is a chance worth taking.\n\nPOPULAR VIDEO:", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-bachelor-arie-becca.jpg?w=1000", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fbachelor-arie-becca-lauren-breakup-proposal-bachelorette-1202720988%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202720988&comment_count=89", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-bachelor-arie-becca.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Wagmeister"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bachelor-arie-becca-lauren-breakup-proposal-bachelorette-1202720988/", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019: ABC Exec Reveals the Real Story Behind Arie\u2019s Breakup and the Next \u2018Bachelorette\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "ABC's executive in charge of \"The Bachelor\"\u00a0franchise talks about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202720988, "author": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-03-07T13:27:41"}, "pmc-tag": "Arie Luyendyk Jr.,Becca Kufrin,Robert Mills,The Bachelor,The Bachelorette", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019: ABC Exec Reveals the Real Story Behind Arie\u2019s Breakup and the Next \u2018Bachelorette\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019: ABC Exec Reveals the Real Story Behind Arie\u2019s Breakup and the Next \u2018Bachelorette\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bachelor-arie-becca-lauren-breakup-proposal-bachelorette-1202720988/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT:\u00a0Do not read ahead if you have not watched the finale of Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d or \u201cAfter the Final Rose.\u201d As host Chris Harrison w\u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-bachelor-arie-becca.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "The Bachelor Arie Becca"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-07T21:27:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-07T21:27:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@EWagmeister", "site": "@variety", "text": {"title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019: ABC Exec Reveals the Real Story Behind Arie\u2019s Breakup and the Next \u2018Bachelorette\u2019"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-bachelor-arie-becca.jpg?w=1000", "alt": "The Bachelor Arie Becca"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019: ABC Exec Reveals the Real Story Behind Arie\u2019s Breakup and the Next \u2018Bachelorette\u2019", "description": "ABC's executive in charge of \"The Bachelor\"\u00a0franchise talks about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited."}, "author": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202720988, "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019: ABC Exec Reveals the Real Story Behind Arie\u2019s Breakup and the Next \u2018Bachelorette\u2019", "published_at": "2018-03-07 13:27:41", "image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-bachelor-arie-becca.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 89, "tags": "The Bachelorette", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "SPOILER ALERT:\u00a0Do not read ahead if you have not watched the finale of Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of \"The Bachelor\" or \"After the Final Rose.\"\r\n\r\nAs host Chris Harrison warns each and every season, \"The Bachelor\" finale is always dramatic.

But it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh my god, thank god we had this footage.\u201d It just worked itself in organically into the fabric of the finale.\r\n\r\nCan you clear up the timeline of the proposal and the breakup, and Lauren starting to date Arie?\r\n\r\nThe proposal happened right before Thanksgiving and then the breakup happened in January, so it was almost two months in between, and that\u2019s when Arie asked Lauren for a second chance, just so they can date. And that was two months ago, and things are going incredibly well.\r\n\r\nHow long after the breakup did ABC ask Becca to be \"The Bachelorette?\"\r\n\r\nYou have to be respectful. You can\u2019t say, \u201cYou just had your heart broken. Do you want to meet 25 new guys?\u201d It was a very slow process. Fortunately, we had time because this was mid-January and the finale doesn\u2019t air until mid-March. I know two months doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, and the feelings are still raw, but she still just wanted to keep trying. I think when you\u2019ve had great tragedy in your life, like she\u2019s had, there is a resilience that starts to come in, and you realize that for better or worse, life goes on and you\u2019re better off taking a chance. So we moved slowly [asking her to be \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d], but when she came around to it, it got really exciting. It started very slowly and then it got very serious in the middle of February. She actually hadn\u2019t signed until basically a couple of days ago, so it was definitely a lot of thinking. She\u2019s also very close with her family and I don\u2019t know if her family wanted her to jump right back into a show that caused her so much heartbreak, but they are supportive and that\u2019s fantastic.\r\n\r\nThere's been a lot of discussion surrounding the lack of diversity with leads on \"The Bachelor\" franchise, and just last year, Rachel Lindsay was the first-ever African American lead on \"The Bachelorette.\" What went into the decision naming Becca next season's lead?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m super proud of this cast [from Arie's season]. We look at everything, and diversity is not only ethnicity, but also it\u2019s the types of women that we had, and I was really happy that we had a lot of types of different women. We had a lot of professional women and strong women who are their own women. With Becca, it was really a no-brainer decision. I think everybody, after they see how this plays out, they\u2019re going to want to see her get her happy ending. This is a girl who\u2019s been through so much \u2014 she lost her dad to brain cancer, her mother had a battle with breast cancer. She\u2019s really strong and resilient, and you really root for her after the finale.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the season, Becca's boyfriend from her past showed up, and a lot of people on Twitter criticized that scene for seeming staged, solely to create drama. He obviously didn't just pop up in Peru, so how did he show up?\u00a0\r\n\r\nI\u2019m really glad you asked that. We sit down at the end of every season and we look at things and we say, \u201cThis is good, this worked, people didn\u2019t like this, or people responded to this.\u201d For me and the producers, something that really didn\u2019t sit right was when DeMario\u2019s [Jackson] girlfriend came back in Rachel\u2019s [Lindsay] season \u2014 it just felt completely fake and it felt like this woman had a speech prepared and was ready to go \u2014 so when you see all of that, if it plays as false, then it pulls on a sweater thread and the whole thing can fall apart because it all seems false, and it\u2019s not. So in this case, this guy reached out to production and said he heard Becca was on the show and he was really upset and wanted to see her. And as a producer, you think, \u2018That\u2019s a great storyline, if it\u2019s authentic.\u2019 But at the very least, we had to make sure that this guy was willing to put up the money to get to Peru, and see if this guy is genuine and didn\u2019t want to just get on TV \u2014 and he did. So once we realized that this guy really has feelings for Becca and he wants to go, we did it. This was a guy that Becca had spoken about many times on the show as the one big relationship that she had, and seven years, that\u2019s a long time. So that\u2019s how it all came to be.\r\n\r\nWhy did you originally cast Arie as this season\u2019s lead? Is it because he is a bit older, and perhaps ready for a real relationship?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s funny because Arie is the same age as Nick [Viall], but I think the reason why Arie comes off as older is because he has a more mature lifestyle. Nick Viall almost feels like an early-to-mid 20-something who is still figuring himself out and moved to L.A. Arie lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., where he\u2019s showing houses, and he\u2019s even slowed down with the racing. He\u2019s a grown-up. I think that\u2019s the difference, and that\u2019s part of what went into the decision-making. I thought Nick\u2019s season was great and I absolutely love Nick, but you watched that finale last year and he got engaged to Vanessa [Grimaldi], and it should have been this full-circle moment for him because he got so close with Andi [Dorfmann] and then he got so close with Kaitlyn [Bristowe] and then he finally found this person and it just felt like this thing is going to last for five minutes \u2014 and that\u2019s what ended up happening. And everyone has to do their own thing so I\u2019m not decrying anything that he did. But it just felt like we really wanted to find someone who was going to leave the spotlight after this was over, and that\u2019s Arie. He was never one of those people that was really on social media and stayed in \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d circle. He was just living his life.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the intention in casting Arie was to make this season the most authentic it could possibly be when it comes to looking for love, so why do you think ratings were down this season?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know, but I will tell you that I was surprised when the ratings were up when Nick [Viall] was \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d so sometimes you just don\u2019t know. Nick was a roll-of-the-dice because he\u2019d been on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d which is not usually the breeding ground for the lead, so sometimes you can\u2019t put your finger on these things. When Sean Lowe was \u201cThe Bachelor,\u201d it really came down to him and Arie, and it was down to the wire because people really wanted to see Arie be \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d because he was so heartbroken by Emily [Maynard] so when we were making \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d this year, it was surprising how many people said they didn\u2019t know who he was. I know five years is not yesterday, but it\u2019s also not so long ago. He was somebody who always remained in the conversation with fans \u2014 maybe not as many as I thought, but I thought there was a lot of appeal for Arie, and it was fascinating to see that we had to re-educate people [on Arie] on I think Arie also had to re-educate himself what it\u2019s like to be on this type of show. I think he has a lot of personality, and it\u2019s really on us for not showing more of that. You saw on \u201cThe Women Tell All\u201d that he is really very funny, and I think if we had maybe shown more of that, maybe that would have helped. Also, we premiered on New Year's Day and then the next day was the college football championship game and then you had the Olympics, so we had a lot of strikes against us. But it still felt like people cared \u2014 I heard a lot of chatter about the season online.\r\n\r\nSo you believe the numbers being down are due to competing programming and perhaps the lack of awareness for Arie \u2014 not any sort of \"Bachelor\" fatigue among audiences?\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s \u201cBachelor\u201d fatigue. The people that are watching, certainly all seem to like it and live for it. They might not like certain elements, but I haven\u2019t seen anyone say, \u201cI\u2019m done watching 'The Bachelor.'\u201d But it is an interesting time right now in the world, and there might be people who say, \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like I can get an escape right now because the world is in a weird place.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the flip side of that, do you think the political climate and intense news cycle serve as a benefit to the show because it can be an escape for viewers?\r\n\r\nI think that\u2019s right. Even when things are horrible on the show, as we\u2019ve seen in this finale, there still is a measure of hope. At the end of the day, we are trying to make a version of a fairytale here and there is something about love that is hopeful, even when it is love that\u2019s lost. There\u2019s always going to be hope at the end of the day. There is something hopeful and escapist about this show. We\u2019ve all made a fool of ourselves or gotten dumped, so I think there\u2019s so much\u00a0relatability to show.\r\n\r\nWhat do you expect Becca\u2019s season of \"The Bachelorette\" to be like?\r\n\r\nThis could be one of the stranger seasons of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d because she might not truly be over Arie and it may not work \u2014 I certainly hope it does, and we will do everything we possibly can to make sure it does, but you just don\u2019t know. It certainly is a chance worth taking.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR VIDEO:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/7iHVTpoErfE", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/7iHVTpoErfE?version=3&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://pmcvariety.wordpress.com&rel=1&fs=1&autohide=2&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1520458061.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
