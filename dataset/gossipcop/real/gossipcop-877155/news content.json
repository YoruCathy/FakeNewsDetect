Following suggestions from the public and the White House press corps, on September 6 Huckabee Sanders announced 12 organizations that would receive funds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe American Red Cross and the Salvation Army received the largest portions of the president\u2019s donation \u2013 $300,000 each.\n\nTwo groups associated with Christian ministries \u2013 Samaritan\u2019s Purse and Reach Out America \u2013 were promised $100,000 each.\n\n\n\nEight other groups \u2013 the ASPCA, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Habitat for Humanity, the Houston Humane Society, Operation Blessing, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon \u2013 would receive $25,000 apiece, the White House said earlier this month.\n\nThe Red Cross, which was slated to receive one of the larger donations from Trump, did not confirm a specific donation, however a spokesperson told The Hill the organization was \u201cgrateful to the Trumps for their generous support of our mission.\u201d\n\nHabitat for Humanity confirmed to The Hill the organization had received a check from the president and first lady Melania Trump.\n\nA Habitat for Humanity spokesperson told The Hill the president and first lady thanked the organization in a note for being \u201con the forefront of rebuilding our Nation and providing a critical helping hand for those in need.\u201d\n\nDisaster relief organizations Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon also confirmed to The Hill they received checks from the president and first lady to assist in Harvey relief.\n\nReach Out America said in a Facebook post two days before the White House announced the recipients that they had received a $100,000 donation from Trump.\n\n\u201cIt was a landmark day for Reach Out America when President Donald & First Lady Melania Trump visited First Church of Pearland, TX. The President & First Lady were there to encourage Hurricane Harvey survivors, and then passed out relief supplies. Larry Williamson, founder of Reach Out America received a generous donation of $100,000 from President Trump for ROA,\u201d the organization\u2019s Facebook page said.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s David Farenthold reported on Wednesday that Direct Relief, which is dedicated to improving \u201cthe health and lives of people affected by poverty and emergency,\u201d received a personal check from the president for $25,000.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News\u2019 Lauren McGaughy confirmed the animal charity the Houston Humane Society also received a check for $25,000.\n\nThe ASPCA, Operation Blessing, and Samaritan\u2019s Purse declined to discuss personal donations.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities for confirmation.\n\nTrump\u2019s record for fulfilling charitable pledges is not spotless.\n\nEarly in the Republican presidential primaries last year, the real estate mogul vowed to give $1 million of his personal fortune to veterans\u2019 charities, plus an additional $5 million he said he had raised during a fundraiser in Iowa ahead of the state\u2019s caucuses.\n\nBut it was revealed months later that Trump had not made good on that pledge, and only donated $1 million to the causes after facing pressure from media.\n\nSince then, however, the president has fulfilled his promise to donate his presidential salary, giving his first quarter pay to the National Parks Service and his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education.\n\nThe Associated Press also reported on Friday that nearly eight months after Trump was sworn into office, his inaugural committee still has not fulfilled a promise to donate leftover funds to charities.\n\nThe committee had raised an unprecedented $107 million for the inauguration.", "images":
