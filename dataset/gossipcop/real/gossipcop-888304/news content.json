In 2014, she founded The Happy Hippie Foundation in order to help combat homelessness, particularly among LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations.\n\nShe\u2019s not just the face and brains behind this important organization, Cyrus also puts her money where her mouth is. When the 25-year-old musician found out that a contestant from her team on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d was facing homelessness, Cyrus sprung into action.\n\nJanice Freeman appeared on season 13 of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d where she was part of Team Miley. Unfortunately, Freeman was eventually eliminated from the show. As fans of \u201cThe Voice\u201d who remember her know, Freeman has not had an easy road in life. Freeman had her daughter Hannah when she was 21, and when Hannah was just 4 years old, the girl\u2019s father died of cancer.\n\nThen, Freeman herself was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Although she survived her diagnosis, her financial state has been precarious, particularly after losing \u201cThe Voice.\u201d But, just when she thought her family could be homeless, her old friend Miley Cyrus stepped up to help.\n\nFreeman shared the story in this emotional video:\n\nAnd she later shared more about Cyrus\u2019s awesome generosity on her Twitter account:\n\nThank you ALL but she found us placement until we found permanent housing, gave me the deposit, covered me for 6 months so I can get on my feet! @MileyCyrus you are one of my closest friends and what you did for me and my family Im praying GOD gives you the desire of your heart! \u2014 Janice Freeman (@janice_freeman) January 1, 2018\n\nAs Freeman explained, Cyrus not only helped place she and her family into housing, but she also covered the deposit and paid for six months of rent, giving Freeman a chance to get on her feet.\n\nAs you can imagine, Freeman was beyond grateful and touched by the singer\u2019s selflessness. As she explained in this Instagram post, she considers their bond to be sacred and Cyrus to truly be her hero.\n\nWay to be an awesome example for other celebs, Miley!\n\nCheck out some of Freeman\u2019s performances on \u201cThe Voice\u201d below.\n\nHere she is singing Brandi Carlile\u2019s \u201cThe Story\u201d in her Top 12 performance.\n\nAnd here\u2019s her take on Mary J. Blige\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Goin\u2019 Down\u201d during the \u201cKnockouts\u201d round:\n\nAnd you have to listen to this battle with \u201cVoice\u201d co-contestant Katrina Rose. The duo took on Stevie Nicks and Etta James\u2019 W.O.M.A.N.:\n\nPretty impressive pipes, right? We\u2019re so happy she and her family have a secure place to call home.", "images": ["https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-14-at-00.24.01-150x150.png", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Bridget-Sharkey-Bio-Pic-120x120.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/simplemost_logo-s.png", "https://api.pymx5.com/v1/sites/track?event_type=PAGE_VIEW&noscript=1", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/simplemost_logo550.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=621503737999996&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/499497312_miley-cyrus-750x500.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/michael-che-150x150.jpg", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/joe-bagley-plants-150x150.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036471&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/tiramisu-oreos-e1587046443576-150x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-_RZ5Sz8Yt-BUw.gif", "https://trc.taboola.com/1138740/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/499497312_miley-cyrus.jpg", "https://trc.taboola.com/1147555/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-17-at-12.25.58-PM-150x150.png", "https://3apq7g38q3kw2yn3fx4bojii-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ariel-150x150.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/499497312_miley-cyrus.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Sharkey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.simplemost.com/miley-cyrus-janice-freeman-voice/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Helps \u2018The Voice\u2019 Contestant Find Housing After Cancer Battle", "meta_data": {"news_keywords": "helping others, homeless, inspiration, miley cyrus, pay it forward, the voice", "original-source": "https://www.simplemost.com/miley-cyrus-janice-freeman-voice/", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus Helps 'The Voice' Contestant Find Housing After Cancer Battle", "description": "Miley Cyrus is known for her powerful voice and her equally powerful opinions, but one thing that many people do not realize about her is that she's also a passionate philanthropist.
