The duo later make out and get hands-y in the bathroom on the sink.\n\n2002\n\nThe couple weren\u2019t always so secretive about their relationship. After making their official debut as a couple on the red carpet of the MTV Video Music Awards in 2002, they also coupled up a year later at the Once Upon a Time in Mexico premiere in New York City.\n\nImage zoom Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias Bill Davila/FilmMagic\n\nIn true turn of the century fashion, Kournikova showed off rock-hard abs in an all-white belly-baring ensemble with strappy heels while Enrique wore distressed flared denim jeans and a black dress shirt paired with a T-shirt.\n\n2004\n\nThe rumor mill went into overdrive about a possible engagement \u2014 or wedding \u2014 when Kournikova stepped onto the court at the World Team Tennis match with a blindingly large pink diamond ring on her ring finger. She later sported a simple band while out and about.\n\nImage zoom Anna Kournikova Jason Squires/WireImage\n\nReports circulated the duo had wed in a secret ceremony in Puerto Vallarta, but sources told PEOPLE at the time the rumors were false.\n\n2006 \u2013 2012\n\nThe pair appeared to be going strong for nearly a decade.\n\nIn 2006, they sat front and center at the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Miami Heat game in Miami, posed for photos at Big Pink restaurant and capped off the year with a date at Mauro\u2019s Cafe in December.\n\nImage zoom Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova Issac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty\n\nAnd the next year, Kournikova was photographed goofing around in a bikini with Iglesias while they prepared to board a boat in Miami. In December, they jetted to London and once again fueled wedding rumors when Kournikova was snapped with yet another plain band on her ring finger.\n\nIglesias fueled breakup rumors when he told a Swedish newspaper that the duo had been secretly married but were \u201cnow\u201d divorced. \u201cWe\u2019re divorced. I am single now, but that\u2019s okay,\u201d he told Aftonbladet. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being alone.\u201d\n\nHowever, a Kournikova pal told PEOPLE Iglesias was joking, and his rep also confirmed the duo were \u201cstill together.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Kournikova told PEOPLE she was \u201cnever getting married\u201d but added that \u201ceverything is good\u201d between her and Iglesias. Days later, the singer told reporters he had been trying to get his girlfriend to marry him for years. \u201cI always try, but she pays me no attention,\u201d he said as he arrived in the Dominican Republic for a series of concerts.\n\nThough they didn\u2019t attend many public events together for the rest of the decade, the duo were photographed going on dinner dates and vacationing in St. Barts.\n\nThe former tennis champ also opened up about hopefully becoming a mother in the future in a 2011 interview with Women\u2019s Health. \u201cI absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt,\u201d she told the mag. \u201cI love taking care of people.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 interview with Parade, Iglesias reiterated the duo had no plans to wed. \u201cI\u2019ve never really thought marriage would make a difference,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I come from divorced parents, but I don\u2019t think you love somebody more because of a piece of paper.\u201d\n\n2013 \u2013 2014\n\nIn late 2013, reports surfaced that the longtime couple had called it quits. But after the new year, they were photographed spending quality time together on a boat in Miami.\n\nThen in 2014, Iglesias shocked fans by again claiming he and Kournikova had divorced. \u201cI got a divorce three days ago and I wanted to give you guys the exclusive. I\u2019m serious. No, seriously. Don\u2019t laugh,\u201d he told reporters ahead of a performance at the Staples Center that October.\n\n2016\n\nKournikova proved all was well in 2016 when she posted a photo of her and Iglesias with her brother Allan on her Instagram account.\n\nOver the last few years, Kournikova also began sporting another massive ring \u2014 perhaps a yellow diamond? \u2014 complete with a matching diamond band.\n\n2017\n\nSixteen years after they first met, Iglesias and Kournikova reportedly became parents over the weekend. According to TMZ, the couple welcomed a boy and a girl named Nicholas and Lucy. Reps for the musician and athlete did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019d be a perfect mother,\u201d Iglesias once told PEOPLE en Espa\u00f1ol in 2007.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fenrique-iglesias-11-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fenrique-iglesias-21-1.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fenrique-iglesias-3.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fanna-kournikovia-1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fenrique-iglesias-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melody Chiu"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/enrique-iglesias-anna-kournikova-inside-private-relationship/", "title": "Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova: Inside Their Relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Anna Kournikova,Couples,Enrique Iglesias,Music News,News,Twins", "news_keywords": "Anna Kournikova,Couples,Enrique Iglesias,Music News,News,Twins", "description": "From meeting on set of Iglesias' steamy music video to reportedly welcoming twins, here's a look back at the singer and the former tennis pro's relationship", "og": {"title": "Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova: Inside Their Relationship", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/enrique-iglesias-anna-kournikova-inside-private-relationship/", "description": "Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova have been so secretive about their relationship that fans have often wondered if they\u2019re even still together.
