At all. It\u2019s probably the last thing that she wants to do, and not because she\u2019s in London working. She doesn\u2019t want to go to a dance with you because she\u2019s 28, and 28-year-old people don\u2019t want to go on dates with 16-year-old children because it\u2019s creepy.\"\n\nKimmel also addressed the awkwardness and gender roles involved, noting that Stone had been backed into a corner where she was was forced to respond or she would \"look like a jerk.\"\n\n\u201cWhy do we find it socially acceptable for a boy to ask an adult celebrity on a date?\u201d Kimmel asked. \u201cWhat if it was the other way around? What if Shailene Woodley \u2014 no, you know what? What if Shia LaBeouf showed up at a high school looking for a date? He\u2019d be arrested, right? He\u2019d be beaten and arrested. But when this kid asks Emma Stone, oh it\u2019s adorable (and) we put him on (Good Morning America). In fact, this is a hostage situation, because if Emma Stone didn\u2019t write him a letter, she would look like a jerk.\u201d\n\nThe moral of the story?\n\n\"Kids, don't look for your prom date in Us Weekly,\" he said. \"It's not cute.\"\n\nSee the full clip below.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e30afed5169a67365f7a6b40d01e9d83dd1c961/c=0-0-999-565/local/-/media/2017/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636276681015271069-146464-6989.jpg?width=999&height=565&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/16/USAT/4d8a8908-57d6-4c34-a2cc-f44dd8502152-b51007f0-adff-4d31-842a-49bf32e1ad1b_thumbnail.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e30afed5169a67365f7a6b40d01e9d83dd1c961/c=0-0-999-565/local/-/media/2017/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636276681015271069-146464-6989.jpg?width=660&height=374&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e30afed5169a67365f7a6b40d01e9d83dd1c961/c=0-0-999-565/local/-/media/2017/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636276681015271069-146464-6989.jpg?width=999&height=565&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/13/jimmy-kimmel-stop-celebrity-promposals-emma-stone/100408934/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel wants to stop celebrity promposals: 'It's creepy'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel wants to stop celebrity promposals: 'It's creepy'", "description": "\"Kids, don't look for your prom date in Us Weekly,\" he said. \"It's not cute.\"", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/13/jimmy-kimmel-stop-celebrity-promposals-emma-stone/100408934/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e30afed5169a67365f7a6b40d01e9d83dd1c961/c=0-0-999-565/local/-/media/2017/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636276681015271069-146464-6989.jpg?width=999&height=565&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 999, "height": 565}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Kelly Lawler", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "\"Kids, don't look for your prom date in Us Weekly,\" he said. \"It's not cute.\"", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e30afed5169a67365f7a6b40d01e9d83dd1c961/c=0-0-999-565/local/-/media/2017/04/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636276681015271069-146464-6989.jpg?width=999&height=499&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel wants to stop celebrity promposals: 'It's creepy'", "description": "\"Kids, don't look for your prom date in Us Weekly,\" he said. \"It's not cute.\""}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492012800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
