I just want to be loved.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Britta Pedersen/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa /MediaPunch\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was [surprised] for an artist of that magnitude to be so open and vulnerable,\u201d Dr. Singh tells PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m really having that experience with the majority of people that I work with because I think that I create a safe space for them to be themselves where I\u2019m not judging them.\u201d\n\nAfter the session, Perry \u201cactually said \u2018thank you for having such a safe space,'\u201d he adds. \u201cThe whole session was about the dichotomy of the conflict between her professional persona of Katy Perry and her individual human life of Katherine Hudson.
