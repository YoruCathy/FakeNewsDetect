He wants to be in a boxing movie, for example, before he gets too old, but be will not be appearing in any of the multiple Game of Thrones spinoff shows HBO is planning. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be spinoffs,\u201d he said in the March issue of Italian GQ, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to be involved in any of it.\u201d\n\nStill, he wishes the network the best, and sees an upside to the fact that none of the current cast members will appear on the new shows, all of which are planned as prequels to the main story. \u201cThe great thing about \u2018Thrones\u2019 for HBO is that you can sell it in a totally different way,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could set it 300 years earlier and save a load of money because we [the cast] are very expensive now.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, Harington, Emilia Clarke (Daenerys), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion), Lena Headey (Cersei) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie) all make between $500k and $1.1 million per episode, so he could have a point.\n\nHarington also remembered the heady early days before he commanded that kind of paycheck, and revealed the clincher that made him accept the role of Jon Snow in the first place, despite not fully understanding the show at first:\n\nIt was HBO, and that\u2019s all that really mattered to me. It was, and is, a staple of quality. But the script? I didn\u2019t really understand it. I read it twice and thought, This is the most bizarre thing ever. I don\u2019t quite get why they\u2019re doing it, but I\u2019m in. I do remember reading my role and thinking, This is in my locker \u2013 I can do this. Grumpy. Quiet. Solid. That\u2019s fine. I can do that.\n\nYes, we think he\u2019s nailed the grumpy quiet solid act by now.\n\nHarington named season 2 as the most significant year for him, since that was when \u201cwe realized it was a show that was successful, we were suddenly in this incredible location \u2013 and I was with the girl that I fell in love with.\u201d\n\nThat girl would be Rose Leslie (Ygritte), to whom Harington is now engaged.\n\nAs for life after the credits roll on season 8 of Game of Thrones, the door is wide open.\n\nI freaked out. That\u2019s ending, what am I going to do now? And then I suddenly realized that next year I can do two films and a play. Or I could do another show which I\u2019ve never been able to do since being on \u2018Thrones\u2019. And\u2026 I could take two months off and spend them with Rose! We can go off somewhere! I suddenly got really excited about it.\n\nWe look forward to the Rocky reboot starring Kit Harington.\n\nTo stay up to date on everything Game of Thrones, follow our all-encompassing Facebook page and sign up for our exclusive newsletter.\n\nWatch Game of Thrones for FREE with a no-risk, 7-day free trial of Amazon Channels\n\nh/t ET Canada", "images": ["https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/winteriscoming/logo_winteriscoming-net__150x150.png", "https://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/android-app.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1578981752316085&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,f_auto,w_150,h_150/https://fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/winteriscoming/logo_winteriscoming-net__150x150.png", "https://winteriscoming.net/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/apple-app.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035728&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FJon-Snow-Official.jpg", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_850,h_560,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FJon-Snow-Official-850x560.jpg", "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/fansided-logo.svg", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,g_auto,f_auto,h_963,w_1901/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F10%2FJon-Snow-and-Ygritte.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2FJon-Snow-Official.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Selcke", "Corey Smith", "David Harris", "Razor"], "canonical_link": "https://winteriscoming.net/2018/03/14/kit-harington-will-not-game-thrones-spinoffs/", "title": "Kit Harington says he won\u2019t star in any Game of Thrones spinoffs, because duh", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "He also discusses the reasons why he got involved with Game of Thrones in the first place.
