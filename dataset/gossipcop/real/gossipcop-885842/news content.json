In May, Weinstein was arrested in New York on charges of rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct related to interactions with two women.\n\nA report from Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker also details Weinstein\u2019s alleged and elaborate efforts to silence journalists and accusers. The former movie executive denies the new accusations and \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex,\u201d but said in a statement to the Times that, \u201cI appreciate the way I\u2019ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.\u201d\n\nThe Weinstein scandal has sparked a national conversation about sexual misconduct and prompted others to come forward with accusations ranging from groping to rape against others, including former Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick, actor Morgan Freeman and former President George H. W. Bush.\n\nThese are the prominent public figures who have been accused of sexual misconduct after the Harvey Weinstein allegations.\n\n144.

Ronald Martinez\u2014Getty Images\n\nMMA fighter Conor McGregor is under investigation in Ireland after a woman accused him of sexual assault in December, the New York Times reported on March 26. According to the Times, the woman said the alleged incident occurred at the Beacon Hotel in Dublin.\n\nMcGregor has not been charged with a crime as of March 27. The news of the investigation came on the same day after McGregor announced his retirement on Twitter. McGregor has not publicly commented on the allegations, but his publicist released a statement calling his retirement unrelated to reports about the investigation.\n\n\u201cThis story has been circulating for some time, and it is unclear why it is being reported now,\u2019\u2019 the statement said, according to the Times. \u201cThe assumption that the Conor retirement announcement today is related to this rumor is absolutely false.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for McGregor didn\u2019t immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n143. Ryan Adams\n\nRyan Adams performs in concert on the first day of week one of the Austin City Limits Music Festival at Zilker Park on October 6, 2017 in Austin, Texas. Gary Miller\u2014FilmMagic/Getty Images\n\nThe New York Times reported on Feb. 13 that seven women accused singer Ryan Adams of offering to help their music careers but then pursued them sexually. One woman said Adams sent her inappropriate sexual messages while she was underage. This Is Us star Mandy Moore, who was married to Adams from 2009 to 2016, said the singer was emotionally abusive during their relationship and stifled her own musical ambitions. Singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers said Adams became obsessive and controlling during a brief relationship. Once she broke up with Adams, Bridgers said, he rescinded offers to help further her musical career.\n\nIn a statement to the Times, a lawyer for Adams \u201cunequivocally denie[d] that he ever engaged in inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage.\u201d In a series of tweets published on Feb. 13, Adams further denied the claims in the article, while apologizing to anyone he had hurt, \u201chowever unintentionally.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a perfect man and I have made many mistakes. To anyone I have ever hurt, however unintentionally, I apologize deeply and unreservedly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the picture that this article paints is upsettingly inaccurate. Some of its details are misrepresented; some are exaggerated; some are outright false.\u201d\n\n142.

Mayorga\u2019s attorney filed a civil complaint regarding her allegation last month, which also alleges that she signed a non-disclosure agreement in 2010 for an out-of-court settlement of $375,000.\n\nIn a statement posted on Twitter, Ronaldo denied Mayorga\u2019s allegation. \u201cI firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense,\u201d he wrote.\n\nRonaldo was left off Portugal\u2019s national soccer team for two November games following the reports. Portugal coach Fernando Santos said he expects Ronaldo to play for Portugal in the future.\n\n141. Brett Kavanaugh\n\nSupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on Thursday September 6, 2018. The Washington Post\u2014The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nChristine Blasey Ford, a professor at Palo Alto University, accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her when they were both in high school. In an interview with the Washington Post published on Sept. 16, Blasey Ford said that an intoxicated Kavanaugh pinned her down on a bed and groped her during a party. She said Kavanaugh put his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. She said she was able to escape when another man at the party jumped on top of both Kavanaugh and Blasey Ford.\n\nIn a statement on Friday sent by the White House to the Post, Kavanaugh said: \u201cI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\u201d The White House issued another statement on Monday denying the allegation. \u201cOn Friday, Judge Kavanaugh \u2018categorically and unequivocally\u2019 denied this allegation,\u201d a White House spokesperson said, according to the Post. \u201cThis has not changed. Judge Kavanaugh and the White House both stand by that statement.\u201d\n\nIn a second statement released by the White House on Monday, Kavanaugh said: \u201cThis is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describes \u2014 to her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. I am wiling to talk to the Senate Judiciary Committee in any way the Committee deems appropriate to refuse this false allegation, from 36 years ago, and defend my integrity.\u201d\n\nBlasey Ford initially contacted the Post in July through a tip line, and sent a letter to Democrat Anna Eshoo, her congresswoman, in July. In August, she decided not to come forward, fearing it would negatively affect her life, according to the Post. She changed her mind after The New Yorker reported that a woman sent a letter to Democrats in Congress detailing the alleged incident.\n\n140.

Fager\u2019s departure comes just days after CBS CEO Les Moonves left the company amid allegations of sexual harassment. In The New Yorker\u2018s Sept. 9 story about Moonves, six women said that Fager had touched employees at company parties and protected male subordinates accused of sexual harassment. Sarah Johansen told the magazine that Fager groped her at a work party when she was an intern at CBS in the 2000s.\n\nCBS News President David Rhodes said in a statement, according to CNN, that the \u201caction today is not directly related to the allegations surfaced in press reports, which continue to be investigated independently. However, he violated company policy and it is our commitment to uphold those policies at every level.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Fager said: \u201cThe company\u2019s decision had nothing to do with the false allegations printed in The New Yorker. Instead, they terminated my contract early because I sent a text message to one of our own CBS reporters demanding that she be fair in covering the story. My language was harsh and, despite the fact that journalists receive harsh demands for fairness all the time, CBS did not like it. One such note should not result in termination after 36 years but it did.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report from CBS News, Fager texted CBS News correspondent Jericka Duncan: \u201cIf you repeat these false allegations without any of your own reporting to back them up you will be held responsible for harming me. Be careful. There are people who lost their jobs trying to harm me and if you pass on these damaging claims without your own reporting to back them up that will become a serious problem.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for CBS did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n139.

The woman filed a criminal complaint Monday, which alleges Depardieu sexually assaulted her on August 7 and August 13 in his home in Paris, according to French newspaper Le Parisien.\n\nDepardieu\u2019s attorney, Herve Temime, said on France\u2019s BFM TV that Depardieu \u201cabsolutely denies any rape, any sexual assault, any crime.\u201d Temime did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n138. Asia Argento\n\nItalian actress Asia Argento in Cannes, southern France on May 19, 2018. Loic Venance\u2014 AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe New York Times reported on Aug. 19 that Asia Argento, an Italian actress and one of the first women to publicly accuse of Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, quietly paid $380,000 to Jimmy Bennett after he accused her of sexually assaulting him in a California hotel room in 2013 when he was 17 and she was 37. The Times story was based on documents the paper received anonymously.\n\nBennett issued his first public statement through his attorney on Aug. 22, which said: \u201cI did not initially speak out about my story because I chose to handle in private with the person who had wronged me. My trauma resurfaced as she came out as a victim herself. I have not made a public statement in the past days and hours because I was ashamed and afraid to be part of the public narrative.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released on Aug. 21, Argento called the allegation \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and denied ever having a sexual relationship with Bennett. She said her late partner Anthony Bourdain recommended paying Bennett to avoid \u201cpossible negative publicity that such a person, whom he considered dangerous, could have brought upon us.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department said it was aware of the alleged incident, and a spokesperson for the department told TIME that it is attempting to reach out to Bennett and his representatives \u201cin an effort to appropriately document any potential criminal allegations.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 27, Variety reported that Argento had been fired as a judge from Italy\u2019s X Factor. Argento has not yet commented, and her agent did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nOn Sept. 5, Argento\u2019s new attorney, Mark Heller, released a statement that said: \u201cAs revealed in the text messages published by TMZ, Asia stated, \u2018The horny kid jumped me \u2026 I had sex with him it felt weird.\u2019 She went on to relate that she became \u2018frozen\u2019 when he was on top of her and told her that she had been his sexual fantasy since he was 12 years old. Asia chose at the time not to prosecute Bennett for sexually attacking her.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said that Bourdain only paid Bennett $250,000 of the $380,000 settlement, and Argento will not be making any more payments to Bennett.\n\nBennett\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment on Heller\u2019s statement.\n\n137. Les Moonves\n\nLes Moonves attends the 2017 American Songbook Gala at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center on February 1, 2017 in New York City. Andrew Toth\u2014FilmMagic\n\nCBS CEO Les Moonves has been accused of sexual harassment spanning three decades, according to a report by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker. Six women told Farrow that Moonves had behaved inappropriately toward them between the 1980s and late 2000s, including four who alleged that he touched them inappropriately and two who accused him of physical intimidation and threatening behavior.\n\n\u201cThroughout my time at CBS, we have promoted a culture of respect and opportunity for all employees, and have consistently found success elevating women to top executive positions across our Company,\u201d Moonves said in a statement to TIME. \u201cI recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected \u2013 and abided by the principle \u2013 that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career.\n\nThe New Yorker report also contradicts the first part of Moonves\u2019 statement, suggesting that harassment may have occurred across the organization. Several employees, for example, accused former chairman of CBS News and a current executive producer of 60 Minutes Jeff Fager of inappropriately touching or flirting with colleagues, and of turning a blind eye toward other misconduct, according to the story.\n\nOn Sept. 9, The New Yorker reported six other women accused Moonves of sexual assault or harassment. including allegations that he forced two women to perform oral sex on him.\n\nIn a statement to The New Yorker, Moonves said: \u201cThe appalling accusations in this article are untrue. What is true is that I had consensual relations with three of the women some 25 years ago before I came to CBS. And I have never used my position to hinder the advancement or careers of women. In my 40 years of work, I have never before heard of such disturbing accusations. I can only surmise they are surfacing now for the first time, decades later, as part of a concerted effort by others to destroy my name, my reputation, and my career. Anyone who knows me knows that the person described in this article is not me.\u201d\n\nMoonves resigned from CBS hours after the second The New Yorker report was published. In a statement, the network said it would donate $20 million \u2014 deducted from severance benefits owed to Moonves \u2014 to organizations that support the #MeToo movement. The network\u2019s chief operating officer Joseph Ianniello will serve as CEO and president until a permanent replacement is named. Moonves\u2019 contract stipulated that he could receive $180 million in severance. But CBS\u2019 board said it will wait to determine Moonves\u2019 severance after the conclusion of an external investigation into the allegations against Moonves.\n\n136. Chris Hardwick\n\nChris Hardwick attends the 100th episode celebration off \"The Walking Dead\" at The Greek Theatre on October 22, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. Jason LaVeris\u2014FilmMagic\n\nActor Chloe Dykstra wrote in an essay published on Medium that an ex-boyfriend, whom she identified only as someone who \u201cgrew from a mildly successful podcaster to a powerhouse CEO of his own company,\u201d sexually and emotionally abused her. The post was widely believed to be about Chris Hardwick, a TV and podcast host and founder of Nerdist Industries.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Hardwick said: \u201cI\u2019m devastated to read that she is now accusing me of conduct that did not occur,\u201d he said. \u201cl was blindsided by her post and always wanted the best for her. As a husband, a son, and future father, I do not condone any kind of mistreatment of women.\u201d\n\nAMC said on June 18 that it was suspending Hardwick\u2019s show, Talking with Chris Hardwick. NBC said it would \u201cassess\u201d Hardwick\u2019s role as game show host on The Wall. On July 25, AMC said Hardwick would return to the network. \u201cFollowing a comprehensive assessment by AMC, working with Ivy Kagan Bierman of the firm Loeb & Loeb, who has considerable experience in this area, Chris Hardwick will return to AMC as the host of Talking Dead and Talking With Chris Hardwick,\u201d the network said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning Chris to work is the appropriate step.\u201d\n\n135.

The allegations including unwanted touching and suggestive comments, CNN reported.\n\nMorgan Freeman denied the allegations in a statement sent to TIME: \u201cI am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday\u2019s media reports. All victims of assault and harassment deserve to be heard. And we need to listen to them. But it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor.\u201d\n\n134.

Chicago Tribune\u2014TNS via Getty Images\n\nWriter Zinzi Clemmons wrote on Twitter that Junot D\u00edaz forcibly kissed her when she was a grad student. In an April essay for The New Yorker, D\u00edaz wrote about being raped as a child and said he cheated on girlfriends and \u201churt people\u201d in adulthood.\n\nIn a statement to the New York Times, D\u00edaz said: \u201cI take responsibility for my past. That is the reason I made the decision to tell the truth of my rape and its damaging aftermath. This conversation is important and must continue. I am listening to and learning from women\u2019s stories in this essential and overdue cultural movement. We must continue to teach all men about consent and boundaries.\u201d\n\nIn May, D\u00edaz stepped down as the chair of the Pulitzer Prizes amid a review into the allegations, though he remains on the board. MIT, where D\u00edaz served as a professor, cleared him of misconduct in June following an investigation.\n\nIn an interview with The Boston Globe published June 30, D\u00edaz denied the allegations. \u201cI was shocked\u2026 I was, like, \u2018Yo, this doesn\u2019t sound like anything that\u2019s in my life, anything that\u2019s me,\u2019\u201d he told the paper. \u201cI did not kiss anyone. I did not forcibly kiss Zinzi Clemmons. I did not kiss Zinzi Clemmons.\u201d\n\nHe added that he regretted the statement he sent to the Times after the allegations were made public. \u201cI\u2019ve written a lot of crap in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cOne does when one\u2019s a writer. But, definitely, that statement is the worst thing I\u2019ve written, the worst thing I\u2019ve put my name to. Boy, I wish I\u2019d had the presence of mind to rewrite the damn thing.\u201d\n\n133. Tom Brokaw\n\nTom Brokaw has withdrawn as commencement speaker at Sacred Heart University Matt Rourke\u2014AP\n\nTwo women \u2014 former NBC journalist Linda Vester and an unnamed woman who previously worked as a production assistant at the network \u2014 accused Tom Brokaw of making unwanted sexual advances. Vester said the veteran NBC News anchor tried to forcibly kiss her twice and groped her once, while the production assistant said Brokaw suggestively invited her to his office to discuss her career. Brokaw told the Washington Post that neither incident occurred.\n\nBrokaw said in a statement issued by NBC: \u201cI met with Linda Vester on two occasions, both at her request, 23 years ago, because she wanted advice with respect to her career at NBC. The meetings were brief, cordial and appropriate, and despite Linda\u2019s allegations, I made no romantic overtures towards her, at that time or any other.\u201d\n\n132. John Kricfalusi\n\nTwo women told BuzzFeed News that John Kricfalusi, the creator of popular cartoon Ren & Stimpy, sexually preyed on them as teenagers. Both women said that they reached out to Kricfalusi to mentor them in animation.\n\nKricfalusi\u2019s attorney said in a statement to BuzzFeed: \u201cThe 1990s were a time of mental and emotional fragility for Mr. Kricfalusi, especially after losing Ren and Stimpy, his most prized creation. For a brief time, 25 years ago, he had a 16-year-old girlfriend. Over the years John struggled with what were eventually diagnosed mental illnesses in 2008. To that point, for nearly three decades he had relied primarily on alcohol to self-medicate. Since that time he has worked feverishly on his mental health issues, and has been successful in stabilizing his life over the last decade. This achievement has allowed John the opportunity to grow and mature in ways he\u2019d never had a chance at before.\u201d\n\nHe later posted an 11-page apology to the two women on Facebook, writing: \u201cI wish I could have made my apologies directly to you but now that have gone public, it seems this is the only way for me to express myself\u2026 There is some general truth in [the BuzzFeed story], some things I remember somewhat differently, some not at all. The writer exaggerated and presented some things out of context for tabloid consumption.\u201d\n\n131.

Ferro announced he was resigning from Tronc\u2019s board of directors hours before the story was published. In April, Ferro said he would sell his shares in Tronc.\n\nFerro\u2019s spokesperson told Fortune: \u201cOver more than 20 years of leading public companies and other enterprises, Michael Ferro has never had a claim filed against him nor a settlement made on his behalf. Your on-the-record allegations appear to involve private conduct with private individuals who were not employees of tronc or any other company he ran. As recently announced, Mr. Ferro has retired back to private life after leading a financial turnaround of tronc as the non-executive chairman. There will, therefore, be no other comment.\u201d\n\n130. Richard Meier\n\nArchitect Richard Meier arrives for the Robin Hood Foundation gala in New York, U.S., on Monday, May 10, 2010.

To those whom I have hurt, I genuinely apologize.. There are women telling the truth about my behavior and I have no recollection of physically threatening anybody or their careers.\u201d\n\nBut in the same statement, Alexie said that he denied \u201cthe accusations, insinuations, and outright falsehoods\u201d made by Dremousis.\n\n\u201cShe has withheld from the public the fact that she and I had previously been consenting sexual partners,\u201d he added. \u201cMs. Dremousis has continually tweeted and spoken in public about my behavior, making accusations based on rumors and hearsay and quoting anonymous sources.\u201d\n\nA week later, NPR spoke to three women on the record who said Alexie had made inappropriate comments and unwanted sexual advances. Alexie has not commented further on the allegations, and he declined to accept the prestigious Carnegie Medal in March.\n\n128.

I can say without a doubt that I have never used favors, sexual or otherwise, as a reason for managing anyone. I want to make it clear that not one of those relationships were anything but consensual,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cI take responsibility for my part in the situation and I am not here to diminish anyone\u2019s feelings or experiences. I apologize to these women, my past and present partner, my clients and employees for the pain this is bringing them. I was under the impression I was living my life as a supportive man to women. It is with a heavy heart that I see now I was wrong.\u201d\n\nBoth Berry and Henson spoke out against Cirrincione following the Post\u2019s report.\n\n124.

I have never touched her inappropriately.

He will stay on as chief creative officer and as a member of the board until his contract expires in January, the company said.\n\nThe company\u2019s investigation found that Marciano \u201cexercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers and in placing himself in situations in which plausible allegations of improper conduct could, and did, arise.\u201d\n\n123.

In one alleged incident, a manicurist who worked at the Wynn Last Vegas said that casino mogul forced her to have sex. The woman\u2019s supervisor later filed a report to the casino\u2019s HR department, and Wynn later paid the woman a $7.5 million settlement, according to the Journal.\n\nIn a statement to the Journal, Wynn denied the allegations. \u201cThe idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering insulting publicity or engaging in multi-year lawsuits. It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.\u201d\n\nHe added that the allegations were the \u201ccontinued work of my ex-wife Elaine Wynn, with whom I am involved in a terrible and nasty lawsuit in which she is seeking a revised divorce settlement.\u201d\n\n121.

In a statement released on his Twitter and Instagram pages shortly before The Wrap published its report, Copperfield said: \u201cThe #MeToo movement is crucial and long overdue. We all want people who feel they\u2019ve been victims of sexual misconduct to be empowered, and as a rule we should listen, so more will feel comfortable coming forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut imagine what it\u2019s like, believing in the movement, and having also been falsely accused publicly in the past,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlways listen, and consider everything carefully, but please for everyone\u2019s sake don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d\n\nCopperfield\u2019s statement appears to reference a 2007 allegation made by Lacey Carroll, who told authorities Copperfield invited her to his home in the Bahamas and sexually assaulted her. The FBI investigated Carroll\u2019s claims, but the case was closed without charges against Copperfield. Carroll was later arrested for prostitution and providing a false police report in connection with a separate case, in which she accused another man of sexual assault. She denied the charges, but pleaded guilty to obstructing a police officer, according to the Seattle Times.\n\n120.

In the interview, Douglas preemptively denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cI felt the need to get ahead of this,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely painful. I pride myself on my reputation in this business, not to mention the long history of my father and everything else\u2026 It has caused tremendous stress to me for something I believe I have nothing to regret or feel responsible for.\u201d\n\n119.

He named me in the allegations, claiming I fired him because he refused to have sex with me. That is a lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in a national moment where rough justice stands in place of careful analysis, nuance and due process,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOn balance, it is far more important to me that women are stepping forward to tell their stories and confront their harassers than it is to continue our campaign.\u201d\n\n102.

By recognizing and openly admitting what I\u2019ve done to further this terrible situation, I hope to empower the change within myself. We should all find the courage to admit we\u2019re at fault. More than anything, I\u2019m hopeful that I can start to rebuild the trust and the respect of those I love most. I\u2019m not sure I deserve it, but I will work everyday to earn it back.

I have always tried to be a leader and supportive of them, and many of them have gone on to highly successful careers in radio, journalism and other fields\u2026 \u201cIn the pressure of a live radio environment, I have at times been a tough and demanding boss. We aspire to put out a top-notch show. Many people have thrived in that environment; a few have not.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe how deeply upsetting this is to me,\u201d he added. \u201cI am sure that once the facts come out that people will see me for who I am \u2013 flawed but caring and decent in all my dealings with others.\u201d\n\n85.

Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family\u2026 We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won\u2019t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there.\u201d\n\n84. Cade Hudson\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on Dec. 9 that Hudson, a prominent agent at Creative Artists Agency, offered actor Sean Rose sex in exchange for access to directors and a movie star.

The agency counts Warner Brothers, Chevrolet, Discover, Dunkin Donuts and Oreo among its clients.\n\nAlexander denied the allegations. \u201cThe allegations you are reporting on are false.

Please respect my privacy during this very, very sad time.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 12, the Martin Agency announced it had appointed Kristen Cavallo as its first female CEO, replacing Matt Williams.\n\n81.

Bryan Singer\n\nProducer Bryan Singer attends the premiere of \"Legion\" at Pacific Design Center on January 26, 2017 in West Hollywood, California. Jason LaVeris\u2014FilmMagic\n\nThe X-Men director faces a lawsuit for allegedly raping then-17-year-old Cesar Sanchez-Guzman in 2003. In the suit, which was filed on Dec. 7, Guzman claims that he met Singer at a party on a yacht and the director offered to give him a tour of the boat. In one of the boat\u2019s rooms, Guzman claims, Singer \u201cforced Cesar to the floor, shoved Cesar\u2019s face against his crotch area and demanded Cesar perform oral sex on him.\u201d\n\nSinger denies Guzman\u2019s allegations. In a statement. his representative said: \u201cBryan categorically denies these allegations and will vehemently defend this lawsuit to the very end. Cesar Sanchez-Guzman apparently claims that he did not remember this alleged incident from 2003 until now. Significantly, when Sanchez-Guzman filed for bankruptcy only a few years ago, he failed to disclose this alleged claim when he was supposed to identify all of his assets, but conveniently, now that the bankruptcy court discharged all of his debts, he is able to recall the alleged events.\u201d\n\nSinger has faced two other civil suits over allegations of sexual harassment in the past. In 2014, Michael Egan claimed in a lawsuit that Singer forced him to have sex in California and Hawaii in the 1990s, which Singer\u2019s then-attorney called \u201cabsurd and defamatory.\u201d Egan later dropped the lawsuit because he couldn\u2019t find a new attorney to represent him, but argued his case still had merit.\n\nThat same year, an anonymous man filed a lawsuit against Singer and director Gary Goddard, which alleged that Singer attempted to force him into sex and fondled him when he was 17. Singer denied that allegation at the time and the court dismissed the lawsuit on the grounds that there was \u201cno legal basis\u201d for the suit.\n\n78.

In a reply, according to HuffPost, Ford agreed and apologized.\n\nFord Jr., who comes from a prominent political family in Tennessee, joined Morgan Stanley in 2011 as a managing director. Morgan Stanley confirmed in a statement to HuffPost: \u201cHe has been terminated for conduct inconsistent with our values and in violation of our policies.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Ford Jr. denied the allegation. \u201cThis simply did not happen. I have never forcibly grabbed any woman or man in my life. Having dinner and drinks for work is part of my job, and all of my outreach to the news reporter making these false allegations was professional and at the direction of my firm for business purposes. I support and have tremendous respect for the brave women now speaking out in this important national dialogue. False claims like this undermine the real silence breakers. I will now be brining legal action against the reporter who has made these false claims about me as well as Morgan Stanley for improper termination.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Ford Jr. did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\nMorgan Stanley said in a statement later in January: \u201cThe press has reported that Mr. Ford was terminated for sexual misconduct. He was not. We have not received any internal allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct involving him either before or after his separation became public.\u201d\n\n77.

But he insisted all encounters were consensual and occurred before he wed in 2015.\n\n\u201cAt times in the past, I blurred the personal and the professional in ways that were, I now recognize, disrespectful of my colleagues and our contributors, and that made them feel uncomfortable or demeaned,\u201d Stein wrote, according to the Times. \u201cI am very sorry for any hurt I caused them.\u201d\n\n76.

He said: \u201cWe have come to a time where hard-earned careers are being lost on the basis of accusations. I need to reiterate that these accusations against me are false. We have lost the presumption of innocence; we have lost \u2018due process\u2019; and we have lost the ability to review evidence \u2014 allowing the media to become both \u2018judge and jury.\u2019 Until I can sit down and have a dialogue with my accusers, managed not by the press but by an impartial mediator, I have nothing further to say on this matter. My wife, family and close friends, know me and my true nature and I am grateful for their love and support.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Knepper did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n75.

I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one,\u201d Masterson said in a statement to HuffPost. \u201cIn this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all.\u201d\n\nIn March, People reported that the former That 70s Show star was being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department after three women accused him of sexual assault in the early 2000s.

In a statement provided to New York, Hockenberry said: \u201cI\u2019ve always had a reputation for being tough, and certainly I\u2019ve been rude, aggressive and impolite. Looking back, my behavior was not always appropriate and I\u2019m sorry. It horrifies me that I made the talented and driven people I worked with feel uncomfortable, and that the stress around putting together a great show was made worse by my behavior. Having to deal with my own physical limitations [Hockenberry is paralyzed from the waist down] has given me an understanding of powerlessness, and I should have been more aware of how the power I wielded over others, coupled with inappropriate comments and communications, could be construed. I have no excuses.\u201d\n\n71. Bruce Weber\n\nPhotographer Bruce Weber attends the 2017 Gordon Parks Foundation Awards Gala on June 6, 2017 in New York City. Ilya S.

It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It\u2019s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by people I love.
