My Next Guest Needs No Introduction will be a six-episode limited series which, unlike most shows within the Netflix purview, will be released one at a time, monthly, rather than all at once. Here's a teaser.\n\nLetterman's been off TV since his widely-publicized retirement in May 2015, which was overshadowed by his even-more-publicized retirement beard. Yeah, it's only been two and a half years. But that's a long time in TV.\n\nA good crop of guests make up the first season: George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey, Howard Stern, and freakin' Barack Obama. The first episode is set to hit Netflix on January 12.", "images": ["https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-reverse.2fe772617ee3b7f2fc81c9f7237c17495b42eaee.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5d9622fc4afa850008f6a744/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/GQ-StaffPortraits-8203.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/logo-header.d739eb0c2af2cf500d0c7ebecd1d6597474e69aa.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Philip", "Tom Phili"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/david-lettermans-new-netflix-show-has-some-stellar-guests-lined-up", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Tom Philip", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The Late Show standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "id": "5a4fb06878ce215ac7f467d2", "keywords": "culture,david letterman,entertainment,tv", "news_keywords": "culture,david letterman,entertainment,tv", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a4fb06878ce215ac7f467d2", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The Late Show standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "'The Late Show' standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/david-lettermans-new-netflix-show-has-some-stellar-guests-lined-up"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "'The Late Show' standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctBVhyZxXYY"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
