He wasn\u2019t. The viewers may think he was, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Vicki explained to E! News. \u201cDid he turn into a monster towards the end? He did a lot of weird ass crazy things that I still don\u2019t understand because I don\u2019t talk to him.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he did what he did, but he wasn\u2019t a monster. He wasn\u2019t really the man I thought he was if he did what he did to me.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Vicki says if she could talk to Brooks one on one she\u2019d ask him one question: why?\n\n\u201cWhy did you reveal bad records? Why did you do what you did to me?\u201d Vicki explained. \u201cWe had a good thing going, or so I thought, but why? I still don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve never been able to get the answer from him.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t remember Brooks faked cancer and showed off fake cancer documents to the media and Vicki\u2019s RHOC co-stars in hopes of shutting down doubts about his health.\n\nUltimately, it was revealed that Brooks never had cancer and was never treated by City of Hope Medical Center.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, Vicki called her relationship with Brooks \u201cgreat\u201d in the RHOC season 12 premiere. Gag!\n\nOh, Vicki. Somehow I feel like Vicki isn\u2019t fully over Brooks and I don\u2019t think she ever will be. Why is she still talking about him? No one cares. And anything Vicki says about Brooks isn\u2019t going to change people\u2019s minds about Brooks or her possible involvement in his cancer scam. It\u2019s a shame Vicki can\u2019t seem to forget Brooks especially when her new boyfriends seems so great. I want Vicki to be happy, and I think she is with her new man so I wish she\u2019d just close the chapter on Brooks. You know, outta sight outta mind.\n\nThoughts on Vicki\u2019s interview? Why do you think Vicki still talks about Brooks? Was Brooks a monster? Do you believe Vicki never knew anything about Brooks cancer scam? Was Vicki\u2019s relationship with Brooks \u201cgreat?\u201d Does Vicki need to stop talking about Brooks?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-80x80.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jim-Edmonds-Speaks-Out-After-Meghan-King-Edmonds-Threesome-Friend-Is-Identified.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kara-Keough-Brother-Shane-Pays-Tribute-to-Baby-McCoy-After-His-Death-Feature.jpg", "https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/NUP_152234_0566.jpg", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/teresa-giudice-1.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320&ssl=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Jennifer-Aydin.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tamra-braunwyn.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vicki.jpg?fit=654%2C447&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bravocon-.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/180716_3762858_Did_Vicki_Gunvalson_Set_Up_Kelly_Dodd_s_Ex_.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small-1.png", "https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/RHONJ-season-10-gia-giudice-frank-catania-ava-tortorici-miss-teen-usa-nj.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vicki.jpg?fit=654%2C447&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/07/11/vicki-gunvalson-reflects-brooks-ayers-drama-wasnt-monster/", "title": "Vicki Gunvalson Reflects on Brooks Ayers Drama: \"He Wasn't a Monster\" - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Vicki Gunvalson Reflects on Brooks Ayers Drama: \"He Wasn't a Monster\" - The Real Housewives | News.
