On last night\u2019s Season 12 premiere, the Bravolebrity opened up about her sudden weight gain and how she\u2019s focused on getting her life back. Ahead of the episode on Monday, July 10, the 53-year-old took to Instagram to address her haters and come clean about her body struggles.\n\n\u201cSo let's just get to it. Yes, I have gained weight. A lot of weight. About 40 pounds to be exact. I have not had plastic surgery or fillers, it's just plain and simple weight gain,\u201d she captioned the photo. \u201cThere are multiple factors that have contributed to my size and it will be addressed this season on the show.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Shannon Beador (@shannonbeador) on Jul 10, 2017 at 2:15pm PDT\n\nThough she\u2019s OK with showing her struggles on TV, she doesn\u2019t have time for any of the haters.\n\n\"To those people who intend to write cruel or derogatory comments to me, I want to let you know you will be blocked and the comment deleted,\" she continued.\n\n\"Gaining weight and trying to take it off is a struggle that most women will face at some point in their lives. I am hopeful that my fans and viewers of the show will be supportive of my journey.\" Then, during the episode, the mother of three acknowledged the rumor she started gaining weight following her husband\u2019s infidelity scandal in 2015.\n\nA post shared by Shannon Beador (@shannonbeador) on Jun 24, 2017 at 8:27pm PDT\n\n\"I knew an allegation was put out there about my husband ... that stress caused me to eat more, caused me to drink more, and that's a huge part of why I gained my weight,\u201d she said.\n\nA post shared by Shannon Beador (@shannonbeador) on Jun 18, 2017 at 12:06pm PDT\n\n\u201cMy weight gain has affected me and how I feel about myself. I'm embarrassed of my body.\u201d\n\nShannon first addressed her body issues in the Season 12 trailer when she blamed former friend Vicki Gunvalson for her packing on the pounds. \"All I want to do is eat. I just don't understand how I let myself go,\u201d she said as she pointed to her body. \u201cThis is stress, and that is Vicki Gunvalson.\"\n\nThe reality star also showed how much her body\u2019s changed when she shared a before-and-after shot on Instagram. \"Five years ago almost to the day. Same cabana. Same amazing friend,\u201d she wrote.\n\nA post shared by Shannon Beador (@shannonbeador) on Jun 24, 2017 at 2:04pm PDT\n\n\u201cNot the same body. #goals #workingonit #itsslow #coverupnotcomingoff #nextyear #myfriendstilllooksincredible.\" Did you like last night\u2019s premiere episode?
