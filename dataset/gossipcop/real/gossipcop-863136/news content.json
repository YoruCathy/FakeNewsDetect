And it\u2019s not just to keep delivering a reliable stream of monologue taunts.\n\nThe \u201cLate Show\u201d discussion turned to the disappearance of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi and Trump\u2019s soft approach and reluctance to pressure the Saudis amid mounting evidence of Khashoggi\u2019s killing by men close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nTrump, who advanced the idea of \u201crogue killers\u201d responsible for Khashoggi\u2019s death, helped sow doubt the Saudi government orchestrated the killing, Brzezinski said. And she said it was similar to how Trump defused sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his nomination process.\n\n\u201cThat can\u2019t be our reality, and at some point this has to end, one way or another,\u201d Brzezinski said.\n\nThat end, Scarborough said, was to marshal support for the midterm elections next month and weaken Trump\u2019s influence in Congress.\n\nBy 2020, he believes, Trump will be eyeing the exit.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be elected president, he didn\u2019t think he was going to be elected president, he didn\u2019t even think he was going to get the Republican nomination. He\u2019s going to cash out,\u201d Scarborough said.\n\nColbert, a fierce Trump critic, wants him to be out in 2020. But not in that way.\n\n\u201cI think that would be a smart thing for him to do,\u201d Colbert told Scarborough, as the audience laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I don\u2019t want it to happen, because I think it\u2019s important that the voters of America have an opportunity to say, \u2018Oops, my bad, we made a mistake there\u2019 and correct themselves.\n\n\u201cAnd if Donald Trump doesn\u2019t run, he takes away that corrective action of history, and therefore his presidency is whole and unjudged, if he just doesn\u2019t run again.\u201d\n\nColbert said that if that were to happen, Trump could say, \u201c\u2018I fixed it, I made it great again, goodbye,\u2019\u201d and take the $100 million he raised and make \u201canother failing casino or something,\u201d Colbert said.\n\nScarborough said he was skeptical Trump would ride off into the sunset.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get money from the Saudis. He\u2019s right now proving to the Saudis he\u2019ll be their lap dog. He\u2019ll make money from (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin when he gets out. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been Putin\u2019s lap dog. Donald Trump is all about money. It\u2019s what drives him,\u201d Scarborough said.", "images": ["https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/SCS-placeholder.jpg", "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/colbert2-1.jpg?w=1024&h=805", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/STC_main.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/colbert2-1.jpg?w=1024&h=805", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Washington Post"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mercurynews.com/stephen-colbert-really-wants-trump-to-run-in-2020", "title": "Stephen Colbert really wants Trump to run in 2020", "meta_data": {"application-name": "santacruzsentinel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "generator": "WordPress 5.4", "wp-parsely_version": "1.14", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Stephen Colbert really wants Trump to run in 2020", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/stephen-colbert-really-wants-trump-to-run-in-2020", "description": "Colbert said that if that were to happen, Trump could say, \u201c\u2018I fixed it, I made it great again, goodbye,'\u201d and take the $100 million he raised and make \u201canother failing casi\u2026", "site_name": "Santa Cruz Sentinel", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/colbert2-1.jpg?w=1024&h=805", "width": 1024, "height": 805}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-19T20:22:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-22T11:20:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Stephen Colbert really wants Trump to run in 2020"}, "image": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/colbert2-1.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cropped-STC_SI.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539878400.0, "source": "https://www.santacruzsentinel.com", "summary": ""}
