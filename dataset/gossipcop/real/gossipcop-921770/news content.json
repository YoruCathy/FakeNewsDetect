Burke shared a throwback photo of herself as a child getting a kiss on her head from her dad.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cDad, if I had one more chance to have you here with me today, I would do things differently,\u201d she captioned the sweet shot on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. \u201cEvery day I would tell you how much I love you. I miss you so much already.\u201d\n\nThe Dancing with the Stars pro added that her father passed away on March 9, nearly a month shy of his 68th birthday.\n\nBurke told PEOPLE in 2011 that she felt \u201cabandoned\u201d after her parents split when she was a toddler. Her mother remarried in 1993 \u2014 and Burke forged a close bond with her stepfather Bob Wolf, whom she calls Dad.\n\nDuring a 2012 appearance on Bethenny Frankel\u2018s talk show, the dancer said she had been estranged from her dad for a decade but reconnected after he was in a bad accident.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure that everything in my life was okay, and I felt like there was that void in my life,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cI have a wonderful stepfather who has been my father, but it was really important for me just to reach out to my dad. Just for me and to like, have some closure if anything really were to happen.\u201d\n\nThe sad announcement comes just six days after Burke told fans she would be taking a hiatus from social media because she was \u201cdealing with some personal things right now\u201d on March 13, only a few days after her father\u2019s passing.\n\n\u201cThanks for your understanding,\u201d she continued, \u201cand remember to tell the people who are important to you just how much you love them each and everyday.
