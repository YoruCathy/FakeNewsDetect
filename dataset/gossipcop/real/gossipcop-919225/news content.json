He seems excited about life.\u201d\n\nIt was recently claimed that Brad has quit drinking alcohol and is doing his best to be a better man and a good father to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne\n\nA source said: \u201cHe goes to therapy every week and is mostly interested in learning and bettering himself as a man and father.\u201d\n\nWIN a R 2,000 Woolworths Voucher Subscribe to our Free Daily All4Women Newsletter to enter Sign Up Now\n\nThe World War Z star prefers to keep things \u201cprivate and safe\u201d when he has visitation time with his children, but he would love to spend more time with them.\n\nThe insider said: \u201cBrad doesn\u2019t go out much with the kids or leave the house. But Brad would definitely like to spend more time with them than he does.\n\n\u201cHe prefers to keep things very private and safe. It\u2019s his sanctuary and just being there is where he finds peace.\n\n\u201cHe has projects around the house and is always making things or changing things around.\u201d\n\nLast May, the Fury actor admitted his drinking had become a \u201cproblem\u201d during his marriage, but he was \u201creally happy\u201d to be sober\n\nHe said: \u201cI can\u2019t remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn\u2019t boozing or had a spliff, or something. Something. And you realise that a lot of it is, um, cigarettes, you know, pacifiers. And I\u2019m running from feelings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really, really happy to be done with all of that. I mean I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year, you know \u2013 things I wasn\u2019t dealing with.\n\n\u201cI was boozing too much. It\u2019s just become a problem.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again. I think that\u2019s part of the human challenge: You either deny them all of your life or you answer them and evolve.\u201d\n\nThe Fury actor admits that he found it harder to give up alcohol than marijuana\n\nHe said: \u201cI mean, we have a winery. I enjoy wine very, very much, but I just ran it to the ground. I had to step away for a minute. And truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good.\n\n\u201c[I] didn\u2019t want to live that way anymore.\u201d\n\nAuthor: BANG Showbiz", "images": ["https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/24/bloom-rewards-a4w_925x80.png?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/22/bloomrewards-logo-revised22Jan_transparent.png?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/17/1529409341605-120x120.jpg?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/25/sarah-advice-120x120.jpg?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08/i-5.jpeg", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/06/rhoj-120x120.jpg?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/themes/a4w_2017/images/iab.jpg?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/16/All4women-logo-new-sep2019.png?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/16/PPSA-logo-web-72dpi.png?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/16/i-4-120x120.jpeg?x70234", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1037353429671984&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08/i-5-750x458.jpeg?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/17/rikki-leaves-the-bachelor-sa-2-120x120.png?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif?x70234", "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/06/all4women-logo-white_150x30.png?x70234"], "top_img": "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08/i-5.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.all4women.co.za/1403479/entertainment/celebrity-gossip/brad-pitt-healthier-happier-split-angelina-jolie", "title": "Brad Pitt \u2018healthier and happier\u2019 since split from Angelina Jolie \u2013 All 4 Women", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 80213523425}, "keywords": "Entertainment,brad pitt,Celebrity Gossip", "description": "Hollywood hunk Brad Pitt is looking \"healthier and happier\" following his split from Angelina Jolie and is \"excited about life\".", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt 'healthier and happier' since split from Angelina Jolie | All4Women", "description": "Hollywood hunk Brad Pitt is looking \"healthier and happier\" following his split from Angelina Jolie and is \"excited about life\".", "site_name": "All 4 Women", "updated_time": "2018-03-08T10:43:30+02:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08/i-5.jpeg", "secure_url": "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08/i-5.jpeg", "width": 1000, "height": 650}, "url": "https://www.all4women.co.za/1403479/entertainment/celebrity-gossip/brad-pitt-healthier-happier-split-angelina-jolie"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/all4women", "section": "Celebrity Gossip", "published_time": "2018-03-08T09:00:07+02:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-08T10:43:30+02:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Brad Pitt 'healthier and happier' since split from Angelina Jolie | All4Women", "site": "@all4women", "image": "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/08/i-5.jpeg", "creator": "@all4women"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.all4women.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/22/cropped-IOS_icon-380x380.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520492407.0, "source": "https://www.all4women.co.za", "summary": ""}
