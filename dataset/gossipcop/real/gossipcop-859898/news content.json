Report at ESPN, the predecessor of The Bill Simmons Podcast. Early on\u2014The B.S. Report predates Marc Maron\u2019s WTF by two years\u2014Simmons grasped that an uninterrupted, long-form interview scarcely existed in the media wasteland. He took note of the diminishing returns of what celebrities and athletes were willing to say and the disgust fans had for sound bites and puff pieces. Now, he routinely books guests who won\u2019t, or don\u2019t always, open up elsewhere: Kevin Durant, an NBA champion and typically a man of few words, for instance, showed up this year for a series of fascinating, raw interviews. Simmons\u2019s talk with The Atlantic\u2019s Ta-Nehisi Coates is also a must-listen. The host steers the conversation toward sports to get them chatting, and then everything you want to hear from America\u2019s writer-in-residence comes out in unexpected, new ways.\n\nGateway Episode: \u201cTa-Nehisi Coates on Storytelling, Challenging Obama, and the Kaepernick Situation\u201d\n\nThe Every Little Thing host Flora Lichtman will make her obsessions your obsessions. The show follows her train of thought, taking listeners through unexpected twists and turns where they find out flamingos can drink boiling-hot water, robust mite communities live on our faces, and why no one ever sees a living armadillo (it has to do with a phenomenon known as eye shine). Lichtman has a fantastic sense of humor and a charming curiosity that seduces listeners into the topic du jour. The show is perfect politically neutral entertainment for conversations with the in-laws or for work parties. While no one\u2014maybe not even Lichtman\u2014can predict what the next subject will be, after a few episodes, listeners get a sense for the quirky world she\u2019s created and how she moves through it. Every Little Thing embodies the old maxim that the best ideas are the ones we can\u2019t forget.\n\nGateway Episode: \u201cRapture Chasers\u201d\n\nThe experience of This Is Actually Happening is different from most of what you\u2019ll hear elsewhere. Every other week, people who have experienced a massive disturbance in their life tell their stories uninterrupted, no questions, no music. A male model becomes the target of the Japanese mafia in one show, and in the next, a victim of incest talks about how advocacy changed her life. They are all of the most articulate ilk, people who have done the hard work of thoughtful introspection and, without asking anything of the listener, they share themselves and what they\u2019ve learned. This creates an intimate connection with the speaker, perhaps the closest thing listeners have to trying on another person\u2019s consciousness. Each show title starts with \u201cWhat if \u2026 \u201d (with titles like \u201cWhat if you were a white supremacist?\u201d) to tell the listener exactly what to expect, but others are more rhetorical (\u201cWhat if you went to the dark side?\u201d). Others still are so specific (like \u201cWhat if you spent 15 hours on the edge of sanity?\u201d) that you\u2019ll want to know how exactly that question was posed in the first place.", "images": ["https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Uu9S1eaoWrlTfKWrZ5TaG3cWgJQ=/0x43:2000x1085/960x500/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Podcast/original.jpg", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/pnEixPSQwIN1Axpsk9riDnucte0=/353x0:1478x1125/250x250/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Books_Missed-1/original.jpg", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/D9AuWSkMzJ8m4zRLwHxMCOlGQOc=/0x15:1947x1110/720x405/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Podcast/original.jpg", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/nav-crossword.png", "https://atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net/b/ss/atlanticprod/1/H.22--NS/0", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/fOoO1DSh2EOgCisTIhvjNgGVqlc=/420x0:1500x1080/250x250/filters:format(png)/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_song/original.png", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DO7-dd6r6KCAw3oA8xRKy-ncrXI=/440x0:1565x1125/250x250/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Movie/original.jpg", "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6WmURrECHoAAZHfZ3ReGJQTMcUU=/420x0:1500x1080/250x250/filters:format(png)/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_bookread/original.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Uu9S1eaoWrlTfKWrZ5TaG3cWgJQ=/0x43:2000x1085/960x500/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Podcast/original.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Jane Standley", "Eric Mcquade", "Ann Hulbert", "Sophie Gilbert", "Jane Yong Kim", "The Editors", "Spencer Kornhaber", "Christopher Orr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/12/the-50-best-podcasts-of-2017/548165/", "title": "The 50 Best Podcasts of 2017", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The shows that kept listeners refreshing their apps this year", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Atlantic", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "locale": "en_US", "title": "The 50 Best Podcasts of 2017", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/12/the-50-best-podcasts-of-2017/548165/", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Uu9S1eaoWrlTfKWrZ5TaG3cWgJQ=/0x43:2000x1085/960x500/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Podcast/original.jpg", "description": "The shows that kept listeners refreshing their apps this year"}, "fb": {"pages": "29259828486,1468531833474495,1061579677251147,457711054591520,370457103090695,1631141167169115,148681772342453,1510507419185410,128344747344340,128377530562508,236061986423933", "admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 100770816677686}, "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theatlantic", "domain": "theatlantic.com", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"src": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Uu9S1eaoWrlTfKWrZ5TaG3cWgJQ=/0x43:2000x1085/960x500/media/img/mt/2017/12/EOY2017_Podcast/original.jpg"}}, "application-name": "theatlantic", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/lacroix/apple-touch-icon-iphone.50541ad29f2c.png", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "krux": {"title": "The 50 Best Podcasts of 2017", "description": "The shows that kept listeners refreshing their apps this year"}, "author": "Laura Jane Standley, Eric McQuade", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/facebook-instant/article/548165/"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlantic/", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered", "tag": "culture", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2017-12-21T14:18:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-23T12:19:02-05:00"}, "keywords": "Gateway Episode, new podcast episode, listeners", "news_keywords": "Gateway Episode, new podcast episode, listeners"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513883880.0, "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com", "summary": ""}
