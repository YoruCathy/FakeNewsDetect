No 2-year-old wants to be working, but I had no choice. My whole life, I was in and out of school. I didn't have friends. I was working constantly and I didn't have a real life.\"[6] She began acting professionally at three years of age in a 1997 national commercial for Shake 'n Bake.[9] She was then cast in The Prophet's Game.\n\nMomsen is included on the list of Unclaimed Coogan accounts for performing children whose partial childhood earnings are mandated to be put in a special fund but who have yet to claim their earnings.[10]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nActing [ edit ]\n\nIn 2000, Momsen played the role of Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, her breakout role. In 2002, she played Gretel in Hansel and Gretel and Alexandra, the President's daughter, in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams.\n\nMomsen's career came to a halt for over three years until she received a lead role in the WB series Misconceptions, which never aired. After that, she also appeared in the 2006 film Saving Shiloh. She also auditioned for the title role in Hannah Montana, and was in the top three, but the role was instead awarded to Miley Cyrus\u2014a decision that Momsen was happy with in retrospect.[11] In 2007, she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film Underdog as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie Paranoid Park, directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nBeginning in 2007, she played the character of Jenny Humphrey in The CW television series Gossip Girl, based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Momsen's appearances on the series became increasingly sporadic, and, by the end of the first half of the fourth season, she had only appeared in four episodes. It was then announced that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the show,[12] which ended with her leaving the series as a regular cast member after the completion of the fourth season in 2011. On August 16, 2011, Momsen told Elle magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music career.[13] On October 16, 2012, it was reported that Momsen would be returning to Gossip Girl for its final episode, in which she appeared briefly in the wedding sequence.[14][15]\n\nModeling [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2008, at the age of fourteen, Momsen signed to IMG Models.[16][17] She was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring/summer 2010 collection.[18] After weeks of speculation about who would be the face of Madonna's 2010 fashion line \"Material Girl\", Momsen was announced on July 15, 2010.[19] A week later, Momsen was announced as the model for John Galliano's new women's fragrance, scheduled to launch in autumn 2010.[20] In 2010, she appeared in a video for Galliano's \"Parlez-Moi d'Amour\" fragrance ad campaign.\n\nMomsen is the face of Samantha Thavasa's handbag line.

Does that count?\"[26]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nMomsen performing in April 2010\n\nMomsen has said that \"music is where I can be me\",[27] stating that \"acting is easy. I've been doing it for so long and I totally love it. But you're playing a character instead of yourself. Music is more personal because you're writing it and you're involved in every step of it.\"[27] At 7 years old, Momsen recorded the song \"Christmas, Why Can't I Find You?\" for the soundtrack to How the Grinch Stole Christmas. In 2002, she recorded the songs \"One Small Voice\" and \"Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" for the compilation album School's Out!

Momsen subsequently swapped out her former bandmates. She co-writes songs with Phillips; in addition to lead vocals, Momsen also plays rhythm guitar.\n\nThe band's debut album Light Me Up was released on August 30, 2010 in the UK,[30] where it debuted at number 6, as well as at number 18 in Ireland.

According to Momsen, she wrote the song when she was 8 years old and recorded it as a demo with a producer.[32] Montag released the song as a digital only single, with the music video being directed by her husband Spencer Pratt. Momsen commented about the recording: \"I'm like, okay, dude, you're singing an 8-year-old's words, but that's cool. It's so funny because I didn't shop it or anything and I get this call going, 'Did you write a song for Heidi Montag'? And I'm like, 'What?'\"[32] The track was later included on Montag's debut studio album Superficial (2010).\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Momsen announced that the band would be the supporting act for Evanescence during the fall of 2011.[33] Throughout 2012, Momsen and her band toured North America; the second headlining tour, titled the Medicine Tour, began in March 2012 [34] and culminated with supporting dates for Marilyn Manson's 2012 world tour Hey Cruel World...
