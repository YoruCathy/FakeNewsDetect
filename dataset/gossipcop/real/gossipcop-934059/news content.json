Selena Gomez was a little too confessional in her new song \u2018Back To You.\u2019 We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she regrets that fans are sure she\u2019s singing about ex Justin Bieber.\n\nAs soon as fans got a listen to Selena Gomez\u2018s brand new song \u201cBack To You,\u201d they immediately dissected the lyrics and many believed that she was singing about her ex Justin Bieber, 24. The reaction has been a tough one for the 25-year-old, who has moved on after rekindling things with the Biebs in the fall of 2017. \u201cAll the speculation and judgement about Selena\u2019s new song being about Justin has been hard on her. It\u2019s never easy putting personal stuff out there but this is taking way more of a toll on her than she was expecting,\u201d a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cShe loves her song and she\u2019s proud of it, but she\u2019s starting to have major regrets about being so open. She feels like people are judging her and that always makes her feel anxious,\u201d our insider adds. With lyrics like \u201cLet a couple years water down how I\u2019m feeling about you\u201d and \u201cEverybody knows we got unfinished business,\u201d how could fans NOT think that she was singing about Justin? Even the chorus goes \u201cWhat was there wasn\u2019t sure. But I\u2019d go back to you. I know I\u2019d go back to you.\u201d\n\nThis is Sel\u2019s first new music in 2018, after releasing the singles \u201cBad Liar,\u201d \u201cFetish\u201d and \u201cWolves,\u201d last year. It\u2019s her first single since breaking up with The Weeknd, 28, to go back to Justin in Oct. of 2017. While their rekindled romance had fizzled by early spring of 2018, many fans think that the lyrics are a confessional about the Biebs. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious that Selena wrote Back To You about Justin\u2026 those lyrics damn same girl,\u201d one fan tweeted while another wrote \u201cSooo \u2018Back To You\u2019 is so about Justin or what lol.\u201d The song was recorded for the second season of Netflix\u2019 13 Reasons Why, which Selena is the Executive Producer and at least one level-headed fan pointed that out, tweeting \u201cAgain people #BackToYou is not about Justin. It\u2019s written for the show.\u201d", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F10%2Fselena-gomez-regrets-back-to-you-personal-justin-bieber-lyrics%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3137878", "https://i2.wp.com/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/what-i-learned-as-a-17-year-old-girl-in-the-boy-scouts.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/rolling-stones-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/beth_shiliday.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/bean-bag-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-performance-one-world-nbc-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/selena-gomez-regrets-being-open-ftr.jpg", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://i1.wp.com/www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/office-chairs.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/taylor-swift-then-vs-now-shutterstock-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/selena-gomez-regrets-being-open-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/lady-gaga-one-world-together-at-home.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/10546188dy.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/selena-gomez-regrets-being-open-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Melody Fewx", "Lana Parker", "Nick Caruso", "Oscar Hartzog", "Ryan Lattanzio", "Senior Evening Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/10/selena-gomez-regrets-back-to-you-personal-justin-bieber-lyrics/", "title": "Selena Gomez Regrets Being \u2018So Open\u2019 After Fans Speculate Her New Song Is About Justin Bieber", "meta_data": {"description": "Selena Gomez is having regrets about being so open on her song 'Back To You,' now that fans think she's singing about ex Justin Bieber.", "news_keywords": "Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez Regrets Being \u2018So Open\u2019 After Fans Speculate Her New Song Is About Justin Bieber", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/10/selena-gomez-regrets-back-to-you-personal-justin-bieber-lyrics/", "description": "Uh oh!
