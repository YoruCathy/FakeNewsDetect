Ashley Iaconetti, who began her Bachelor tenure on Chris Soules\u2019 season and went on to appear on two seasons of Bachelor in Paradise, is most known for crying on the show after getting rejected. When entering The Bachelor Winter Games house, the 29-year-old journalist had her eye on Canadian Bachelor star Kevin Wendt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my Bachelor Games claim right now. Kevin, we\u2019re going out on a date,\u201d Ashley tells the camera in Us Weekly\u2019s exclusive sneak peek of the Monday, February 13, premiere. \u201cYou guys know me. I zone in on one person, and I\u2019m not looking anywhere else.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, he was looking elsewhere. He chooses Bibiana Juliana, a contestant from Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season, for his date, and she agrees.\n\nWith that, Ashley cannot contain her emotions, breaking down in tears in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s literally been a pattern the last two years. I just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. Friend zone central,\u201d she says, trying to take deep breaths while crying. \u201cWhy does this always happen? Why does it always happen? I don\u2019t get it. It sucks. Like, the one guy I had interest in, of course went on a date tonight. Why don\u2019t I ever get picked?\u201d\n\nLater, she laugh-cries her way through a conversation with Ben Higgins, who tries to console her. At one point, a girl in the house asks if she\u2019s laughing or crying. \u201cBoth, it\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s fine,\u201d she says, unable to stop cry-laughing.\n\nAfter Soules sent Ashley home on season 19 of The Bachelor, Ashley fell for Jared Haibon on season 2 of Bachelor in Paradise. While the two became best friends, she fell in love with him and was absolutely heartbroken when he didn\u2019t feel the same way. She returned to Paradise with Jared on season 3, and he quickly got into a relationship with Caila Quinn, once again hurting Ashley. She also briefly had a relationship with Wells Adams, but that did not work, either.\n\nThe Bachelor Winter Games premieres on ABC Tuesday, February 13, at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ashley-i-crying.gif", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ashley-i-crying-02.gif?crop=0px%2C0px%2C960px%2C504px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ashley-i-crying-02.gif"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ashley-i-crying-02.gif?crop=0px%2C0px%2C960px%2C504px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/bachelor-winter-games-ashley-i-sobs-during-premiere/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019: Ashley I.
