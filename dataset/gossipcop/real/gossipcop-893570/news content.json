News, the pop star jokingly shows producer Jack Antonoff her dance moves for the single, including a new creation: the endearingly awkward \"dolphin body roll.\"\n\n\"My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene,\" Swift sings in the clip while holding her arms out like wings. \"Watch for the dance move,\" she says before demonstrating what she has dubbed the dolphin body roll. The two of them break into laughter and the short clip ends.\n\nAccording to Billboard, The Making of a Song will chronicle the production of each track on Swift's new album, Reputation, which was released on Friday. The series is available on AT&T video platforms DIRECTV NOW, DIRECTV (Channel 1113) and AT&T U-verse (Channel 1501).", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2Fellen-pompeo-5.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F02%2F022318-danielle-brooks-baw-lead.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimages%2F2018%2F08%2Farticles_african-hair.jpg&q=85&w=200", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F11%2F111417-taylor-swift.jpg%3Fitok%3DubvVgY_4"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F11%2F111417-taylor-swift.jpg%3Fitok%3DubvVgY_4", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meghan Overdeep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-awkward-call-it-what-you-want-dance-moves", "title": "Taylor Swift Demos Awkward \"Call It What You Want\" Dance Moves in New Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "TV Shows,Celebrity,News,Music,Jack Antonoff,Taylor Swift", "news_keywords": "taylor swift, taylor swift reputation, taylor swift making of a song, taylor swift now, call it what you want, taylor swift dance move", "description": "In the first episode of Making of a Song, a new series on AT&T's Taylor Swift NOW channel, Swift offers fans an inside look into the making of \"Call It What You Want,\" and some goofy dance moves.", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Demos Awkward \"Call It What You Want\" Dance Moves in New Video", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-awkward-call-it-what-you-want-dance-moves", "description": "Behold the dolphin body roll.", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F11%2F111417-taylor-swift.jpg%3Fitok%3DubvVgY_4"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-awkward-call-it-what-you-want-dance-moves", "description": "In the first episode of Making of a Song, a new series on AT&T's Taylor Swift NOW channel, Swift offers fans an inside look into the making of \"Call It What You Want,\" and some goofy dance moves.", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F11%2F111417-taylor-swift.jpg%3Fitok%3DubvVgY_4"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-awkward-call-it-what-you-want-dance-moves", "title": "Taylor Swift Demos Awkward \"Call It What You Want\" Dance Moves in New Video", "description": "Behold the dolphin body roll.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-img.instyle.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2F622x350%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2017%2F11%2F111417-taylor-swift.jpg%3Fitok%3DubvVgY_4"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.instyle.com", "summary": ""}
