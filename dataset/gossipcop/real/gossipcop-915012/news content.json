But watch we did, and let\u2019s just say we\u2019re not impressed with the reality TV star\u2019s latest endeavor. They say the best revenge is living well\u2014not losing weight. But Kardashian spun the more than 40 pounds she shed after breaking up with ex-husband Lamar Odom into not just a term\u2014\u201drevenge body\u201d\u2014but a TV show. And the results are appalling.\n\nAt the start of the show, you hear a voiceover, led by Kardashian: \u201cThis revenge body, who is it for?\u201d Three contestants answer: \u201cMy ex-fianc\u00e9.\u201d \u201cMy mom.\u201d \u201cMy friends.\u201d Then you hear Kardashian say, \u201cHaters are our greatest motivators.\u201d To which we say: A resounding no. Here, we list the top five reasons why you should boycott Kardashian\u2019s new show.\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 1. Weight Loss Should Not Be About Revenge\n\nIf you choose to lose weight, it should be about fulfilling your own personal health goals\u2014not about fulfilling some sort of fantasy to \u201cshow\u201d people in your life something. If you\u2019re going to show anyone anything, you should just live your best life. What\u2019s more, the idea that \u201chaters\u201d should be our greatest motivators is so twisted, because if one is using the imagined idea of someone else\u2019s perception as a gauge for personal growth, the scale is pretty much guaranteed to come out skewed.\n\nPlus, Kardashian herself said that she began to work out as a method of stress relief, which, according to her, had nothing to do with losing weight. \u201cI started working out during my divorce, but it was more for sanity reasons,\u201d she told ET.\n\nIn 2013, Kardashian \u201cdecided to turn to fitness as a form of therapy and as a stress reliever,\u201d as she wrote on Instagram. \u201cI started slow and eventually I started working out four to five days a week,\u201d she said. That all sounds good: It\u2019s been proven that exercise can lead to happiness, and there are tons of studies on the effect of physical movement on one\u2019s overall well-being.\n\nBut this is a far cry from the spectacle into which she\u2019s spun her enjoyment of exercise. It\u2019s one thing to use moderate exercise as an outlet during a breakup\u2014anything that helps ground oneself in times of chaos is good. \u201cGenerally speaking, the strategy of doubling down on self-care in response to a break up is a good one,\u201d eating disorder specialist Tabitha Limotte, LMFT, CEDS, tells us. \u201cHowever, that means \u2018self-care\u2019 in a much broader sense, and with the goals of exerting some control over our life and self-improvement, not revenge.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 2. The Show Is All About Getting Thin\u2014Not Healthy\n\nKardashian has been sharing some seriously problematic \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos on Instagram leading up to the premiere. For example, in the image on the above left, Kardashian looks perfectly healthy\u2014there\u2019s no reason for her to seek weight loss. But instead, she began working out and obtained what she calls a \u201crevenge body,\u201d which she shows off on the right.\n\nThe issue with channeling one\u2019s attention into revenge\u2014and, even more troubling, into molding one\u2019s body into severely skewed societal standards around what bodies \u201cshould\u201d look like as a vehicle toward such a goal\u2014is that it can be extremely unhealthy, and it just doesn\u2019t work, at least not in the long-term.\n\n\u201cThe real problem in focusing on our bodies, and on revenge, is that both lend themselves to obsessive behavior,\u201d notes Limotte. \u201cThat might make great television, but is not a viable strategy for coping with loss and rejection. The best medicine for that is time, self-discovery, and understanding our relationship patterns so that we are less likely to repeat them.\u201d Yeah, no one is talking about any of that on Revenge Body, that\u2019s for sure.\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 3. It\u2019s Horribly Exploitative\n\nIn the first few minutes of the show, cameras watch a young man named Will binge-eating Chinese takeout and a chocolate cake alone in his apartment, then sitting shirtless on his bed, looking sad. Then, cut to a snuggle with a huge teddy bear. The shots are voyeuristic and parasitic, clearly reveling in this \u201cinside look\u201d\u2014and completely unnecessary for the storyline of the show. This is plain-old exploitation at its finest, and we can just hear some TV exec saying, \u201cDo we have a giant stuffed animal somewhere? Can we get that on screen?\u201d And so begins an hour of extremely disturbing television.\n\nSure, some may argue that he and his fellow cohort signed up for this, and sign up they did. But people will volunteer to do literally anything if it\u2019ll be televised\u2014see Born in the Wild and Dating Naked\u2014especially if a Kardashian is involved. \u201cIt was one of those moments that you\u2019ll never forget in your life, because it\u2019s Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian,\u201d Will says in an on-screen confessional of meeting the reality star.\n\nAs to why Will joined the show: \u201cMy boyfriend, Kyle, broke up with me, and I want him back so bad,\u201d he told Kardashian. \u201cI really want to lose all this weight, so maybe I can get him back \u2026 He told me, straight to my face, he wasn\u2019t attracted to me anymore.\u201d Kardashian\u2019s response: \u201cMmm,\u201d telegraphing her best concerned face.\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 4. This Kind of Exercise Can Lead to Obsession and Eating Disorders\n\nRevenge Body certainly isn\u2019t the first TV show to follow a bunch of people working out in the hopes of losing weight. (Those other shows have their own problems.) But it is the first one to make the process about revenge\u2014the people on this show aren\u2019t motivated to hit the gym for health reasons, though that may play into their decision. They\u2019re getting their sweat on for the express purpose of making someone else feel bad.\n\nIf you start a revenge-based workout plan, it can lead to obsessive exercise. \u201cIf the exercise becomes obsessive, it can lead to life-threatening health consequences,\u201d says Limotte, noting those can include physical injury and \u201cpsychological impairment.\u201d There\u2019s even a condition associated with this phenomenon\u2014\u201dovertraining syndrome\u201d\u2014which looks like \u201cdepression, irritability, and increased anxiety and guilt around not exercising,\u201d adds Limotte. \u201cOver-exercise can also lead to the development of an eating disorder, which is a serious illness that often persists for many years.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc7a 5. Exercise Should Be About Health\u2014and Moderation\n\nEpisode 1 of Revenge Body is the first and last installment of the series we plan to watch. And as far as Limotte is concerned, when in doubt, slow your roll. \u201cI recommend Churchill\u2019s principal of economy of effort: Why exercise for two hours when 30 minutes will suffice?\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s last show, Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9, had an unfortunate name and was pretty lackluster, but at least it was benign. When it was, uh, kanceled, no one was exactly surprised, but perhaps we all should\u2019ve paid a little more attention to the fact that Kardashian was apparently pining to focus her attention on \u201cother jobs,\u201d according to a source via TMZ when Kocktails was shut down. Now we know what those \u201cother jobs\u201d entail, and now we\u2019re pining\u2014for earlier days of Kardashian TV.", "images": ["https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/bibi-dietz.jpeg?resize=%2C", "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e15/10369437_1405176929794377_1260868061_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=0K3A-poQoYYAX9ahjUN&oh=df3a128bbf3ea7268a52005d734d3f89&oe=5EC38AA0", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/chris-harrison.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tiger-king-netflix-1.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/boycott-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/blackpink-jisoo.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=stylecaster.com&path=%2Fboycott-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body%2F&ct=article&lob=&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=657310&comment_count=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1130306277008218&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/prince-harry.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/15877053_244837915939489_6008249507223961600_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=OIf40191b18AX9M-RJs&oh=b187e6e7d184dfa36d9fd1e0a473d23c&oe=5EC3CBA0", "https://scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/15802860_848743975228931_5559092294243581952_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=d7LYvB_ajMAAX9_P3Wo&oh=e88fcd0a3e44d2ece63e2638ab77b393&oe=5EC49D47"], "top_img": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/boycott-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bibi Deitz"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/boycott-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body/", "title": "5 Reasons to Boycott Khloe Kardashian\u2019s New Show, \u2018Revenge Body\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "We don't even have to watch Revenge Body to know there are serious problems with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's new show.
