Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.\n\nSaying it was time to \u201cclose that chapter\u2026and begin this chapter\u201d of his life, Kim said this morning he \u201ccould not be more excited to be back on ABC,\u201d where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. \u201cThis is the start of something new.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he\u2019s not on the CBS series and is now \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d on ABC\u2019s doc drama.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be part of this show,\u201d said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.\n\n\u201cIt started as a Korean show,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI loved the message of it,\u201d noting also that the doctor drama is a \u201cfamiliar genre to American audiences.\u201d The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital\u2019s surgical unit.\n\nKim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it \u201ccrucial\u201d to have signed House\u2019s David Shore as EP.\n\n\u201cI am really content being behind the scenes\u201d on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it \u201cfascinating\u201d to watch the actors, as a producer.\n\n\u201cAt some point I would love to play with them\u2026David and I have talked about it in the past and we\u2019ll see what comes up.\u2019", "images":
