(Which was fitting, considering \"The Handmaid's Tale\" won Best Drama, along with Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.) And everything shimmered with sequins and beading.\n\nNicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. \u201cHandmaid\u2019s\u201d Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (\"The Handmaid's Tale\" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.)\n\n\u201cA red dress is fiery, it\u2019s sexy, it\u2019s a universal power color,\u201d celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. \u201cAnd it also says \u2018resistance\u2019 in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.\u201d\n\nViola Davis wore Zac Posen.

(Rich Polk/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWhite always emerges when people are desperate for change in our culture,\u201d mused Verdi, \u201cbecause it\u2019s a blank canvas for new beginnings.\u201d\n\nAnd the summer\u2019s glitter trend was on full display, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele\u2019s belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross\u2019s silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones\u2019 black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper\u2019s midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown.\n\n\u201cGlitter is so hot right now, and it was sparkle, sparkle, sparkle everywhere, and lots of sequin sand silver,\u201d Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish.\n\nOther standouts included Viola Davis in juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior.\n\nTessa Thompson wore Rosie Assoui. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, so there was a heightened sense of glamour. If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you\u2019re gonna bring your A game,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cAnd we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it\u2019s become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.\u201d\n\nWhile the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year\u2019s awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,\u201d said Verdi. \u201cYou\u2019ll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you\u2019ll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.\u201d\n\nAnd you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday\u2019s red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket.\n\n\u201cA lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren\u2019t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it\u2019s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.\u201d\n\nVerdi noted this is an issue because the competition for these couture gowns is fierce.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a few great dresses in any given collection every season, and every stylist is trying to pull them for the celebrities that they are dressing,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when the fashion houses are assessing who these should go to, they want it to go to a nominee over a presenter; to a global star versus a national star; to someone younger over someone older - those are what the \u2018rules\u2019 would be.\u201d\n\nAnd, often, to someone slimmer over someone curvier, as stars like Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones (both nominated Sunday night) have been public about their struggles to find designers to dress them.\n\nBut Bloom noted that she\u2019s fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway.\n\n\u201cI can always resell it,\u201d she said. \u201cI do have an account on [the resell/consignment site] The RealReal. My writing partner sells all of her clothes there. Take a look on The Real Real for this dress tomorrow.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/ZH/MW-GU701_f0fb14_20181030155116_ZH.jpg", "https://www.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/NS/MW-GU703_29507a_20181030155121_NS.jpg", "https://www.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/NS/MW-GU702_3b797a_20181030155119_NS.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/google-play.png", "https://www.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/NS/MW-GU704_7c6355_20181030155124_NS.jpg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GU701_f0fb14_ZG_20181030155116.jpg", "https://www.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/NS/MW-GU705_e04a6c_20181030155127_NS.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/app-store.svg", "https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-IE699_stimul_ZU_20200417141513.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GU701_f0fb14_ZG_20181030155116.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "canonical_link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are-the-hottest-fashion-trends-from-the-2017-emmys-red-carpet-2017-09-17", "title": "These are the hottest fashion trends from the 2017 Emmys red carpet", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "These are the hottest fashion trends from the 2017 Emmys red carpet", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are-the-hottest-fashion-trends-from-the-2017-emmys-red-carpet-2017-09-17", "description": "Thanks to the Emmys, every prom dress and formal gown is gonna be red, white or covered in sparkles next spring.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GU701_f0fb14_ZG_20181030155116.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "page.site": "marketwatch", "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@marketwatch", "id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Thanks to the Emmys, every prom dress and formal gown is gonna be red, white or covered in sparkles next spring.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GU701_f0fb14_ZG_20181030155116.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "theme-color": "#2e2e2f", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "googlebot-news": "index", "article.doctype": 88, "cXenseParse": {"wsj-doctype": 88, "wsj-product": "Moneyish Blogs", "wsj-column": "Moneyish"}, "article.id": "5293dec6-4491-4aed-b13c-f6662efef9da", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422,app-argument=mwatch://article?id=5293dec6-4491-4aed-b13c-f6662efef9da", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article.column": "Moneyish", "author": "Nicole Lyn Pesce", "description": "Thanks to the Emmys, every prom dress and formal gown is gonna be red, white or covered in sparkles next spring.", "article.template": "full", "keywords": "article_normal", "news_keywords": "article_normal", "parsely-link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are-the-hottest-fashion-trends-from-the-2017-emmys-red-carpet-2017-09-17", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "These are the hottest fashion trends from the 2017 Emmys red carpet", "parsely-section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-post-id": "5293dec6-4491-4aed-b13c-f6662efef9da", "parsely-tags": "PageType: Article, Template: full, ArticleId: 5293dec6-4491-4aed-b13c-f6662efef9da, Column: Moneyish, DocType: 88, Subsection: Personal Finance", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-17T23:04:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Nicole Lyn Pesce"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com", "summary": ""}
