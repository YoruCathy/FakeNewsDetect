The fact that it's currently one of the most popular series streamed online, a whole new demographic of teenage girls have reportedly been hooked to Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen's complicated social lives. Just the mere thought of a \"Gossip Girl\" reboot is making the fans excited for the upcoming episodes. Of course, it is expected that new actresses will play the lead roles, following the footsteps of the original Blair and Serena tandem.\n\nLeighton Meester played the role of spoiled and bratty socialite, Blair Waldorf, while Blake Lively played the role of the well-loved socialite with a lot of secrets, Serena van der Woodsen. Currently, they are now celebrating a whole new stage of their life, far from the roles that they used to play in \"Gossip Girl.\" That said, if ever there's going to a be a series reboot, fans can expect a whole new cast of characters.\n\nReboot or season 7?\n\nWhile a reboot may seem more likely to happen, there are also fans who are clamoring for season 7.\n\nIf there's going to be \"Gossip Girl\" season 7, it would mean that showrunners will have to gather all the main characters in the series to film and shoot for new episodes.\n\nAccording to reports, some of the main characters are currently busy with their respective projects, which means that it would be quite a feat to round them up for a \"Gossip Girl\" season 7. In fact, Ed Westwick, who played the role of Blair Waldorf's love interest, Chuck Bass, has downplayed the possibility of him reprising his role in reboot since he is currently busy with \"Dynasty\" reboot. Leighton Meester also seems to be on the same page with Ed Westwick, politely saying no when she was asked in an interview if she would be willing to reprise her role as Blair Waldorf in a reboot.\n\nBlake Lively open for reboot\n\nWhile Ed Westwick and Leighton Meester have decided to cut ties with \"Gossip Girl,\" it appears that there's still one cast member who is willing to reprise her role in a reboot, and that is no other than Blake Lively. Although she did not say outright that she would be willing to work long hours again to reprise her role as Serena van der Woodsen, her optimism and \"why not?\" attitude has sparked a lot of praises from the series diehards.\n\nAs of writing, it looks like the future of a \"Gossip Girl\" reboot might be a little bleak, but as one famous line says - never say never.", "images": ["https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/p/4/2020/04/17/v_640x360/b92ea92f-b040-4aed-a129-1ae4edb1d46c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/12/660x290/b_160x130/on-90-day-fiance-fans-are-disgusted-over-big-eds-nasty-bath-with-roses-father-image-source-tlc-youtube_2439395.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/15/660x290/b_160x130/on-90-day-fiance-fans-suspect-jenny-is-in-india-already-married-to-sumit-image-source-tlc-youtube_2441781.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/1/390/profile_1390431_1457504078.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/50/50963/1280x330/b_350x93/39803150634345259c8fa1ccd0b9_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/8/8569/1280x330/b_350x93/41024150675557959cf43fb71fc7_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/5/30/660x290/b_502x220/blake-lively-is-open-to-a-gossip-girl-reboot-teen-vogue-teenvoguecom_1356559.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/tag/51/51733/1280x330/b_350x93/59484150283796459937ccc323cc_c.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/4/155/profile_4155309_1486296056.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2020/4/16/660x290/b_160x130/o15/90-day-fiance-ed-brown-gets-a-rude-awakening-over-relationship-with-rosemarie-vega-image-source-tlc-youtube-screenshot_2442597.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/5/30/660x290/b_1200x630/blake-lively-is-open-to-a-gossip-girl-reboot-teen-vogue-teenvoguecom_1356559.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/5/30/660x290/b_1200x630/blake-lively-is-open-to-a-gossip-girl-reboot-teen-vogue-teenvoguecom_1356559.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Toti Zamora", "Sofia Vergara Encourages Women To Get Mammograms", "Sam Heughan", "Caitriona Balfe Spent Weekend Together In New York", "Justin Bieber Is Dating 'Ballers' Actress Paola Paulin"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/05/gossip-girl-reboot-or-season-7-chuck-blair-and-serena-share-their-thoughts-001736221.html", "title": "'Gossip Girl' reboot or season 7 - Chuck, Blair and Serena share their thoughts", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "description": "The complicated and sophisticated world of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen is just too hard to let go of.", "news_keywords": "Gossip Girl, Blake Lively", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/05/gossip-girl-reboot-or-season-7-chuck-blair-and-serena-share-their-thoughts-001736221.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "'Gossip Girl' reboot or season 7 - Chuck, Blair and Serena share their thoughts", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/5/30/660x290/b_1200x630/blake-lively-is-open-to-a-gossip-girl-reboot-teen-vogue-teenvoguecom_1356559.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Blake Lively Is Open to a 'Gossip Girl' Reboot | Teen Vogue - teenvogue.com"}, "description": "The complicated and sophisticated world of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen is just too hard to let go of.", "determiner": "auto", "rich_attachment": "true", "see_also": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2020/04/jon-bon-jovi-talks-bon-jovis-musical-future-reveals-band-could-never-tour-again-003117509.html"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BlastingNews/", "section": "Showbiz & Tv", "published_time": "2017-05-30T03:49:32-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Gossip Girl' reboot or season 7 - Chuck, Blair and Serena share their thoughts", "image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/5/30/660x290/b_1200x630/blake-lively-is-open-to-a-gossip-girl-reboot-teen-vogue-teenvoguecom_1356559.jpg", "description": "The complicated and sophisticated world of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen is just too hard to let go of....", "url": "https://goo.gl/8LDOpG", "site": "@BlastingNews", "creator": "@BlastingNews"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496130572.0, "source": "https://us.blastingnews.com", "summary": ""}
