The actress, who has earned three Emmy nominations for her role as Cersei Lannister in the HBO hit series, said the Miramax co-founder made sexual advances toward her after their first meeting at the Venice Film Festival. Headey was attending to promote the Weinstein-produced film \u201cBrothers Grimm,\u201d which screened there in September 2005.\n\n\u201cAt one point Harvey asked me to take a walk down to the water,\u201d she began. \u201cI walked down with him and he stopped and made some suggestive comment, a gesture. I just laughed it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was genuinely shocked. I remember thinking, it\u2019s got to be a joke,\u201d she continued. \u201cI said something like, \u2018Oh, come on, mate?!?? It\u2019d be like kissing my dad!!\u2019\u201d\n\nHeadey suggested her rebuff might have cost her roles in other projects helmed by Weinstein, because she was never cast again.\n\nEchoing stories from many other actresses in recent weeks, Headey recounted a second incident, in which the producer allegedly tried to lure her into his hotel room under the pretense of work.\n\n\u201cI had always carried the thought that he\u2019d never try anything with me again, not after I\u2019d laughed and said never in a million years,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI believed that he respected my boundary and maybe he wanted to talk about potential work.\u201d\n\nOver breakfast, the actress recalled talking \u201cabout films, film making.\u201d When the producer asked about Headey\u2019s love life, she \u201cshifted the conversation back to something less personal.\u201d Later, she continued, Weinstein said he wanted to give her a script in his hotel room.\n\n\u201cWe walked to the lift and the energy shifted,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy whole body went into high alert. The lift was going up and I said to Harvey, \u2018I\u2019m not interested in anything other than work. Please don\u2019t think I got in here with your for any other reason. Nothing is going to happen,\u2019 I said. I don\u2019t know what possessed me to speak out at that moment, only that I had such a strong sense of \u2018don\u2019t come near me.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe producer, she said, did not take her statement well.\n\nC Flanigan via Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe was silent after I spoke, furious,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe got out of the lift and walked to his room. His hand was on my back. He was marching me forward, not a word. I felt completely powerless. He tried his key card and it didn\u2019t work, then he got really angry. He walked me back to the lift, through the hotel to the valet, by grabbing and holding tightly to the back of my arm. He paid for my car and whispered in my ear, \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone about this. Not your manager, not your agent.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI got into my car and cried,\u201d Headey concluded.\n\nThe actress\u2019 tweets also slammed \u201cBrothers Grimm\u201d director Terry Gilliam for \u201cendless bullying\u201d \u2015 a word frequently associated with Weinstein \u2015 and shared a message from a fan thanking her for \u201couting\u201d the director as \u201ca really really huge asshole.\u201d\n\nHer story comes after The New York Times and The New Yorker publicized allegations of rampant sexual harassment and abuse by Weinstein over decades, blaming Hollywood insiders\u2019 culture of secrecy for keeping it under wraps for so long.\n\nDozens of women have spoken out against the producer, who was fired from his company last week. Their admissions have encouraged women across social media to share their own personal stories of sexual harassment and abuse, using the hashtag #MeToo.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a32ae1b1600004700c4ffba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63be214000020008c849b.jpeg?cache=yukmlp3wb8&ops=1778_1000", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63be214000020008c849b.jpeg?cache=yukmlp3wb8&ops=crop_361_69_1117_789,scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bfe09312400001e005838fc.png?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63be214000020008c849b.jpeg?cache=yukmlp3wb8&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-lena-headey-harvey-weinstein_n_59e62e62e4b02a215b339cec", "title": "Lena Headey Recalls How Harvey Weinstein Made Her Feel 'Powerless'", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The \"Game of Thrones\" actress shared her own sexual harassment experience with the producer on Twitter.", "keywords": "entertainment,harvey weinstein,lena headey", "og": {"title": "Lena Headey Recalls How Harvey Weinstein Made Her Feel 'Powerless'", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63be214000020008c849b.jpeg?cache=yukmlp3wb8&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63be214000020008c849b.jpeg?cache=yukmlp3wb8&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-lena-headey-harvey-weinstein_n_59e62e62e4b02a215b339cec", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The \"Game of Thrones\" actress shared her own sexual harassment experience with the producer on Twitter."}, "article": {"tag": "entertainment,harvey weinstein,lena headey", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-17 13:42:39 -0400", "modified_time": "2017-10-17 13:42:39 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Lena Headey Recalls How Harvey Weinstein Made Her Feel 'Powerless'", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/59e63be214000020008c849b.jpeg?cache=yukmlp3wb8&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "The \"Game of Thrones\" actress shared her own sexual harassment experience with the producer on Twitter.", "creator": "sara_bee"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_59e62e62e4b02a215b339cec", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508262159.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
