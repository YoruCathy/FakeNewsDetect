Callers reported that the male was bleeding and the car had two flat tires.\n\nOfficers made contact with Ortiz-Magro, 32. They also made contact with Harley, who was standing by with another citizen. Officers determined that Ortiz-Magro had gotten out of the vehicle and Harley had driven away as he was holding onto the vehicle, dragging him briefly, according to the spokesperson. She was determined to be primary aggressor and arrested on one count of misdemeanor domestic battery.\n\nOrtiz-Magro had apparent minor injuries to the mouth and arm as well as road rash. He was not transported to the hospital.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, \u201cthe child was picked up by a family friend before officers arrived on the scene.\u201d\n\nOrtiz-Magro was not filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation when the incident occurred and MTV had no comment when reached by PEOPLE.

He begged to get out and opened the door but she continued to pull away while he was getting out and it tore up his entire arm.
