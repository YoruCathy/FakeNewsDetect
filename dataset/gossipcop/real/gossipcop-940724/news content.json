In a lengthy series of videos posted on Thursday night, Cameron opened up about the sometimes dark side of social media and how it makes her feel. As reported by E!, the 22-year-old Descendants 3 actress voiced her thoughts, made in a series of selfie videos on her Instagram Stories on how lousy social media makes her feel at times.\n\n\u201cI really hate how Instagram makes me feel, I think, and I hate how Twitter and any kind of social media makes me feel. \u201cWhether I\u2019m looking at other people\u2019s lives or how I portray my life, I just hate the whole thing. I hate it. I think that they\u2019re something super wrong with staring at other people that much and I think there\u2019s something really wrong with staring at yourself that much. It\u2019s like walking around with a mirror up to yourself all day long. You don\u2019t even look at people\u2019s eyes. You look at how you come off to them, like you\u2019re watching yourself in a dream.\u201d\n\nCameron\u2019s recent declaration of the dark side of social media comes amid several polls that were carried out in recent years that shows what appears to be a growing social media fatigue worldwide, more specifically amongst the 22-year-old\u2019s millennial generation, the first to be born while the internet was mainstream. While Cameron expressed her discomfort, she also let her fans know that sometimes social media can be a \u201creally beautiful thing.\u201d\n\nday off \u2601\ufe0f A post shared by \u2661DOVE\u2661 (@dovecameron) on May 31, 2018 at 12:49pm PDT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not, like, condemning social media,\u201d she went on to say. \u201cI think that there are loads of you know, examples of when it\u2019s been used for good and when it\u2019s brought people together and blah blah blah and I know all of that. But I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s- that\u2019s not exclusively what it is.\u201d\n\nAs reported by Just Jared, who posted the series of videos via a fan account of Cameron, the actress also acknowledged the complete irony of her discussing her thoughts on social while being on social media.\n\n\u201cAnd I supposed it\u2019s all about defining, \u2019cause like, why am I even making this video right now if I\u2019m talking about social media in this kind of light. And I guess it\u2019s all about kind of finding your way of positively using something that can be super insidious. But then, how do you keep the insidious thing at the door? It\u2019s just like, way too much information.\u201d\n\n@bellamihair #dovexbellami ???? A post shared by \u2661DOVE\u2661 (@dovecameron) on May 30, 2018 at 1:44pm PDT\n\nCameron went on to liken social media connections to a \u201cgroup depression.\u201d Research conducted over the past couple of years suggests that social media use is associated with increased depression and anxiety, although the cause and effect are still unclear.\n\nBack in 2016, Cameron revealed on Twitter that she battled with anxiety her whole life.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t decide if I want to delete everything or if I want to just be like real and open and honest and live my life like this, because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more important; for me to feel connected to everybody else or to myself. Can I do both? I can\u2019t decide if I can do it all or if I have to pick and choose. And I guess that\u2019s kind of like growing up. I can\u2019t decide if not being able to do it all is me being afraid of my own abilities or being honest.\u201d\n\nCameron said that at the end of it all, it boils down to individual perception, as \u201cwhatever turns out to be true for you is what\u2019s true for you because you\u2019re the one perceiving the world.\u201d\n\nAt the end of her stories, Cameron also offered her fans some advice.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a way that I can say this without sounding like I\u2019m telling you what to do, don\u2019t put any stake on any of this. This doesn\u2019t mean anything, doesn\u2019t define you, doesn\u2019t have any bearing on our soul or your worth or your self-worth. You have to find that for yourself. It\u2019s not here. It\u2019s not on here.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_footer.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'138'%20height%3D'70'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20138%2070'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20width%3D'300'%20height%3D'170'%20viewbox%3D'0%200%20300%20170'%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=Tllhu1DlQy20Y8", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3bd1a3d2c01a173ca477b7aa4785d73d?s=250&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/logo_header_no_tagline.png", "https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-9522791002.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tiffani Cordner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4923985/dove-cameron-says-she-hates-how-social-media-makes-her-feel/", "title": "Dove Cameron Says She Hates How Social Media Makes Her Feel", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "//www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "viewport": "width=980", "mediapartners-google": "noindex", "adsbot-google": "noindex", "adsbot": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "1C6368F835120934051BE08C50A93BA3", "p": {"domain_verify": "27de048ce20584ff72683f9a7e89cbc1"}, "yandex-verification": "01101353387c3168"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
