Kylie Jenner opened up about the challenges of motherhood during a new interview conducted by Kim Kardashian.\n\nIn the Evening Standard magazine covey story, Kardashian, 37, pointed out that the \u201cearly stages of motherhood are challenging,\u201d prompting the 20-year-old to reply, \u201cIt\u2019s actually been the opposite for me. I feel like it\u2019s just been so amazing, and so much fun. I\u2019m learning so much more about myself and life, and it\u2019s been such a great experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course there\u2019s hard times and stuff\u2026 even in the beginning, just not sleeping, the nights, like, baby blues\u2026 and all the ups and downs,\u201d Jenner admitted in the ES story posted online on Monday, May 1. \u201cAnd also even when I\u2019m here it was so hard to leave this morning. I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019ll be right back, I\u2019m so sorry, I have to leave!\u2019 and she doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on. I think about her all the time, anywhere I am. I would rather be with her or wish she can come everywhere. I can\u2019t wait till she can come everywhere with me, because right when she\u2019s old enough I\u2019ll bring her everywhere.\u201d\n\nThe Kylie Cosmetics creator gave birth to her daughter, Stormi, with Travis Scott on February 1. After maintaining a low profile throughout her pregnancy, Jenner announced on February 4 that she had welcomed her baby girl and revealed her daughter\u2019s name two days later.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know how we thought of Storm. Her dad insisted it was him, but I feel like it was me,\u201d the Life of Kylie star told her sister about the name. \u201cAnd that kind of just stuck with us. And then I didn\u2019t really like just Storm \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel like that was her name. So then it became Stormi. And it just stuck. I feel like there were a lot of other names that I might have even liked better to be honest, but I feel like Stormi picked her own name, like it was just her name.\u201d\n\nKardashian, who has three children of her own \u2014 North, 4, Saint, 2, and 3-month-old Chicago \u2014 with husband Kanye West, also asked Jenner about how her life has changed since becoming a parent.\n\n\u201cI think more about the future because of her. Every time I leave and I\u2019m stressed about leaving her, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m doing it for you.\u2019 Everyone says you change completely when you become a mom, but I really feel the same, just better. So I don\u2019t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course,\u201d Jenner explained. \u201cBut I feel like it\u2019s only gotten better. You\u2019re less selfish \u2014 and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It\u2019s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don\u2019t know, the whole thing is really\u2026 it\u2019s like such an amazing experience.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1868px%2C982px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1868px%2C982px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-talks-challenges-of-motherhood-with-kim-kardashian/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Talks Challenges of Motherhood With Kim Kardashian", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kylie Jenner opened up about the challenges of being a mother during a new interview with her sister Kim Kardashian \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Talks \u2018Baby Blues\u2019, Challenges of Motherhood With Kim", "description": "Kylie Jenner opened up about the challenges of being a mother during a new interview with her sister Kim Kardashian \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-talks-challenges-of-motherhood-with-kim-kardashian/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-04T15:08:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1868px%2C982px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1868px%2C982px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "The Kardashians", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-01T22:45:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-04T15:08:24+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kylie Jenner opened up about the challenges of being a mother during a new interview with her sister Kim Kardashian \u2014 get the details", "title": "Kylie Jenner Talks \u2018Baby Blues\u2019, Challenges of Motherhood With Kim", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1868px%2C982px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525214736.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
