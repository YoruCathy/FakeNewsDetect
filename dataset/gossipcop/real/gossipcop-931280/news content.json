He says ever since he and Kim posted video seemingly showing Taylor knew about his infamous \"Famous\" lyric ahead of time ... his relationship with radio has never been the same.\n\nHe admits he wanted major radio play as one of the most popular artists in the world, and says the fact he simply wasn't getting it after he released 'Life of Pablo' screwed with his head.\n\nKanye also notes that the departure of L.A. Reid from Universal Music might've affected his radio dynamic ... but says it was just one of many stressors in his life at that point.\n\nPlay video content", "images":
