There was the little matter of the diamond ring she couldn\u2019t get off her hand.\n\nHours earlier, in her rush to get dressed, she tried on the \u201cbeautiful, beautiful\u201d ring. But then she wanted to switch it to another finger \u2014 and it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cAnd then you know when you start pulling on something, it just gets swollen,\u201d she recounts the next morning over a late breakfast in her hotel room in West Hollywood. \u201cSo I was on the red carpet minorly panicking about this ring that was very stuck on my finger.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she got home in the wee hours that she was able to do a bit of research on YouTube, and learned about the dental floss and olive oil trick. \u201cIt\u2019s all the rage,\u201d she says, joking. After a little threading and a lot of slathering, the offending bauble finally slid off her finger. \u201cSo much for a perfect night,\u201d she adds with a laugh.\n\nThe awards show had barely begun when it was clear the momentum was all in \u201cMaisel\u2019s\u201d favor. First, Alex Borstein (who plays comedy club manager Susie Myerson) won for best supporting actress; then the show\u2019s creator and executive producer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, made history as the first woman to win for both writing and directing in the same year. The next thing Brosnahan knew, Angela Bassett was announcing her name (if butchering it a bit). \u201cI was completely overwhelmed,\u201d says Brosnahan.\n\nShe didn\u2019t prepare a speech, she says, but after what she laughingly recalls as the \u201cOprah debacle\u201d at the Golden Globes \u2014 she\u2019d interrupted herself mid-acceptance with a shout-out to Oprah Winfrey \u2014 she cobbled together in her head a list of people to thank. But what she really wanted to do was speak to the moment.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I love the most about this show \u2026 [is] it\u2019s about a woman who is finding her voice anew,\u201d she said from the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s happening all over the country right now. One of the most important ways that we can find and use our voices is to vote. So if you haven\u2019t already registered, do it on your cell phone right now. Vote, show up and bring a friend to the polls.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the call to action the next morning, she dismisses any suggestion that it was politically motivated. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel political to me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty as citizens to have a say.\u201d\n\nAnd while she recognizes that strident speeches from celebrities at awards shows can feel \u201cself-indulgent and vain,\u201d she wasn\u2019t going to miss the opportunity to take advantage of the spotlight to make a point. \u201cWe have a huge election coming up, and it\u2019s more important than ever that we exercise our right to vote,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, hard won.\u201d\n\nBrosnahan says she hasn\u2019t decided where she\u2019ll keep her trophy. \u201cThe Golden Globe is on the toilet, but the shelf is not big enough for them both.\u201d\n\nEric Jamison/Invision/AP/REX/Shu\n\n\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d proved marvelous indeed \u2014 the comedy, which will debut its second season later this year, would go on to nearly dominate the half-hour categories \u2014 winning five prizes that night and eight trophies overall out of 14 nominations. The Academy clearly fell in love with the tale of Midge Maisel, a 1950s New York City housewife whose fairy-tale life gets upended when her husband walks out, leading her to discover a talent for stand-up comedy.\n\nThe morning after the Emmy sweep, bleary-eyed after a late-night run to In-N-Out Burger after hitting the party circuit, Brosnahan is slightly dazed. (\u201cI\u2019m bad at parties,\u201d she says apologetically. \u201cToo much mingling and small talk, which has never been my strong suit.\u201d) Despite the trophy sitting nearby on the bed, the win hasn\u2019t quite sunk in.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never recover from having my name spoken in the same sentence as the other legendary actresses in this categories who I\u2019ve admired,\u201d she says of her fellow nominees, including Pamela Adlon, Allison Janney, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Lily Tomlin. \u201cIt\u2019s just been wild and crazy and incomprehensible. It\u2019s a dream I didn\u2019t know I had.\u201d\n\nThe show is something of an acting Olympics \u2014 not only must she master that rat-a-tat Sherman-Palladino dialogue, but she also has to deliver it from the stages of comedy clubs as Midge makes the rounds honing her routine.\n\nIn person, the 27-year-old actress is nothing like the bold, outspoken Midge \u2014 her quiet demeanor is punctuated by soft, self-conscious giggles. \u201cI think we are both ambitious \u2014 we\u2019re both resilient, and I think we both see the glass half full,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not as confident as Midge, particularly when it comes to work. Midge enters into this whole new field that she has no experience in at all, and genuinely believes in her heart of hearts that she can take it by storm. She never doubts it for a single second. That\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nSummoning up that bravado is somewhat of a leap for her, she readily acknowledges. It starts with \u201cpower posing\u201d in her mirror \u2014 and then segues to what she says the show\u2019s first assistant director calls \u201csiren songs.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019d ever print this,\u201d she says, letting out an over-the-top \u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\n\nThat, along with copious amounts of caffeine, is what she credits with enabling her to summon the moxie. \u201cMidge has a lot of energy,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot more than we usually have at four in the morning on a Monday.\u201d\n\nTwo seasons in (with a third already ordered), Brosnahan admits she\u2019s still intimidated.\n\n\u201cI knew that Midge would become a successful stand-up, but I didn\u2019t really think about what that would look like in practice,\u201d she says. \u201cThe audiences are growing now, which means that they\u2019re growing for Midge, but they\u2019re also growing for me. I\u2019m performing in front of more and more people every time I get up onstage, and it\u2019s horrifying. It never gets less horrifying. Although from some stand-ups I\u2019ve spoken to, it doesn\u2019t seem that out of the ordinary. So I\u2019m in good company with the constant state of petrification.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of living up to the creators\u2019 exacting standards, a point Sherman-Palladino highlighted when receiving the trophy for best writing. She thanked the cast for its endurance and \u201cgraciously accept[ing] that sometimes it matters when you drop the \u2018the.\u2019\u201d\n\nBrosnahan acknowledges the pressure is intense. \u201cBut I appreciate that she knows that her dialogue exactly as written is the best version of it,\u201d she says. Two script supervisors are on hand to make sure nothing goes amiss \u2014 one matches the actions, and the other is solely there to monitor the dialogue. \u201cShe\u2019s very gentle and so lovely and patient,\u201d Brosnahan says, \u201cbut she will often come in with a contraction note: \u2018It\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s,\u201d and you\u2019re saying \u201cIt is.\u201d\u2019 But she\u2019s always right. It\u2019s those tiny, tiny little shifts that make the thing sing.\u201d\n\nThe secret of Rachel\u2019s success is good old-fashioned talent and extreme hard work. no one works harder on her craft. she\u2019s a total and utter perfectionist, but in the nicest possible way.\n\namy sherman-palladino\n\nSherman-Palladino has created some of TV\u2019s most indelible female characters, working with actresses like Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Sutton Foster. (\u201cI need those fast-talking broads!\u201d she quips.) And this partnership, too, has delivered creatively for both.\n\n\u201cThe secret of Rachel\u2019s success is good old-fashioned talent and extreme hard work. No one works harder on her craft, on her character,\u201d says Sherman-Palladino. \u201cShe\u2019s a total and utter perfectionist, but in the nicest possible way. It\u2019s that fearlessness, that confidence, that strength, that ability to commit everything to a scene, that brings Midge alive. Plus, no one can take off some gloves, a coat and a purse faster or with more precision. That may not sound like much, but in our show \u2014 it\u2019s a lifesaver.\u201d\n\nBrosnahan says she\u2019s \u201ccompletely in awe\u201d of her boss\u2019 talent. \u201cShe knows exactly what she wants all the time, not unlike Midge,\u201d she says. \u201cShe tackles this enormous show and all of the stuff that comes with it with a real sense of joy.\u201d And she admits she\u2019s desperately striving to keep up with Sherman-Palladino\u2019s famously encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture, whether from today or the 1950s. \u201cShe was very dismayed that I didn\u2019t know who the Dionne quintuplets were!\u201d she says.\n\nThe costumes also help her get into character \u2014 they\u2019re all tailor-made and custom-designed by Donna Zakowska. \u201cI don\u2019t feel complete until I have a wig on, my hair did, lipstick and the corset,\u201d says Brosnahan. It\u2019s not about making her thinner \u2014 her petite frame is apparent, even clad in a heavy hotel robe \u2014 but about giving her body the right shape for the period. \u201cMidge is very fashion-conscious, and the shape of 1950s fashion was with a long torso and lower waist,\u201d she says, explaining that her waist falls naturally higher. \u201cThis way the costumes really do look like they came out of a fashion magazine because that would have been important to Midge.\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t quite stolen anything from Midge\u2019s ample closet yet, though she has her eye on a gray knee-length cashmere coat. \u201cIt\u2019s so luxurious and heavy and warm, it\u2019s just like wearing a blanket,\u201d she sighs.\n\nAlthough Brosnahan was shy as a kid growing up in suburban Illinois, she says she always wanted to be an actress.\n\n\u201cMostly I just had a love for storytelling, from a very young age,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved to read. I was an incessant reader \u2014 anything and everything.\u201d Fantasy novels were a favorite \u2014 from Roald Dahl to the Harry Potter books \u2014 for the way they transported her to faraway, different worlds. \u201cThat translated very directly into a love for this kind of storytelling and a love for period pieces.\u201d Bit parts in the third-grade play, \u201cwhere you pulled your part out of a hat and played Troll No. 2,\u201d translated into more formidable roles in high school and college.\n\nBut acting felt like a hobby, she says. \u201cI guess I just didn\u2019t know for a long time that it could be a career. I always felt like maybe I would have to choose something else.\u201d She even considered a career in psychology, which she minored in in college.\n\nWe Are The Rhoads for Variety\n\nAnd then she landed the part of the enigmatic Rachel Posner in Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and turned what was planned to be a five-line role into a recurring character (and snagged an Emmy nom for guest actress).\n\nThe series\u2019 then-showrunner Beau Willimon says Brosnahan\u2019s performance \u201cleapt off the screen\u201d so much that they wrote large parts of the season to expand her story. \u201cThe more we worked with Rachel, the more obvious it became that she had a long and successful career ahead of her,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t say we predicted she\u2019d win an Emmy, but with an extraordinary gift like hers, I\u2019m not at all surprised.\u201d\n\nBrosnahan remains grateful for the opportunity the show provided. \u201cI look often at \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 which at the time felt like absolutely the hardest, most excruciating and also fulfilling \u2014 by the same token \u2014 thing I\u2019d ever done up until this point, and they\u2019re just so different. That was challenging because it required digging into emotional depths that I\u2019d never traveled to before and trying to hold my own with such powerhouses around me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky to be able to say that I had more than one experience that\u2019s as fulfilling as the current one.\u201d\n\nAfter Brosnahan starred in the WGN America drama series \u201cManhattan\u201d and took on a few stage roles, the script for \u201cMaisel\u201d landed in her lap. \u201cI fell in love with it from the first page,\u201d she says. \u201cMidge reminded me of so many women that I know and love in my own life that I don\u2019t see on-screen enough \u2014 unapologetically confident, ambitious women who approach the world with a sense of insatiable curiosity and joy. She\u2019s complicated too. She\u2019s privileged and selfish and has a hard time seeing outside her previously very narrow worldview. But she\u2019s interested in growing and evolving. And that\u2019s exciting to me as well.\u201d\n\nThe Palladinos were cycling through a stream of auditions when Brosnahan walked in.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fearlessness to Rachel,\u201d says Sherman-Palladino. \u201cShe was not afraid to lean into the anger that Midge was feeling when she took that stage.\u201d\n\nBrosnahan says she recognizes the rage that fuels Midge\u2019s mission. \u201cWomen are angry sometimes. Men are angry. Everybody\u2019s angry,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you be angry if your husband walked out on you, after all of your goals have been accomplished and dreams have come true? You have a perfect life, and everything comes shattering down. I\u2019m glad it came through, and they bought it.\u201d\n\nJennifer Salke, head of Amazon Studios, says of Brosnahan\u2019s portrayal: \u201cRachel brings a rawness and relentless authenticity to Midge that comes from a deeply committed place. The audience has to believe that Midge is on this journey that she never intended would be her path in life. There is never a moment where the performance doesn\u2019t ring true, and that is an unbelievable feat in bringing a character to life.\u201d\n\nThe Palladinos had been developing the series for years, but its debut last November couldn\u2019t have been timed more perfectly: The show about a woman finding her voice hit as the national conversation turned to precisely that subject.\n\n\u201cI have no desire to stop playing her anytime soon,\u201d says Brosnahan of Midge Maisel. \u201cI\u2019m into playing her as long as Amy wants to keep writing her and directing her.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of Amazon Studios\n\n\u201cI think it was a fortunate coincidence,\u201d says Brosnahan. \u201cBut it\u2019s been really encouraging talking to young women who feel inspired by the show and inspired by Midge in her journey and her innate sense of self-empowerment.\u201d\n\nBrosnahan promises there\u2019s more to come in Season 2 as Midge explores her voice onstage. \u201cI love how she\u2019s asking questions about motherhood and womanhood and the double standards between women and men and some of the hypocrisy that she\u2019s noticing now that she\u2019s got her eyes wide open,\u201d she says. There\u2019s a moment in the second season when she dares to say the word \u201cpregnant\u201d onstage \u2014 it was a taboo for comics back then \u2014 \u201cand it\u2019s not well received,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1950s that isn\u2019t something you can talk about. It\u2019s considered crude and rude and private and inappropriate to be discussing in public, and I think that just fuels her fire.\u201d\n\nThough she now has both a Golden Globe and an Emmy to her name, Brosnahan says she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s quite arrived. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you ever have that moment,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI think it always feels like the other shoe could drop, and that\u2019s motivating in its own way. It feels kind of important to never feel like \u2018I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 It feels like the minute I reach that point, I\u2019ll stop taking risks, and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile she\u2019s in \u201cMaisel\u201d for the \u201clong haul\u201d (\u201cI have no desire to stop playing her anytime soon\u201d), she\u2019s got her eye out for other projects with female creators.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dying to work with more women in all different facets of the industry,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope that there\u2019ll be more opportunities to work with more women as we continue the conversation about the need for more women to be represented in different parts of this industry, whether in front of or behind the camera.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe one day she\u2019ll join their ranks as a producer or director. \u201cI\u2019d like to do it all \u2014 if they\u2019ll let me,\u201d she says.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/marvelous-ms-maisel.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Ffeatures%2Frachel-brosnahan-emmys-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-1202948487%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202948487&comment_count=10", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/rachel-brosnahan-variety-emmys-cover-story-3.jpg", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/rachel-brosnahan-variety-emmys-cover-story-2.jpg?w=1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/rachel-brosnahan-variety-emmys-cover-story-2.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Debra Birnbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/rachel-brosnahan-emmys-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-1202948487/", "title": "Rachel Brosnahan on Finding Mrs. Maisel and Her \u2018Marvelous\u2019 Emmys Night", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "With her star turn in Amazon\u2019s award-winning comedy, Rachel Brosnahan finds her voice.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202948487, "author": "Debra Birnbaum", "pmc-category": "Features,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-09-20T06:00:50"}, "pmc-tag": "Emmys,Rachel Brosnahan,The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel", "title": "Rachel Brosnahan on Finding Mrs. Maisel and Her \u2018Marvelous\u2019 Emmys Night", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "Features", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rachel Brosnahan on Finding Mrs. Maisel and Her \u2018Marvelous\u2019 Emmys Night", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/rachel-brosnahan-emmys-the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-1202948487/", "description": "In the end, a piece of dental floss saved the day.

After a little threading and a lot of slathering, the offending bauble finally slid off her finger. \u201cSo much for a perfect night,\u201d she adds with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe awards show had barely begun when it was clear the momentum was all in \u201cMaisel\u2019s\u201d favor. First, Alex Borstein (who plays comedy club manager Susie Myerson) won for best supporting actress; then the show\u2019s creator and executive producer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, made history as the first woman to win for both writing and directing in the same year.

But what she really wanted to do was speak to the moment.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of the things I love the most about this show \u2026 [is] it\u2019s about a woman who is finding her voice anew,\u201d she said from the stage. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s happening all over the country right now. One of the most important ways that we can find and use our voices is to vote. So if you haven\u2019t already registered, do it on your cell phone right now. Vote, show up and bring a friend to the polls.\u201d\r\n\r\nReflecting on the call to action the next morning, she dismisses any suggestion that it was politically motivated. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel political to me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s our duty as citizens to have a say.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while she recognizes that strident speeches from celebrities at awards shows can feel \u201cself-indulgent and vain,\u201d she wasn\u2019t going to miss the opportunity to take advantage of the spotlight to make a point. \u201cWe have a huge election coming up, and it\u2019s more important than ever that we exercise our right to vote,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard, hard won.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrosnahan says she hasn\u2019t decided where she\u2019ll keep her trophy. \u201cThe Golden Globe is on the toilet, but the shelf is not big enough for them both.\u201d\r\nEric Jamison/Invision/AP/REX/Shu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d proved marvelous indeed \u2014 the comedy, which will debut its second season later this year, would go on to nearly dominate the half-hour categories \u2014 winning five prizes that night and eight trophies overall out of 14 nominations. The Academy clearly fell in love with the tale of Midge Maisel, a 1950s New York City housewife whose fairy-tale life gets upended when her husband walks out, leading her to discover a talent for stand-up comedy.\r\n\r\nThe morning after the Emmy sweep, bleary-eyed after a late-night run to In-N-Out Burger after hitting the party circuit, Brosnahan is slightly dazed. (\u201cI\u2019m bad at parties,\u201d she says apologetically. \u201cToo much mingling and small talk, which has never been my strong suit.\u201d) Despite the trophy sitting nearby on the bed, the win hasn\u2019t quite sunk in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll never recover from having my name spoken in the same sentence as the other legendary actresses in this categories who I\u2019ve admired,\u201d she says of her fellow nominees, including Pamela Adlon, Allison Janney, Issa Rae, Tracee Ellis Ross and Lily Tomlin. \u201cIt\u2019s just been wild and crazy and incomprehensible. It\u2019s a dream I didn\u2019t know I had.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe show is something of an acting Olympics \u2014 not only must she master that rat-a-tat Sherman-Palladino dialogue, but she also has to deliver it from the stages of comedy clubs as Midge makes the rounds honing her routine.\r\n\r\nIn person, the 27-year-old actress is nothing like the bold, outspoken Midge \u2014 her quiet demeanor is punctuated by soft, self-conscious giggles. \u201cI think we are both ambitious \u2014 we\u2019re both resilient, and I think we both see the glass half full,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not as confident as Midge, particularly when it comes to work. Midge enters into this whole new field that she has no experience in at all, and genuinely believes in her heart of hearts that she can take it by storm. She never doubts it for a single second. That\u2019s not me.\u201d\r\n\r\nSummoning up that bravado is somewhat of a leap for her, she readily acknowledges. It starts with \u201cpower posing\u201d in her mirror \u2014 and then segues to what she says the show\u2019s first assistant director calls \u201csiren songs.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019d ever print this,\u201d she says, letting out an over-the-top \u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\r\n\r\nThat, along with copious amounts of caffeine, is what she credits with enabling her to summon the moxie. \u201cMidge has a lot of energy,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot more than we usually have at four in the morning on a Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\nTwo seasons in (with a third already ordered), Brosnahan admits she\u2019s still intimidated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI knew that Midge would become a successful stand-up, but I didn\u2019t really think about what that would look like in practice,\u201d she says. \u201cThe audiences are growing now, which means that they\u2019re growing for Midge, but they\u2019re also growing for me. I\u2019m performing in front of more and more people every time I get up onstage, and it\u2019s horrifying. It never gets less horrifying. Although from some stand-ups I\u2019ve spoken to, it doesn\u2019t seem that out of the ordinary. So I\u2019m in good company with the constant state of petrification.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of living up to the creators\u2019 exacting standards, a point Sherman-Palladino highlighted when receiving the trophy for best writing. She thanked the cast for its endurance and \u201cgraciously accept[ing] that sometimes it matters when you drop the \u2018the.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nBrosnahan acknowledges the pressure is intense. \u201cBut I appreciate that she knows that her dialogue exactly as written is the best version of it,\u201d she says. Two script supervisors are on hand to make sure nothing goes amiss \u2014 one matches the actions, and the other is solely there to monitor the dialogue. \u201cShe\u2019s very gentle and so lovely and patient,\u201d Brosnahan says, \u201cbut she will often come in with a contraction note: \u2018It\u2019s \u201cit\u2019s,\u201d and you\u2019re saying \u201cIt is.\u201d\u2019 But she\u2019s always right. It\u2019s those tiny, tiny little shifts that make the thing sing.\u201d\r\nThe secret of Rachel\u2019s success is good old-fashioned talent and extreme hard work. no one works harder on her craft. she\u2019s a total and utter perfectionist, but in the nicest possible way.\r\namy sherman-palladino\r\nSherman-Palladino has created some of TV\u2019s most indelible female characters, working with actresses like Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Sutton Foster. (\u201cI need those fast-talking broads!\u201d she quips.) And this partnership, too, has delivered creatively for both.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe secret of Rachel\u2019s success is good old-fashioned talent and extreme hard work. No one works harder on her craft, on her character,\u201d says Sherman-Palladino. \u201cShe\u2019s a total and utter perfectionist, but in the nicest possible way. It\u2019s that fearlessness, that confidence, that strength, that ability to commit everything to a scene, that brings Midge alive. Plus, no one can take off some gloves, a coat and a purse faster or with more precision. That may not sound like much, but in our show \u2014 it\u2019s a lifesaver.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrosnahan says she\u2019s \u201ccompletely in awe\u201d of her boss\u2019 talent. \u201cShe knows exactly what she wants all the time, not unlike Midge,\u201d she says. \u201cShe tackles this enormous show and all of the stuff that comes with it with a real sense of joy.\u201d And she admits she\u2019s desperately striving to keep up with Sherman-Palladino\u2019s famously encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture, whether from today or the 1950s. \u201cShe was very dismayed that I didn\u2019t know who the Dionne quintuplets were!\u201d she says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe costumes also help her get into character \u2014 they\u2019re all tailor-made and custom-designed by Donna Zakowska. \u201cI don\u2019t feel complete until I have a wig on, my hair did, lipstick and the corset,\u201d says Brosnahan. It\u2019s not about making her thinner \u2014 her petite frame is apparent, even clad in a heavy hotel robe \u2014 but about giving her body the right shape for the period. \u201cMidge is very fashion-conscious, and the shape of 1950s fashion was with a long torso and lower waist,\u201d she says, explaining that her waist falls naturally higher. \u201cThis way the costumes really do look like they came out of a fashion magazine because that would have been important to Midge.\u201d\r\n\r\nShe hasn\u2019t quite stolen anything from Midge\u2019s ample closet yet, though she has her eye on a gray knee-length cashmere coat. \u201cIt\u2019s so luxurious and heavy and warm, it\u2019s just like wearing a blanket,\u201d she sighs.\r\n\r\nAlthough Brosnahan was shy as a kid growing up in suburban Illinois, she says she always wanted to be an actress.\r\n\r\n\u201cMostly I just had a love for storytelling, from a very young age,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved to read. I was an incessant reader \u2014 anything and everything.\u201d Fantasy novels were a favorite \u2014 from Roald Dahl to the Harry Potter books \u2014 for the way they transported her to faraway, different worlds. \u201cThat translated very directly into a love for this kind of storytelling and a love for period pieces.\u201d Bit parts in the third-grade play, \u201cwhere you pulled your part out of a hat and played Troll No. 2,\u201d translated into more formidable roles in high school and college.\r\n\r\nBut acting felt like a hobby, she says. \u201cI guess I just didn\u2019t know for a long time that it could be a career. I always felt like maybe I would have to choose something else.\u201d She even considered a career in psychology, which she minored in in college.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then she landed the part of the enigmatic Rachel Posner in Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and turned what was planned to be a five-line role into a recurring character (and snagged an Emmy nom for guest actress).\r\n\r\nThe series' then-showrunner Beau Willimon says Brosnahan's performance \"leapt off the screen\" so much that they wrote large parts of the season to expand her story. \"The more we worked with Rachel, the more obvious it became that she had a long and successful career ahead of her,\" he says. \"I can't say we predicted she'd win an Emmy, but with an extraordinary gift like hers, I'm not at all surprised.\"\r\n\r\nBrosnahan remains grateful for the opportunity the show provided. \u201cI look often at \u2018House of Cards,\u2019 which at the time felt like absolutely the hardest, most excruciating and also fulfilling \u2014 by the same token \u2014 thing I\u2019d ever done up until this point, and they\u2019re just so different. That was challenging because it required digging into emotional depths that I\u2019d never traveled to before and trying to hold my own with such powerhouses around me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been so lucky to be able to say that I had more than one experience that\u2019s as fulfilling as the current one.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter Brosnahan starred in the WGN America drama series \u201cManhattan\u201d and took on a few stage roles, the script for \u201cMaisel\u201d landed in her lap. \u201cI fell in love with it from the first page,\u201d she says. \u201cMidge reminded me of so many women that I know and love in my own life that I don\u2019t see on-screen enough \u2014 unapologetically confident, ambitious women who approach the world with a sense of insatiable curiosity and joy. She\u2019s complicated too. She\u2019s privileged and selfish and has a hard time seeing outside her previously very narrow worldview. But she\u2019s interested in growing and evolving. And that\u2019s exciting to me as well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Palladinos were cycling through a stream of auditions when Brosnahan walked in.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fearlessness to Rachel,\u201d says Sherman-Palladino. \u201cShe was not afraid to lean into the anger that Midge was feeling when she took that stage.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrosnahan says she recognizes the rage that fuels Midge\u2019s mission. \u201cWomen are angry sometimes. Men are angry. Everybody\u2019s angry,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t you be angry if your husband walked out on you, after all of your goals have been accomplished and dreams have come true? You have a perfect life, and everything comes shattering down. I\u2019m glad it came through, and they bought it.\u201d\r\n\r\nJennifer Salke, head of Amazon Studios, says of Brosnahan\u2019s portrayal: \u201cRachel brings a rawness and relentless authenticity to Midge that comes from a deeply committed place. The audience has to believe that Midge is on this journey that she never intended would be her path in life. There is never a moment where the performance doesn\u2019t ring true, and that is an unbelievable feat in bringing a character to life.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Palladinos had been developing the series for years, but its debut last November couldn\u2019t have been timed more perfectly: The show about a woman finding her voice hit as the national conversation turned to precisely that subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI have no desire to stop playing her anytime soon,\u201d says Brosnahan of Midge Maisel. \u201cI\u2019m into playing her as long as Amy wants to keep writing her and directing her.\u201d\r\nCourtesy of Amazon Studios\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it was a fortunate coincidence,\u201d says Brosnahan. \u201cBut it\u2019s been really encouraging talking to young women who feel inspired by the show and inspired by Midge in her journey and her innate sense of self-empowerment.\u201d\r\n\r\nBrosnahan promises there\u2019s more to come in Season 2 as Midge explores her voice onstage. \u201cI love how she\u2019s asking questions about motherhood and womanhood and the double standards between women and men and some of the hypocrisy that she\u2019s noticing now that she\u2019s got her eyes wide open,\u201d she says. There\u2019s a moment in the second season when she dares to say the word \u201cpregnant\u201d onstage \u2014 it was a taboo for comics back then \u2014 \u201cand it\u2019s not well received,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the 1950s that isn\u2019t something you can talk about. It\u2019s considered crude and rude and private and inappropriate to be discussing in public, and I think that just fuels her fire.\u201d\r\n\r\nThough she now has both a Golden Globe and an Emmy to her name, Brosnahan says she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s quite arrived. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you ever have that moment,\u201d she says.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it always feels like the other shoe could drop, and that\u2019s motivating in its own way. It feels kind of important to never feel like \u2018I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 It feels like the minute I reach that point, I\u2019ll stop taking risks, and I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile she\u2019s in \u201cMaisel\u201d for the \u201clong haul\u201d (\u201cI have no desire to stop playing her anytime soon\u201d), she\u2019s got her eye out for other projects with female creators.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m dying to work with more women in all different facets of the industry,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope that there\u2019ll be more opportunities to work with more women as we continue the conversation about the need for more women to be represented in different parts of this industry, whether in front of or behind the camera.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd maybe one day she\u2019ll join their ranks as a producer or director. \u201cI\u2019d like to do it all \u2014 if they\u2019ll let me,\u201d she says.", "application-name": "Variety", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=https://variety.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=16", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "fragment": "!"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537448450.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
