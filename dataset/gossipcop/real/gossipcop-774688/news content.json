Like Stassi just bought a bikini for $200 would she pay that or would Bravo foot the bill as the purchase and shopping trip was for filming?\n\n-Holidays/Trips? I noticed certain housewives being the host or inviting other housewives but who actually pays for the holiday itself?", "images": ["https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/renderTimingPixel.png", "https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2v6dk/styles/communityIcon_o5brmt5pdyk41.png"], "top_img": "https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BravoRealHousewives/comments/8izf08/who_pays_bravo/", "title": "Who pays?
