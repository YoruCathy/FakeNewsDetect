{"url": "http://time.com/4503609/shia-labeouf-weird-behavior-timeline/", "text": "Most people were first introduced to Shia LaBeouf in 2000 when he starred in the Disney show Even Stevens. As Louis Stevens, the mischievous ne\u2019er do well little brother of a perfectionist older sister, he seemed to fit right in with the glossy kids the channel was prepping for stardom.\n\nBut LaBeouf\u2019s career has taken some interesting twists and turns in the intervening dozen-plus years, as he\u2019s appeared in franchises like Transformers as well as prestigious indies, and then hit some controversial and legal snags and engaged in political protest.\n\n\u201cThe star is a by-product of the machine age,\u201d he told ArtNet News in 2016, \u201ca relic of modernist ideals, it\u2019s outmoded.\u201d So instead of playing by the script, LaBeouf has continually made choices that are, well, unusual. Think: performance art projects, cryptic interviews and swathes of time spent without bathing.\n\nHere\u2019s a roundup of the actor\u2019s enduring, awesome weirdness\u2014and his evolving public art projects.\n\nJuly 2009: After LaBeouf was charged with a misdemeanor for criminal trespassing following his 21st birthday, he told David Letterman that he\u2019d just been trying to buy some cigarettes at four in the morning. \u201cI got really wasted in Chicago and ended up celebrating in Walgreens,\u201d he says. He ended up making multiple late-night Walgreens visits, each of them involving a costume change. Ultimately, the store dropped the charges.\n\nDecember 2013: LaBeouf releases a short film online that viewers discover is a plagiarized enactment of a short story that was actually written by author Daniel Clowes, who is not credited. This incident kicks off LaBeouf\u2019s notable phase of borrowing quotes, lines and works from other people. In a 2016 interview with ArtNet News, he cited this moment as transformational in terms of moving him introducing him to a future in performance art. \u201cThe idea of the \u2018star\u2019 could become a prime site for the formulation of new stances whose honesty might advance a more satisfying kind of affect,\u201d he said. He apologized via Twitter to Clowes\u2014but the tweets were all unattributed quotes themselves, too.\n\nFebruary 2014: LaBeouf wears a paper bag on his head as he walks the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival for the premiere of his movie Nymphomaniac. The bag reads \u201cI am not famous anymore\u201d in large letters across his face.\n\nFebruary 2014: During a press conference to promote Nymphomaniac at the Berlin Film Festival, he delivers a cryptic line: \u201cWhen the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.\u201d Then he stormed out. Journalists noted that the line is actually from a Manchester United football player named Eric Cantona, who reportedly said these same words before walking out of a news conference in 1995 after being convicted for assault.\n\nFebruary 2014: LaBeouf launches the #IAMSORRY project, in which he appears alone with that same paper bag over his head in a room in a Los Angeles art space. Visitors are allowed, one by one, to visit him and use a variety of props in their interactions, including a bottle of Jack Daniels. Afterward, LaBeouf said in an interview with Dazed that he had been raped by one of the visitors during the 5-day experiment. Afterward, his collaborators Turner and R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 publicly noted that they \u201cput a stop\u201d to the incident when they became aware of it. No charges were pressed against the alleged perpetrator.\n\nJune 2014: During a Broadway performance of Cabaret, LaBeouf is escorted from the audience after allegedly engaging in disruptive behavior. (Witnesses say he went up on stage and grabbed at actor Alan Cumming.) He subsequently spends the night in jail, and eventually pled guilty to disorderly conduct.\n\nJune 2014: LaBeouf reportedly heads straight to an audition after spending his night in jail. The movie is War Dogs, directed by Jake Phillips\u2014and the actor he\u2019s auditioning with is current late-night host James Corden. (Ultimately, War Dogs would be made starring Jonah Hill and Miles Teller and released in 2016.) In the audition, LaBeouf reads his line while wearing his shoelaces dangling over his face. As Phillips later explained, the actor\u2019s shoelaces had been removed during his jail stint. \u201cSo he was carrying his shoelaces, and he put them on his face because he was being weird and wanted to throw you off a little bit,\u201d he told Corden in a later interview.\n\nJanuary 2015: In Sia\u2019s music video for \u201cElastic Heart,\u201d LaBeouf and dancer Maddie Ziegler don nude leotards and circle each other warily in a large metal bird cage. The pop singer later apologizes after some find the interaction between LeBeouf and Zieger potentially sexually suggestive, stating that the pair were the only two actors she felt could play \u201ctwo warring \u2018Sia\u2019 self states.\u201d\n\nMarch 2015: LaBeouf sets up a livestream of his heartbeat.\n\nMay 2015: Along with art students at Central St. Martins, LaBeouf films 30 minutes of seemingly improvisational acting in front of a green screen. The soundbites from the footage would become prime meme material. \u201cSeen from a distance, almost everything looks beautiful,\u201d he muses poetically. At one point, he yells: \u201cDo it! Just do it! Don\u2019t let your dreams be dreams!\u201d This particular segment spawned a series of its own memes, his tough-love acting taking the Internet by storm.\n\nOctober 2015: LaBeouf was arrested for public intoxication while crossing the street in Austin, Texas, booked into the local jail for the night, and later released on his own recognizance.\n\nNovember 2015: He and a writer for Dazed magazine both don GoPro video cameras on their heads and sit filming each other, in silence, for an hour. There are moments of levity throughout as the two can\u2019t help but laugh.\n\nNovember 2015: It\u2019s a busy month of self-reflection for LaBeouf, who invites fans to join him as he watches all of his movies\u2014in order\u2014at Manhattan\u2019s Angelika Film Center. He also livestreams his own face during the experience, sharing the varied emotions of his reactions with the world at large. They\u2019re pretty good.\n\nFebruary 2016: He spends 24 hours in an elevator as performance art, again with frequent collaborators R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 and Turner. They livestream the whole thing, naturally.\n\nApril 2016: A man in New York City was punched out by a stranger who said he \u201clooked like Shia LaBeouf.\u201d The actor called and left a message to apologize to his victimized doppelg\u00e4nger even though he had nothing to do with the actual incident\u2014and offer him some soup as a condolence. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Hey, this is Shia LaBeouf\u2026 I just read an article that you were punched in the face because you look like me?\u2019 And he was like, \u2018Aw, man. That sucks. I\u2019m so sorry. But I get it. It\u2019s happened to me before.\u2019 And then he was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know. I wish I was in New York. I\u2019d come bring you soup,'\u201d the lookalike told the New York Post.\n\nMay 2016: Shia launches an open-sourced, monthlong cross-country journey. Called \u201c#TakeMeAnywhere,\u201d he tweets out his geographic coordinates daily, allowing fans to find him, pick him up, and take him\u2026 anywhere. (And do pretty much anything with him in the process. He\u2019s shared some pretty weird revelations with some of his fans in the process, but others came away impressed. \u201cSometimes when you meet your heroes, you\u2019re disappointed when you meet them, but not Shia,\u201d one fan who met up with him said afterward. \u201cHe was just an amazing guy. He was so receptive and conversational. I think he\u2019s a true artist.\u201d\n\nDecember 2016: The trio of LaBeouf, R\u00f6nkk\u00f6, and Turner camp out at the Sydney Opera House during a culture festival for two nights as, one by one, visitors delivered a message to them starting with the cryptic phrase \u201cAnd in the end\u2026\u201d \u201cAs 2016 draws to a close, we are all too aware of the pervasive sense of foreboding that has come to define the year,\u201d LaBeouf and his collaborators expressed in a statement about the project, called #ANDINTHEEND. \u201cAnd yet, we still yearn for some greater truth, for the utopias of our distant horizons, expressed through art.\u201d The messages from the visitors were streamed online and on a giant digital screen outside the Opera House, while the three onstage intermittently read out some of the striking statements.\n\nJanuary 2017: In his most overtly political work yet, LaBeouf and company set up a camera connected to a continuous livestream outside of New York\u2019s Museum of the Moving Image. The message, this time, was \u201cHe Will Not Divide Us\u201d\u2014that \u201che\u201d referring to new President Donald Trump. To launch the protest project, LaBeouf recruited Jaden Smith to recite the phrase like a mantra for over four hours during Inauguration Day. The livestream was ostensibly set to continue throughout Trump\u2019s tenure, and drew crowds\u2014and controversy. LaBeouf was allegedly arrested during an on-camera tussle with a detractor.\n\nFebruary 2017: The Museum of the Moving Image shut down the He Will Not Divide Us project on Feb. 10 in a move that LaBeouf and his collaborators considered \u201cabandonment.\u201d They then relocated the installation to the El Rey Theater in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Feb. 18 to keep the momentum going. But that was not to last long. According to Deadline, the camera was vandalized with spray paint after just two days at its new home, and on Feb. 23, LaBeouf shared an update that the stream had been taken down after reports of gunshots.\n\nMarch 2017: He Will Not Divide Us reopens on March 22\u2014with some adjustments\u2014in the U.K., taking the form of a waving flag printed with the statement and hoisted above the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology in Liverpool. \u201cEvents have shown that America is simply not safe enough for this artwork to exist,\u201d LaBeouf, R\u00f6nkk\u00f6, and Turner said in a statement about the work\u2019s latest iteration.\n\nTurns out, the U.K. wasn\u2019t \u201csafe enough\u201d either: after just a single day, police were called to the scene when trespassers attempted to climb the flagpole, according to a Merseyside Police statement. The flag was subsequently removed on police advice, the BBC reports.\n\nApril 2017: LaBeouf performs a 2017 version of the Walden Pond experiment, spending a month alone in a cabin in Finland starting April 12. (Ronkko and Turner are also alone, at different cabins.) The new project is called #ALONETOGETHER. Visitors to a Finnish museum can send messages to the artists, which they\u2019ll respond to by text. As usual, it\u2019s livestreamed; so far, they\u2019ve been complaining of the cold at their mysterious, remote locales in Lapland. Shia\u2019s also shared tidbits about his \u201cbadass\u201d grandmother, the funky spelling of his last name, and his teetotaling approach to the experiment.\n\nJuly 2017: LaBeouf is arrested in Savannah, GA for \u201cdisorderly conduct, obstruction and public drunkenness\u201d while trying to bum a cigarette, and released soon after on bail. However, video of an expletive-riddled, racist rant leveled at the police officers took on a life of its own, prompting LaBeouf to share a formal apology via Twitter. He called the incident a \u201cnew low\u201d and expressed a new commitment towards attaining sobriety.\n\nMarch 2018: LaBeouf is the cover star of Esquire Magazine, in which he opens up about his struggles with addiction, his fraught relationship with his father and the screenplay he penned, working title Honey Boy, based on his life as a child star living with his dad. (Soon after, news came out that the movie would go forward with LaBeouf playing his own father, and actor Lucas Hedges playing LaBeouf as a kid.) LaBeouf also noted, as an aside, that Kanye West once took a bunch of his clothes out of his closet at his own offering.\n\nApril 2018: In an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! LaBeouf is his usual candid self \u2014 maybe a little too candid. While discussing his experiences in Finland and the acceptance of nudity he encountered there, he got reflective with a NSFW memory.\n\nGet The Brief.
