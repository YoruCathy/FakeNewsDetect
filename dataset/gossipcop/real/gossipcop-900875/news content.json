Series star Kristen Bell announced on Twitter that the series is coming to Hulu for fans to rewatch, \u201cwhich is great, because you\u2019ll need to brush up, because we\u2019re making another one!\u201d\n\nIn August, word broke that Hulu was working on a revival of the show. Following Bell\u2019s video, Hulu confirmed that it has picked up a limited, eight-episode season, with creator Rob Thomas coming back to write the first episode and produce the series. The new season will follow Veronica as she\u2019s hired to investigate the murders of spring breakers, in a \u201cmystery that pits the enclave\u2019s wealthy elites ... against a working class that relies on the cash influx that comes with being the West Coast\u2019s answer to Daytona Beach.\u201d Hulu says that it will stream the show\u2019s existing three seasons and movie starting next summer, and the show will return sometime in 2019.\n\nThe cult hit, which originally aired on UPN and the CW between 2004 and 2007 before it was canceled, followed Veronica Mars, a high school student who moonlights as a private investigator. The show\u2019s cast and creators have repeatedly voiced their desire to revive the show. In 2014, they raised $5.7 million on Kickstarter and made a film. Creator Rob Thomas has also released a pair of mystery novels that continue the adventures of the character.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSwJVED2hVmWgoCpbQKS1ZptPaw=/0x0:1600x838/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13124845/veronica_mars_watching_recommendation_videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOCYpfMSpUA2OzhPhR4bKCVbbeY=/0x0:1600x900/1200x800/filters:focal(670x111:926x367)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/61479649/veronica_mars_watching_recommendation_videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aSwJVED2hVmWgoCpbQKS1ZptPaw=/0x0:1600x838/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13124845/veronica_mars_watching_recommendation_videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Liptak", "Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883176/veronica-mars-hulu-back-new-season-kristen-bell-rob-thomas", "title": "Hulu is bringing back Veronica Mars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/verge", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/andrewjliptak/", "published_time": "2018-09-20T13:34:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-20T13:34:15-04:00"}, "author": "Andrew Liptak", "style-tools": "https://www.theverge.com/style/community/372/e8584abde1fc118cbb44d8e68e9902bc/tools.css", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Hulu announced today that it greenlit an eight-episode revival of the cult classic TV show Veronica Mars, which will premiere in 2019.
