Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nHe also said, \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it\u2019s totally necessary.\u201d\n\nDriver, who criticized Damon for the comments at the time, told the New York Times on Tuesday that she feels Damon \u201crepresented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Rob Kim/Getty; Michael Loccisano/Getty\n\nShe added, \u201cThat somehow we should have a hierarchical system whereby touch on the arse is this, tits is this, you know, front bottom, back bottom, over the shirt, rape! That there would be some criteria.\u201d\n\nDriver advocated for involving men in the women\u2019s movement, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no way to move forward unless we do this together.\u201d\n\nIn January, Damon apologized for his controversial comments, telling the Today show, \u201cI really wish I\u2019d listened a lot more before I weighed in on this. Ultimately what it is for me is that I don\u2019t want to further anybody\u2019s pain. With anything that I do or say, so for that I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\nDriver also told the NYT she supported a \u201cmodel of truth and reconciliation,\u201d referring to commissions that were established after the Rwandan genocide and South African apartheid, in which victims of violence were given a platform to speak.\n\n\u201cWomen get to be heard,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou get to be seen and heard and the accusers get to hear that and get to metabolize that and then there is due process and then there is healing.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Minnie Driver and Matt Damon in 1998 Steve Granitz/WireImage\n\nDriver, who costarred with Damon in 1997\u2019s Good Will Hunting, also spoke again about how the film\u2019s producer, now-disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein, did not want to cast her in the film.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t want to cast me,\u201d she said, explaining that the casting director didn\u2019t think she was attractive enough to have sex with. \u201cI got off lightly with him. I really did,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen we talk about sexual harassment, it\u2019s not about sex, it\u2019s about power.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Weinstein previously said that the producer did pull for Ashley Judd to star in the role that ultimately went to Driver, but denied that Driver was considered not attractive enough for the part.\n\n\u201cWhile Ashley was the top choice for Miramax and Mr. Weinstein, the role went to Minnie Driver, who was the star and director\u2019s preference,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cMinnie did a brilliant job and he believes Ashley would have as well.\u201d\n\nLast year, Driver opened up about her own experience with sexual assault as a teen. \u201cWhen I was [17], I was on vacation in Greece, and this guy, kinda elbow-grabbed me, and said \u2018You\u2019re going to dance with me,\u2019\u201d she said on Sirius XM\u2019s StandUP! with Pete Dominick. \u201cI said \u2018no\u2019 and I pulled my arm away from him, and he grabbed me by the back of my hair. I tried to kick him, and then he punched me.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fminnie-driver-matt-damon.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fminnie-driver-matt-damon.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Fminnie-driver-matt-damon-2-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1200&h=628&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F02%2Fminnie-driver-matt-damon.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/minnie-driver-new-dig-matt-damon-nice-white-male/", "title": "Minnie Driver Rationalizes Matt Damon's Sexual Harassment Remarks: He's a 'Nice White Male'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Matt Damon,Minnie Driver,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "news_keywords": "Matt Damon,Minnie Driver,Movie Celebrities,Movie News,News", "description": "Driver said Damon \u201crepresented every intelligent, nice white male who feels it is their job to comment on the way that women metabolize stuff.\u201d", "og": {"title": "Minnie Driver Rationalizes Matt Damon's Sexual Harassment Remarks: He's a 'Nice White Male'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/minnie-driver-new-dig-matt-damon-nice-white-male/", "description": "Minnie Driver is once again calling out her former costar and boyfriend&nbsp;Matt Damon for his previous comments about sexual misconduct in Hollywood and beyond.
