The cat then scaled up the professor\u2019s arm like a personal Everest.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEh \u2014 we tolerate this?\u201d Targalski asked. It was both a question and an apologetic statement, directed more to the camera crew and less to the cat, who by this point was already upon his neck.\n\nThe Polish historian & political scientist Jerzy Targalski remained completely unruffled during our interview when this happened\ud83d\udc47\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/4dLi16Pq1H \u2014 Rudy Bouma (@rudybouma) July 7, 2018\n\nSomeone from behind the camera made a sound. Targalski smiled and pressed on, with the resignation of a man who has shared his home with a cat and thus knows his place in the feline-human order.\n\nHe spoke of the presence of secret-police agents in certain countries and what that means for the political transformation of those countries. But he may as well not have been speaking at all for all the attention his cat was stealing.\n\nAD\n\nAs Targalski continued the interview, his cat nuzzled his ear, used his shoulders to get a closer look at a chandelier above and, at one point, curled its tail across Targalski\u2019s face, covering his eyes. The political scientist, who earned his PhD with a thesis titled \u201cMechanisms of dismantling communism in Yugoslavia on the example of Slovenia and Serbia (1986-1991),\u201d simply brushed the cat\u2019s tail away and held it down for several moments to the side of his head.\n\nAD\n\nAlas, none of that footage made it into the final Nieuwsuur segment. Lisio does, however, manage a cameo in the final cut that aired last week (around the 3:50 mark in the video below) in a far less obtrusive manner \u2014 by lying in Targalski\u2019s lap, getting petted as the professor conducts a seated interview.\n\nDoor ingrijpen van regering in #Polen moeten 27 leden van het Hooggerechtshof vervroegd met pensioen.

Kelly (better known as \u201cBBC dad\u201d) can tell you after his two young children hilariously crashed his BBC appearance last year.\n\nAD\n\nHe\u2019s not even the first to have a cat interrupt a television shoot. Last year, Dumka \u2014 a black cat belonging to Nils Usakovs, the mayor of Riga, Latvia \u2014 wandered into an online Q&A session his human was hosting, to the delight of many of the mayor\u2019s Facebook followers, as The Washington Post\u2019s Karin Brulliard reported.\n\nAD\n\nUsakovs took it in good stride, writing later on Facebook: \u201cAnything can happen if your office is ruled by cats.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/9deae4bf-86c8-4f49-8658-ce5f2f4b2a30.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-i-b2ReyBLde3FJffMs-mfmPnS8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CUJRICLZ5Y7C7LLGKQ5TT4CC7I.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-i-b2ReyBLde3FJffMs-mfmPnS8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CUJRICLZ5Y7C7LLGKQ5TT4CC7I.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy B Wang", "National Politics Reporter Covering Presidential Campaigns"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2018/07/09/a-professor-was-giving-a-tv-interview-about-polish-politics-his-cat-didnt-care/", "title": "A professor was giving a TV interview about Polish politics.
