The 34-year-old television personality tied the knot with his longtime fianc\u00e9e Kaitlynn Carter on Saturday.\n\nJenner and Carter\u2019s wedding took place on the exotic island of Nihi Sumba in Indonesia. The oceanside ceremony was joined by 50 of the bride and groom\u2019s family and friends, according to People.\n\nThe couple exchanged their wedding vows in front of Jenner\u2019s brother Brandon and mother Linda Thompson. Meanwhile, the \u201cI Am Cait\u201d star wasn\u2019t able to attend her son\u2019s big day because she chose to fly to Vienna, Austria to attend the Life Ball fundraising event.\n\nJenner and Carter\u2019s wedding was the culmination of the four-day festivities on the island, which included horse races on the beach and a white party where the couple and their guests danced the night away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just excited to celebrate spending the rest of our lives together,\u201d Jenner said days prior the ceremony. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to marry Kaitlynn.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how much Jenner spent for the four-day affair, but Page Six has learned that he is shelling out $6,000 per night on the suite where he and Carter are spending their honeymoon.\n\nJenner and Carter originally had invited 70 guests, but not everyone was able to attend. Aside from Jenner\u2019s father, his half-sisters with Kris Jenner, Kendall and Kylie, also did not make it to the tropical wedding.\n\nKylie was said to be busy taking care of baby True, so she chose not to come. On the other hand, Kendall\u2019s reason for ditching the family event was not disclosed.\n\n\u201cMy two little sisters, we never even heard from them. They never even RSVP\u2019d I don\u2019t think,\u201d the former \u201cThe Hills\u201d star said days before the nuptials. \u201cWe sent them an invite but we just never heard anything back. Well, they\u2019ll be missed. I would have loved to have had them there.\u201d\n\nBecause some important people weren\u2019t able to fly to Indonesia, a source dished to Us Weekly that Jenner and Carter are planning to host a second wedding celebration when they get back to Los Angeles after their honeymoon.", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/trump-has-largely-left-decisions-on-easing-lockdowns.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/02/brody-jenner.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/04/20/apple-tim-cook-watch.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/wuhan-is-slowly-reopening-after-a-lockdown-to.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/leader-of-italys-far-right-league-party-matteo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2014/01/21/target-logo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/16/arinew10.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/messages-of-support-for-the-residents-are-displayed.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/02/06/airasias-top-executives-have-stepped-aside-during-an.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/02/brody-jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/inside-brody-jenner-kaitlynn-carters-oceanside-wedding-indonesia-2686703", "title": "Inside Brody Jenner, Kaitlynn Carter\u2019s Oceanside Wedding In Indonesia", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "brody jenner, brody jenner dating, brody jenner girlfriend, brody jenner wife, brody jenner kaitlynn carter, brody jenner father, brody jenner caitlyn jenner, keeping up with the kardashians, reality tv", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/inside-brody-jenner-kaitlynn-carters-oceanside-wedding-indonesia-2686703", "title": "Inside Brody Jenner, Kaitlynn Carter\u2019s Oceanside Wedding In Indonesia", "description": "Brody Jenner and longtime girlfriend Kaitlynn Carter tied the knot in an oceanside ceremony in Indonesia.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/02/brody-jenner.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/02/brody-jenner.jpg", "height": 901, "width": 600, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Mel Rose Matulac", "modified_time": "2018-06-03T03:51:48-04:00", "published_time": "2018-06-03T03:51:48-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Inside Brody Jenner, Kaitlynn Carter\u2019s Oceanside Wedding In Indonesia", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/inside-brody-jenner-kaitlynn-carters-oceanside-wedding-indonesia-2686703", "description": "Brody Jenner and longtime girlfriend Kaitlynn Carter tied the knot in an oceanside ceremony in Indonesia.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/02/brody-jenner.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "brody jenner, brody jenner dating, brody jenner girlfriend, brody jenner wife, brody jenner kaitlynn carter, brody jenner father, brody jenner caitlyn jenner, keeping up with the kardashians, reality tv", "author": "Mel Rose Matulac", "description": "Brody Jenner and longtime girlfriend Kaitlynn Carter tied the knot in an oceanside ceremony in Indonesia."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528012308.0, "source": "https://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
