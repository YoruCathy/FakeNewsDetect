As he started explaining his passion for all the \u201cmagic,\u201d \u201cwands and little weird candies that make you turn into like a lion,\u201d a lightning bolt scar appeared on his forehead, then a pair of round, black glasses.\n\nHe then appeared in full Gryffindor robes with a wand in hand, followed by another costume change into Dumbledore.\n\n\u201cI just love it so much,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what keeps me young, I feel like.\u201d\n\nOn a completely different topic, Mendes and Corden played ice hockey together \u2014 Corden trying his hardest to be goalie is a sight to see \u2014 and talked about Justin Bieber\u2019s dirty underwear. The \u201cYouth\u201d singer said he would definitely buy the Bieb\u2019s underwear for $500 if it went up for auction.\n\nThere are conditions, obviously. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a pair of underpants that he just wore on Tuesday,\u201d Corden said. \u201cI want it to be the pair of underpants he recorded \u2018Love Yourself\u2019 in.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest rendition of Carpool
