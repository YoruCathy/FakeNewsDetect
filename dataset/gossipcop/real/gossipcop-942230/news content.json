It can be so hard (and boring) to eat really clean all of the time. A cheat meal allows me to enjoy food without feeling like I\u2019m overindulging. My trainer, Mel, instructs that you should schedule a cheat meal about once every 10 days. This way you won\u2019t lose any of the progress you\u2019ve made at the gym.\u201d\n\nKimmy recommends that you indulge WITHOUT booze, and to do so infrequently. However, the day after you treat yourself, you MUST \u201cget back on track.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you do them too often, your body\u2019s hormones are thrown off\u2026 Your testosterone, which is a muscle-making and fat-loss hormone, can change if you\u2019re eating too many calories, which can make you gain weight. You can still enjoy your favorite food, as long as you get back on track the next day. Cheat meals work best when you avoid alcohol, since they\u2019re empty calories filled with sugar. This part is easy for me since I don\u2019t really drink\u251c\u00f3\u0393\u00e9\u00bc\u0393\u00c7\u00a5which means I can just have an extra doughnut or two. Kidding! I do have a sweet tooth, though, so normally my cheat meals are desserts or other sweets.\u201d\n\nJudging from her appearance, the 37-year-old clearly knows what she\u2019s talking about!\n\nIn February of this year, the mother-of-three revealed she has a 24-inch waist and 39-inch hips.\n\nKim, whatever you\u2019re doing, keep it up!\n\n[Image via Dennis Van Tine/Future Image/WENN.]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20118%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20430%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20111%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20244%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20112%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20188%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-hilton-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20356%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20225%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20113%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20248%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20538%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20162%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20275%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20163%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2083%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20101%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20311%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20100%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20312%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg"], "top_img": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/themes/perezhilton_com/static/images/perez-default.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/kim-kardashian-cheat-meal-healthy-eating-blog-post-website/", "title": "REVEALED: Kim Kardashian\u2019s Cheat Meal Strategy!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "8jhNuv6mCy23T6U62W5nXupmY4X1fumTlO3sRfrF0Oc", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "REVEALED: Kim Kardashian's Cheat Meal Strategy! - Perez Hilton", "description": "Kim Kardashian says it\u2019s okay to cheat\u2026 on your diet!
