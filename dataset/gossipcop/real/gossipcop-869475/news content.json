The Oscar winner gave her side of the story during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Sunday, July 23.\n\nBack in 2014, the Sister, Sister alum allegedly told InTouch that she was snubbed by the Atomic Blonde actress. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t very nice to me. I said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 and she actually rolled her eyes and said, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019\u201d Mowry, now 39, told the magazine at the time. \u201cI wasn\u2019t over-the-top. I know how to approach another celebrity. Charlize was just mean. I\u2019m just being honest.\u201d\n\n\n\nCelebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever!\n\nThen, Dish Nation reported that Theron, 41, was \u201cso pissed off\u201d that she demanded SoulCycle ban Mowry from their spin classes.\n\nDuring a round of \u201cPlead the Fifth,\u201d Cohen recapped the rumors and asked Theron what really happened. \u201cWhat a bitch,\u201d the Monster actress joked.\n\n\u201cWell you can\u2019t go by that,\u201d Theron said of the false story. \u201cI\u2019m really nice at SoulCycle actually, because once my endorphins kick in I\u2019m actually almost too friendly. I\u2019m always touching people, like, \u2018Hey!\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added that she doesn\u2019t even remember seeing the The Game actress at SoulCycle. \u201cI\u2019m not an eye roller, but I would be like f\u2013k off,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/charlize-tia-91bf4257-64bb-4a58-bde9-a9218fc92e1b.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/charlize-tia-35ec4bb9-c573-45f5-be9e-06ca98b1029c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/charlize-tia-35ec4bb9-c573-45f5-be9e-06ca98b1029c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlize-theron-clears-up-rumored-soulcycle-drama-with-tia-mowry-w493709/", "title": "Charlize Theron Clears Up Rumored SoulCycle Drama With Tia Mowry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Charlize Theron cleared up an old 2014 rumor that she rolled her eyes at Tia Mowry at a SoulCycle class \u2014 read more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Did Charlize Theron Really Roll Her Eyes at Tia Mowry at SoulCycle?", "description": "Charlize Theron cleared up an old 2014 rumor that she rolled her eyes at Tia Mowry at a SoulCycle class \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/charlize-theron-clears-up-rumored-soulcycle-drama-with-tia-mowry-w493709/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:52:15+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/charlize-tia-35ec4bb9-c573-45f5-be9e-06ca98b1029c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/charlize-tia-35ec4bb9-c573-45f5-be9e-06ca98b1029c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Video", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-07-24T14:43:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:52:15+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Charlize Theron cleared up an old 2014 rumor that she rolled her eyes at Tia Mowry at a SoulCycle class \u2014 read more", "title": "Did Charlize Theron Really Roll Her Eyes at Tia Mowry at SoulCycle?", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/charlize-tia-35ec4bb9-c573-45f5-be9e-06ca98b1029c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500907380.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
