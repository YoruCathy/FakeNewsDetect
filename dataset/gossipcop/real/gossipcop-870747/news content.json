The legal beef between two real housewives is officially over now that a settlement has been reached. Joanna Krupa of \u201cReal Housewives of Miami\u201d and Brandi Glanville formerly of \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d recently agreed to an an out-of-court settlement in a defamation suit filed by Krupa against Glanville.\n\nAccording to E Online the drama between these two spans back to a 2013 episode of \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d where Glanville accused Krupa of breaking up RHOBH alum Yolanda Hadid\u2019s marriage to Mohamed Hadid. Brandi also added that Hadid himself told her that Joanna\u2019s roast beefy box \u201csmelled\u201d and asked Andy Cohen if he\u2019d gotten food poisoning from \u201ceating bad sushi.\u201d\n\nCan you smell that shade?\n\nE also received a statement from Brandi apologizing for her remarks about Krupa\u2019s alleged funk box.\n\n\u201cI want to apologize to Joanna Krupa for the statements I have made about her. I regret making such statements about Joanna Krupa; I also certainly never intended my statements to be taken so seriously and out of proportion.\u201d Glanville continued, \u201cI apologize as I never wanted my statements to affect Joanna Krupa\u2019s reputation and I wish her nothing but continued success in life.\u201d\n\nThe humbling is very real. So far no word on how much the reality stars settled for, but Krupa\u2019s reportedly \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the outcome.\n\nWhat do YOU think about Joanna Krupa and Brandi Glanville\u2019s feminine odor lawsuit settlement???", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/bossip4/images/logo-tmz.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035391&c4=", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=554175888070395&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/bossip4/images/svg/bossip-logo-color.svg", "https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/15871366964911-e1587136728700.jpg?w=259&h=169&crop=1", "https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/joanna-krupa-brandi-glanville-splash.png?w=560&h=320&crop=1", "https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/joanna-krupa-brandi-glanville-splash.png?w=574&h=446", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/bossip4/images/ajax-loader.gif", "https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/1587133822523-e1587133843628.jpg?w=259&h=169&crop=1", "https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/15870507991981.jpg?crop=0px%2C139px%2C699px%2C456px&resize=259%2C169"], "top_img": "https://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/joanna-krupa-brandi-glanville-splash.png?w=560&h=320&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bossip Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://bossip.com/1576404/sour-sushi-files-joanna-krupa-brandi-glanville-settle-smelly-cooch-lawsuit/", "title": "Joanna Krupa And Brandi Glanville Settle Feminine Odor Lawsuit", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100006356380901, "pages": 106856409344350}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Bossip", "creator": "@Bossip", "title": "Sour Sushi Files: Joanna Krupa & Brandi Glanville Settle Smelly Co", "description": "Petty PH problems\u2026Joanna Krupa And Brandi Glanville Settle Feminine Odor LawsuitAhhh yes, the sweet smell of\u2014-success!
