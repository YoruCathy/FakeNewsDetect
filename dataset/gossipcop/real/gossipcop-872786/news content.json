But they probably aren't using a nickname quite like the one Brandi Glanville calls her grandmother.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum revealed the eyebrow-raising moniker in a sneak peek of her session with Tyler Henry in the upcoming episode of Hollywood Medium, which you can view over at Us Weekly. The medium relays a message to Brandi from her late grandfather that's meant for her grandma, who is watching from another room, saying that he wants her to take it easy these days. \u201cThe way that this comes across is basically saying I\u2019m not worried about health but if there are going to be any issues, she might kind of overdo it by her own doing,\u201d Tyler explained. \"It's not like grandma has to worry about her health, she just might have to pace herself.\u201d\n\nThat's a sentiment that Brandi shares about her grandma, too. \"Yeah, you don't need to garden every day and live by yourself and be so, I call her 'gangster bitch grandma,'\" Brandi told Tyler, to which her grandma replied, \"Shut up, Brandi.\"\n\nBut you could tell that there was still a lot of love between Brandi and her grandma, no matter what name she calls her.\n\nTyler has read lots of Bravolebs over the years, including Carole Radziwill, Lisa Vanderpump, and Stassi Schroeder.
