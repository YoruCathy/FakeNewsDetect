We\u2019d had some public Twitter spats \u2026 Eight years or so had passed. It was time to put all that behind us,\u201d she told \u201cOn Air with Ryan Seacrest\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cI came to the studio and he played me a bunch of unfinished but really solid moments for his new record. Then he played me this one part for this new song called \u2018Feels\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Oh yeah.\u2019 This is like my favorite song off the record. I was just down to do it.\u201d\n\nHarris split from Perry\u2019s nemesis and \u201cSwish Swish\u201d muse, Swift, last summer. After the breakup, Harris called out the 27-year-old \u201cReputation\u201d singer out for trying to \u201cbury [him] like Katy.\u201d", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/katy-perry-calvin-harris-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/katy-perry-calvin-harris-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/katy-perry-calvin-harris-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["August"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/08/24/why-katy-perry-ended-her-beef-with-calvin-harris/", "title": "Why Katy Perry ended her beef with Calvin Harris", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
