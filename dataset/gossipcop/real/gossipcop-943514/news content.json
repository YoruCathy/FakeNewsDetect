It was heartbreaking for sure, but also extremely realistic. Jane\u2019s former editor-in-chief may be a goddess divine, but she isn\u2019t going to magically fix every problem her employees may have. The real world is tough, Little Jane. Get used to it.\n\nUnemployment isn\u2019t all bad for Jane, though. At least she has a reason to put on pants and go out into the sunlight: Our girl has a lunch date with Dr. Ben. It is adorable, you guys! He says things like \u201cTinder application\u201d and admits to being mad that \u201cnerds\u201d are cool now even though he had to suffer through a childhood of being an actual nerd. Dr. Ben is lovely. Here\u2019s the thing: Is he Too Nice and Too Kind and Too Drama-Free to be a viable endgame love interest on this show? I fear that Little Jane likes them complicated. Want some evidence? When their food arrives, Dr. Ben says grace and it completely and utterly freaks Jane out. If she wanted a catch to explain Dr. Ben\u2019s near perfectness, she finds one in this.\n\nWhen she explains the situation to Sutton (\u201cIt\u2019s a BIG but!\u201d) and Kat, they wonder if perhaps Jane has some unresolved issues when it comes to Ben\u2019s particular brand of religion and not religion itself. A bread crumb for what\u2019s to come later.\n\nThe next day, Jane takes her unemployment show on the road and ends up at a local coffee shop to work. She spends most of her time annoying the barista by only drinking water and ordering a mini-biscotti. She is contemplating a cat-sitting job posted on the job board when a familiar voice rings in her ears. Pinstripe is back, babies! As much as I adore Dr. Ben, this entire scene, full of some top-notch banter, reminds me just how fun the Jane-Ryan relationship was to watch. They are brimming with chemistry! Can someone please make out in this coffee shop?\n\nThere is a point to their banter, though. Jane learns that Ryan is currently working as a \u201cPage Six\u201d party reporter by night and \u201cworking on a novel\u201d by day. Since Jane is in need of a gig, she wonders if she\u2019d be a good fit for \u201cPage Six.\u201d Pinstripe is hesitant \u2014 he doesn\u2019t think Jane could hack it on the party-gossip beat \u2014 but he\u2019s willing to give her a shot. She can join him at a swanky bar this evening and if she ends up getting some real scoop, he\u2019ll introduce her to his editor.\n\nAs much as Jane insists things with Pinstripe are purely business, even Sutton knows there\u2019s more to it than that, and the proof is in Jane\u2019s choice of underwear for the evening (fancy, not full coverage). Like Sutton, I too enjoy a good love triangle. Jane\u2019s first night with Pinstripe, though, does stay firmly in the business realm. She ends up getting some scoop on a Knicks player changing sneaker endorsements and Ryan is impressed. He invites her to work the party circuit one more time before meeting with his editor. She declines in favor of a date with Dr. Ben. See guys, this really is a triangle! #MoreThanALine\n\nUnfortunately, the Scrabble and take-out date goes downhill fast once Jane catches a glimpse of Dr. Ben\u2019s cross tattoo. They get into the religion thing. She just can\u2019t understand how a man of science and rational thinking could believe in things like prayer being able to heal sick people. It gets awkward and intense, which is definitely not the best second-date vibe. Jane ends up grabbing Sutton and Kat and heading back to the Bronze Bomber to meet up with Pinstripe. Again, she nails it on the gossip hunt and discovers the NY14 reporter who interviewed her not too long ago is cheating on his wife. When Pinstripe informs her that his wife is six months pregnant, which makes the story even more scandalous, Jane wants to call it quits. They\u2019d be destroying lives and there are just some lines she isn\u2019t willing to cross, even if Ryan is. It seems like the triangle is officially blown to bits.\n\nJane runs back into the arms of Dr. Ben. She comes clean about why she got so angry about his faith \u2014 it all has to do with her mom. Her mom was religious, and even more so after her cancer diagnosis. Her mom prayed. Jane prayed. But her mom still died. So, yeah, she has a tough time buying into the healing powers of faith. Katie Stevens rips out your heart in this scene, it is so good. Dr. Ben is just as empathetic as you\u2019d imagine, and their relationship gets back on track. Little Jane and Dr. Ben 4Eva!\n\nKat is also navigating some troubling romantic waters in this episode. She and Adena finally end up hanging with some of Adena\u2019s friends \u2014 even though Adena is a little reluctant to hop into that whole \u201cNew York art-world lesbian\u201d scene. When Kat realizes that many of the ladies at the bar they\u2019re hanging at are Adena\u2019s exes, both curiosity and jealousy get the better of Kat. She wants to know Adena\u2019s number: exactly how many women has she slept with? When Adena tries to change the subject and answers by saying \u201cthe past is in the past,\u201d it only agitates Kat more.\n\nShe needs a meeting with her girls. The three best friends that anybody could have chat about their own numbers (Jane\u2019s is 4, Sutton\u2019s is 28), and how they define sex, and it is all very nonjudgmental and frank and funny \u2014 basically, it is exactly why this show resonates with so many people. Still, it most definitely does not quash Kat\u2019s fears. She\u2019s not worried about Adena\u2019s actual number of partners, she\u2019s more worried about the number of serious relationships she\u2019s been in. Remember: Adena was dating someone else when she and Kat got together. Kat\u2019s worried it could be a pattern.\n\nFinally, after one more jealous outburst in a club, Kat and Adena Talk About It. Kat hates that Adena is playing dumb about this conversation because it makes Kat feel like a crazy person for wanting to know some basic information about her girlfriend\u2019s dating history. Adena comes clean: She\u2019s avoiding the conversation in an attempt to protect herself and this relationship. She\u2019s living in a country that doesn\u2019t want her here in order to be with Kat. She\u2019s scared all the time and she doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize the relationship and she doesn\u2019t want to scare Kat off admitting that things are so complicated. One thing that is most definitely not complicated, is that both Kat and Adena love each other. They finally say those three little words out loud.\n\nAw, I love when the romantic stuff ends on a happy note.\n\nFrom the Back Page\n\n\u2022 Sutton wants to impress \u201cinfluencer\u201d Brooke Langley, who is being profiled in Scarlet, as a means to move up in the fashion world. The ladies end up at the Bronze Bomber and really hit it off \u2014 until Brooke puts $500 dollars worth of cocaine (labeled \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d) on Sutton\u2019s company credit card and assures her it\u2019s totally cool and normal. Sutton has reservations, but can\u2019t pass up the invite to an elite fashion-world dinner party. The girl is trying to make some career moves \u2014 she\u2019ll be expensing that coke.\n\n\u2022 You guys, Oliver makes my heart go pitter-patter. Last week he was voicing his disgust over an ignorant designer, this week he admits to wishing \u201cinfluencers\u201d were not a thing. Sutton may worship at Brooke\u2019s fashionable feet, but Oliver does not. He\u2019s wonderful!\n\n\u2022 Oh, also: his dog\u2019s name is Nacho. That is all.\n\n\u2022 SUTTON\u2019S GREEN VELVET BLAZER.\n\n\u2022 \u201cDaddy needs his beauty rest.\u201d \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever call yourself daddy again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 I love that Adena is sitting at home watching Friends on her computer. Fictional characters \u2014 they\u2019re just like us!\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy 28 is a strict interpretation because once you get into oral and hand stuff \u2014 I\u2019m gonna need a bigger boat.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/302/608/acdd88ffe4111d72ed301cb2e90b250414-26-the-bold-type.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/06/26/recaps/26-the-bold-type.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/302/608/acdd88ffe4111d72ed301cb2e90b250414-26-the-bold-type.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maggie Fremont"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/the-bold-type-recap-season-2-episode-4.html", "title": "The Bold Type Recap: A Good Triangle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Bold Type Recap: A Good Triangle", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/the-bold-type-recap-season-2-episode-4.html", "description": "Jane\u2019s latest prospect might be too good to be true.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/302/608/acdd88ffe4111d72ed301cb2e90b250414-26-the-bold-type.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Bold Type Recap: A Good Triangle", "description": "Jane\u2019s latest prospect might be too good to be true.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/302/608/acdd88ffe4111d72ed301cb2e90b250414-26-the-bold-type.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-27T01:01:00.118Z", "tag": "tv, tv recaps, overnights, recaps, the bold type, the bold type season 2, freeform", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Jane\u2019s latest prospect might be too good to be true.
