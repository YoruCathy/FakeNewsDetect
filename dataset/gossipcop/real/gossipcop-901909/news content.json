We all wear matching pajamas and do presents,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then we spend that evening at my parents\u2019. And actually in the last two years, my in-laws have joined as well, and we have all of our family together Christmas night, and we have a big dinner and do a gift exchange. It\u2019s fun!\u201d\n\nThe family of three will be spending the holidays in Southern California.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate \u2014 both of our families live right next to us, so we don\u2019t need to travel over the holidays. So that helps us relax a bit,\u201d Conrad shared. \u201cSo we\u2019ll just be doing lots of family time and lots of celebrating.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Lauren Conrad\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Lauren Conrad Takes Her \u2018Little Lamb\u2019 Liam To His First Pumpkin Patch\n\nConrad also explained that she\u2019s excited about dressing \u201ctiny\u201d Liam in adorable Christmas-themed apparel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the cute outfits. I\u2019ve had so much fun buying him tiny Christmas sweaters and pajamas,\u201d she said.\n\nLiam James is \u201cchanging every day,\u201d Conrad added, and his little personality is beginning to shine through. Plus, he appears to be taking after one of his grandpas.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still pretty tiny. We always keep saying that he\u2019s a tiny version of my dad,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cHe kind of looks like him and he has a lot of energy. My dad has more energy than anyone I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very loved child!\u201d she continued.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1314&h=688&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Flauren-conrad1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Flauren-conrad-3-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1314&h=688&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F12%2Flauren-conrad1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/lauren-conrad-liam-james-tell-first-christmas-card/", "title": "See Lauren Conrad's Adorable Christmas Card \u2014 Starring Her 5-Month-Old Son Liam James!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Babies,Christmas,Holiday Entertaining,Lauren Conrad,News,TV", "news_keywords": "Babies,Christmas,Holiday Entertaining,Lauren Conrad,News,TV", "description": "Liam James Tell\u00a0is front and center in mom\u00a0Lauren Conrad\u00a0and dad William Tell's 2017 holiday card", "og": {"title": "See Lauren Conrad's Adorable Christmas Card \u2014 Starring Her 5-Month-Old Son Liam James!", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/parents/lauren-conrad-liam-james-tell-first-christmas-card/", "description": "Liam James Tell&nbsp;is front and center in mom&nbsp;Lauren Conrad&nbsp;and dad William Tell\u2019s 2017 holiday card!
