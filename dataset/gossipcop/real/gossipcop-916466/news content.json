In a candid new interview alongside her A Wrinkle in Time co-stars Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey revealed she doesn\u2019t pump her own gas.\n\n\u201cI gotta just say, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she shared with E! News. Reese, who pumps her own gas, may we add, quipped back, \u201cYou would, it would come back to you!\u201d\n\nOprah replied, \u201cI actually took someone to the airport recently and I was like make sure you have your ticket and they were like \u2018What?\u2019 and I said, \u2018They don\u2019t have tickets anymore!'\u201d\n\nBut even though Oprah doesn\u2019t pump her own gas or answer her own phone, she does pay her own bills and get her own coffee. In fact, she recently had a super funny experience at Starbucks. \u201cCan you imagine writing \u2018Oprah\u2019 on a coffee cup?\u201d Mindy asked. Funnily enough, Oprah has seen it done before! \u201cI just went two days ago and the woman said \u2018Name?\u2019 and I said \u2018Oprah\u2019 and she said \u2018How do you spell that?'\u201d Oprah shared.\n\nOprah is one of the most famous and successful women in the world and many think her current lifestyle makes her fit to be President of the US someday. However, she recently confirmed she\u2019d never run for office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt very secure and confident with myself in knowing what I could do and what I could not. And so it\u2019s not something that interests me. I don\u2019t have the DNA for it,\u201d she told InStyle. She then told host Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, \u201cI am definitely not running for President. I am the kind of person who tries to listen to signs. I think, \u2018Well am I supposed to run the country?\u2019 I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Well, we think so!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oprah-winfrey-pumping-gas.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/art-carney-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/john-tesh-wife-connie-sellecca03.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_1221376cw.jpg?crop=0px%2C274px%2C2336px%2C1323px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/CL2319_cover_cn2_View-1.jpg?w=300", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oprah-winfrey-pumping-gas.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_10543684k.jpg?crop=518px%2C193px%2C2424px%2C2424px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/richard-boone-have-gun-will-travel-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C964px%2C546px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_9241936v.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C5347px%2C3028px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Valerie-Bertinelli-Feature.jpg?crop=160px%2C93px%2C1887px%2C1068px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/martin-lawrence-kids.jpg?crop=741px%2C0px%2C2204px%2C2204px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/sunny-hostin-abby-huntsman-the-view.jpg?crop=51px%2C67px%2C3168px%2C1795px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oprah-winfrey-reese-witherspoon.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/shutterstock_editorial_9728195bk.jpg?crop=0px%2C141px%2C4000px%2C2265px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-Harry-bothered-by-Prince-William-title.jpg?crop=452px%2C0px%2C3583px%2C3582px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/oprah-winfrey-happiness.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Amber-Laign-and-Robin-Roberts.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/new-cut.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Prince-William-gets-new-title.jpg?crop=476px%2C0px%2C2875px%2C2875px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lucy-podcast-main.jpg?resize=120%2C68"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oprah-winfrey-pumping-gas.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/oprah-winfrey-pump-gas-154800/", "title": "Oprah Winfrey Doesn't Know How to Pump Her Own Gas!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "She belongs in New Jersey!
