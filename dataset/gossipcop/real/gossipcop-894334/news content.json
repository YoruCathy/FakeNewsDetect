For the first time ever, the two stars will take the stage together to open the awards show. Both women will also have their own solo spotlight performances during the event, with Pink playing the title track from her Beautiful Trauma album and Clarkson taking on a song from her Meaning of Life release and a surprise fan favorite.\n\nEarlier this month, Clarkson expressed wanting to collaborate with Pink at some point in a conversation with EW editor-in-chief Henry Goldblatt at one of the magazine's A-List events. \"I\u2019m a huge fan of Pink,\" Clarkson said, \"I haven\u2019t had the chance yet to work with her. I think if you project it enough, it might happen, right?\u201d Looks like she was right.\n\nClarkson went on to gush over Pink's latest album Beautiful Trauma, \"I love her because she has done the whole singer-songwriter record she recently did, she does pop, she loves rock.\" Clarkson also added that she loves Pink's unapologetic nature, that, \u201cShe is who she is, and that\u2019s cool if you like her, and it\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t. I relate to that, so I think that\u2019s why I like her a lot.\u201d\n\nIt had been previously announced that both performers would appear on the AMAs as performers, but until now it was not known that the two would collaborate for the first time. Among the other incredible performances promised by the AMAs are a rare appearance from Diana Ross, Christina Aguilera's Bodyguard tribute, BTS' AMAs debut, and many more.\n\nVote for the AMAs on Billboard.com.\n\nThe 2017 American Music Awards will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, Nov. 19 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?4863e69cb9d656c61185", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/amas-2-recirc-2017.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/amas/8039118/amas-2017-kelly-clarkson-pink-performance-opener", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-11-16T16:52:02-05:00", "published_time": "2017-11-16T09:58:07-05:00"}, "description": "Kelly Clarkson and Pink will perform together for the first time at the 2017 AMAs.", "og": {"description": "Kelly Clarkson and Pink will perform together for the first time at the 2017 AMAs.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "AMAs 2017: Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Perform Opening Number Together Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/events/amas/8039118/amas-2017-kelly-clarkson-pink-performance-opener", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kelly Clarkson and Pink will perform together for the first time at the 2017 AMAs.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510844287.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
