The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out today for a holiday party, which she's hosting for military families with Prince William at Kensington Palace, wearing the perfect plaid skirt for the occasion.\n\nThe pleated midi piece is by Emilia Wickstead, and boasts a bright red, green, and white tartan. For her top, Kate opted for a cardigan by Brora, but cleverly buttoned it up and wore it like a blouse. (The cardigan-as-a-shirt look is a BAZAAR-approved trend for the winter.)\n\nSamir Hussein Getty Images\n\nStuart C.

Prince William was seen making truffles with some of the young attendees, while Kate was seen chatting with some of the children and moms.\n\nKate chats to children and mums pic.twitter.com/V9UIaWEZ7O \u2014 Richard Palmer (@RoyalReporter) December 4, 2018\n\nTomorrow, the couple \"will fly to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus to meet with Serving personnel, families living on the base, wider station personnel and members of the local community,\" Kensington Palace previously announced.\n\nThese won't be Kate and William's only holiday plans this year, of course. They'll be spending Christmas Eve and Christmas Day with the royal family at the Queen's Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, a palace source told BAZAAR.com. In the days following, they're expected to spend time with Kate's family in Berkshire.\n\n\n\nThe Cambridges actually celebrated Christmas with the Middletons in 2016, as they were seen attending church service with the Duchess' family instead of the royals. This year, the'll make time for both sides of the family for the holiday. It'll also be their first Christmas with William and Kate's youngest son, Prince Louis, who was born in April.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-and-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1077182198-1543931468.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.735xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-and-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1077182198-1543931468.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.735xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erica Gonzales"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25392847/kate-middleton-emilia-wickstead-plaid-skirt-christmas-party/", "title": "Kate Middleton Wears an Emilia Wickstead Plaid Skirt at the RAF Christmas Party", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#606060", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Kate Middleton Attends a Christmas Party in the Perfect Plaid Skirt", "description": "She and Prince William are hosting military families at Kensington Palace today.", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25392847/kate-middleton-emilia-wickstead-plaid-skirt-christmas-party/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-and-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1077182198-1543931468.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.735xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "modified_time": "2018-12-04 03:33:45", "published_time": "2018-12-04 02:04:00", "section": "Celebrity News", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-and-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1077182198-1543931468.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.735xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "title": "Kate Middleton Wears an Emilia Wickstead Plaid Skirt at the RAF Christmas Party", "description": "As you start to brainstorm for what to wear for your Christmas celebrations, look no further than Kate Middleton for inspiration.
