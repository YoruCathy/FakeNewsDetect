The former America\u2019s Got Talent host jetted off to Aspen on Sunday, December 23, to join his ex-wife Mariah Carey and their twins Moroccan and Monroe.\n\nCannon, 38, took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo Monroe took when he was dozing by a Christmas tree. \u201cWhen your daughter catches the rare occasion of you sleeping!\u201d the rapper captioned his picture. \u201cDaddy, I thought you don\u2019t ever sleep?\u2019 #MissMonroe.\u201d\n\nThat same night, Carey posted a snap of herself cozying up under a blanket with Moroccan.\n\nCannon and the five-time Grammy winner ended their six-year marriage in 2014, but remain close friends and coparents. (They always celebrate birthdays together!)\n\n\u201cThe common denominator is we both want what\u2019s best for our children,\u201d the Drumline actor told Us Weekly in February. \u201cYou put them first and you step back and become selfless in making decisions and it\u2019s pretty easy.\u201d\n\nCannon added that as far as he is concerned, Carey can \u201cdo no wrong.\u201d\n\nJust like their famous parents, Moroccan and Monroe were born to perform. \u201cThey\u2019re definitely entertainers,\u201d Cannon told Us in July. \u201cThey\u2019re hams!\u201d But Moroccan might have a future career in tech: the comedian quipped that little boy tapped into his email and changed all the settings.\n\n\u201cI know none of the passwords,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAll of my emails say it\u2019s coming from Moroccan and Monroe.\u201d\n\nCarey described Moroccan as a \u201ctechnological genius\u201d when she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in June and revealed that he ordered a dog online without her knowing.\n\nCannon is also dad of 22-month-old son Golden \u201cSagon\u201d with model Brittany Bell.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts-02.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts.jpg?crop=20px%2C0px%2C1805px%2C1020px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1754px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1754px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mariah-carey-and-nick-cannon-celebrate-christmas-2018-together/", "title": "Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon Celebrate Christmas 2018 Together", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon are spending Christmas in Aspen, Colorado, with their twins Moroccan and Monroe \u2014 find out more", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon Spending Christmas Together With Their Twins: Pics", "description": "Exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon are spending Christmas in Aspen, Colorado, with their twins Moroccan and Monroe \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mariah-carey-and-nick-cannon-celebrate-christmas-2018-together/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-11-07T22:06:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1754px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1754px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Holidays With Us", "section": "Celebrity Moms", "published_time": "2018-12-24T16:07:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-11-07T22:06:16+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon are spending Christmas in Aspen, Colorado, with their twins Moroccan and Monroe \u2014 find out more", "title": "Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon Spending Christmas Together With Their Twins: Pics", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i1.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nick-Cannon-Mariah-Carey-Kids-Christmas-Gifts.jpg?crop=59px%2C0px%2C1754px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@rachelpaula"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545667637.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
