I did provide a copy of the manuscript about a week before, I think it was,\u201d Presiding Bishop Michael Curry told Robin Roberts on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America Tuesday. \u201cI only deviated slightly. You can\u2019t get a preacher \u2014 you\u2019re going to deviate a little bit.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThey were aware of the basic outline and what was in it.\u201d\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex selected Curry, the first African American presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, to deliver the sermon at their May 19 wedding at St. George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor Castle. They chose Curry after consulting with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the dean of St. George\u2019s Chapel, Curry told Good Morning America. When he got the phone call from the Archbishop\u2019s Lambeth Palace informing him of their decision, he couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Get out of here. It\u2019s April Fools. You gotta be kidding,'\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was actually true.\u201d\n\nA month later, when he was finally able to tell his wife the news, she had the same, stunned reaction, he said.\n\nBorn in Chicago, Curry said he has had a \u201cremarkable and very surprising\u201d last few days after his sermon on the power of love enchanted the world. He took a selfie with the crew on his American Airlines flight back to the U.S., he said, and Keenan Thompson on Saturday Night Live did an impression of him on the show\u2019s \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment that night.\n\n\u201cIt was a great likeness,\u201d Curry said of the S.N.L. impression. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they actually pulled it off just in a matter of hours.\u201d\n\nHe told Roberts that the clear love between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle inspired his sermon \u2014 and notably brought together a diverse group of people for the ceremony.\n\n\u201cThe love between those two people, between that royal couple, was so powerful, not only did we all show up, but it brought all these different worlds together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt brought different nationalities, different ethnicities, different religious traditions, people of all stripes and types, people of different political persuasions, actually for a moment we were together, organized around love.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.
