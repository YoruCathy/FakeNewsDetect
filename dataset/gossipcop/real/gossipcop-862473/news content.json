The images show the difference between what she calls \"real\" and \"produced\" photos.\n\n\"The difference between the two is lighting, pose and clothes adjustments,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nIn the post, the \"produced\" photo is shot in much better, vibrant light \u2014 which creates the illusion that she has a healthy glow, and even amps up her muscle definition. The photo is also taken from above, rather than straight on, which creates a more flattering selfie.\n\nThe NASCAR driver is a strong advocate of healthy living and showing off her \"real\" body \u2014 and she just happens to have rock-solid abs.\n\nPatrick ended her inspirational post with a powerful message to her followers: \"We all want to look our best at all times, no shame in that. But don't let someone else's body put yours down. Use it for motivation. Keep digging friends to be the best you! You own that! We all know when we are treating our bodies with the respect it deserves. It's the one and only thing we own for life.\"", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/1223448/danica-patrick-fit-today-tease-170621_d332295b18967378ce64a42e95678f8c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201704/x_tdy_style_raisman_170420.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/1223448/danica-patrick-fit-today-tease-170621_d332295b18967378ce64a42e95678f8c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/danica-patrick-s-real-vs-produced-ab-photos-promote-body-t113000", "title": "Danica Patrick's 'real vs produced' ab photos promote body positivity", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/style/danica-patrick-s-real-vs-produced-ab-photos-promote-body-t113000", "title": "Danica Patrick shows \u2018real vs produced\u2019 photos of abs to prove a point", "description": "NASCAR driver Danica Patrick shared side-by-side photos of her wearing the same outfit on the same day \u2014 shot in two different ways.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/1223448/danica-patrick-fit-today-tease-170621_d332295b18967378ce64a42e95678f8c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/1223448/danica-patrick-fit-today-tease-170621_d332295b18967378ce64a42e95678f8c.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/1223448/danica-patrick-fit-today-tease-170621_d332295b18967378ce64a42e95678f8c.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "Danica Patrick shows \u2018real vs produced\u2019 photos of abs to prove a point", "description": "NASCAR driver Danica Patrick shared side-by-side photos of her wearing the same outfit on the same day \u2014 shot in two different ways.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "NASCAR driver Danica Patrick shared side-by-side photos of her wearing the same outfit on the same day \u2014 shot in two different ways.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_25/1223448/danica-patrick-fit-today-tease-170621_d332295b18967378ce64a42e95678f8c.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498080180.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
