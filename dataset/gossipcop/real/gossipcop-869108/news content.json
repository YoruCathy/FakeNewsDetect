This morning, the streaming service released the first, brief teaser for \"Disenchantment,\" which is about a princess (voiced by \"Broad City\" costar Abbi Jacobson), a demon (Eric Andre), a dwarf (Nat Faxon) and their adventures in a realm called \"Dreamland.\"\n\nThe brief \"Disenchantment\" teaser features an old-fashioned announcer trumpeting the fact that since Groening showed us the future in the animated series \"Futurama\" and the present in \"The Simpsons,\" the logical next step is the past, as we see a fairy tale-style castle.\n\nThe teaser doesn't give away much of what's coming up. We'll have to wait for Aug. 17, when \"Disenchantment\" streams on Netflix, to find out more.\n\nIn the meantime, Groening -- who named several characters from \"The Simpsons\" after members of his own famly, and streets in Portland -- can bask in that Fox series' stunning success.\n\nIn April, \"The Simpsons\" broke the record for most episodes produced for a primetime scripted TV show. The previous holder of the record was the classic Western drama, \"Gunsmoke.\"\n\nIn recognition of setting the new record, \"The Simpsons\" in April aired a special opening parody of \"Gunsmoke,\" featuring Maggie Simpson vs. Marshal Matt Dillon (James Arness played the lawman in the series).\n\nSince its debut in December 1989, \"The Simpsons\" has also gone on to become TV's longest-running animated series.\n\n-- Kristi Turnquist\n\n\n\nkturnquist@oregonian.com\n\n503-221-8227\n\n@Kristiturnquist", "images":
