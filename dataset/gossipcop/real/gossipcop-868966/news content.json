We're a bit too emotionally unstable right now to deal with confusing jokes of this magnitude okay?\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n'The special effects get better,' he joked to E! at Comic-Con on Saturday. 'I'm about 400 pounds\u2014you just can't tell.'\n\nThe world is already testing our patience enough right now, what with the state of international politics and the bee population being in decline and we're not sure we can deal with any more confusion to be honest Chris.\n\nFortunately, the Australian actor got serious and admitted his superhero body, and those of his Thor: Ragnarok castmates Idris Elba and Mark Ruffalo, actually all came as a result of working hard and cheering each other on in the gym.\n\n'We had a nice gym on set, which we'd all inhabit quite often and get in and motivate each other.\n\n'It's all a very supportive, loving cast on set,' he complimented his co-stars.\n\nOkay, panic over.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/1600x800/landscape-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/28/1600x800/landscape-1499696778-liam-hemsworth.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/29/1600x800/1500451963-hbz-charlize-theron-red-carpet-index-1500411463.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/1600x800/landscape-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a37271/chris-hemsworth-jokes-special-effects-muscles/", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Jokes Special Effects Are To Thank For His Rippling Muscles And It\u2019s Not Funny", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Jokes That His Whole Body Is Actually A Giant Special Effect", "description": "Why would you joke about such serious things, Chris?", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a37271/chris-hemsworth-jokes-special-effects-muscles/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/1600x800/landscape-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-06-25 04:19:38", "published_time": "2017-07-25 11:51:06", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/1600x800/landscape-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Jokes Special Effects Are To Thank For His Rippling Muscles And It\u2019s Not Funny", "description": "The Australian actor revealed the secret to his toned physique and the news almost broke our hearts.", "keywords": "chris hemsworth, thor, actor, workout, health, fitness, elsa pataky, wife, body", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/980x980/square-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-25T11:51:06Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/1600x800/landscape-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/30/980x980/square-1500978330-chris-hemsworth.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Chris Hemsworth Jokes That His Whole Body Is Actually A Giant Special Effect", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500954666.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
