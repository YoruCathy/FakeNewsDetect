Even Gadot made it.\n\nThe \u201cWonder Woman\u201d star played \u201cBox of Lies\u201d \u2014 a \u201cTonight Show\u201d game where Fallon and a guest attempted to stump each other on the contents of a mystery box. Most of the items, however, are hard to describe even truthfully.\n\nAlso Read: 'Wonder Woman' First Reactions: 'the Best DCEU Film to Date'\n\nGadot won the game, but granted, some of the items made trying to confuse Fallon really easy. One item was a fake foot dressed up like a skiing mountain, complete with little skiiers. It\u2019s an item so bizarre that not even Gadot had any idea what to do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know how to describe this,\u201d she laughed.\n\nShe eventually won the game (thanks to the aforementioned foot) and received the best prize as writer Seth Herzog came out and did an interpretive dance to the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d theme song \u2014 complete with Wonder Woman regalia.\n\nAlso Read: 'Wonder Woman': Director Patty Jenkins Says 'Superman,' 'Casablanca' Inspired Blockbuster\n\nIt was a dance so spellbinding that at one point Fallon tried to cover Gadot\u2019s eyes. The actress had a very eventful night in the lead-up to the release of \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d the latest DCEU film set to hit theaters on June 2.\n\nWatch the full video above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-icon.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-wrappro-white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/laura-bush-michelle-obama-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DC-Films-Superhero-Movies.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/try-pro-free.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Issue-4_DTTW_Portfolio_COVER-1.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/white-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/wonder-woman-trailer-new-things-we-learned-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/browse.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NUP_189951_0317-2.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/wrap-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/bill-cosby-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/memberships/user_icon_white.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Wonder-Woman-Banner-160x105.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gal-gadot-jimmy-fallon.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-52741361-160x105.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8498827&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8flXM--ZHulLQ.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Wonder-Woman-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wonder-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/get-more.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Dwayne-Johnson-160x105.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/email-icon.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Cannes-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/first-take.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/riot.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gal-gadot-jimmy-fallon.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carli Velocci", "Beatrice Verhoeven", "Ross A.
