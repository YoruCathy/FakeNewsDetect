It included an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her, which left her mortified.\n\nOn another day, he summoned a different female employee to his office, and then dropped his pants, showing her his penis. After the employee declined to do anything, visibly shaken, he reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act.\n\nHe would sometimes quiz female producers about who they\u2019d slept with, offering to trade names. And he loved to play a crass game with men and women in the office: \u201cf\u2014, marry, or kill,\u201d in which he would identify the female co-hosts that he\u2019d most like to sleep with.\n\nThese accounts of Lauer\u2019s behavior at NBC are the result of a two-month investigation by Variety, with dozens of interviews with current and former staffers. Variety has talked to three women who identified themselves as victims of sexual harassment by Lauer, and their stories have been corroborated by friends or colleagues that they told at the time. They have asked for now to remain unnamed, fearing professional repercussions.\n\nOn Wednesday, NBC announced that Lauer was fired from \u201cToday.\u201d It was a stunning move for a co-host who was widely considered the crown jewel of the network\u2019s news division, with a $25 million annual salary. The cause of his dismissal, according to sources, was a detailed complaint from another current NBC employee about inappropriate sexual conduct from Lauer that started on a trip at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and continued for several months.\n\nThe employee met with human resources at NBC on Monday night. In a statement, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack called this the first complaint about Lauer\u2019s behavior in more than 20 years and acknowledged that it may not be the last: \u201cWe were also presented with reason to believe that this may not have been an isolated incident,\u201d Lack said.\n\nSeveral women told Variety they complained to executives at the network about Lauer\u2019s behavior, which fell on deaf ears given the lucrative advertising surrounding \u201cToday.\u201d NBC declined to comment. For most of Lauer\u2019s tenure at \u201cToday,\u201d the morning news show was No. 1 in the ratings, and executives were eager to keep him happy.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if NBC is paying Lauer through the end of his contract, which expires in 2018. Lauer couldn\u2019t be reached for comment.\n\nInsiders say that NBC was forced to act quickly after this week\u2019s complaint, given the severity of the accusations and the national dialogue around sexual harassment that has ended the careers of Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K. and other prominent men. Now, against a series of questions about the future of \u201cToday,\u201d a troubling portrait has emerged of Lauer. In front of the camera, for more than two decades, Lauer had positioned himself as America\u2019s squeaky-clean dad. But behind the scenes, Lauer was a different person.\n\nDespite being married, Lauer was fixated on women, especially their bodies and looks, according to more than 10 accounts from current and former employees. He was known for making lewd comments verbally or over text messages. He once made a suggestive reference to a colleague\u2019s performance in bed and compared it to how she was able to complete her job, according to witnesses to the exchange. For Lauer, work and sex were intertwined.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of consensual relationships, but that\u2019s still a problem because of the power he held,\u201d says a former producer who knew first-hand of these encounters. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he\u2019s Matt Lauer and he\u2019s married. So he\u2019d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn\u2019t ever complain.\u201d\n\nLauer, who was paranoid about being followed by tabloid reporters, grew more emboldened at 30 Rockefeller Center as his profile rose following Katie Couric\u2019s departure from \u201cToday\u201d in 2006. His office was in a secluded space, and he had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door from the inside without getting up. This afforded him the assurance of privacy. It allowed him to welcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him, according to two women who were sexually harassed by Lauer.\n\nAccording to sources, the sexual harassment extended to when Lauer traveled on assignment for NBC. Several employees recall how he paid intense attention to a young woman on his staff that he found attractive, focusing intently on her career ambitions. And he asked the same producer to his hotel room to deliver him a pillow, according to sources with knowledge of the interaction.\n\nThis was part of a pattern. According to multiple accounts, independently corroborated by Variety, Lauer would invite women employed by NBC late at night to his hotel room while covering the Olympics in various cities over the years. He later told colleagues how his wife had accompanied him to the London Olympics because she didn\u2019t trust him to travel alone.\n\nThe spotlight on Lauer intensified earlier this month, when his longtime booker Matt Zimmerman was fired over sexual harassment complaints. The two were very close, and Lauer had promoted Zimmerman to a high executive position and offered him a powerful perch.\n\nLauer\u2019s conduct was not a secret among other employees at \u201cToday,\u201d numerous sources say. At least one of the anchors would gossip about stories she had heard, spreading them among the staff. \u201cManagement sucks there,\u201d says a former reporter, who asked not to be identified, speaking about executives who previously worked at the show. \u201cThey protected the s\u2014 out of Matt Lauer.\u201d\n\nSome producers told Variety they were conflicted about what to do around Lauer. They worried that their careers would be sidelined if they didn\u2019t return his advances. \u201cThere is such shame with Matt Lauer not liking you,\u201d the former employee added. \u201cI did this special with him and we are traveling and I had a cold sore on my lip and I heard him say to Bryant Gumbel, \u2018She has this really ugly cold sore on her lip,\u2019 like that was something to be ashamed of. He was just really cruel.\u201d\n\nAccording to producers, Lauer \u2014 who had considerable editorial clout over which stories would ultimately air on \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 would frequently dismiss stories about cheating husbands. However, in the wake of Roger Ailes and Harvey Weinstein, Lauer had to keep up with a conversation about sexual harassment. It often made for awkward moments on TV for staff members who knew about Lauer\u2019s private interactions.\n\nIn September, Lauer asked the former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly if he\u2019d ever sent lewd text messages to colleagues. \u201cThink about those \u2026 women and what they did,\u201d Lauer said. \u201cThey came forward and filed complaints against the biggest star at the network they worked at. Think of how intimidating that must have been. Doesn\u2019t that tell you how strongly they felt about the way they were treated about you?\u201d", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/matt-lauer-4.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2017%2Fbiz%2Fnews%2Fmatt-lauer-accused-sexual-harassment-multiple-women-1202625959%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202625959&comment_count=1074", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/matt-lauer-4.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ramin Setoodeh Elizabeth Wagmeister", "Ramin Setoodeh", "Elizabeth Wagmeister"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/matt-lauer-accused-sexual-harassment-multiple-women-1202625959/", "title": "Matt Lauer Accused of Sexual Harassment by Multiple Women (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Accounts of Matt Lauer\u2019s inappropriate behavior at NBC are the result of a two-month investigation by Variety, with dozens of interviews.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202625959, "author": "Ramin Setoodeh,Elizabeth Wagmeister", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-11-29T12:34:31"}, "pmc-tag": "Matt Lauer,sensitive,The Today Show", "title": "Matt Lauer Accused of Sexual Harassment by Multiple Women (EXCLUSIVE)", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "biz,tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "biz", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Matt Lauer Accused of Sexual Harassment by Multiple Women (EXCLUSIVE)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/matt-lauer-accused-sexual-harassment-multiple-women-1202625959/", "description": "As the co-host of NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d Matt Lauer once gave a colleague a sex toy as a present.
