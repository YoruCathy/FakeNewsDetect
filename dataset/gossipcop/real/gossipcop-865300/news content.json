As CI readers know, on Wednesday, Rob went on a rant attacking his ex, Blac Chyna, where he accused her of cheating on him.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashian\u2019s star continued to release \u201crevenge porn\u201d type photos and videos to embarrass the woman.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Rob went on to accuse her of being a \u201ccrazy person,\u201d \u201cdisrespectful,\u201d and claimed she spent tens of thousands of dollars on cosmetic alterations.\n\nAccording to the reality star, he spent over $100,000 on plastic surgery for his baby momma.\n\nThe Kardashian brother threatened Chyna, saying that she won\u2019t be able to see their daughter ever again unless she stops drinking alcohol and consuming narcotics like \u201ccocaine, X, and E.\u201d\n\nAnd what did Chyna have to say about all of this?\n\nShe responded with some drama of her own, alleging that Kardashian beat her.\n\nHowever, she has since deleted the Snap where she made the initial accusation.\n\nA source revealed today \u201cthe entire family was very disappointed in Rob\u2019s actions yesterday. All of the sisters are trying not to react publicly, and are working to brush it under the rug.\u201d\n\nThe insider added that Kris Jenner is the one who is the most upset.\n\n\u201cShe is very distraught,\u201d the insider revealed, and \u201cKourtney Kardashian is in her own little world with Younes Bendjima, and Khloe is busy with her boyfriend Tristan Thompson. They don\u2019t have time for Rob\u2019s drama, but they do want what is best for Rob\u2019s child, Dream. They are afraid Rob\u2019s outburst will affect Blac and Rob\u2019s baby.\u201d\n\nThe Kardashian family knows what he did was wildly inappropriate, but they still stand by him, because after all, he is family.\n\nThings might be getting worse for Rob, considering Blac\u2019s attorney Walter Mosley said to E! News that they might take legal action against the reality star for releasing \u201crevenge porn.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs CI readers know, Mischa Barton is currently battling her own case regarding the leaking of inappropriate \u201cprivate\u201d footage of her in the bedroom. Times are changing, and a person can\u2019t release private images to harass another individual anymore without legal repercussions. What do our readers think of this fiasco? Is Rob out of line or does Chyna deserve it? Perhaps, it\u2019s both?", "images": ["https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Fantasia-Barrino-Kendall-Taylor-Zion-300x200.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/The-Weeknd--300x200.jpg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Kesha-Instagram-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ScreenShot2018-02-22at2.44.51PM-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Emily-Ratajkowski-Bathing-Suit-300x215.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Katie-Holmes-BlogSpot.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/331148d775fa54d2c477a43cdefe0f5e?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ammika-Harris-Chris-Brown-Baby-Aeko-Germany-300x198.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Tiny-Harris8217-Daughter-Heiress-Says-A-Swear-Word-As-They-Sing-Together-In-Adorable-Vid-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Monica-Promotes-Show-After-Instagram-Hiatus-300x217.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Robert-De-Niro-CelebWiki.org_-300x225.jpeg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blac-Chyna-1-700x466.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rob-and-Blac-Chyna.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Jana-Kramer-TritonDigitalCMS.com_-300x225.jpg", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png"], "top_img": "https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Rob-and-Blac-Chyna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "William Bohn", "Kathy Bailey Vaughn"], "canonical_link": "https://celebrityinsider.org/rob-kardashians-family-is-very-disappointed-in-him-after-his-wild-social-media-rant-regarding-blac-chyna-49180/", "title": "Rob Kardashian\u2019s Family Is \u201cVery Disappointed\u201d In Him After His Wild Social Media Rant Regarding Blac Chyna", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "blac chyna, kuwk, rob kardashian, t.i., tiny harris,", "keywords": "celebrity news, blac chyna, kuwk, rob kardashian, t.i., tiny harris,", "description": "The Kardashian family isn't pleased with Rob's Instagram and Twitter drama-meltdown.
