Ever since her Hunger Games days she's been known to deliver an A-plus soundbite (or seven) during them. And her recent chat with Ellen DeGeneres was no exception. The Red Sparrow actress stopped by The Ellen Show on Friday (March 2) and wound up telling everyone about her drunk alter-ego named Gail.\n\n\"I can't go on a vacation right now, because I just can't deal with 'Gail' at the moment,\" she said. \"I need to rest before 'Gail.'\"\n\nSo who is \"Gail,\" exactly? Well, according to Lawrence, she comes out only during \"a very specific drunk\" period. \"It's not just every time I'm drunk, I turn into this 'Gail,'\" she said. \"I think she's some sort of like tortoise gambler, or something. I don't always turn into this masculine alter-ego that jumps into shark-ridden waters just to make my friends laugh.\" That's a true story, by the way: Lawrence\u2014or shall we say Gail?\u2014actually did jump into shark-infested waters while on vacation. \"My friends were like, 'That's too far, Jen, like no. Not funny.'\"\n\nLawrence suggested it's rum that really makes Gail come out, so of course DeGeneres gave her some to drink during their chat. \"I'm normally, like, pretty cautious,\" Lawrence said. \"And then I get some rum in me and I'm like, 'Let's arm wrestle!'\"\n\nDeGeneres then pulled up a picture of Gail, who was smiling at the camera in a very particular way Lawrence couldn't re-create sober. Incredible. \"I was trying to look cute,\" she said. \"I was, like, getting photographed with all my girlfriends on the beach. I wanted to look cute!\u2026 My whole face is just crooked\u2026. The hair, too, just so presidential.\"\n\nWatch Lawrence explain all this yourself, below.\n\nI now want to kick back with both Jennifer Lawrence and Gail at the same time. How can I make that happen?", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Wang", "Emily Wan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/jennifer-lawrence-drunk-alter-ego-gail", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence's Drunk Alter-Ego 'Gail' Is Both Terrifying and My New Best Friend", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Emily Wang", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "'Red Sparrow' actress Jennifer Lawrence went on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show Friday and introduced everyone to her drunk alter-ego named 'Gail.'", "id": "5a99818999ea9a2ba3431b34", "keywords": "celebrity gossip,snd,jennifer lawrence", "news_keywords": "celebrity gossip,snd,jennifer lawrence", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a99818999ea9a2ba3431b34", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"'Red Sparrow' actress Jennifer Lawrence went on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show Friday and introduced everyone to her drunk alter-ego named 'Gail.'\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Squad up.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence's Drunk Alter-Ego 'Gail' Is Both Terrifying and My New Best Friend", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/jennifer-lawrence-drunk-alter-ego-gail"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Squad up.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a998302fb204a1bd5840239/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-lawrences-drunk-alter-ego-gail-web-lead.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence's Drunk Alter-Ego 'Gail' Is Both Terrifying and My New Best Friend"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/mctn16hLzhg"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
