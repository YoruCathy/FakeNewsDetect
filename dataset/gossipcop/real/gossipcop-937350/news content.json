News Sunday at the Billboard Music Awards.\n\n\u201cSo Miles, of course, is the same name as the great Miles Davis,\u201d the 39-year-old Oscar and Grammy winner added. \u201cAnd Chrissy really liked the name Theodore, so we put it all together and got Miles Theodore Stephens. When he came out and we hung out with him for a little, we were like, \u2018He looks like a Miles.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Legend, 39, was out working the red carpet and performing at the ceremony, which saw Janet Jackson receive the icon award, Teigen, 32, was home cooking dinner and handling two kids.\n\nThe supermodel poked fun at Legend on Twitter, writing, \u201cWow didn\u2019t u just have a baby John smh go take care of it!!!!!! disgusting.\u201d\n\nTeigen hasn\u2019t shied away from the ups and downs of motherhood. On Sunday night, she posted a topless snapshot while holding little Miles.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t seen @AliWong\u2019s new Netflix special, you are bad at picking Netflix specials #AsianPearUnderwear,\u201d she captioned the image.\n\nShe previously said on Twitter things are better this time around.\n\n\u201cI can confirm postpartum life is 90% better when you don\u2019t rip to your butthole. Baby boy: 1 point. Luna: 0,\u201d she quipped.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/google_podcasts_badge402x-1-1.png?w=190&h=48", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/we_hear_sidebarimage_520x280_v2.jpg", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/stitcher-button402x-1.png?w=165&h=49", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-960635116.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/spotify-podcast-badge-wht-grn-330x80402x.png?w=205&h=50", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-960635116.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png?w=190&h=46"], "top_img": "https://nyppagesix.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-960635116.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/05/21/john-legend-explains-meaning-behind-sons-name/", "title": "John Legend explains meaning behind son\u2019s name", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2020 NYP Holdings.
