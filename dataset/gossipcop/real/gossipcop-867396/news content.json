You turned my life and world right side up.\"\n\nWarren penned a touching note for his little girl, explaining, \"Having you has taught me how to appreciate the here and now. I can't afford to wish for tomorrow because I know I'll miss today. You are kind, thoughtful and fair. You are smart, creative and driven. You're not afraid to lead but more importantly you're not afraid to listen. Keep it up my champ! You're doing great. I love you. I'm so proud of you.\"\n\nAlba has even been a parenting mentor for her friend and \"Sin City\" co-star Jaime King when the 38-year-old actress was expecting her first son, James, with husband Kyle Newman.\n\n\"Jess Alba was always on speed dial for me,\" King said of the Honest Company founder, who is also the godmother to James. \"I didn't know what I was doing when I had my first child and I had to go back to work so soon. I was terrified but I always call her\u2026 I think in the lifestyle we have, it's very different and it's not as easy to navigate, and she does it so elegantly and seamlessly and so I'm very lucky.\"\n\nCheck out the video below for more adorableness from Alba's happy family.", "images": ["https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/11/19/186936ea-2db7-4a48-b750-74f38f653dc6/thumbnail/640x360/80fb8996993802606d5c971761bf5b42/newsletter-breakingnews.jpg", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/18/0240896e-a28a-4921-a05e-e434c69a6c87/thumbnail/620x349/eeab3a411a50e607fd8b23cfd4f4e270/alba.jpg", "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/18/0240896e-a28a-4921-a05e-e434c69a6c87/thumbnail/1200x630/f70a4c9d6062fbf54cb9579d56c7b7e6/alba.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/18/0240896e-a28a-4921-a05e-e434c69a6c87/thumbnail/1200x630/f70a4c9d6062fbf54cb9579d56c7b7e6/alba.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "canonical_link": "http://www.etonline.com/news/221701_jessica_alba_is_pregnant_with_baby_no_3_see_the_cute_announcement/", "title": "Jessica Alba expecting baby No. 3 with husband Cash Warren", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Actress took to Instagram on Monday to share news that she and her husband, Cash Warren, will soon welcome new bundle of joy", "keywords": "jessica alba, celebrity babies, baby bumps, pregnant", "news_keywords": "jessica alba, celebrity babies, baby bumps, pregnant", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.etonline.com/news/221701_jessica_alba_is_pregnant_with_baby_no_3_see_the_cute_announcement/"}, "ios": {"app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223, "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/jessica-alba-cash-warren-expecting-baby-no-3/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "http://www.etonline.com/news/221701_jessica_alba_is_pregnant_with_baby_no_3_see_the_cute_announcement/", "title": "Jessica Alba expecting baby No. 3 with husband Cash Warren", "description": "Actress took to Instagram on Monday to share news that she and her husband, Cash Warren, will soon welcome new bundle of joy", "image": {"identifier": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/18/0240896e-a28a-4921-a05e-e434c69a6c87/thumbnail/1200x630/f70a4c9d6062fbf54cb9579d56c7b7e6/alba.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267, "pages": 131459315949}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNewsEntertainment", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "CBS News", "ipad": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"iphone": 334256223, "ipad": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/jessica-alba-cash-warren-expecting-baby-no-3/", "ipad": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/jessica-alba-cash-warren-expecting-baby-no-3/", "googleplay": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/jessica-alba-cash-warren-expecting-baby-no-3/"}}, "site": "@CBSNewsEnt", "title": "Jessica Alba expecting baby No. 3 with husband Cash Warren", "description": "Actress took to Instagram on Monday to share news that she and her husband, Cash Warren, will soon welcome new bundle of joy", "image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/07/18/0240896e-a28a-4921-a05e-e434c69a6c87/thumbnail/1200x630/f70a4c9d6062fbf54cb9579d56c7b7e6/alba.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "theme-color": "#101010", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "CBS News", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "summary": ""}
