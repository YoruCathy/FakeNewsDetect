That\u2019s at least what the evidence suggests by the typically C-to-F-list caliber talent Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry attracts, celebs who are seemingly hard-up for work if they aren\u2019t somehow E! adjacent (like Wednesday\u2019s guest Chrissy Metz of This Is Us on NBC, which like E! is owned by NBCUniversal). There are, of course, some notable exceptions like RuPaul.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI bring this up because Iggy Azalea, fresh from her thus unsuccessful pivot to Latina, was also on Wednesday\u2019s show and to hear her talk, you\u2019d never guess that her commercially viable days are in all likelihood behind her. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of hits,\u201d she boasted, rattling off names, some more memorable (\u201cFancy,\u201d \u201cProblem\u201d with Ariana Grande) than others (\u201cBooty\u201d with J. Lo, \u201cPretty Girls\u201d with Britney Spears). She told Henry, \u201cI feel like in my mind you jam out to me,\u201d which I totally believe she does feel. (I also believe she says this to a lot of people and will continue saying this for decades even if she ends up living in a bedroom with her mother in a crumbling mansion. Especially that, actually.) Henry did not pretend to not know who she was, as he often has in the past when pulling up to a celebrity\u2019s house (he said he thought Larry Birkhead was Keith Urban).\n\nNo dead people from Azalea\u2019s past felt like talking to Henry, I guess, so he instead advised Azaela on her love life and career and it was like...what does this guy even do anyway? Now he\u2019s clairvoyant thanks to \u201cthem\u201d? He promised Iggy she\u2019d have new springtime career opportunities and then have time for love. It\u2019s exciting that the days are getting longer, the weather is getting warmer, and we\u2019ll be able to check against Henry\u2019s prediction soon enough.\n\nHe spoke of the failing health of someone close to Azeala, whom she eventually identified as her grandfather. Henry said he was receiving \u201ca symbol of a water balloon and a bunch of holes being poked in the water balloon. And it\u2019s like we stop one hole and water comes out the other. We have to stop that hole but it\u2019s like water comes out the other. And it\u2019s basically their way of acknowledging this person\u2019s health, like we\u2019re dealing with this and this other thing comes up.\u201d You\u2019d think that \u201cthey\u201d would come up with better metaphors, being of the spirit realm and having nothing better to do than float around all day until some nosy little towheaded Hogwart\u2019s reject starts poking around for inter-dimensional gossip.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just having me keep in mind his prostate...they\u2019re having me go to like lower, rectal, prostate area,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd again it was like, what do you do, man???\n\nAt the end of her segment, Iggy pointed out how the facts contained in this reading were not Googleable, to underscore Henry\u2019s legitimacy. A cursory look confirms that she\u2019s right, which means she could have told this information to producers or Henry himself and then he spit it back at her and she said, \u201cOh wow, yes, yes,\u201d while thinking, \u201cI\u2019m so glad to be on television,\u201d or, \u201cIt\u2019s nice that someone is at least pretending to want to talk to me.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the episode, Henry brought out his mother, whom he called a \u201crapper fan\u201d on multiple references. So...like any rapper? Indeed, she seemed thrilled to be in the presence of Azalea. Henry shared that they used to listen to Azalea\u2019s track \u201cMurda Bizness\u201d together. It sounded like he pronounced it \u201cbidness,\u201d and if that doesn\u2019t make you cringe, well, check out his accompanying dance move.\n\nThough Henry didn\u2019t communicate with a dead person from Azalea\u2019s past, he testified to the camera, \u201cI was still about to give a reading to Iggy today but it focused on living matters on living people.\u201d Wow, I can\u2019t believe that worked out for him on his own show.
