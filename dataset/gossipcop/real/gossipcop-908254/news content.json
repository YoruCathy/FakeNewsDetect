Yeah, it\u2019s very, very exciting.\u201d\n\nThe wedding won\u2019t be for a while, however: Williams said that the couple is waiting until the latest season of Game of Thrones is over to start wedding planning, although she thinks Turner is \u201calready letting her little heart wonder and imagine.\u201d (Perhaps about how to work in some custom Louis Vuitton?)\n\nThe two actresses, who play sisters on Game of Thrones, have long maintained a close friendship offscreen. Last year, Turner gushed about Williams in an interview: \u201cShe\u2019s my best friend, she\u2019s my soul mate. I love that girl to pieces,\u201d she said. They also have their own hashtag: #Mophie.\n\nWilliams won\u2019t be the only actress to stand by her costar\u2019s side on her big day. Courteney Cox, for example, was Jennifer Aniston\u2019s maid of honor in her wedding to Justin Theroux, and Drew Barrymore was a bridesmaid in Cameron Diaz\u2019s wedding. High School Musical fans got a surprise in 2014 when they noticed Vanessa Hudgens was low-key in Ashley Tisdale\u2019s bridal party.\n\nWhenever Turner\u2019s big day does arrive, the only list Arya Stark will be manning is a guest one.", "images": ["https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.e33072deca0cf93bb836ebae5f1a13228ccd143f.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.e59a2fba3f338152fef5e68bdd8de503b13ab406.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746d56cdef03417e8312b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746ceca2fb57e0cf3876e/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.ca5391719a9bb240552dec148d9ee3c8f603abfd.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746d56cdef03417e8312b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elise Taylor", "Elise Taylo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/maisie-williams-bridesmaid-at-sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-wedding", "title": "Maisie Williams Will Be a Bridesmaid at Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas\u2019s Wedding", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Elise Taylor", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "Maisie Williams revealed in an interview that she will be in Game of Thrones costar Sophie Turner\u2019s wedding to Joe Jonas.", "id": "5a673ca26cdef03417e83125", "keywords": "living,weddings", "news_keywords": "living,weddings", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a673ca26cdef03417e83125", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Maisie Williams revealed in an interview that she will be in Game of Thrones costar Sophie Turner\u2019s wedding to Joe Jonas.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746c86cdef03417e83127/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746c86cdef03417e83127/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "When the big day arrives, the only list Arya Stark will be keeping is a guest list.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746d56cdef03417e8312b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Maisie Williams Will Be a Bridesmaid at Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas\u2019s Wedding", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/maisie-williams-bridesmaid-at-sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-wedding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "When the big day arrives, the only list Arya Stark will be keeping is a guest list.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": {"src": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6746d56cdef03417e8312b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-maisie-williams-bridesmaid-sophie-turner-wedding.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Maisie Williams Will Be a Bridesmaid at Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas\u2019s Wedding"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
