The former network executive Preston Beckman \u2014 known on Twitter as \u201cthe Masked Scheduler\u201d \u2014 noted in a blog post that Fox probably intentionally showed it on Sunday night to counterprogram ABC\u2019s premiere of the revived \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d (\u201cThey probably don\u2019t want egg on their face if \u2018AI\u2019 returns with an impressive number,\u201d he said.)\n\nIn interviews leading up to the broadcast, both Ms. O\u2019Brien and Mr. Wrong stressed that Mr. Simpson didn\u2019t get a dime for this special. He was reportedly paid $800,000 for the book \u201cIf I Did It\u201d in 2006, but got no money for the interview then, according to Fox. Fox, on the other hand, definitely stands to benefit \u2014 which was one of the complaints levied before the broadcast was scrapped the first time.\n\nFox, Ms. Regan, Ms. O\u2019Brien and Mr. Darden have all insisted that \u201cThe Lost Confession\u201d is a vital document in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp. The special was framed as a look inside the mind of a domestic abuser, and perhaps a warning to any woman who might be in a relationship with someone who talks the way Mr. Simpson does in the interview. Mr. Wrong also made sure to point out that unlike in 2006, the Brown and Goldman families gave their blessing to show this footage, ostensibly because they believe it makes Mr. Simpson look guilty.\n\nDoes O.J. Come Clean?\n\nIt certainly seemed that way. Bear in mind that this interview has been edited down from about four hours (according to Ms. Regan, in promos Fox sent to TV critics), and that throughout Mr. Simpson is referring to the \u201chypothetical\u201d confession in the book \u201cIf I Did It.\u201d In the six minutes in which he talks about the murders, he describes being on the scene with a friend named Charlie \u2014 whom the panel believes was just a voice inside his head. It\u2019s all very odd.\n\nThat said, when Mr. Simpson describes grabbing a knife (\u201cI do remember that part,\u201d he says), and recalls seeing copious amounts of blood, it doesn\u2019t sound all that hypothetical. The interview goes on to cover the aftermath of the crime \u2014 including the infamous Bronco chase \u2014 and Ms. Regan\u2019s questioning about what was going through Mr. Simpson\u2019s mind at that time keeps steering him toward explaining his feelings of anger, frustration, depression and yes, guilt.\n\n[ALSO READ: The O.J. Simpson Murder Trial, as Covered by the Times]\n\n\u201cThe Lost Confession\u201d also offers a glimpse into its subject\u2019s character. It\u2019s fascinating to see Mr. Simpson blasting the media, all while frequently reminding Ms. Regan of his past reputation as a successful and popular guy. He seems to cling to every half-truth about his relationship with Ms. Brown that makes him look like he\u2019s the real victim.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/12/arts/television/12OJinterview/12OJinterview-articleLarge.png?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/12/arts/television/12OJinterview/12OJinterview-facebookJumbo.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/12/arts/television/12OJinterview/12OJinterview-facebookJumbo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Noel Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/arts/television/oj-simpson-interview-fox-lost-confession.html", "title": "The O.J.
