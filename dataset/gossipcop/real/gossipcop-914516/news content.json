As police were investigating the first robbery, three additional street robberies took place \u201cwithin minutes of each other,\u201d police officials said.\n\nHicks and Tamburo have been charged with three counts of felony attempted second-degree robbery and two counts of second-degree robbery. Hicks is also facing allegations that he personally used a handgun during the robbery. Prosecutors also allege both Hicks and Tamburo, 23, committed the robberies against victims who are over the age of 60, according to the criminal complaint obtained by Radar.\n\nHicks remains in Men\u2019s Central Jail in lieu of $550,000 bail, while Tamburo posted $350,000 bail on February 6, according to court records.\n\nTamburo is scheduled to appear in court on June 29 for an arraignment, but Hicks\u2019 arraignment remains on hold until his mental competency is determined. The Disney star will be back in court on June 22 when both sides will discuss the doctor\u2019s evaluation of Hicks competency in front a judge.\n\nHicks has had other run-ins with the police. On July 8, 2017, the TV star was arrested for discharge of a firearm with gross negligence, Santiago said. Hicks also was arrested on September 11, 2017 for battery. However, no charges were filed for either arrest because of insufficient evidence, Santiago said.\n\nWe pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?
