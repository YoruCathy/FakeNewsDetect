And despite the short shooting schedule, find love they did. Four couples emerged from the show, with one surprise proposal at the \u201cWorld Tells All\u201d taping.\n\nClare Crawley, runner-up on Juan Pablo Galavis\u2019 infamous \u201cBachelor\u201d season and contestant on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d and Canada\u2019s Benoit Beausejour-Savard, got engaged after a whirlwind romance.\n\nThe two briefly dated on \u201cBachelor Winter Games\u201d before Beausejour-Savard left the show brokenhearted when Crawley started showing interest in other men. However, they reconnected after filming and dated for two months before Beausejour-Savard proposed on the \u201cTells All\u201d stage.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I got back from \u2018Winter Games\u2019 there was a message from him just checking to see if I was okay,\u201d Crawley told Variety shortly after she accepted the engagement and custom Neil Lane ring.\n\nAt the time, Beausejour-Savard said he thought she had ended up with another man from the show but still wanted to check on her as he says he knew \u201cit wasn\u2019t the end of the two of us.\u201d They continued to grow their relationship but kept it a the secret from their fellow \u201cBachelor\u201d cast mates \u2014 by avoiding them.\n\n\u201cThey were thinking we were savage and didn\u2019t want any news from them, but that wasn\u2019t it,\u201d Beausejour-Savard said. \u201cWe were bad at lying and just wanted to avoid the lies.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the cast said they were just as surprised as the audience, with fan-favorite Ashley Iaconetti saying she was \u201ctruly shocked, truly amazed, just in awe\u201d and friend Lesley Murphy said \u201cit was so unexpected but in the best way possible.\u201d\n\nJordan Mauger, a former Bachelor in New Zealand, called Beausejour-Savard a \u201csneaky French bugger\u201d for lying to them, saying, \u201cHe really pulled one over on us because we were just hanging out with them last night and watching the episode where the stuff goes down with Benoit and Clare, and Clare left the room. And we were like \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s still s\u2014 going down?\u2019 But it was all play, they were good, give them the reality Oscar.\u201d\n\nAs for the other couples, Americans Dean Unglert and Murphy found love on the show, as did Iaconetti and Canadian Kevin Wendt, and Australia\u2019s Courtney Dober and New Zealand\u2019s Lily McManus.\n\nUnglert, who was beloved with fans after Rachel Lindsay\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d but fell from favor after his behavior on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d got down on one knee during the \u201cWorld Tells All\u201d taping. But instead of presenting an engagement ring, too, Unglert gave Murphy a key to his house.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t know what to expect going into the show, but \u201ceven the producers, the creators \u2014 everyone \u2014 were surprised and excited to see the amount of couples that came out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this has more couples coming out of it [than even \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019], so it\u2019s good to see people grow so quickly and so fondly for each other over such a short amount of time,\u201d Unglert said.\n\nIaconetti, who first appeared on Chris Soules\u2019 season and has since been on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d said that she feared there would be cliques going into \u201cWinter Games.\u201d Citing her friendship with Ben Higgins, Luke Pell and Unglert, she admitted she thought the Americans would all stick together but was pleasantly surprised to find everyone, instead, \u201cassimilated together as different countries, and it was pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nWendt added that he was surprised how well the cast got along, and was expecting \u201cto have the Chads [Johnson, of JoJo\u2019s season] of the house ready to fight me and crazy women fighting each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was cool because when I started clicking with Ashley, we just laid around all day talking about everything, and all the guys were friends with each other,\u201d Wendt said. \u201cIt was a very positive feeling leaving there that I made a bunch of friends and a girlfriend all in one.\u201d\n\nMauger shared a moment he wished had aired \u2014 when he and Dober faced off in a New Zealand versus Australia downhill skiing challenge. The two bet that whoever lost the competition had to do a \u201cshoey\u201d \u2014 drinking a beer out of a shoe \u2014 from the other person\u2019s ski boot. Mauger came out on top and said, \u201cWe went back to the lodge, and he had to drink, and I made sure my boot was really sweaty. It was an absolute laugh.\u201d\n\nHiggins, the former Bachelor who ended his engagement with Lauren Bushnell last year, left \u201cWinter Games\u201d early after realizing he wasn\u2019t over his previous relationship and was not yet ready to date. Still, he said he has no regrets about the experience.\n\n\u201cIt was different. I didn\u2019t know what I was getting myself into, honestly, and I think the thing that maybe excited me about the whole experience was every day when I woke up it felt easy because it felt very real,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was going to be a dating show. I didn\u2019t know it was also going to be a very limited amount of competitions. I just went into it thinking \u2018Hey, this seems like the right next step for me.\u2019 I\u2019m really glad I did it.\u201d\n\nStassi Yaramchuk from \u201cBachelor\u201d Sweden also revealed at \u201cWorld Tells All\u201d that she was single after striking up a relationship with Pell on the show. She alleged that Pell refused to talk to her after filming ended and claimed the romance was just for TV, with the two facing off for an awkward conversation during the tell-all taping. Yaramchuck says she is now interested in being the next Bachelorette.", "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Fbachelor-winter-games-surprise-engagement-finding-love-in-four-episodes-1202706770%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202706770&comment_count=7", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/bachelor-winter-games.jpg?w=1000"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/bachelor-winter-games.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Chuba"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bachelor-winter-games-surprise-engagement-finding-love-in-four-episodes-1202706770/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Cast Talks Surprise Engagement, Finding Love in Four Episodes", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Winter Games\" finished off it's first season on Thursday, capping its four-episodes with the \"World Tells All\" to check in with the cast.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202706770, "author": "Kirsten Chuba", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-02-22T20:00:04"}, "pmc-tag": "Ben Higgins,Benoit Beausejour-Savard,Clare Crawley,The Bachelor,The Bachelor Winter Games", "title": "\u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Cast Talks Surprise Engagement, Finding Love in Four Episodes", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Bachelor Winter Games\u2019 Cast Talks Surprise Engagement, Finding Love in Four Episodes", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/bachelor-winter-games-surprise-engagement-finding-love-in-four-episodes-1202706770/", "description": "SPOILER ALERT:\u00a0Do not read if you have not yet watched \u201cThe Bachelor Winter Games\u201d finale from Thursday, Feb. 22. \u201cThe Bachelor Winter Games\u201d finished its inaugural season on Thursday, \u2026", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/bachelor-winter-games.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "THE BACHELOR WINTER GAMES - Is love the universal language?
