But these days she's becoming equally as well known for another standout quality: her stunning good looks. The 26-year-old actress recently became the new face of L'Or\u00e9al Paris, joining other unforgettable women including Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Lopez, Gwen Stefani and Eva Longoria. We caught up with Michele on the phone as she was getting ready for ELLE's 19th Annual Women in Hollywood Celebration and learned more about her take on her own beauty, growing up in the entertainment business, her makeup must-haves and what her new gig means to her.I think I'm beautiful. It's just in this town and in Hollywood, I wouldn't consider myself the standard, typical type of beauty. I'm Jewish and Italian, and I have a lot of different ethnicities that add to my look being unique. I've always loved that about myself. I've always loved my background and my heritage, and how that really made me and my type of beauty different.I feel like people should make their own decisions. That was just my personal choice, and I think that was a great choice for me. I'm a singer and when you get a nose job you don't know how it's going to affect your voice or change your sound. So that was just a risk that I didn't want to take.I love Sophia Loren, Barbra Streisand, Natalie Wood, Raquel Welch\u2014all of the Old Hollywood women who were ethnic and different-looking. Those are the women I look to and try to represent in photo shoots. I love to be in shoots that are inspired by someone like one of those women.I think personally I've always kept my makeup to a minimum because I don't really know how to do makeup on myself. But now I work with an incredible makeup artist. Her name is Melanie Inglessis . I've been working with her since we started Glee, and she's done 90 percent of all my major events and appearances. We really take chances and we really have fun, and we try to make every event different. At one event, we'll do a smoky eye. At the next event, we'll do a strong lip. I really love that.We've had the same goal since the beginning. We've always been very consistent with keeping things natural and me, but still taking little risks and trying different things here and there.Oh my god, I can't even think of one. I love the look Melanie did for the Grammys my first year in 2010. I love that beautiful smoky eye, and Mark Townsend did my hair. He also does my hair for all of my events. Melanie and I were just looking through every one we've done and there are just so many. She's knocked it out of the park every single time. I think honestly the best look she's ever done was this year when I won the People's Choice Award. She did this pink lip on me and I was like, \"You're crazy. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it.\" But it ended up looking so amazing. That was one of these risks we've taken and it turned out so perfectly. [Editor's note: That's Michele at the 2012 People's Choice Awards above! Inglessis used a mix of Lanc\u00f4me Rouge In Love High Potency Lipcolors in Roses in Love and Violette Coquette to get her mauve-y pink pout.]I think you should always wash your face before you go to bed at night\u2014especially if you have makeup on.I'm very minimal as far as makeup is concerned. But for years I have not left my house without putting on L'Or\u00e9al mascara. It's always been the best mascara out there. The Voluminous Mascara is especially my favorite. I am also a huge fan of my Clarisonic that I use to wash my face every day. I think that that's really saved my face. For hair, I'm a really big fan of doing hair treatments. L'Or\u00e9al EverCr\u00e8me has an amazing hair mask , and I also love K\u00e9rastase hair products. Those just really help me keep my hair so strong with all the damage that it goes through all the time from all the products and styling. I try to use the K\u00e9rastase deep treatment once a week.When I'm not doing the show or on the red carpet, I really like to give my skin the chance to breathe. So I am very minimal. I actually try not to wear any makeup at all when I'm not working so that my skin can just have a break.Maybe just a little lip balm, but honestly I don't really carry makeup with me because I don't like to wear makeup when I'm not working. I'll definitely keep a little mascara in my bag sometimes for a touch-up.I've always wanted to be a part of the L'Or\u00e9al family. Honestly, my mother and I have been using the brand for so many years. I really love the message it has. And their commercials and print ads are always stunning and so sophisticated. So for the chance to be a part of a company that I just know and love personally so much is amazing. I'm incredibly honored to be a part of this legacy.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images", "images":
