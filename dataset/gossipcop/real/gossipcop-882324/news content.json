In 2012, Scott signed his first major-label deal with Epic Records. In November of the same year, Scott signed a deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music, as part of its production wing Very GOOD Beats. In April 2013, Scott signed a record deal with T.I.'s Grand Hustle imprint.\n\nScott's first full-length project, the mixtape Owl Pharaoh, was self-released in 2013. It was followed with a second mixtape, Days Before Rodeo, in August 2014. His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015), was led by the hit single \"Antidote\". His second album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016) became his first number one album on the Billboard 200. The following year, Scott released a collaborative album with Quavo titled Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho under the group name Huncho Jack. In 2018, his highly anticipated Astroworld was released to widespread critical acclaim and produced his first Billboard Hot 100 number one single, \"Sicko Mode\".[5] In late 2019, Scott's record label Cactus Jack Records released the compilation album JackBoys which became the first number one album on the Billboard 200 of the 2020s.\n\nScott's musical style has been described as a fusion of traditional hip hop, lo-fi and ambient. Scott has sold over 45 million certified records in the US alone.[6] He has been nominated for six Grammy Awards and won a Billboard Music Award.\n\nEarly life\n\nJacques Berman Webster II[4] was born in Houston, Texas. From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. Located in south-central Houston, the neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, \"Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey [sic]. I was always like, \u2018I gotta get the fuck out this shit.\u2019 It gave me my edge\u2014[it made me] who I am right now.\"[7] Webster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business.[8] Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer.[9] Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen.[10] Webster then attended the University of Texas San Antonio, before dropping out his sophomore year to fully pursue his music career.[11][12][13][14][15][16]\n\nAfter dropping out, Webster immediately moved to New York City in an attempt to start his music career. His parents, frustrated that he had dropped out of school, eventually cut him off financially.[17]\n\nCareer\n\n2008\u201312: Career beginnings and record deals\n\nWebster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates. In 2008, the duo released their untitled first EP on social networking website Myspace.\n\nThe following year, Scott and OG Chess, one of Scott's schoolmates, formed the group The Classmates. The Classmates released two projects, with Buddy Rich in 2009 and Cruis'n USA in 2010.[18] Scott mainly handled production work on both projects. The duo remained together until late 2012, when personal conflicts and financial disputes led to the disbandment of the group.[19]\n\nAfter leaving college, Scott moved from Houston to Washington Heights in New York City where Scott began working with friend Mike Waxx, who owned the music website Illroots. After moving to New York, Scott slept on the floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's studio. Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[17] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at University of Southern California.[20] Atlanta-based rapper and owner of Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled \"Lights (Love Sick)\". While in Los Angeles, T.I.'s representative contacted Webster, asking him to attend a studio for a meeting. During the meeting, T.I. freestyled over \"Animal\", one of Webster's productions.\n\n2012\u201314: Owl Pharaoh and Days Before Rodeo\n\nScott performing in 2013.\n\nScott's first solo full-length project is a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh, which was set to be released as a free download in 2012.
