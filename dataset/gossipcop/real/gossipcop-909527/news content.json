GRAMMY winners Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood and past GRAMMY nominees Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry will join the star-studded list of performers paying tribute to Parton in Los Angeles during GRAMMY Week on Friday, Feb. 8, 2019.\n\nBrooks, Yearwood, Cyrus and Perry are the latest additions to an already stacked lineup of previously announced artists who will be performing songs from Parton's impressive musical catalog. Previously announced performers include GRAMMY winners Vince Gill, Don Henley, Norah Jones, P!nk, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, Mark Ronson, Mavis Staples, and Chris Stapleton, GRAMMY nominees Leon Bridges, Lauren Daigle and Linda Perry and multi-platinum singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes.\n\nTo the delight of fans and artists alike, the honoree will be closing out the program with a special performance as well, with GRAMMY-nominated musician Greg Phillinganes serving as the musical director for the evening.\n\nParton is being recognized as the 2019 MusiCares Person Of The Year, marking the first member of the Nashville music community to receive the honor. She was chosen for her unparalleled contributions to country music and a multitude of charitable causes, including the children's literacy organization she started in 1995, Imagination Library, with which she has donated over 100 million books to kids around the world.\n\n\"Dolly Parton has always been and continues to be a courageous trailblazer and indomitable inspiration for creators and artists\u2014so for us to have the opportunity to honor her at our annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala is to pay tribute to a true pillar of strength and someone who we all look up to and cherish,\" Recording Academy President and CEO Neil Portnow said. \"Dolly also knows the power of philanthropy and she has used her stardom to contribute to a wide range of causes from natural disasters to education and literacy programs.\"\n\nMusiCares provides a vital safety net of health and human services programs, and the proceeds from MusiCares annual Person of the Year gala go directly to the charitable organization to continue their much-needed work, which includes helping music people have a place to turn in times of financial, medical and personal need.\n\nThe 29th annual gala will open with a reception and silent auction sponsored by Delta Airlines offering an exclusive and unparalleled selection of luxury items, VIP experiences and one-of-a-kind celebrity memorabilia for bidding guests followed by a gala dinner sponsored by AEG complete with a live auction, the tribute concert and the award presentation.\n\nFor ticket and table information, please
