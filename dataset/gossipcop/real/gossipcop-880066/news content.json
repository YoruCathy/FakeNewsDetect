And the comedy icon is opening up about why this project was the one to draw him back.\n\nCarrey and his Kidding co-stars, Judy Greer and Catherine Keener, sat down with ET's Nischelle Turner at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, and he talked about working on the small screen once again after almost a quarter of a century.\n\n\"Projects find you when you're ready to express them. That's what I find,\" Carrey shared. \"The ones that you're drawn to are the ones that, for some reason, you've just experienced something very similar or something in your past is lit up by this.\"\n\nCarrey got his big break as a cast member on the Fox sketch comedy series In Living Color, on which he starred from 1990 to 1994. Carrey left the series following the release of his massive hit films Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Mask and Dumb and Dumber, which all came out in his final year on the show.\n\nBut Carrey said there was one memory he had from the made-for-TV movie Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All, which he shot alongside veteran film and TV star Stacy Keach back in 1989, that really gave him a passion for acting that he's never forgotten.\n\nYoung Jim Carrey Performs Hilarious Stand-Up Routine, Opens Up About Start in Comedy -- Watch!

There's something about it that's meant to be, that is the craziest, hairiest blessing that could ever happen.\"\n\nCarrey added that, while his character has something of a nervous breakdown in the series, the show is actually \"about a nervous breakthrough.\"\n\nKidding premieres Sept. 9 on Showtime.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Jim Carrey Reflects on the 'Insane' Experience of Getting His Start in Stand-Up Comedy This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
