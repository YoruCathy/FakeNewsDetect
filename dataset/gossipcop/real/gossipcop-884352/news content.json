First, she costarred in Shake It Up alongside Bella Thorne, but when her first Disney show came to an end, Zendaya made an interesting decision: Instead of moving on to feature films and more adult projects right away, she signed on for a second Disney series.\n\nThat show was K.C. Undercover, a show about a black family of spies that Zendaya both starred in and produced. In a new interview with Black-ish star Yara Shahidi for Glamour, she opens up about why she decided to stay at the children's network and bring K.C. to fruition.\n\nDisney\n\n\"I didn\u2019t feel like there was any other choice,\" she explained. \"I was like, 'If I\u2019m going to do this, this is how it has to be.' There needs to be a black family on the Disney Channel.

And you know, there is so much work left to be done. I\u2019ve talked about this before, but can I honestly say I would be in the position I\u2019m in if I weren\u2019t a lighter-skinned black woman? No.\"\n\n\n\nYara completely agreed, adding, \"One thing that I constantly say is that my goal is not to be the face of black girls. The goal is to open the door so widely that I am drowning in a sea of\u2014.\"\n\n\"In a sea of black girls,\" Zendaya finished the thought for her. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nAs Zendaya said though, there's so much work left to be done to make that dream a reality.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts", "Kayleigh Roberts Is The Weekend Editor At Marie Claire", "Covering Celebrity", "Entertainment News", "Actual Royals Like Kate Middleton", "Meghan Markle To Hollywood Royalty", "Like Katie Holmes", "Chrissy Teigen."], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a12778808/zendaya-diversity-disney-channel/", "title": "Zendaya Just Spoke Out About the Need for More Diversity on the Disney Channel", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Marie Claire", "title": "Zendaya Just Spoke Out About the Need for More Diversity on the Disney Channel", "description": "\"There needs to be a black family on the Disney Channel. \"", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a12778808/zendaya-diversity-disney-channel/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 128598260542816, "pages": 10799255126}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire", "modified_time": "2017-10-04 02:14:31", "published_time": "2017-10-04 02:14:31", "section": "Celebrity", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@marieclaire", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "21t3kl6tV4kpBdF4RZeyQAZd2D32Yzv-g9TAHaxCVvE", "title": "Zendaya Just Spoke Out About the Need for More Diversity on the Disney Channel - Zendaya Talks Diversity on the Disney Channel", "description": "In a new interview with Black-ish star Yara Shahidi, Zendaya opened up about diversity on the Disney Channel.", "keywords": "Zendaya", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrity,celebrity", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-04T14:14:31Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zendaya-1507126168.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Zendaya Just Spoke Out About the Need for More Diversity on the Disney Channel", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507054471.0, "source": "https://www.marieclaire.com", "summary": ""}
