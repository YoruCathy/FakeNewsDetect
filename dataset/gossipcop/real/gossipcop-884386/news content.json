Thank you to everyone at the Gridiron.\n\nI just came here from Mardi Gras and I have to say: boy do you guys have some weird traditions.\n\nI did like that song y\u2019all did for me. But you do know what the actual House of the Rising Sun was, right? I\u2019ll put this diplomatically. It was a house of ill repute\u2026 you know, the kind of place where if you walk in with enough money you can get whatever you want. Kind of like Congress.\n\nAnyway this is new to me. I heard about your rule: singe, don\u2019t burn? What does that even mean? Does it mean less Tabasco sauce?\n\nI\u2019m not gonna lie -- I feel kinda out of place here. More out of place than Mike Pence at a men\u2019s figure skating competition. More out of place than Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin. More out of place than the Mnuchins in a Waffle House. More out of place than Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice. More out of place than John Kelly. Period.\n\nThe point is: I\u2019m not from here. I just don\u2019t get Washington. Like closing the government. It\u2019s not how adults behave\u2026 it\u2019s not how the real world works.\n\nI can\u2019t stop picking up the garbage just because I don\u2019t like Mitch McConnell. Think how much garbage there would be if everyone did that!\n\nAnd I can\u2019t close the playgrounds because someone won\u2019t play ball. If I do something like that, parents would be on me like Rand Paul\u2019s neighbor.\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m a mayor. I did some homework: Did you know that the last sitting mayor to speak at your Spring dinner was John Lindsay in 1966?\n\nFrom the looks of it, a whole bunch of you were there!\n\nMark Shields- you were there, right? I mean think about where you were in 1966. Walter Isaacson and I were 6-year-olds, playing \u201cKick the Can\u201d in Broadmoor. Tom Cotton wasn\u2019t even a sparkle in his mother\u2019s eye. In 1966, Al Hunt, well, he already had gray hair. Seriously, the last time you guys had a mayor -- a speaker who actually gets things done -- was 52 years ago.\n\nAnd when I say \u201cget things done\u201d -- I mean it.\n\nMayors work with the other side to solve problems. We balance budgets. We fight climate change. Here\u2019s a little secret, off-the-record\u2026 it\u2019s real. We fight crime. We invest in infrastructure and build things. We actually do. Check out the rebuilding in New Orleans. It\u2019s just unbelievable.\n\nIn fact, just the other week, I had the New Orleans Department of Public Works pull 46 tons of Mardi Gras beads out of the sewers. That\u2019s true. 46 tons of Mardi Gras beads. You\u2019re looking at whole lot of drinking\u2026 and a whole lot of poor decisions.\n\nSpeaking of Mardi Gras\u2026 President Trump, you should really come down to New Orleans.\n\nMy lovely wife Cheryl and I actually saw you in Paris on Bastille Day. We were only about 500 yards away. We saw how much joy you took in watching the military march by. I actually said to Cheryl: You know, New Orleans has everything Donald Trump talks about.\n\nParades? We\u2019ve been having those since 1699 with military bands and all. We have a parade or krewe as we call it, called the Knights of Chaos. There\u2019s even someone called the King of Chaos.\n\nMr. President, I know you like giving nicknames. Come to think of it, that\u2019s a perfect one for you. King Chaos. What do y\u2019all think?\n\nWe have more things in New Orleans that you\u2019d like.\n\nA wall? We got one of those. We call it a levee.\n\nToo much public leaking? Happens on Bourbon Street all the time.\n\nGold? We\u2019ve got that, too. There are enough gold doubloons in our city that you could literally write your name across a building in huge gold letters. I mean, not that anyone would ever do that.\n\nAnd know what else? No matter how many times we say it, we don\u2019t drain any swamps either.\n\nI will say this about swamps: They\u2019re part of the ecosystem. So you just gotta get used to the fact that they\u2019re teeming with all manner of hideous beasts. Snakes. Alligators. James Carville.\n\nAnyway, you\u2019d love New Orleans. And a little getaway might be good for you, because I know things have been tough lately: Recently, there was a survey that ranked all of our presidents. President Trump came in dead last.Fake news, right?\n\nWell, this is real: there was another ranking of presidents who declared themselves to be stable geniuses, and Mr. President, you were indeed the greatest of all time.\n\nI jest. The truth is the President and I have a lot in common. We\u2019re both a little overweight and balding. I just have had an easier time admitting it. I know you like winning but...you\u2019re not gonna win this battle. We both love Wrestlemania. We both take more mulligans than we\u2019d admit to.\n\nAnd another thing that we have in common -- the President has a lonely job, and I understand lonely.\n\nI\u2019m a Democrat from the south. That\u2019s lonely. Nobody ever comes to visit.\n\nFor Nancy Pelosi, the south is San Jose. For Chuck Schumer, the South is the Jersey shore sunbathing with a shirtless Chris Christie.\n\nHe didn\u2019t do that\u2026 but just try to get that image out of your mind now that I said it.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m thrilled to be sharing the stage tonight with my fellow Southerner, Senator Tom Cotton.\n\nSenator Cotton\u2019s family were cattle farmers. Which prepared him for the Senate, because he\u2019s pretty experienced with BS.\n\nI was worried that I was going to slip up and actually curse there. But even if I did, I can count on Tom Cotton to say that he and David Purdue actually heard something different.\n\nBut Senator, here\u2019s the thing. You can\u2019t sprinkle BS with sugar and turn it into a cupcake.\n\nNow, that\u2019s about as far as I can go with jokes about Tom Cotton. Otherwise, I\u2019ll get one of those cease and desist letters he likes to send.\n\nActually, I will say one more thing about the Senator. He\u2019s a favorite of the President. A real up and comer. The President has been talking about choosing him for all type of positions. Mr. President, a little advice from a southern Democrat: You want to expand your base? Stop talking about picking cotton.\n\nYou know, when I think of what y\u2019all are dealing with here\u2026 I\u2019m reminded of a Boudreaux and Thibodaux joke my dad used to tell me.\n\nBoudreaux and Thibodaux got a pilot to fly them to Canada to hunt moose. They bagged six. Unfortunately, when they got back, the pilot said the plane could take only four.\n\nThibodaux said \u201cLast year we shot six and the pilot let us take \u2018em all in that same plane as yours.\u201d Eventually the pilot relented. But even on full power, the little plane went down.\n\nBoudreaux and Thibodaux survived the crash, sitting over the six moose.\n\nBoudreaux turned to Thibodaux, and asked, \u201cWhere we at?\u201d\n\nThibodaux replied, \u201cI think we\u2019re pretty close to the place we crashed last year.\u201d\n\nIn Louisiana, we say: \u201cWhere you at?\u201d or \u201cWhere we at?\u201d\n\nIt can mean a bunch of things, including how are you or we doing not just where you happen to be. So if I asked \u201cwhere we at\u201d in our politics nationally, the truth is we\u2019re not doing so well. And that means we need to change things up. It means telling the truth and confronting the truth.\n\nI have had to confront a totally broken city and rebuild it, and I had to confront the truth of Confederate statues.\n\nThe President has to confront the truth of a fractured nation.\n\nAnd we all have to confront the truth that we human beings can act poorly towards one another sometimes.\n\nY\u2019all in the press can\u2019t let us off the hook on that. Because an independent press is indispensable to a free and just nation.\n\nNow, we can be blinded by anger, hate, fear and actually turn on each other. But eventually, we\u2019re going to come back to earth, start putting one foot in front of the next and start seeing each other again as fellow human beings. We live and breathe the same air, raise our kids and pray we get them through our teenage years, go to church, go to ballgames, cheer for our country in the olympics and begin once again to find our common purpose.\n\nYou see, it all comes full circle and I am hopeful because when all is said and done\u2026I believe love wins.\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson as old as the Bible itself. One that Billy Graham himself and so many others remind us of so often.\n\n\u201cWhatsoever you do to the least of my brothers that you do unto to me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good way to live. And it happens to be a pretty good governing philosophy as well.\n\nWe live in the greatest country in the world. But the truth is, we cannot be great unless we are good.\n\nMr. President- You are my president. You are our president.\n\nWe all want you to do good. And we want you to do well.\n\nOur country depends on it.\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nAnd God bless the United States of America.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1520271778/180305-Mitch-Landrieu-tease_zm0fbq", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1520271778/180305-Mitch-Landrieu-tease_zm0fbq", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1520271778/180305-Mitch-Landrieu-tease_zm0fbq", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mitch Landrieu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/mitch-landrieu-roasts-tom-cotton-rand-paul-and-donald-trump-at-the-gridiron", "title": "Mitch Landrieu Roasts Tom Cotton, Rand Paul and Donald Trump at the Gridiron", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Mitch Landrieu Roasts Tom Cotton, Rand Paul and Donald Trump at the Gridiron", "keywords": "Donald J.
