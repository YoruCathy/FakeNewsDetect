She says, \u2018I want my own to be this way.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to put on your seatbelt and buckle up when you are going round those curves.\n\n\u201cWe make sure we don\u2019t sand down the edges by doing big movements \u2013 squats, kettle bell swings, dead lifts \u2013 that accentuate her assets.\u201d\n\nGunnar\u2019s gym is not huge and the pricey equipment is packed in tight. But there\u2019s just enough room for his key workout tool \u2013 a HUMMER.\n\nThe bright yellow monster sits at the entrance to the gym and Gunnar attaches battle ropes to the bars at the front for one of Kim\u2019s favourite workout moves \u2013 the beatdown.\n\nThe scene is straight out of a Hollywood movie and it\u2019s clear why so many stars have Gunnar on speed dial \u2013 he takes exercise seriously but makes it fun.\n\nKim comes to Gunnar five times a week and surprisingly he describes her as one of his hardest workers.\n\nHe says: \u201cKim is hardcore. She does not whine or complain, she just comes in ready to work and she doesn\u2019t stop.\n\n\u201cKim drives for an hour each day to get here for 7am and she does that because it\u2019s a priority for her. I have other clients who live two minutes away and cancel twice a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really strong. You wouldn\u2019t know it, but she can lift a lot of weight. She did 20 leg presses this morning lifting 300lb weights.\u201d\n\nGunnar trains up to nine star clients a day, including Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez and Modern Family actress Sofia Vergara.\n\nHe got Angelina Jolie in the form of her life to play Lara Croft in Tomb Raider and helped Matthew McConaughey buff up as stripper Dallas in Magic Mike.\n\nBut the biggest project in his life is surely the Kardashian clan.\n\nHe has trained every one of the family at some point, including Kris and Rob, but is adamant he treats each as an individual.\n\nHe says: \u201cKim, Kendall and Khloe have very different bodies. With Khloe we do a lot of stairs and side lunging, while with Kendall it\u2019s upper body strength.\n\n\u201cShe is very athletic, very gifted athletically and picks up movements well.\n\nGunnar is the man behind Khloe\u2019s recent transformation from flab to fab.\n\nThe 30-year-old came to Gunnar for help following unflattering photos of her tummy in a bodycon dress last November.\n\nAnd Gunnar admits helping her shave off the pounds \u2013 by pulling a SLEDGElike a cart horse.\n\n\u201cSledge-pulling is a terrific movement for her. It\u2019s a great resisted pull that drives the legs.\n\n\u201cYou expend a ton of energy on resistance work and I make sure we do lots of moves with ropes and pulling sandbags too. Those are all big metabolic kicks.\u201d\n\n\u201cKhloe has put a lot of distance between her and the body she had in that dress.\n\n\u201cNow she looks like she could handle whatever comes at her, whether it\u2019s a night in 4in heels or a sprint in flats.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to stay downbeat around Gunnar. Pacing around his gym, he\u2019s full of energy. And his positive attitude is infectious.\n\nHe enthuses about all his clients \u2013 \u201cSofia kills it\u201d and \u201cJ-Lo is 100% focused\u201d \u2013 but saves his biggest compliments for the Kardashians.\n\n\u201cThey are super pleasant,\u201d he says. \u201cI love them as people and their achievements.\u201d\n\nGunnar describes how he went to Kim and Kanye\u2019s opulent Hollywood home last week and the first thing Kim wanted to know was about his 10-year-old daughter Sloan.\n\nHe says: \u201cI have other people I\u2019ve worked with for years who couldn\u2019t even tell you my kids\u2019 names with a lot less going on than her.; But Kim genuinely cares.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about his biggest success story to date, Gunnar refuses to take all the credit for Kim\u2019s curves.\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s body has changed because she\u2019s done the work.\n\n\u201cThe celebrities who look great and say they do nothing are either lying, really young or they\u2019re genetic freaks.\n\n\u201cThe ones who lie can\u2019t admit to working out because they don\u2019t want to seem narcissistic, but in reality they\u2019re in the gym all day.\u201d\n\nHere Gunnar shows Sun readers the top moves to get his star clients\u2019 best assets.\n\nTo get Kim\u2019s bum\u2026\n\nIn true LaLa Land style, Gunnar uses a giant yellow Hummer for Kim\u2019s workouts.\n\nBut you can just as easily use the Ford Focus parked in your driveway. No big deal.\n\nBeat-downs\n\n*Loop a set of battle ropes (Amazon or eBay sell them) through a bar (or the grille of a car)\n\n*Standing with your legs hip distance apart, lift both hands up high and slam the ropes down between your knees and squat at the same time.\n\n*Stand and repeat. Do between 10/20 reps, or until you cannot do anymore.\n\n*If you don\u2019t have battle ropes you can use a garden hose or a twisted bed sheet.\n\nSingle leg squats\n\n*Holding onto a bar (or the front of your car), bend both knees and taking one bent leg behind you, gently tap the ground with your toe.\n\n*Place your foot back on the ground and repeat 10 times. Then switch sides.\n\nPlyometric jumps\n\n*Holding the bar (or car), bend both knees and bring your bum to the ground, then spring up high and back down into a squat position.\n\n*Do this eight times, or as many as you can do until your legs give out.\n\nWaves\n\n*Holding the rope in each hand, lift one hand and then the other as if you are banging a drum.\n\n*Do this for 30 seconds, working up to 60 seconds.\n\nTo get J-Lo\u2019s abs\u2026\n\nGunnar says of Jen: \u201cSomething both Kim and J-Lo both do is workout with a poker face.\n\n\u201cNothing will break their concentration or focus. They\u2019re both 100% committed to the work and that shows in their faces.\u201d\n\nBall toss \u2013 Abs 1\n\n*Facing a wall, lie down on a mat with both knees bent and a large bouncy ball in both hands.\n\n*Sit up and throw the ball against the wall, then catch it on its return.\n\n*Lie back down and repeat. Repeat full movement ten times.\n\nBall toss \u2013 Abs 2\n\n*Repeat Abs 1, but on catching the ball, rotate your torso and tap the floor on your right and then your left side, making sure you twist your waist fully.\n\n*Repeat full movement ten times.\n\nBall toss \u2013 Abs 3\n\n*Staying in the same seated position, lift both feet off the ground and throw the ball directly from the chest to a partner and catch it back from them.\n\n*Repeat the full movement ten times.\n\nTo get Sofia Vergara\u2019s boobs\u2026\n\nGunnar says of the Modern Family star: \u201cSophia\u2019s extremely focused and works out alone, she doesn\u2019t bring friends, not even (fianc\u00e9) Joe (Manganiello).\u201d\n\nThe Fly\n\n*Lie down with your back on a bench wth your legs on the ground and holding 2.5lb dumbbells (or heavier if you can).\n\n*Draw your stomach in and down and open your arms wide.\n\n*Slowly bring your arms back in together as if you\u2019re hugging an invisible overweight friend.\n\n*Repeat 10-12 times.\n\nTurkish sit-up\n\n*Still lying on the bench, stretch your arms straight above you, then sit up and reach to the ceiling and lie back down.\n\n*Do 8-15 reps depending on your choice of weight.\n\n*Hold the weights steady as if you are balancing a glass of red wine on top of each.\n\nLeg raises\n\n*Sit up straight on a stool, holding either side of it.\n\n*Raise your legs to knee level and raise both feet up to the ceiling then back down to knee height, not dropping them to the floor. This also works the lower abdomen.\n\nAdditional reporting: Emma Patterson", "images":
