Though he is best known for playing a hard-nosed, Baltimore-based drug dealer on the classic HBO series The Wire, the moment you hear his English accent, it becomes hard to believe he is famous for playing such a tough guy.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Elba showed off some of the charisma that has made him a fixture in big-budget movies over the last half decade or so. To help promote his latest venture, a starring role in the film adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s The Dark Tower, Elba sat alongside Fallon and ran through a couple of songs, karaoke style.\n\nBut there was an important twist: the songs were first run through Google Translate, from English to another language then back to English, warping the original version of the tunes until they were almost unrecognizable. The first song, Sir Mix-a-Lot\u2019s \"Baby Got Back,\" was hilariously incoherent, with the big butt talk from the original song being converted to \"large saplings.\" This is just a guess, but you should do yourself a favor and not ever refer to the love of your life's backside as a large sapling.\n\nThe better performance, however, comes at the end of the clip, when Elba and Fallon bust out a duet version of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You,\" which is just as amazing as it sounds. Elba even decided to ad-lib at the end after the lyrics stopped flowing, improvising and telling the crowd how much he loves them.\n\nI don\u2019t think you'll be seeing much of this side of Elba when The Dark Tower drops on Friday, Aug. 4\u2014his character is a certified badass in that movie. But get you a man who can do both, as the kids say these days. You can watch the full clip of Elba getting his karaoke jams on up top.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/yx81biyrubga0zezddkb/idris_elba_jimmy_fallon"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/yx81biyrubga0zezddkb/idris_elba_jimmy_fallon", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kyle Neubeck"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/08/idris-elba-jimmy-fallon-karaoke-google-translate", "title": "Try Not to Swoon at Idris Elba Singing a Translated Version of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love to You\"", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "description": "Idris Elba joined 'The Tonight Show' to promote his new movie and perform a duet of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You\" with Jimmy Fallon.", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Try Not to Swoon at Idris Elba Singing a Translated Version of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love to You\"", "description": "Idris Elba joined 'The Tonight Show' to promote his new movie and perform a duet of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You\" with Jimmy Fallon.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/08/idris-elba-jimmy-fallon-karaoke-google-translate", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/yx81biyrubga0zezddkb/idris_elba_jimmy_fallon", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Try Not to Swoon at Idris Elba Singing a Translated Version of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love to You\"", "description": "Idris Elba joined 'The Tonight Show' to promote his new movie and perform a duet of Boyz II Men's \"I'll Make Love To You\" with Jimmy Fallon.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/08/idris-elba-jimmy-fallon-karaoke-google-translate", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/yx81biyrubga0zezddkb/idris_elba_jimmy_fallon", "site": {"id": 13049362}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
