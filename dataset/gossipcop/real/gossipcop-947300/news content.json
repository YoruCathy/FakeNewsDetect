No matter where our parents may be, this day serves to celebrate their important role in our lives.\n\nIn May we celebrated mothers, and in June we celebrated fathers. It follows that in July we can bring all our parents together and show them some appreciation all at once.\n\nParents play a vital role in the lives of children. From our birth, parents protect, teach, provide and serve as role models. As part of a family, we look to them for guidance. We mirror their behavior and learn to be a core part of our communities.\n\nThroughout our lives, our parents lead us to be independent thinking individuals. As many of us know, those efforts can be challenging. The world is changing as quickly as they grow. Often the sleepless nights and worry seem endless. On this particular Sunday, we honor all parents who do everything to raise and protect their children.\n\nHOW TO OBSERVE\n\nSpend some time with your parents or visit someone who was like a parent to you. For those with small children, give yourself a pat on the back. Set the laundry aside and go to the park. Find a moment alone with each of your children and show them how glad you are to be their parent. Post on social media using #NationalParentsDay and encourage others to celebrate the day.\n\nHISTORY\n\nPresident Bill Clinton established National Parents\u2019 Day in 1994 when he signed Congressional Resolution (36 U.S.C. \u00a7 135) into law. The recognized the \u201c\u2026uplifting, and supporting the role of parents in the rearing of children.\u201d Republican Senator Trent Lott introduced the bill.\n\nThere are over 1,500 national days.
