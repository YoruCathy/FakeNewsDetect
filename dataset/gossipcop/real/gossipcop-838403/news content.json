From the wreckage several years later comes a very different adaptation from Orphan Black creator Graeme Manson. Like the film, the series is set in a frigid, post-apocalyptic future aboard a perpetually moving train (containing 1,001 cars that house Earth's remaining human population) where class differences play out in various ways.
