She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201ccringeworthy\u201d on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m single, I\u2019ve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,\u201d Shay explained. \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t see every minute of every conversation \u2026 I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one \u2026 You can\u2019t fault me for being happy and being in love.\u201d\n\n\u201cRob was very reserved on the show,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person \u2026 So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.\u201d\n\nValletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: \u201cNo one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic. Leaving mean or nasty comments needs to stop!\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656730676_scheana-shay-robert-valletta-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C2000px%2C1130px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656730676_scheana-shay-robert-valletta-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656730676_scheana-shay-robert-valletta-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scheana-shay-i-know-i-look-stupid-on-pump-rules/", "title": "Scheana Shay: I Know I Look 'Stupid' on \u2018Pump Rules\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Vanderpump Rules\u2019 star Scheana Shay opened up looking \u2018stupid\u2019 on the current season of the Bravo hit in her relationship with Rob Valletta \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scheana Shay: I Know I Look 'Stupid' on 'Pump Rules' in Rob Relationship", "description": "Vanderpump Rules\u2019 star Scheana Shay opened up looking \u2018stupid\u2019 on the current season of the Bravo hit in her relationship with Rob Valletta \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scheana-shay-i-know-i-look-stupid-on-pump-rules/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-06T19:49:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656730676_scheana-shay-robert-valletta-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656730676_scheana-shay-robert-valletta-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "tag": "Reality TV", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-06T19:43:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-06T19:49:08+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Vanderpump Rules\u2019 star Scheana Shay opened up looking \u2018stupid\u2019 on the current season of the Bravo hit in her relationship with Rob Valletta \u2014 get the details", "title": "Scheana Shay: I Know I Look 'Stupid' on 'Pump Rules' in Rob Relationship", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/656730676_scheana-shay-robert-valletta-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@sarahhearon"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520365434.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
