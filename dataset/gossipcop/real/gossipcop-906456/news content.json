And even with all that, you\u2019ll probably find yourself thinking, Eh. But here we are anyway, three weeks into Arie\u2019s journey and still only vaguely interested.\n\nWith 18 women left in the house, Chris \u201cTime Is Precious\u201d Harrison arrives to let the women know that there will be two group dates and one one-on-one this week before leaving behind the first date card for: Maquel, Jacqueline, Lauren B., Tia, Marikh, Bekah M., Bibiana, and Krystal. And with that, I\u2019d like to introduce you all to the Gorgeous Ladies of The Bachelor, or GLOB. (Because if I had to choose one word to describe this season, it would in fact be \u201cglob.\u201d)\n\nOn the wrestling date, the women will be learning from two of the \u201cGorgeous Ladies of Wrestling\u201d \u2014 no, not from the hit Netflix show GLOW, but rather from the far less exciting 1980s series. And to make matters worse, Arie doesn\u2019t even know that it\u2019s called a wrestling \u201cmatch.\u201d He prefers to call it a \u201cwrestling fight\u201d as he stands in the ring in a suit and attempts to participate.\n\nAnd let me tell you something about these gorgeous ladies of wrestling: They do NOT believe in laughter. In their minds, this is not a date. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. The women get to learn from Little Egypt herself, and she will not have them goofing off. Instead, she\u2019s going to insult Bibiana\u2019s mother for naming her child after a Bib, and she\u2019s going to get her fellow wrestler to pull Tia\u2019s hair until she gets angry. (But instead Tia and Bibiana go cry together in a corner.)\n\nSo remember last week when I said Becca\u2019s shopping excursion was a terrible date? This one is WAY worse. Fun is literally not allowed, but you also can\u2019t take things the other direction and hit these mean women. Instead, you have to put on a fake smile and fake punch them.\n\nBut of course, Bekah M. is INTO it. For tonight\u2019s show, she\u2019s going to be a \u201csex kitten.\u201d Fun fact: She thinks she looks like Catwoman when really, she looks like an 8-year-old who\u2019s about to go trick-or-treating.\n\nAs the women dress up for the main event, it\u2019s Arie who\u2019s the first one in the ring, still wearing a suit because he truly doesn\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on. His opponent? Pretty Boy Pitbull Kenny King! Remember Kenny from Rachel\u2019s season? Me too! Excited to see him again? Sure. Want to hear how he\u2019s doing? TOO BAD. You literally watch Kenny throw Arie around and then he\u2019s gone, never to be seen again.\n\nThen it\u2019s the women\u2019s turn to enter the ring, and I\u2019ve gotta say, this feels like a giant step back for womankind. The only highlight? Tia yelling \u201cI\u2019m too pretty for this!\u201d and ultimately defeating Bibiana.\n\nThat night, Arie takes the women to an Airstream park, where Krystal steals him away so he can tell her how sexy she was today and she can whisper sweet, drawn-out syllables into his ear. She asks if he prefers for her to be aggressive, and he is all, \u201cJust be you!\u201d If she needs attention, he gives her permission to come get it. Speaking of attention, Krystal\u2019s time is interrupted. As she stands to leave, she tells the next woman to \u201chave fun,\u201d and those two words have never sounded more like a threat.\n\nWhile Bibiana complains about Krystal being too aggressive, Tia gets some one-on-one time with Arie where he admits that he expected her to rock today, so when he saw that she was upset about the old woman screaming at her and pulling her hair he thought, \u201cHuh, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d GREAT THOUGHT, DUDE. But the good news is that her being upset allowed Arie to comfort her, which apparently makes him feel like a man. So should we address the issue of Arie needing a crying woman to feel like a man? No? Great, let\u2019s move on. (Next: And the date rose goes to\u2026)\n\nNext up, Bekah lies on Arie and tells him about her longest relationship \u2014 2.5 to 3 years \u2014 which translates in my mind to: middle school. She and Arie then bond about how breakups can make you reevaluate things and how you, like, totally end up hitting the gym and stuff, right? Totally! Then they make out and she straddles him while the rest of the women discuss how well their nights went.\n\nSo while Bekah mounts Arie, Krystal pulls a Trump and decides that everyone else is living in their own \u201cfalse reality\u201d and the truth is only what she believes, which is that she and Arie are the OTP\u2026and then Arie gives the date rose to Bekah. As he so eloquently puts it, \u201cYou were outstanding today and tonight you were amazing.\u201d (I can only imagine how great his wedding vows will be.)\n\nThe next day, Krystal admits that she\u2019s been hated on by \u201cjealous\u201d girls her entire life. She has struggled for so long and she\u2019s had to be SO strong and carry so much all by herself, and now, she just has to endure it one more time because she knows she and Arie will end up together. This process is just the latest thing she has to get through in order for them to be together in the end. Meanwhile, I can\u2019t wait until ABC forces her to watch this on the Women Tell All special and let me tell you: THAT will be something to endure.\n\nAs for Lauren S., she\u2019s off to Napa Valley with Arie for her one-on-one date in wine country, and she, for one, is looking forward to all the \u201ccheersing\u201d that will be happening. But the wine isn\u2019t the only great thing about this date. There\u2019s also the riveting conversation.\n\nFirst up, they discuss how early they go to bed. THEN they discuss how early they wake up. And wait, isn\u2019t it crazy how you reach a certain age and you suddenly just start wearing cardigans?! So cray.\n\nAnd if you thought that was great stuff, just wait until the dinner portion of the evening in which Lauren S. talks so much that ARIE ACTUALLY EATS. This might be the first time in Bachelor history that we\u2019ve seen someone eat on a date, and that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s bad.\n\nSitting down to dinner, Arie kicks things off by explaining that he\u2019s not a wine connoisseur, he just likes going to wineries and drinking wine. He then asks Lauren ONE question about her journey to get here, and she tells him about past relationships, her amazing friends and family, that one time her mom got an eye infection when she was in college, why she loves music, how she doesn\u2019t really know what \u201cscience\u201d is, and the fact that her last relationship lacked chemistry. Welp, I\u2019d say that last thing applies here too.\n\nBefore the night\u2019s over, she tries to rescue herself by talking SOME MORE about how she wasn\u2019t herself tonight and how she\u2019s not sure what\u2019s happening. (Surely it\u2019s not the wine you\u2019ve been drinking all day.) But in the end, Arie tells her he can\u2019t give her the rose because, to quote him, \u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d Same, Arie. Same. He then walks her out and says his super easy \u201cmost difficult\u201d goodbye yet.\n\nBack at the house, Lauren\u2019s luggage is taken away, and Krystal takes it upon herself to perform some sort of funeral for Lauren\u2019s \u201cbeautiful soul\u201d before offering the other women the never-before-heard advice to make the most of their time, and Caroline has had enough of it. As Lauren\u2019s friend, Caroline is done with Krystal and the fact that she thinks she can be condescending to everyone just because \u201cyou met his dog.\u201d (Next: Who let the dogs out?)\n\nWell, if that\u2019s the criteria, this place is about to be filled with condescension, because the next group date introduces Ashley, Becca K., Brittany, Jenna, Caroline, Chelsea, and Annaliese to Arie\u2019s dog. Today\u2019s group date involves hanging out at a park and preparing to perform a show with the dogs that night. But for Annaliese, it\u2019s about yet another childhood trauma. (And cue yet another amazing reenactment.)\n\nIt seems that when Annaliese was young, her grandparents\u2019 dog, the clearly misnamed Sunshine, bit Annaliese and she \u201calmost\u201d lost her eye. Okay, I have a few thoughts: Compared to bumper cars, at least this actually seems traumatic, except\u2026how young were you? Do you actually remember this? And also, how did that dog bite you that you almost lost an eye but have no visible scars on your face? And finally, is there any activity that doesn\u2019t stir up some kind of childhood trauma for you?!\n\nThat night, the women have to perform for a bunch of toddlers at The Grove, and the only good thing to come out of it is that Best in Show\u2018s Fred Willard stops by. And by that, I mean it\u2019s good for us and terrible for poor Fred Willard, who has to watch the women crash and burn. They can\u2019t even get the dogs to sit. Scratch that: They can\u2019t even keep toddlers from wandering onto their stage! And then there\u2019s Annaliese, who\u2019s undoubtedly experiencing another trauma after she\u2019s given the job of designated pooper scooper for the event.\n\nThat night, the women head to an old bank that Jenna just thinks is some building with amazing decor because she doesn\u2019t realize vaults don\u2019t tend to show up in many buildings. Arie grabs Chelsea first, and their conversation goes like this: He gives her a sad face when she says she\u2019s never had anyone respect her for who she is, and somehow that results in them kissing.\n\nCaroline then asks Arie about his last five years A.E. \u2014 After Emily \u2014 and he admits he dated women who weren\u2019t ready for marriage as a \u201cdefense.\u201d She then informs him that the women call him \u201cpillow lips,\u201d and he actually has an appropriately disturbed and embarrassed response.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Annaliese, experiencing her latest trauma: She can\u2019t get enough time with Arie, and then when she finally does, she can\u2019t think of ANYTHING to say. So instead of getting her first kiss with Arie, she\u2019s interrupted by Chelsea and then returns to the other women and puts on her jacket as one final \u201cf\u2014 you\u201d to the sound guy.\n\nWhile Annaliese talks about how she thinks she\u2019s going home, Becca and Arie call each other dorks and make out before he says this super creepy thing: \u201cYou look really good in yoga pants, by the way.\u201d And yet, she doesn\u2019t look good enough to get the date rose, which instead goes to Chelsea, because as Arie puts it, she\u2019s the one person who stood out. (Take THAT, everyone else!)\n\nThe next night is the cocktail party, and Bibiana has arranged for a special romantic setup for Arie. She\u2019s got a bed in the driveway along with a telescope so they can stargaze. Only, when she\u2019s not guarding it, Arie and Lauren B. stumble upon it and start making out. And when Bibiana tries to reclaim it, he gives her the \u201cwe just need five minutes\u201d slap across the face.\n\nArie then proceeds to take woman after woman to Bibiana\u2019s setup, and even lays Bekah M. down there so that he can figure out why he\u2019s so guarded around her. \u201cI\u2019m unsafe because I think you know that I don\u2019t need you,\u201d she tells him in a moment that actually makes me like her tiny child brain. In the past, he\u2019s been attracted to women who need a man to complete them, and that\u2019s not her. And you know what? That information blows his tiny adult mind.\n\nAfter Tia enjoys some moonshine with Arie, which he claims tastes like gasoline \u201cin a good way,\u201d Annaliese takes him away to get her kiss. But instead of going for it, she ASKS for it, literally, and he tells her that they\u2019re not there yet in what\u2019s the most uncomfortable thing I\u2019ve seen thus far in 2018, and I watched Floribama Shore!\n\nOnce Annaliese stops crying and convinces herself that some of the world\u2019s best relationships start with the people not being attracted to each other \u2014 you know, just like Romeo and Juliet \u2014 she heads back to ask Arie if he sees a future there. Spoiler: He does not. So Arie promptly walks Annaliese out.\n\nAnd because we\u2019re already sending women home, what do you say we just keep things rolling? At the rose ceremony, Arie hands out roses to: Caroline, Kendall, Ashley, Lauren, Brittany, Becca, Seinne, Krystal, Tia, Maquel, Jenna, Jacqueline, and Marikh. That means it\u2019s time to say goodbye to Bibiana, and my only question is: Will Arie ever know that she is responsible for his favorite make-out spot?\n\nIf you all need me before next week, I\u2019ll be watching GLOW \u2014 the Netflix show \u2014 with my dog.", "images":
