The Lemonade singer shared a series of new pictures featuring her and the rapper\u2019s 18-month-old babies Sir and Rumi Carter, on her official website, late Thursday evening. In the first picture, the 37-year-old smiles wide as she stands in the sand holding on to Rumi. The little girl is dressed in a yellow printed dress with matching bows. While the Hold Up singer wears a red floral printed dress.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 shared new images of her twins Rumi and Sir Carter Photo: Beyonce.com\n\nIn another image, Sir and Rumi sit side by side in the water as they look out at the sunset. The babies have an actual twinning moment for the occasion \u2013 wearing matching white outfits. The series of photos are believed to have been taken during the Carter family\u2019s trip to South Asia. After the mother-of-three performed in India for Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal\u2019s pre-wedding celebration.\n\nMORE: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's twins steal the show during the OTR II Tour\n\nNoticeably absent from this round of pictures is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband and their six-year-old daughter Blue Ivy Carter. Since their birth in 2017, Rumi and Sir have not been in the spotlight. Unlike their big sister, the babies do not appear on the singer\u2019s Instagram. The last time the world got a look at the twins was back in August when they appeared alongside their big sister in the behind-the-scenes video from their mother\u2019s Vogue cover shoot.\n\nMORE: Blue Ivy bids 19k while attending during charity event with her parents\n\nInside the magazine, the Formation singer got candid about the complications she faced during and after her pregnancy with Sir and Rumi, after delivering the babies via emergency C-Section. \u201cWe spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me,\u201d she wrote in Vogue.\n\nPhoto: Beyonce.com\n\n\u201cI am proud to have been a witness to his strength and evolution as a man, a best friend, and a father.\u201d She continued: \u201cI was in survival mode and did not grasp it all until months later. Today I have a connection to any parent who has been through such an experience.\u201d", "images": ["https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2018122113303/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-pictures/0-34-235/rumi-sir-carter-beach-z.jpg", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2018122113303/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-pictures/0-34-233/beyonce-m.jpg?filter=w400", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035866&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019101828758/beyonce-dad-breast-cancer-news/0-209-648/Pap\u00e1 de Beyonc\u00e9-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/health-and-beauty/2019110529795/beyonce-beauty-legs-body-makeup-vv/0-215-252/beyonce-beauty-trick-perfect-legs-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=XbAUn1QolK10cv", "https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hola/comunes/holacom.gif", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019110628858/super-bowl-jennifer-lopez-shakira-female-performers-roundup-gallery/0-210-292/shakira-jlo-halftime-performance-super-bowl-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2018122113303/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-pictures/0-34-234/beyonce-rumi-z.jpg", "https://us.hola.com/imagenes/celebrities/2019101728644/jennifer-lopez-demi-lovato-beauty-makeup-free-photos/0-212-159/celebrity-makeup-free-m.jpg?filter=w200", "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2018122113303/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-pictures/0-34-233/beyonce-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f"], "top_img": "https://us.hola.com/en/imagenes/celebrities/2018122113303/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-pictures/0-34-233/beyonce-t.jpg?composite=0.9|1/8xw:*;right[0.02xw],bottom[0.02xw]|RJmqrP23Dz8EaRRxMm5bs07f5pu42i2f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://us.hola.com/en/celebrities/2018122113303/beyonce-twins-rumi-sir-carter-pictures/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 shares rare photos of her and Jay-Z's twins \u2013 see how much they've grown!", "meta_data": {"title": "Beyonc\u00e9 shares new pictures of twins Rumi and Sir Carter", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 is showing off her and Jay-Z's twin babies.
