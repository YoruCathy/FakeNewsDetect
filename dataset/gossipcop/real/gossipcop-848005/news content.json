Octavia always changing. She\u2019s not a hero, she\u2019s not a villain \u2014 she\u2019s a wild card.\u201d\n\nAvgeropoulos says it\u2019s important to remember that Octavia\u2019s evolution into the Red Queen \u201cwasn\u2019t instantaneous. It was a slow burn that took place over six challenging, painful years.\u201d\n\n\u201cTowards the end of the season, there\u2019s one of my favorites episodes called \u2018The Dark Years\u2019 which gives Octavia some emotional redemption,\u201d she teases. \u201cI\u2019m excited for fans to see what happened in those six years during the time jump. They\u2019ll find out more of who Bloodraina really is and how she became that way. It wasn\u2019t easy for her. She lost her innocence and a part of herself.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that redemption arc also helps the Blake siblings find peace. Avgeropoulos correctly notes that \u201cOctavia and Bellamy have become incredibly different people. It also doesn\u2019t help that Octavia is starting to see him as an obstacle in her overall game plan \u2014 a potential enemy of Wonkru.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Octavia\u2019s enemies, we can also look forward to her impending confrontation with Echo when the two formally reunite tonight (The CW, 9/8c). \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Echo \u2014 the woman who stabbed her and pushed her off a cliff \u2014 is the last person on Earth that Octavia would want to have as a sister-in-law,\u201d she says.\n\nYour thoughts on Octavia\u2019s new persona?
