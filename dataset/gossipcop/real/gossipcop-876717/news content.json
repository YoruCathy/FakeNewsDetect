Dropping today, Maroon 5 are the latest artists to declare their love for SZA, scoring a coveted guest spot from MTV VMA Best New Artist nominee, who is enjoying a huge breakthrough year following the release of her debut studio album Ctrl in June.\n\nOn \u201cWhat Lovers Do,\u201d Maroon 5 continue to explore hip hop and EDM, with the funky backtrack the perfect compliment to lead singer Adam Levine and SZA\u2019s perfectly complementary back and forth on love.\n\nConsidering Maroon 5\u2019s impressive track record of dominating the charts, especially when it comes to teaming up with female vocalists (\u201cMoves Like Jagger\u201d anyone?), the new single \u201cWhat Lovers Do\u201d will likely be the catalyst that propels SZA from exciting new artist to a household name by the end of the year.\n\nMaroon 5 issued a press release for the new single today, promising a video in the near future that is described as a \u2018larger-than-life cinematic affair.\u2019 The band uploaded a 30 second black and white video showing rehearsal footage of \u201cWhat Lovers Do\u201d earlier this week, but unfortunately SZA was absent.\n\nHere it comes\u2026 #whatloversdo A post shared by Maroon 5 (@maroon5) on Aug 28, 2017 at 7:00pm PDT\n\nWe have a feeling that following Levine\u2019s Twitter tirade against Sunday\u2019s MTV VMAs, the band probably shouldn\u2019t hold their breath for a nomination for \u201cWhat Lovers Do.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Maroon 5 dropped \u201cDon\u2019t Want To Know\u201d with Kendrick Lamar, and again melded hip hop and pop earlier this year with Future on their single \u201cCold.\u201d\n\nThe group have yet to announce the name of their upcoming sixth album, which is set to be released sometime in November. The new album will be the band\u2019s first since 2014\u2019s V, which featured the singles \u201cMaps,\u201d \u201cAnimals\u201d and \u201cSugar.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iHeartConcert-HEader-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Allison-Bowsher-Profile-200x200.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DRAKE-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/oneworld-taylor-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/nav/search-icon.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/bellmedia-logo-white.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/blackhistory-internettrends-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Now-That-I-Found-You-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/close-icon-black.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/lohan-music-teaser-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/OneWorld_1280x720_Thumb-250x141.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/loading-circle.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=417766778714379&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/nav/back-to-top-icon.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/loading.gif", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1133906844-1-250x141.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/twitter-icon.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/gplus-icon.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/themes/much-1.2.58/dist/images/facebook-icon.png", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lovers-Do-770x433.jpg", "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Lil-Nas-x-Billy-Ray-Cyrus-250x141.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lovers-Do-770x433.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Bowsher"], "canonical_link": "https://www.much.com/maroon-5-sza-what-lovers-do/", "title": "Maroon 5 Team Up With SZA For Summery 'What Lovers Do'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "HJjc7_To7geIUneC8S8qDo60eW4G3_sxyNe8RDAmbbo", "og": {"url": "https://www.much.com/maroon-5-sza-what-lovers-do/", "image": "https://www.much.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lovers-Do-770x433.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "Much.com", "description": "We may be entering the Labor Day weekend and the unofficial end to summer, but Maroon 5 and SZA are doing their part to keep the warm weather and good times rolling.
