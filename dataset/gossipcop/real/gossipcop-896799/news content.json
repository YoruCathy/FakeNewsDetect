(2017) played a role in the downfall of her relationship with the film's director, Darren Aronofsky.\n\nThe confession was revealed in a one-on-one interview with Adam Sandler, as part of Variety's Actors on Actors series.\n\n\"Normally, I promote a movie, you put the work in to promoting it, ask people to go see it, and then it's just kind of out of your hands. I normally just kind of let it go,\" she said. \"Dating the director is different.\"\n\nShe continued, \"We'd be on the tour together. I'd come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie. He comes back from the tour, and that's all he wants to talk about and I get it. It's his baby. He wrote it. He conceived it. He directed it. I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner while also being like, 'Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?'\"\n\nEventually, she said, the dynamic became unhealthy. \"I finally was just like, 'It's not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.' Especially because it's my man,\" she said. \"I don't want to sound in an interview that I'm defending what we're doing in any way. It's awesome, what we did. Some people hate it and the people who hate it really hate it. But it's nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.\"\n\nLawrence and Aronofsky's split was first reported by Entertainment Tonight in November. They were reported to have broken up in October and the split was said to have been amicable. They were together for about a year.\n\nReleased in September, mother! quickly became one of the most controversial movies of the year, earning a rare \"F\" from CinemaScore.", "images": ["https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-hurt-relationship-with-darren-aronofsky/intro-1512061225.jpg", "https://img1.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-hurt-relationship-with-darren-aronofsky/intro-1512061225.jpg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://img.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-hurt-relationship-with-darren-aronofsky/intro-1512061225.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andy Scott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/97985/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-mother-hurt-relationship-darren-aronofsky/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Bad reviews of mother! hurt my relationship with Darren Aronofsky", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-hurt-relationship-with-darren-aronofsky/intro-1512061225.jpg", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Bad reviews of mother! hurt my relationship with Darren Aronofsky", "description": "The Oscar winner tells Adam Sandler that bad reviews of the movie movie! negatively impacted her romance with the film's director, Darren Aronofsky.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nickiswift.com/97985/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-mother-hurt-relationship-darren-aronofsky/", "site_name": "NickiSwift.com"}, "twitter": {"title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Bad reviews of mother! hurt my relationship with Darren Aronofsky", "description": "The Oscar winner tells Adam Sandler that bad reviews of the movie movie! negatively impacted her romance with the film's director, Darren Aronofsky.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NickiSwiftCeleb", "image": "https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/jennifer-lawrence-says-bad-reviews-hurt-relationship-with-darren-aronofsky/intro-1512061225.jpg"}, "title": "Jennifer Lawrence: Bad reviews of mother! hurt my relationship with Darren Aronofsky", "description": "The Oscar winner tells Adam Sandler that bad reviews of the movie movie! negatively impacted her romance with the film's director, Darren Aronofsky.", "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-29T05:54:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-30T12:01:20+00:00", "author": "Andy Scott"}, "fb": {"pages": 915319058545299, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "enable=true ad_density=default"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f7a286f935bd433580c2d31f5d66fea9"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511934860.0, "source": "https://www.nickiswift.com", "summary": ""}
