He went from being a super busy person to having nothing but time on his hands,\u201d the source close to Lauer tells PEOPLE. \u201cHe is not doing well.\u201d\n\nThe longtime news anchor, who was fired from the Today show in November 2017, \u201cis not thinking about working again right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t sit around thinking about a comeback,\u201d adds a second source.\n\nInstead, Lauer is focusing all his attention at home \u2014 with his children.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to get by putting all his energy into his kids,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe is working on his relationship with his kids. They have a good relationship, but they\u2019ve been through a lot.\u201d\n\nAs Lauer, 60, and his estranged wife Annette Roque continue working out the terms of their divorce, the former couple is still living together at their Hamptons compound with sons Jack, 17, and Thijs, 11, and daughter Romy, 14.\n\n\u201cAll he wants is to be involved in his kid\u2019s lives,\u201d says the second source. \u201cHe spends his days doing as much kids stuff as he can.\u201d\n\nAnd while Lauer is mainly staying home and keeping a low profile, he still makes time to socialize with friends.\n\n\u201cHe is not dating,\u201d adds the second source. \u201cSome former colleagues have visited him. He has some long-term friends he sees and hangs out with on a regular basis.\u201d\n\nLauer\u2019s lawyer did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn May, the network released a report about the Lauer\u2019s firing. The internal investigation, which was led by NBCUniversal general counsel Kim Harris, focused on four complainants\u2019 allegations and resulted from nearly 70 interviews with current and former employees and more than 30 focus groups with 262 current employees. According to The New York Times, one complaint included a former NBC employee who alleged Lauer sexually assaulted her in his office in 2001.\n\n\n\nIn the first paragraphs of the report, the investigation team states that Lauer \u201cadmitted to engaging in sexual activity\u201d with the anonymous woman whose allegations prompted his firing.\n\nLauer also admitted to \u2014 and apologized for \u2014 seeing NBC staffers romantically during his tenure at the network.\n\n\u201cFive months ago I was terminated by NBC after admitting to past relationships with co-workers. A day later I took responsibility, apologized to the people I had hurt and promised to begin the process of repairing the damage I had caused my family. I have worked every day since then to honor that promise,\u201d he said in a statement to PEOPLE in April.\n\n\u201cI have made no public comments on the many false stories from anonymous or biased sources that have been reported about me over these past several months \u2013 including a claim that I would, or even could, lock someone in my office. I remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost,\u201d Lauer continued.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut defending my family now requires me to speak up. I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false,\u201d he concluded.\n\nRelated video: NBC Investigation Concludes Matt Lauer \u2018Engaged in Inappropriate Sexual Behavior\u2019", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3000001&cs_ucfr=1&rn=636907553117041078&c7=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Finside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well%252Far-BBQdwia&c8=&c9=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msn.com%2Fen-us%2Ftv%2Fcelebrity%2Finside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well%2Far-BBQdwia", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://c.msn.com/c.gif?udc=true&rid=d70214fce28f48819b732f05d2aab13f&rnd=636907553117041078&rf=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msn.com%2Fen-us%2Ftv%2Fcelebrity%2Finside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well%2Far-BBQdwia&tp=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Finside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well%252Far-BBQdwia&di=1275&lng=en-us&activityId=d70214fce28f48819b732f05d2aab13f&d.dgk=tmx.pc.webkit.chrome&d.imd=0&st.dpt=tv-celebrity&st.sdpt=&subcvs=tv&pg.n=articleflex&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&aadState=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAxXTgW.img?h=40&w=138&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&f=png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/assets/shared/badges/en-us/appstore-lrg.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://static-entertainment-neu-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/9b/e151e5.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://otf.msn.com/c.gif?js=0&evt=impr&di=1275&pi=&ps=&su=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.msn.com%252Fen-us%252Ftv%252Fcelebrity%252Finside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well%252Far-BBQdwia&mkt=en-us&pp=False&cv.partner=People&cv.publcat=TIME%2BInc.&st.dpt=tv-celebrity&st.sdpt=&dv.Title1=&cts=636907553117041078&rf=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.msn.com%2Fen-us%2Ftv%2Fcelebrity%2Finside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well%2Far-BBQdwia&rid=d70214fce28f48819b732f05d2aab13f&cvs=Browser&subcvs=tv&cv.entityId=BBQdwia&cv.entitySrc=ar&provid=BBlOXnw&ar=0&d.dgk=tmx.pc.webkit.chrome&d.imd=0&cv.parentId=&isCorePV=&pgIdx=&pgTot=&activityId=d70214fce28f48819b732f05d2aab13f&pm=&pg.n=articleflex&pg.t=article&pg.c=&pg.p=prime&anoncknm=&issso=0&ex=&aadState=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBN2dC1.img?h=630&w=1200&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&f=jpg&x=715&y=520", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://static-entertainment-neu-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/d3/9f8e92.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBN2dC1.img?h=630&w=1200&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&f=jpg&x=715&y=520", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831/https://people.com/tv/inside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-one-year-after-today-show-firing/", "title": "Inside Matt Lauer's Quiet Life 1 Year After Today Show Firing: 'He's Not Doing Well'", "meta_data": {"civicscience": {"jspoll-hostname": "www138.civicscience.com"}, "application-name": "Inside Matt Lauer's Quiet Life 1 Year After Today Show Firing: 'He's Not Doing Well'", "cq": "passed", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ab1142", "msapplication-TileImage": "//static-entertainment-neu-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/sc/1f/08ced4.png", "msapplication-config": "none", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "description": "Inside Matt Lauer's Quiet Life 1 Year After Today Show Firing", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0", "sharing_url": "http://a.msn.com/0A/en-us/BBQdwia", "og": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831/https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/celebrity/inside-matt-lauers-quiet-life-1-year-after-today-show-firing-hes-not-doing-well/ar-BBQdwia", "title": "Inside Matt Lauer's Quiet Life 1 Year After Today Show Firing: 'He's Not Doing Well'", "description": "Inside Matt Lauer's Quiet Life 1 Year After Today Show Firing", "type": "article", "site_name": "MSN", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190413122831im_/https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBN2dC1.img?h=630&w=1200&m=6&q=60&o=t&l=f&f=jpg&x=715&y=520"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 125117174535490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
