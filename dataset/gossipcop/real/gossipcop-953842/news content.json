But as she pointed out on Monday\u2019s episode, she was once a teen mom. In fact, when she was pregnant during her mother\u2019s vice presidential campaign, she may have been the most famous teen mom in the world. Bristol made sure to explain this to viewers: \u201cI\u2019m no stranger to being a young mom in the public eye.\"\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBristol\u2019s story line during the premiere was a family affair, as her mother and sisters (Willow, 24, and Piper, 17) gathered in Arizona for Willow\u2019s bachelorette party. Bristol marveled that she\u2019s the only Palin who doesn\u2019t live in Alaska, given that she moved to Austin after she married Dakota Meyer in 2016. She lives there with their toddler daughters, Sailor and Atlee; and her son, 9-year-old Tripp, whose father is her ex-fiance Levi Johnston.\n\nBristol and Dakota divorced this year, and their split will play out over the season. It\u2019s already tragic: Dakota, 30, is a military veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Bristol told viewers that Dakota\u2019s PTSD \u201chas been really hard on our marriage\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s been a challenge to keep our family together.\u201d\n\nIn the beginning of the episode, Bristol explained that while she was away at the bachelorette party, Dakota took their daughters on a trip to Kentucky, his home state. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time he's taken them by himself like this,\u201d Bristol said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow did he do on the flight?\u201d Sarah asked.\n\n\u201cHe said they did good. I\u2019m proud of him,\u201d Bristol assured her mother. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that he's such a good dad that I don't have to worry.\u201d\n\nHowever, the episode concluded with an extremely disturbing scene, as the couple had a huge fight. Amid noises of their kids playing in the background, Dakota and Bristol tried to explain their issues to two \u201cTeen Mom\u201d producers.\n\nBristol said she knows that Dakota suffers from PTSD, but he takes his anxiety out on her and she can\u2019t handle it \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want her kids to think that\u2019s what marriage looks like. Dakota responded that he feels terrible that he\u2019s said some awful things but that he relives his fellow servicemen dying in front of him every single day, and he wished Bristol could understand his pain.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a punching bag for everything that he goes through internally,\u201d Bristol said, adding that she\u2019s never sure whether his anger is the anxiety or just him being cruel.\n\nAD\n\n\"Well, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s PTSD or what\u2019s not,\u201d Dakota said, mocking Bristol\u2019s tone. \u201cAre you kidding me? You wonder why I go off the rails and why it gets amplified? And all I want you to do is love me and be there for my scars.\u201d\n\nThe whole argument was tough to watch, and MTV promised there\u2019s more to come. On the after-show, Bristol told viewers that Dakota has \u201csought out treatment, and he is taking steps to try to control [his anxiety] and to better himself.\u201d And she explained why she wanted to show her life on television once again.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown up so much the last 10 years, and I think that God gave me this platform to be on this show, to open up my life and to discuss things that are going on or that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d Bristol said. \u201cIf I can help or encourage others, then I think that that\u2019s what God wanted me to do.\u201d\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/57f2027b-73ed-448e-b497-38ad3452a54b.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dt3Uiy17XYIpIN9Raw2JPXxh25A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SMGRFOHQWJCIRGX2YEFG2PXY4M.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dt3Uiy17XYIpIN9Raw2JPXxh25A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SMGRFOHQWJCIRGX2YEFG2PXY4M.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Style Reporter Covering Pop Culture"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/03/bristol-palins-first-episode-teen-mom-og-had-very-disturbing-scene/", "title": "Bristol Palin\u2019s first episode of \u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 had a very disturbing scene", "meta_data": {"description": "The MTV show chronicles Bristol's split with her husband, military veteran Dakota Meyer.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2018/10/03/bristol-palins-first-episode-teen-mom-og-had-very-disturbing-scene/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dt3Uiy17XYIpIN9Raw2JPXxh25A=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SMGRFOHQWJCIRGX2YEFG2PXY4M.jpg", "title": "Bristol Palin\u2019s first episode of \u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 had a very disturbing scene", "description": "The MTV show chronicles Bristol's split with her husband, military veteran Dakota Meyer."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bristol Palin\u2019s first episode of \u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 had a very disturbing scene", "description": "The MTV show chronicles Bristol's split with her husband, military veteran Dakota Meyer."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-10-04T16:31:18.086Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538496000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
