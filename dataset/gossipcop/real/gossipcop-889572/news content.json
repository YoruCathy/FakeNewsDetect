But it doesn't take long for Eleanor to realize she's there by mistake. She hides in plain sight from the Good Place's architect, Michael, and his all-knowing assistant, Janet. Her seemingly perfect neighbors, Tahani and Jason, and open-hearted soul mate, Chidi, help her realize that it's never too late to change. With the help of her new friends -- and a few enemies -- Eleanor becomes determined to shed her old way of life in hopes of discovering a new one in the afterlife.\n\nCast Edit\n\nAbout Edit\n\nThe series was commissioned by NBC based on a pitch by creator Mike Schur. Because of Schur's track record, he was given a 13-episode season, straight away without having to produce a pilot episode first.\n\nThe original announcement of the show gave little away, suggesting only that Kristen Bell's character would be a self-centred character, attempting to become a better person; and that Danson's character would be a mentor to her (which would turn out to be untrue).\n\nThere was no mention of the afterlife setting, in the original casting announcements, and even the cast themselves were only told the minimum about the series; before signing up.\n\nSchur later explained that the concept of \"The Good Place,\" came from his own habit of assigning point scores, to people who annoyed him. Once he had come up with the idea of the twist ending, he had a start and end point for Season 1; which provided him with the series' structure. Only Bell and Danson, were told about the twist ending of Season 1, at the outset.\n\nThe show is highly serialized, with strong story arcs, and cliffhangers at the end of each episode. Schur has mentioned in interviews, that he has a seven-season arc planned out\u2014and according to Bell, Schur has told her how the series will end.\n\nDespite being produced by NBC, The Good Place is marketed as a Netflix Original internationally, having different thumbnails and title card to match.\n\nCasting Edit\n\nBell and Danson were attached to the project at an early stage, and in interviews have mentioned the prospect of working with each other (and of course Schur), to have been a major reason for signing up.\n\nThe other main cast members were less well-known, and cast from auditions.\n\nWilliam Jackson Harper (Chidi), was previously best known for his role in the children's series The Electric Company. Manny Jacinto (Jason), was a dramatic actor, whose biggest role had been as a crime boss in the thriller series The Romeo Section. D'Arcy Carden (Janet), had a background in improv comedy. Jameela Jamil (Tahani), was an experienced TV and radio presenter in the UK, but had no professional acting experience.\n\nSeveral other characters are played by actors who had worked with Schur on Parks & Recreation: Marc Evan Jackson (Shawn) and Adam Scott (Trevor) were regular cast members in that show, and Jama Williamson (Val) and Maribeth Monroe (Mindy St. Claire) had also appeared in the series.\n\nLocations Edit\n\nMost of the series was filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood, with the village exteriors being mainly shot on the Little Europe backlot. Many of the other locations, such as the Chinese Garden, were shot at The Huntington Collection & Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California. The beach scenes, were filmed at Leo Carillo State Beach, in Malibu.\n\nTrivia Edit\n\nKristen Bell (Eleanor Shellstrop) knows how the show will end, as she has been told by creator Michael Schur[1].\n\nEpisodes Edit\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired (U.S. dates) Season premiere Season finale 1 13 September 19, 2016 January 19, 2017 2 13 September 20, 2017 February 1, 2018 3 13 September 27, 2018 January 24, 2019 4 14 September 26, 2019 January 30, 2020\n\nDVD Release Edit\n\nDVD Name Ep # Release Date The Good Place: Season One 13 October 17, 2017 The Good Place: Season Two 13 July 17, 2018 The Good Place: Season Three 13 July 30, 2019 The Good Place: Season Four 14 March 29, 2020\n\nPhotos Edit", "images": ["https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/xavier-riddle-and-the-secret-museum/images/9/97/N2losLW-asset-kids-mezzanine1-16x9-N70Tdc3.jpg/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20190910004306", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/thegoodplace/images/f/ff/The-Good-Place-season-1-poster.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20180915212324", "https://slot1-images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb1586975593232/common/extensions/wikia/WikiaBar/images/wikiabarIcon.png", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wubbzy/images/7/7e/Me_and_My_Friends_-_128.png/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20180423181936", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/thegoodplace/images/f/ff/The-Good-Place-season-1-poster.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20180915212324", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/thegoodplace/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png/revision/latest?cb=20200120160341", "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/101dalmatianstreet/images/0/0e/Community-header-background/revision/latest/zoom-crop/width/100/height/56?cb=20200106151802"], "top_img": "https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/thegoodplace/images/f/ff/The-Good-Place-season-1-poster.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/2000?cb=20180915212324", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thegoodplace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Good_Place", "title": "The Good Place", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "generator": "MediaWiki 1.19.24", "keywords": "The Good Place Wikia,thegoodplace,The Good Place,Michael Schur,3 Arts Entertainment,Fremulon,Universal Television,David Miner,Drew Goddard,Ted Danson,Kristen Bell,William Jackson Harper,Jameela Jamil", "description": "The Good Place is an American fantasy comedy television series created by Michael Schur and the serialized half-hour (22 minutes, the rest being advertising time), which debuted on September 19, 2016 and concluded on January 30, 2020 on NBC.
