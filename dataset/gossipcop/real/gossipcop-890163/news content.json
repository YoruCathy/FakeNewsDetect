My heart is broken.\u201d\n\nCookie was a familiar face to \u201cReal Housewives\u201d fans and, much like Frankel\u2019s other dogs, Biggy and Smallz, has a sizeable following on both Twitter and Instagram. Her relationship with Frankel\u2019s now 7-year-old daughter, Bryn, helped inspire the reality star\u2019s 2014 children\u2019s book, \u201cCookie Meets Peanut.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re sending our well-wishes to Frankel and Bryn during this difficult time in their lives.\n\nTODAY\u2019s editorial team thought this item was news-worthy \u2013 and we hope you do, too.
