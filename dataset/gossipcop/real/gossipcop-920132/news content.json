Warner Bros. did not provide any information on who the man lurking over his shoulder is. Dumbledore has always been rather laid back, even in the face of certain death, but there\u2019s a new essence of cool surrounding his younger self.\n\nJust for added effect, here\u2019s a behind-the-scenes photo of a young Albus Dumbledore talking to a young Newt Scamander.\n\nAnother interesting photo released today gives us a better look at Johnny Depp\u2019s controversial Grindelwald. Depp was cast as Grindelwald in 2016, taking over for Colin Farrell, who technically played the role in 2015\u2019s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, although he hid under the guise of a man named Graves. Depp\u2019s casting was met with scorn from fans, who argued that after allegations arose of Depp\u2019s alleged domestic abuse of ex-wife Amber Heard, he shouldn\u2019t be involved in the film.\n\nHarry Potter creator J.K. Rowling later published a blog post announcing her support of Depp in the role, writing that \u201cthe filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting, but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies.\u201d\n\nDepp\u2019s version of the character is much different than Farrell\u2019s, and can be seen in the photo below standing beside actress Poppy Corby-Tuech, who will play Vinda Rosier, one of Grindelwald\u2019s most trusted followers.\n\nThe full synopsis for The Crimes of Grindelwald can be read below:\n\nAt the end of the first film, the powerful Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) was captured by MACUSA (Magical Congress of the United States of America), with the help of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne). But, making good on his threat, Grindelwald escaped custody and has set about gathering followers, most unsuspecting of his true agenda: to raise pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings. In an effort to thwart Grindelwald\u2019s plans, Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.\n\nFantastic Beasts and the Crimes of Grindelwald will be released in November 2018.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAjPGEMHetBx9B3MvoB40wm-mR8=/0x0:2400x1257/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947887/FB2_03580r.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670791/underwater_foxamarkfield.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670718/raze.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670886/DesMe1.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KNnoXhXn1xo49rXW57Zzx6bexm8=/0x0:2400x1601/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2400x1601):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947875/FB2_04677r.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nkcd1-goUez1k066jpRCFEJ7hYM=/0x0:2400x1599/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2400x1599):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947835/FB2_BTS_00928r.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66671900/iXZHRDT.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66670608/breach.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fm5DC4-BUpwLT7IolDownW33Rg8=/0x0:2400x1599/1200x800/filters:focal(1078x357:1462x741)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58150049/FB2_03580r.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f65R8IN60wAOw6X9AdQNBDu05U4=/0x0:2400x1600/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2400x1600):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947829/FB2_03215r.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66672163/DB8E102C_40E1_4E3C_8AEF_5F156F8456F6_e1561390962980.0.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAjPGEMHetBx9B3MvoB40wm-mR8=/0x0:2400x1257/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947887/FB2_03580r.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Emily Heller", "Cass Marshall", "Tasha Robinson", "Karen Han", "Austen Goslin", "Dec"], "canonical_link": "https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/29/16831478/fantastic-beasts-grindelwald-dumbledore-johnny-depp-jude-law", "title": "Young Dumbledore, Grindelwald star in new Fantastic Beasts sequel photos", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Polygon", "author": "Julia Alexander", "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-29T17:49:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-29T17:49:02-05:00"}, "fb": {"pages": "340327135979921,1121292284586403,353942168328519,231096643968522", "app_id": 549923288395304}, "style-tools": "https://www.polygon.com/style/community/405/aa1b5f60f2d88473ebd6692c9d20c2ed/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Oh, Dumbles", "og": {"description": "Oh, Dumbles", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aAjPGEMHetBx9B3MvoB40wm-mR8=/0x0:2400x1257/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947887/FB2_03580r.jpg", "alt": "Crimes of Grindelwald Eddie Redmayne", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Polygon", "title": "Young Dumbledore, Grindelwald star in new Fantastic Beasts sequel photos", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/29/16831478/fantastic-beasts-grindelwald-dumbledore-johnny-depp-jude-law"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/29/16831478/fantastic-beasts-grindelwald-dumbledore-johnny-depp-jude-law", "title": "Young Dumbledore, Grindelwald star in new Fantastic Beasts sequel photos", "description": "Oh, Dumbles", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jTuqtYcLR8SB60Ek7pyx0ymSv1U=/0x0:2400x1200/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9947887/FB2_03580r.jpg", "alt": "Crimes of Grindelwald Eddie Redmayne"}, "site": "Polygon"}, "sailthru.title": "Young Dumbledore, Grindelwald star in new Fantastic Beasts sequel photos", "sailthru.tags": "general,polygon,front-page,movies,entertainment", "sailthru.description": "Oh, Dumbles", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-29T17:49:02-05:00", "sailthru.image.full": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmGCZseutawuhluvOP2-zQhqTaA=/0x0:2400x1350/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58150045/FB2_03580r.0.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXQMt1YsCWTJUkRBsbK-LgTynOc=/471x0:2070x1599/200x200/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/58150045/FB2_03580r.0.jpg", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/hub/sbnu_logo_minimal/405/touch_icon_ipad_retina_1000x1000.7014.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da0050", "outbrainsection": "movies"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514476800.0, "source": "https://www.polygon.com", "summary": ""}
