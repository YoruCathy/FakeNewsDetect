Inside the Met, the two were photographed mid-conversation as Moschino designer Jeremy Scott (who was Cardi B's date) watched on like a proud dad.\n\nYou can practically hear Cardi saying, \"okurrrrrt?\" through this photo:\n\nGetty Images\n\nLater in the night, Nicki and Cardi even posed together for a group selfie.\n\nCardi B and Nicki Minaj seen catching up inside the #MetGala . pic.twitter.com/TSfDvUqg9F \u2014 Karen Civil \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf9 (@KarenCivil) May 8, 2018\n\nOf course, the internet completely lost it upon seeing the duo chatting at the Met Gala. Within minutes, Twitter was hard at work crafting the greatest comparisons of the rappers' conversation.\n\nOne user pointed out that the meet-up was basically a recreation of the 1435 painting, \"Visitation\", by Jacques Daret. And well, he's not entirely wrong...\n\nNicki Minaj, Jeremy Scott and Cardi B at the 2018 #MetGala / \"Visitation\", from Altarpiece of the Virgin (St Vaast Altarpiece) by Jacques Daret, c. 1435 pic.twitter.com/V5MKBYoxvu \u2014 Est Cola (@thereimond) May 8, 2018\n\nAnother compared the moment to an iconic scene from the Disney movie, The Emperor's New Groove:\n\nThis is tooooo accurate \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Nicki and Cardi I love you both \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/dkr7BWJVAy \u2014 \ud83e\udd0eNov\ud83d\udc9a (@novs_place) May 8, 2018\n\nAnd then, there was a long list of people who simply could not maintain their chill at the sight of the rappers together:\n\nTwo of the best female rappers in the game right now talking and mingling with no problems or no beef!! Y\u2019all need to quit trying to put them against each other!! I love them both!! They are both very talented and beautiful!! @iamcardib @NICKIMINAJ #MetGala pic.twitter.com/fMD0ijNHJq \u2014 Mamba Out \u270c\ud83c\udffe\u270c\ud83c\udffe (@kcjj_04) May 8, 2018\n\nNow all we need is a Nicki x Cardi collab track, please and thank you.
