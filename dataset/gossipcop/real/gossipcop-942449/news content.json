The original run of the Netflix original was one of the most talked-about series of the year, often by fans who loved it, sometimes by critics who lamented how it handled its tough issues like suicide and rape.\n\nBut season 2 has come and gone with\u2026almost no buzz at all. It was a very, very strange phenomenon. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever seen a show go from all anyone could talk about to a complete void of coverage for its sophomore season, yet that\u2019s exactly what happened with 13 Reasons Why.\n\nThe theory was that, perhaps, after a relatively conclusive ending to season 1 (13 episodes, 13 tapes, the end), that simply no one was watching the second season. But that appears not to be the case as Netflix has announced today that yes, 13 Reasons Why is returning for season 3. They also gave these details alongside the announcement:\n\nProduction on the new season will resume later this year. The new season will premiere in 2019.\n\nSeason 3 will have 13 episodes.\n\nBrian Yorkey will be returning as the series' creator and showrunner.\n\nBrian Yorkey, Joy Gorman, Mandy Teefey, Kristel Laiblin, Tom McCarthy, Steve Golin and Selena Gomez are returning as EPs.\n\nThe new season will be produced by Paramount Television and Anonymous Content for Netflix.\n\nNetflix\n\nDespite being a huge fan of season 1, I still have not watched season 2 yet. Partially because I just finished up a big move and didn\u2019t have time, but also because I heard that\u2026it wasn\u2019t very good. Season 1 has an 80% from critics on RottenTomatoes while season 2 has a 28%. I have read a number of rants from critics and fans alike about the decisions made in season 2, but I suppose I am going to have to just watch it for myself to fully make up my mind.\n\nWhile Netflix does tend to bring shows back more often than rival networks, considering it doesn\u2019t care about viewership all that much, it must have faith in the series and it must see that it does have a loyal fanbase, even with the drama, or lack thereof, surrounding season 2. 13 Reasons Why also has the benefit of essentially being\u2026a bunch of kids walking around a high school, as opposed to some of Netflix\u2019s more high cost projects from Altered Carbon to The Crown. It also probably helps that the entire cast is made up of relative unknowns, though by season 3, I hope these kids are getting something of a pay bump, as Netflix clearly sees value in them.\n\nThere\u2019s also a teaser trailer for 13 Reasons Why season 3 you can check out below. If you watched season 2, are you excited for another season?\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
