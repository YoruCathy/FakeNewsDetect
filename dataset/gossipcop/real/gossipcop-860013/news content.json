Yes, I\u2019m trained as an actor, I went to school for this and all of that. But this is not something I can do over and over again,'\u201d Brooks said.\n\nBrooks also took her grief to Twitter in a touching post featuring herself and Wiley.\n\nPoussey\u2019s death is seen as an allegory for the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as the challenges black Americans face on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cAnd now we get to have a voice and say listen, \u2018this is the world that we live in, we\u2019re telling this story for the lost, the last, the least, the left behind, the looked over.\u2019 That\u2019s who we\u2019re telling this story for,\u201d Brooks said.", "images": ["https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=1000", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2016%2Ftv%2Fnews%2Forange-is-the-new-black-death-cast-reacts-season-4-spoiler-dead-1201809344%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1201809344&comment_count=2", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arya Roshanian"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-death-cast-reacts-season-4-spoiler-dead-1201809344/", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Cast Reacts to That Shocking Death in Season 4", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The \"Orange Is the New Black\" cast reacted to the dramatic death in season 4 in a new video.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1201809344, "author": "Arya Roshanian", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2016-07-06T13:05:38"}, "pmc-tag": "Orange Is The New Black", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Cast Reacts to That Shocking Death in Season 4", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Cast Reacts to That Shocking Death in Season 4", "url": "https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-death-cast-reacts-season-4-spoiler-dead-1201809344/", "description": "[Spoiler alert: The following post\u00a0discusses major plot points from the last two episodes\u00a0of \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d\u00a0season 4.
