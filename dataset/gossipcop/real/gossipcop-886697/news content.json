TV shows Total Divas and Total Bellas after she underwent surgery for her nearly career-ending neck injury last January, and it was a long road to recovery. She had a brief comeback in 2016, but she had her last match at Wrestlemania 33 earlier this year \u2014 after which her longtime love John Cena got down on one knee and proposed! Both Nikki and her twin sister Brie Bella \u2014 also known as the Bella Twins \u2014 are currently in retirement, and they exclusively revealed to Life & Style that watching the WWE women\u2019s matches from the sidelines has given them serious FOMO. Watch the video below to find out what the Bella Twins miss the most about wrestling after retiring from the WWE!\n\nLike Nikki, Brie is also retired from the WWE and she retired just one year before Nikki did after a career-defining match during Wrestlemania 32. Brie was open about the reason for her retirement, which was so that she could focus her energy on trying to start a family with her husband, Daniel Bryan. After struggling to concieve, she finally got pregnant with their daughter Birdie Joe, who was born in May.\n\nBut now that Brie has become a mommy, it looks like she\u2019s ready to get back in the ring with her sister \u2014 and it may be sooner than everyone thinks. The Bella Twins opened up about their plans to return to the ring at some point next year.\n\n\u201cWe miss it terribly,\u201d Brie told In Touch back in September. \u201cI think about it every day. Once you have the passion for wrestling, you can\u2019t forget it,\u201d Nikki added. \u201cI say we make our comeback in 2018, but as the Bella Twins, not individuals,\u201d Brie told Nikki and Nikki agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s a deal!\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/did-nikki-bella-retire.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Scott-Kourtney-Coparents.jpg?crop=0px%2C153px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Khloe-Kardashians-Daughter-True-Thompson-Really-Lights-Up-When-Aunt-Kylie-Jenner-Comes-Over.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C612px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cardi-B-Flaunts-Curves-and-Leaves-Little-to-the-Imagination-in-See-Through-Outfit-featured.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/john-cena-grand-entrance.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Scott-Disick-and-Sofia-Richie.jpg?crop=0px%2C62px%2C2280px%2C1294px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-22-at-12-07-19-pm.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/True-Thompson-Dream-Kardashian-Cute-Photos-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C125px%2C1080px%2C613px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Millie-Bobby-Brown-Skincare-Routine-Should-You-Try-It-Out-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-fat-jewish-emily-ratajkowski-sebastian-marriage-exclusive-feature.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/did-nikki-bella-retire.jpg?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/True-Thompson-Cutest-Photos-Selfie.jpg?crop=199px%2C0px%2C810px%2C810px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/True-Thompson-Already-Loves-Picking-Out-Her-Own-Clothes.jpg?crop=71px%2C393px%2C939px%2C531px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/shutterstock_editorial_10491194ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C179px%2C2400px%2C1360px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-Bachelor-Meet-the-Women_PP.jpg?resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/total-divas-cast-2017-alexa-bliss.png?resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/thenikkibella_84078405_2731228150290245_7074942051047440765_n.jpg?crop=0px%2C68px%2C818px%2C817px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Khloe-Kardashian-Gives-a-Little-Tour-of-True-Thompson-Sweet-Bedroom-01.jpg?crop=149px%2C47px%2C701px%2C702px&resize=90%2C90", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Admits-She-Will-\u2018Never-Come-in-Between\u2019-Tristan-and-Daughter-True-After-Scandal-pp.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1133px&resize=120%2C68", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/LS2319_cover_ns4_View.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/did-nikki-bella-retire.jpg?resize=750%2C421", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Hernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/did-nikki-bella-retire-147854/", "title": "Is Nikki Bella Retired?
