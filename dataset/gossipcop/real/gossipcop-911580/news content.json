Yes, we\u2019re talking about Zimbio\u2019s seventh annual TV Couples March Madness Challenge. The high-stakes competition is back and that means your ride-or-die TV couples (and could-be-couples) will be pitted against one another in some epic head-to-head match-ups!\n\nWho will come out on top and steal that coveted crown? Well, that\u2019s totally up to you.\n\nThe 100\u2019s Clarke and Lexa snagged the much sought-after top spot last year for their second, consecutive win. Of course, 2018 is shaping up to be more competitive than ever, so anything can happen this time around! Will Supergirl\u2019s Kara and Lena continue their impressive dominance, or will last year\u2019s beloved runners-up, Emma and Regina from Once Upon a Time, finally get their moment in the spotlight? Of course, there\u2019s always room for a surprise upset, thanks to heavy-weight couples and first-time nominees Betty and Jughead from Riverdale and Waverly and Nicole from Wynonna Earp.\n\nWhatever the outcome may be, one thing\u2019s for sure: This is going to be one hell of a competition! So grab some snacks and start building your voting den because now\u2019s the time to compete and represent your glorious fandoms, people!\n\nScroll down and click through our interactive bracket to vote, and don\u2019t forget to spread the word to help determine which of our 64 first-round teams will advance to Round 2.\n\nThe full tournament schedule is listed below.
