She gave her speech, and as she's walking off, Frances grabs Simone's hand. She has the Globe in this hand and Simone's hand in this hand and she kisses Simone's hand. And I was so blown away by that gesture,\" Johnson said.\"It was so beautiful of her, and I've been meaning, by the way, to call her and tell her, but now that I'm here, I've got to tell you, Ellen, I've got a little crush on Frances,\" Johnson added. The 'Rampage' actor joked he wants to marry McDormand and his longtime girlfriend, Lauren Hashian, with whom he is expecting his third child, also is also 'down with it'.\"Frances, we're gonna have to exchange numbers because just between you and I. I know nobody else is watching - we're getting married.\"\"It's not gonna be weird. Lauren's down with it,\" Johnson said.", "images": ["https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-320,msid-75179621,imgsize-370756,resizemode-4/75179621.jpg", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/29439462.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75192448,imgsize-,width-401,height-300/75192448.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624541,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75192199,imgsize-225390,width-401,height-300/75192199.jpg", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/34824568.cms", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/29251859.cms?width=42&height=42", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624939,imgsize-70122,width-800,height-600,resizemode-75/63624939.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624318,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193563,imgsize-667722,width-401,height-300/75193563.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75192848,imgsize-173341,width-401,height-300/75192848.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75192209,imgsize-555623,width-401,height-300/75192209.jpg", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-75122434,imgsize-487760/75122450.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193066,imgsize-504987,width-401,height-300/75193066.jpg", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-75175665,imgsize-1298224/75174741.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624393,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/29251859.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-61914123,width-91,height-128/61914123.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75193035,imgsize-555016,width-401,height-300/75193035.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/34824568.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-59770138,width-166,height-124/59770138.jpg", "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/thumb/msid-75155826,imgsize-186161/75152992.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624939,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-70122/63624939.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-61914123,width-94,height-124/61914123.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75192669,imgsize-403481,width-401,height-300/75192669.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624657,width-65,height-47.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75191620,imgsize-72210,width-401,height-300/75191620.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63624939,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-70122/63624939.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/english/hollywood/news/dwayne-johnson-jokes-he-wants-to-marry-frances-mcdormand/articleshow/63624657.cms", "title": "Dwayne Johnson jokes he wants to marry Frances McDormand", "meta_data": {"og": {"site_name": "The Times of India", "title": "Dwayne Johnson jokes he wants to marry Frances McDormand -
