Markle\u2019s appearance on Saturday in the audience at the opening ceremony may not have been what impatient royal spectators had been hoping for\u2014Markle sat with friend Markus Anderson, situated far from Harry in the arena\u2014but still technically marked their first joint appearance at an official event. (More intriguing: one of Prince Harry\u2019s personal protection officers was standing in the stairwell near Markle, which many are taking as a sign that Markle is in fact already engaged to the royal.)\n\nAnd it turns out Harry reciprocated, having visited Markle at her place of work earlier in the week. Per several outlets, though originating with a Hello! report, Harry \u201ctried to maintain a low profile\u201d as he stopped by the set of Suits to see Markle in action. \u201cHe was super low-key, met some crew, and was so happy to watch his lady,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly supportive of her work.\u201d Markle reportedly gave Harry a tour of the set, as well. (We very much want to believe Harry filmed a cameo for an upcoming Suits episode, as well, as a British lawyer on a transfer or the posh cousin of a client, or such.)\n\nHarry will remain in Toronto until Saturday, so it\u2019s very possible we are in for additional sightings and appearances for the couple, though they are also quite well-practiced at this point in doing so without being caught by photographers or otherwise creating any commotion. Though that does not mean they aren\u2019t able to carve out moments of romance when out together: royal reporter Patricia Treble noted that, on Saturday at the opening ceremony, when everyone in the audience had their eyes on the stage for the rendition of \u201cO Canada,\u201d Prince Harry \u201cturned his head and looked at Meghan Markle\u201d from across the section between them in the crowd. Treble noted, \u201cHe took advantage of a rare moment out of the spotlight. It lasted a good 10 seconds. She didn\u2019t notice. Yup, he\u2019s in love.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cfb5b609c9fb75e7139b74/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-invictus-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cfb5b58ec2206eb700440a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-invictus-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cfb5b809be4a2d59908bf6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-invictus-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/josh-duboff-square.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.b6748104d0d362745b508aebea5a86c913809200.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Duboff", "Josh Dubof"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/prince-harry-meghan-markle-suits-set-visit-toronto", "title": "Prince Harry Visited Meghan Markle on the Set of Suits in Toronto", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2", "author": "Josh Duboff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2020", "description": "The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.", "id": "59c9064adf32637fb2b91fe8", "keywords": "royals,meghan markle,prince harry", "news_keywords": "royals,meghan markle,prince harry", "robots": "index, follow", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59c9064adf32637fb2b91fe8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Prince Harry Visited Meghan Markle on the Set of \u201cSuits\u201d in Toronto", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/prince-harry-meghan-markle-suits-set-visit-toronto"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": {"src": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Prince Harry Visited Meghan Markle on the Set of \u201cSuits\u201d in Toronto"}, "fb": {"app_id": 305927716147259, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
