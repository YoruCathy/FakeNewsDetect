The May 20 Season 3 premiere of E!'s Total Bellas began addressing that question and many others.\n\nThe show started with Nikki and John settling into their new palatial residence in San Diego. Twin sister Brie Bella and Bryan Danielson (a.k.a. Daniel Bryan) are also settling back in California with their baby Birdie. The more Nikki (a.k.a. Auntie Coco) sees Birdie grow, she feels a connection and yearning to become a mom. John, whose career has never been hotter, remains steadfast against the idea of becoming a dad.\n\nIt\u2019s something Nikki began accepting, but she is hinting toward the opposite. By the way John was reacting even near Birdie it\u2019s hard to picture him in the parental role. But if there is one thing John apparently can't get enough of is rugs. He loves those. Never question a rug man. It\u2019s revealed that Nikki put her dream wedding plans on the back burner to make John happy with nuptials taking place in John\u2019s hometown of West Newberry, Massachusetts.\n\nBrie is surprised sis would not do it in Napa Valley and Wine Country. To her, it\u2019s another example of Nikki sacrificing so much for John. She shows her feelings more with the feeling Nikki walks on eggshells around John for fear he will change his mind about getting married. Nikki also doesn\u2019t want to live through the nightmare of being Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, left at the altar by Mr. Big.\n\nThen comes the \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d when Nikki\u2019s family came over to see the new place. Discussion comes up about Brie and if she would return to the ring despite being a mom and all her other commitments. Earlier in the show the consummate businesswomen found it was hard to catch moments like Birdie\u2019s first ride on the carousel and swim lessons while she is away at photo shoots or meetings.\n\nSee Also 10 WWE Couples Who Found Lasting Love & Marriage These Superstars of the ring put a ring on it and said, 'I do.'\n\nSister-in-law Lola talked of being fulfilled being a mother to Vivienne. Cut to Nikki who appears uncomfortable by the topic as a reminder of what she is missing out on with a life with John. She revealed during the confessional interview that through the entire engagement thus far out of around six months, they\u2019ve shared a bed really 30 to 40 days. Despite the fancy houses, Nikki feels alone.\n\nAfter watching Total Bellas there were signs pointing to the recent events. However, John and Nikki have not given up on each other while speaking about their relationship on the media trail. They were also spotted together the last few days in San Diego.\n\nBack to the dinner, we do see some change with John\u2019s OCD nature. He allows the family to wear shoes indoors and didn\u2019t freak out after Daniel spilled water all over his suit. Would he had been as cool if it was wine or landed on one of his beloved rugs?\n\nWe don\u2019t know, but he made it clear that the home was open and free of any rules. That\u2019s some major progress.\n\nAnd maybe potential proof that John is willing to change and win Nikki back?\n\nTotal Bellas, Sundays, 9/8c, E!", "images": ["https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/best-lines-april-17-234x155.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Triple-H-and-Stephanie-McMahon-234x155.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner2.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner3.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19587797&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/logo-tvinsider.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/comfort-tv-logo.gif?x=1", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo-footer.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/TOtalBellas4-1014x570.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/one-world-together-at-home-full-cover-304x195.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/TotalBellas2-1014x570.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GettyImages-941622478-234x155.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tvi-white.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner1-38x32.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-sRxQ0qKU4hQu4.gif", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/OnDISH_Mini-Logo.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner6.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/totalbellas1-1014x570.jpg", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/partner4.png", "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/whats-on.png"], "top_img": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/totalbellas1-1014x570.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Fishman", "Tv Insider Staff", "Samantha Bergeson", "Paige Strout", "Jim Halterman", "Lauren Schuster"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvinsider.com/690992/total-bellas-season-3-premiere-john-cena-nikki-bella/", "title": "'Total Bellas' Season 3 Premiere Offered Glimmers of Hope for John Cena & Nikki Bella (RECAP)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "it2r-MRipevefeCYWkPlW540pNwHDj9JpbST3-LAA-o", "pocket-site-verification": "c2d9d3d73032bf0b0959f31688efb2", "fb": {"pages": 112199118797264, "app_id": 2128917200700396}, "og": {"site_name": "TV Insider", "description": "We learned what went wrong with the WWE power couple's relationship, but also that it might yet be saved.", "url": "https://www.tvinsider.com/690992/total-bellas-season-3-premiere-john-cena-nikki-bella/", "title": "'Total Bellas' Season 3 Premiere Offered Glimmers of Hope for John Cena & Nikki Bella (RECAP)", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/totalbellas1-1014x570.jpg", "width": 1014, "height": 570}}, "theme-color": "#00aeef", "title": "'Total Bellas' Season 3 Premiere Offered Glimmers of Hope for John Cena & Nikki Bella (RECAP)", "description": "We learned what went wrong with the WWE power couple's relationship, but also that it might yet be saved.", "author": "Scott Fishman", "twitter": {"site": "@tvinsider", "url": "https://www.tvinsider.com/690992/total-bellas-season-3-premiere-john-cena-nikki-bella/", "title": "'Total Bellas' Season 3 Premiere Offered Glimmers of Hope for John Cena & Nikki Bella (RECAP)", "creator": "@tvinsider", "description": "We learned what went wrong with the WWE power couple's relationship, but also that it might yet be saved.", "image": "https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/totalbellas1-1014x570.jpg?450", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.tvinsider.com", "summary": ""}
