While I occasionally answer reader questions, it is not a daily function of this blog. ****\n\nPlenty of black men leave their families behind like trash in a dump, but it\u2019s not something the colored woman do. We\u2019ve got the kids to think about \u2013 Minny Jackson (Pg 311)\n\n\u201cYou is kind, you is smart. You is important.\u201d Mae Mobley (Pg 443)\n\nThey are scared, looking at the back door every ten minutes, afraid they\u2019ll get caught talking to me. Afraid they\u2019ll be beaten like Louvenia\u2019s grandson, or, hell, bludgeoned in their front yard like Medgar Evers.* (Pg 277 *error in the book. Medgar Evers was shot, not bludgeoned. The novel even has the character of Minny stating Evers\u2019 was shot)\n\nI might as well be Little Stevie Wonder I am so blinded by that dress \u2013 Minny Jackson (Pg 317)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about you. You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re pretty, you\u2019re\u2026tall.\u201d Stuart Whitworth, the state senator\u2019s son to Skeeter, his date (Pg 171)\n\n\u201cI hope you write someting really good. Something you believe in\u201d \u2013Stuart Whitworth speaking to Skeeter (Pg 171)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the Home Help Sanitation Initiative- \u201d Hilly Holbrook (Pg 60)\n\n\u201cA bill that requires every white home to have a separate bathroom for the colored help. I\u2019ve even notified the surgeon general of Mississippi to see if he\u2019ll endorse the idea.\u201d Hilly Holbrook (Pg 9)\n\n\u201cWhat you think I am? A chauffeur? I ain\u2019t driving you to no country club in the pouring rain.\u201d \u2013 Minny Jackson (Pg 17)\n\n\u201cAre you\u2026do you find \u2026find men attractive? Are you having unnatural thoughts about\u2026girls or-or women?\u201d \u2013Charlotte Phelan (Pg 75)\n\nI am neither thrilled nor disappointed by the news that they might let a colored man into Ole Miss, just surprised. \u2013 Skeeter (Pg 83)\n\n\u201cI say \u2018 That good vanilla from Mexico\u2019 and then I go head. I tell her what else I put in that pie for her.\u201d Minny revealing the Terrible Awful secret to Miss Celia (Pg 339)\n\n\u201cMother, I want to be with girls as much as you\u2019d like to be with \u2026Jameso.\u201d Skeeter (Pg 75)\n\n\u201cAll these houses they\u2019re building without maid\u2019s quarters? It\u2019s just plain dangerous. Everybody knows they carry different kinds of diseases than we do.\u201d Hilly Holbrook (Pg eight)\n\nAnd Miss Skeeter asking don\u2019t I want to change things, like changing Jackson, Mississippi, gone be like changing a lightbulb. \u2013 Aibileen (Pg 24)\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t hit you Minny, who knows what you become.\u201d Leroy to Minny (Pg 413)\n\nI told him don\u2019t drink coffee or he gone turn colored. He say he still ain\u2019t drunk a cup a coffee and he twenty-one years old. It\u2019s always nice to see the kids grown up fine. (Aibileen Pg 91)\n\nYule May easy to recognize from the back cause she got such good hair, smooth, no nap to it. (Pg 208)\n\n\u201cWe was all surprised Constantine would go and\u2026 get herself in a family way. Some folks at church wasn\u2019t so kind about it, especially when the baby come out white. Even though the father was black as me.\u201d Aibileen to Skeeter (Pg 358)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m ashamed. Sometimes, Senator. Ashamed of what goes on in Mississippi.\u201d Carlton Phelan Skeeter\u2019s father (Pg 268)\n\n\u201cI told Shirley Boon her ass won\u2019t fit on no stool at Woolworth\u2019s anyway.\u201d Minny (Pg 217)\n\n\u201cAnd then they dropped him off at the colored hospital. That\u2019s what the nurse told me, who was standing outside. They rolled him off the truck bed and the white men drove away.\u201d Aibileen to Skeeter (Pg 153)\n\n\u201cYou know, its no wonder Stuart Whitworth dropped you.\u201d Hilly talking to Skeeter. (Pg 280)\n\nWhat would Constantine think of me? Skeeter (Pg 281)\n\n\u201cRemember I told you Constantine had a daughter. Well, Lulabelle was her name. Law, she come out pale as snow. Grew hair the color a hay. Not curly like yours. Straight it was.\u201d Aibileen to Skeeter (Pg 358)\n\n\u201cShe looked white as anybody, and she knew it too.\u201d Charlotte Phelan talking to Skeeter about Lulabelle, Constantine\u2019s now fully grown daughter. (Pg 362)\n\n\u201cI told Lulabelle the truth. I told her, \u201cYour daddy didn\u2019t die. He left the day after you were born. And your mama hadn\u2019t been sick a day in her life. She gave you up because you were too high yellow. She didn\u2019t want you.\u201d Charlotte Phelan to Sketter (Pg 364)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same with Pascagoula here, is it?\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d I say.

You only get one a lifetime.\u201d\n\nI nod, thinking I should write that down. But of course, include it in the book. But of course its too late, it\u2019s already been mailed. There\u2019s nothing I can do, nothing any of us can do now, except wait for what\u2019s coming. Charlotte Phelan speaking with Skeeter (Pg 372)\n\n\u201cGo shopping\u2026get some new clothes. Go do whatever white women do when the maid\u2019s home.\u201d Minny speaking to Miss Celia (Pg 51)\n\n\u201cCat got on the porch this morning, bout gave me a cadillac arrest thinking it was Mister Johnny.\u201d Minny (Pg 48)\n\n\u201cSay maybe she getting mal-nutritious.\u201d Aibileen to Minny, (Pg 14)\n\n\u201cThat ugly white fool\u201d Minny (Pg 292)\n\n\u201cI got me a knife!\u201d Minny (Pg 307)\n\n\u201cI never thought Constantine would go to Illinois with her, Eugenia.

(Pg 428)\n\nShe roll her eyes and stick her tongue out like I handed her a plate a dog biscuits. \u201cI knew you was getting senile,\u201d she say. Aibileen, noting Minny\u2019s expression before she answers. (Pg 430)\n\n\u201cWho taught you those things, Mae Mobley?\u201d Mister Leefolt say and Baby Girl whip her head around with eyes like she seed a ghost. Aibileen watching Raleigh Leefolt speak to Mae Mobley (Pg 431)\n\nMy mouth drop open. Why she never tell me this before? \u201cYou saying people think I got the black magic?\u201d Aibileen speaking to Minny (Pg 24)\n\n\u201cPlease. Find you another colored maid. A young\u2019un. Somebody. . .else.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know any others well enough.\u201d I am tempted to bring up the word friends, but I\u2019m not that na\u00efve. I know we\u2019re not friends. (Skeeter speaking with Aibileen Pg 109)\n\nHe black. Blacker than me.
