The next step was, \u2018You\u2019re going to arrive somewhere with your eyes open and you are going to leave with your eyes closed\u2019. I couldn\u2019t take the pain every day,\u201d Depp told rollingstone.com, recalling his emotional state in the midst of his failed marriage and his simultaneously collapsing financial situation.\n\nDepp had a highly publicised divorce from actress Amber Heard, which was finalised in August 2016, following a legal battle. After Heard\u2019s allegations of spousal abuse, which Depp has vehemently denied -- his legal troubles continued to spiral.\n\nIn January 2017, Depp sued his former business managers, Joel and Robert Mandel of The Management Group (TMG), claiming they mishandled his money and cost him millions.\n\nThe pair subsequently countersued and claimed Depp was the one who spent all his own money on extravagances. In their countersuit, TMG claimed that Depp spent $30,000 a month on just wine, and even had a sound engineer on his payroll to feed him lines while shooting his films, so he wouldn\u2019t have to learn them.\n\nDepp claims it isn\u2019t because he doesn\u2019t want to memorise a script. Rather, it\u2019s the engineer\u2019s job to play him specific sounds to allow his to convey emotions with his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got bagpipes, a baby crying and bombs going off. It creates a truth. Some of my biggest heroes were in silent film... It had to be behind the eyes. And my feeling is, that if there\u2019s no truth behind the eyes, doesn\u2019t matter what the f**king words are,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his wine budget, Depp said, \u201cIt\u2019s insulting to say I spent $30,000 on wine. Because it was far more,\u201d he said.\n\n(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.
