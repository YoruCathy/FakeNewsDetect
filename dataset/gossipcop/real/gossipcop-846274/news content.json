Following Jolie\u2019s divorce filing in September, the two engaged in a bitter custody battle before eventually smoothing things out. How did they go from enemies to friends in such a short time?\n\nAccording to E! News, things went downhill after Pitt was accused of child abuse stemming from an incident on a private plane with his oldest son, Maddox. The allegations created a lot of buzz in the media and led to an investigation by the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services. Pitt was also accused of having a drinking problem and cheating on Jolie with Marion Cotillard, his co-star on the film Allied.\n\nAlthough the failed marriage appeared shockingly sudden, inside sources claimed the couple had been experiencing issues for a long time.\n\nAngelina Jolie with Pax, Maddox and Zahara in Cambodia on February 18, 2017.

They would take some time apart, go on location, calm down and miss each other,\u201d an insider shared. \u201cBut, no matter how bad it got, Brad, especially, was never planning on walking away. Every so often, Angelina threatened divorce, but in Brad\u2019s eyes, their lives were stressful because they were raising six kids, things were always going to work out.\u201d\n\nPitt was eventually cleared of the abuse allegations, but not before suffering significant damage to his public image. To make matters worse, the two were fighting a nasty custody battle that granted Pitt only supervised visits with his six children. The situation didn\u2019t turn around until 2016 came to a close.\n\nJolie was spotted in Cambodia promoting her film, First They Killed My Father, in February. The actress took all six children for the trip and finally talked about the split for the first time. In her emotional interview, Jolie admitted that the breakup had been hard on the family but assured everyone that they were working things out.\n\nBrad Pitt poses with his children Pax, Shiloh, and Maddox along with parents Jane and William Pitt.

I\u2019m coping with finding a way through to make sure this somehow makes us stronger and closer,\u201d she said.\n\nFollowing Jolie\u2019s telling interview, insiders revealed that Brad Pitt was actually in Cambodia with the kids while Jolie was promoting the film. The actor secretly traveled to the country so that he could spend time with the brood, signaling a major shift in his relationship with Jolie.\n\n\u201cThey have made some progress and are taking small steps in the right direction.
