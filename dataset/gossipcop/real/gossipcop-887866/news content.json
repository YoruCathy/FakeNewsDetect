The singer says her first encounter with drinking and partying was in high school, but it all escalated during her Disney Channel days. \u201cI loved it,\u201d she recalls of her past drug use, starting at age 17.\n\n\u201cI felt out of control the first time I did it. My dad was an addict and an alcoholic. Guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol because it fulfilled him and he chose that over a family,\u201d Lovato says.\n\nThe Grammy nominee has been vocal about her struggles with addiction, receiving inpatient treatment for the first time in 2011 after punching her backup dancer Alex \u201cShorty\u201d Welch, who outed her for using Adderall during the Colombian leg of the Camp Rock 2 Tour. The incident led to a two-month \u201cbender\u201d when Lovato was \u201cusing daily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just came to a breaking point; the next 12 months were extremely difficult,\u201d she says about entering treatment at 18. However, relapsing was imminent.\n\n\u201cI was using while I had a sober companion and I went through like 20 sober companions. I was either craving drugs or on drugs. I was not easy to work with,\u201d she recalls of life post-treatment. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to look back at the person that I was.\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Everything Demi Lovato Has Said About Her Sobriety Journey\n\nImage zoom Demi Lovato/Youtube\n\n\u201cI Was Helping Her Back to Being the Demi We Love\u201d\n\nMany of Lovato\u2019s loved ones helped her get to the sober lifestyle she leads today, including Nick Jonas, who costarred in the Camp Rock franchise from 2008 \u2013 2010 and experienced the Disney Channel era alongside her when they were both 15.\n\n\u201cIt was actually the Jonas Brothers waving the flag, and saw Demi veering in a different direction,\u201d Lovato\u2019s manager John Taylor says of her drug and alcohol abuse.\n\n\u201cWhile we were on tour Demi and Joe\u2019s relationship had become really complicated so I was playing the bridge,\u201d Nick, 25, admits about his 28-year-old brother\u2019s brief romance with Lovato, who says she \u201cfriggin\u2019 fell in love with [Joe], in real life,\u201d though the courtship only lasted \u201clike a month or two.\u201d\n\nNick continues, \u201cIt became really good you know between she and I for a while and growing closer than we\u2019ve ever been. I remember thinking in my head I felt a bit of pride about it, like selfishly maybe I was helping her back to being the Demi we know and love. She\u2019s not going to do anything crazy, she\u2019ll be fine and then this episode happened.\u201d (The \u201cepisode\u201d Nick refers to is Lovato\u2019s punching incident, which Kevin Jonas Sr. had to step in and supervise.)\n\nMike Bayer, who is Lovato\u2019s personal-development coach and founder of Cast Centers, remembers the lowest point in her downward spiral when her management team threatened to walk away if things didn\u2019t change for the better. \u201cThe most important fear to Demi is losing people, is losing people that she cares about and that love her. That\u2019s the most important thing to Demi,\u201d Bayer tells viewers.\n\nOn the act of surrender in recovery, Lovato remembers: \u201cThat\u2019s when the change is going to happen.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Demi Lovato/Instagram\n\n\u201cMy Heart Is Always with Wilmer\u201d\n\nThe pop star and the That \u201970s Show alum, 37, announced on Instagram in June 2016 that they had ended their relationship after almost six \u201cloving and wonderful\u201d years together, but the love she has for Valderrama has yet to fade.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never loved anybody like I loved Wilmer and I still love him,\u201d Lovato tells viewers, even sharing the exact date she first laid eyes on the actor. \u201cI met him on Jan. 11, 2010. I thought \u2018I have to have him,\u2019 but I was only 17 and he was like, \u2018Get away from me,'\u201d she jokes, though she adds: \u201cWhen I turned 18 we started dating. I think it was love at first sight, we connected on a level that I\u2019ve never connected with anybody before, he was just my rock, my everything.\u201d\n\nAnd for the first time, Lovato dissects the breakup and gives insight into why they split.\n\n\u201cThe sparks never faded but there are issues that I haven\u2019t conquered yet that I know I won\u2019t conquer if I\u2019m relying on somebody else to take care of the loneliness. I just wasn\u2019t ready and there was so much in my life that I hadn\u2019t explored yet \u2026 That was one of the reasons why we broke up because I\u2019ve never been alone,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt had nothing to do with falling out of love, we decided together we just probably are better as friends.\u201c\n\nEven still, there are times when Lovato thinks what if. \u201cI do have moments where it\u2019s late at night and I\u2019m lonely and I wonder if I made the right decision because love is a gamble. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll lose him for the rest of my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI think my heart is always with Wilmer, I think it was with Wilmer, I think it is with Wilmer, I think it will be. Because you don\u2019t share six years with somebody and not give them a piece of your heart and vice versa. I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m not going to meet anybody that compares to him but I\u2019m trying to keep an open heart and open mind when it comes to that.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Demi Lovato/Youtube\n\n\u201cFood Is Still the Biggest Challenge in My Life\u201d\n\nThough Lovato is extremely proud of abstaining from drugs and alcohol for nearly six years, she has yet to effectively treat her eating disorder.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in a relationship with Wilmer I went three years without purging and when we broke up that\u2019s one of the first things I did,\u201d she admits to manager and confidant Phil McIntyre. \u201cThe less I have to think about food, the easier it is to go about having a normal life and I don\u2019t want to let anybody down so when I do have moments when I slip up, I feel very ashamed. What started the relapse was missing Wilmer. And when I feel lonely my heart feels hungry and I end up binging.\u201d\n\nLovato traces back her struggles with food to her childhood\n\n\u201cThe food came first, when I was 8 years old and my little sister was born, a lot of the attention was taken off me and onto my little sister,\u201d she says of sibling Madison de la Garza. \u201cI had started working at that time and was under a lot of stress so I would bake cookies for my family and I would eat all of them and nobody would have any to eat. That was my first memory of food being that medicine for me.\u201d\n\nFast forward to the present, Lovato confesses \u201cfood is still the biggest challenge in my life\u201d though she does not disclose the date of her latest purge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give it the power that it controls my every thought but it\u2019s something that I\u2019m constantly thinking about,\u201d she says. \u201cBody image, what I wish I could be eating, what I wish I could be eating next, what I wish I didn\u2019t eat, you know it\u2019s just constant. I get envious towards people who don\u2019t struggle with an eating disorder because I think my life would be so much easier.\u201d\n\nImage zoom\n\n\u201cI Am on a Dating App with Both Men and Girls\u201d\n\nDuring a fitting, Lovato tells her stylist Avo Yermagyan that she has been using the secret and exclusive dating app Raya, which is nicknamed the Tinder for Illuminati and the famous person\u2019s Listserv.\n\n\u201cI am on a dating app with both men and girls,\u201d she says. \u201cI am open to human connection so whether that\u2019s through a male or female, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. \u2026 I do like athletes, there is something sexy about someone putting in all of their physical strength into their passion.\u201c\n\nThe star relates to her Lovatics fandom when she talks about first-date jitters and playing mind games and power plays with crushes over text. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain stigma around women having casual sex and for me, I feel it\u2019s my body, it\u2019s my choice. It\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s a connection with somebody and it\u2019s fun,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd to future suitors, Lovato warns: \u201cWhen I\u2019m comfortable in my own skin, I feel confident and when I feel confident, I feel sexy and when I feel sexy, watch out.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Dennis Leupold\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Learning How to Be a Voice and Not a Victim\u201d\n\nSimply Complicated is merely a chapter in Lovato\u2019s lifestyle of being an open book. She\u2019s just 25 after all, but she\u2019s already lived through a lot.\n\n\u201cLooking back it was hard on anyone, let alone a kid,\u201d Lovato says of growing up in the spotlight. Manager McIntyre chimes in: \u201cLooking back at it, I could connect the dots and see that there was an immense amount of pressure. She was living two lives. Here she was squeaky clean on the Disney Channel, all types of moral clauses and just intensity around behavior. Once the camera stops rolling she\u2019s living another life she couldn\u2019t really be herself she couldn\u2019t be a normal teenager.\u201c\n\nFrom booking Camp Rock at 15 to confronting demons with addiction and living with mental illness, Lovato doesn\u2019t need a documentary to remember what she\u2019s overcome.\n\n\u201cThe last decade has taught me a lifetime of lessons. I\u2019ve learned that secrets make you sick, I\u2019m learning how to be a voice and not a victim, I\u2019ve learned sex is natural, I\u2019ve learned that love is necessary, heartbreak is unavoidable and loneliness is brutal. I\u2019ve learned that the key to being happy is to tell your truth, and be okay without all the answers,\u201d she says.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-2-2000-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-1-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-3-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-prem-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F06%2Fdemi-lovato.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-21.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2Fmaps-2-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fnick-jonas-2000-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-highlights/", "title": "Demi Lovato Documentary Highlights: Drug Addiction, Heartbreak, Eating Disorder", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Demi Lovato,Health,Music News,News,Rehab", "news_keywords": "Demi Lovato,Health,Music News,News,Rehab", "description": "The star\u2019s new documentary\u00a0provides an in-depth look at her career trajectory\u00a0through never-before-seen home videos and candid talks", "og": {"title": "Demi Lovato Documentary Highlights: Drug Addiction, Heartbreak, Eating Disorder", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-highlights/", "description": "Demi Lovato&nbsp;has always been honest with her fans, but the singer has never been more real about the first quarter of her life \u2014 until&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-highlights/", "description": "The star\u2019s new documentary\u00a0provides an in-depth look at her career trajectory\u00a0through never-before-seen home videos and candid talks", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-highlights/", "title": "Demi Lovato Documentary Highlights: Drug Addiction, Heartbreak, Eating Disorder", "description": "The star\u2019s new documentary\u00a0provides an in-depth look at her career trajectory\u00a0through never-before-seen home videos and candid talks", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2017%2F10%2Fdemi-lovato-1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
