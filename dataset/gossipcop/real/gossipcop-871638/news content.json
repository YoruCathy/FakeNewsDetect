It's also about protecting other planets and moons from our germs as we responsibly explore the Solar System,\" Dr. James L Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, wrote.\n\nGreen also wrote that he hopes Davis continues to study and do well in school, and hopes to see him at NASA in the future.\n\n", "images": ["https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/jack-davis-nasa-letters.jpg?resize=1200%2C675", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/GettyImages-1219262470.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1024px%2C576px&resize=850%2C478", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/goodnews2-apr17.jpg?resize=850%2C478", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_On_Dark@3x-2.png?fit=132%2C120", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_On_Light@3x.png?fit=132%2C120"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/jack-davis-nasa-letters.jpg?resize=1200%2C675", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/nasa-responds-to-9-year-old-guardian-of-the-galaxys-job-application/20994/", "title": "NASA Responds to 9-Year-Old \u2018Guardian of the Galaxy\u2019s\u2019 Job Application", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Los Angeles", "type": "article", "description": "A self-proclaimed \u201cGuardian of the Galaxy\u201d received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.", "title": "NASA Responds to 9-Year-Old \u2018Guardian of the Galaxy\u2019s\u2019 Job Application", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/nasa-responds-to-9-year-old-guardian-of-the-galaxys-job-application/2029870/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/jack-davis-nasa-letters.jpg?resize=1200%2C675"}, "google-site-verification": "sWoyPxGwXLtX91VCyKxKQiQ_kRCPHsj_VIIRq7VdZsw", "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "twitter": {"site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "description": "A self-proclaimed \u201cGuardian of the Galaxy\u201d received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.", "title": "NASA Responds to 9-Year-Old \u2018Guardian of the Galaxy\u2019s\u2019 Job Application", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/nasa-responds-to-9-year-old-guardian-of-the-galaxys-job-application/2029870/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/jack-davis-nasa-letters.jpg?resize=1200%2C675"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "description": "A self-proclaimed \u201cGuardian of the Galaxy\u201d received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.", "sailthru.title": "NASA Responds to 9-Year-Old \u2018Guardian of the Galaxy\u2019s\u2019 Job Application", "sailthru.description": "A self-proclaimed \u201cGuardian of the Galaxy\u201d received an out of this world response from NASA after applying for a position with the space agency.", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-05T05:05:56+00:00", "taboola_lead": "video", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/cropped-NBC_LA.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501909556.0, "source": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com", "summary": ""}
