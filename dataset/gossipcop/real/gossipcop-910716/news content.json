Heigl joins the Suits ensemble alongside Macht, Sarah Rafferty (Donna Paulsen), Rick Hoffman (Louis Litt) and new series regular Dul\u00e9 Hill (Alex Williams).\n\n\u201cJoining Suits was the perfect organic way to not only collaborate with an EP I admire deeply, but to also become part of a show and cast that I am an immense fan of,\u201d shared Heigl. \u201cI have watched Suits from the very beginning and feel incredibly lucky to be the newest member of the Pearson Specter Litt family.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Patrick J. Adams on Leaving Suits: Mike Ross Has Taught Me the Power of Believing in Myself\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire Suits team, I am extraordinarily excited to welcome Katherine Heigl into our family -- I have always been a big fan of her work and was delighted to discover she was an avid Suits fan herself,\u201d expressed Aaron Korsh, creator and executive producer of Suits. \u201cI cannot wait to have her come play with our entire cast and crew. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Harvey, Louis, Donna, and Alex as the mysterious Samantha Wheeler is a direct threat to their status quo. One thing is for sure -- Samantha's wit, charm, loyalty, strength, and vulnerability will all be put to the test as she muscles her way into the firm currently known as Pearson Specter Litt.\u201d\n\nSeason 8 of Suits begins production this April in Toronto. Season 7 resumes this spring, with new episodes premiering on USA Wednesday, Mar. 28 at 9/8c!\n\nCount down to the Suits premiere with the official Louis Litt 2018 Calendar.
