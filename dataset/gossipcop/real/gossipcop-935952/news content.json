She doesn\u2019t scrutinize his choices or who he dates.\u201d The source revealed that Chris has not introduced Dakota to Moses and Apple, his kids with Gwyneth.\n\nThe GOOP mogul considers Chris and Brad part of her \"modern family,\" and recently photographed the two men together at brunch. Soon, we might see a table of four or even a party of six.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/blog-post--mobile/public/field_blog_image/2018/01/personal-space-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson.jpg?itok=htGXIHnG&timestamp=1517421991", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/scale--1800/public/2017/01/refresh_personalspace_3000x800.png?itok=p_hT2JOp&timestamp=1485473711", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/personal-space-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2016/09/personal-space-gwyneth-paltrow.jpg?itok=2As6d-_s&timestamp=1473431652", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/all/modules/custom/common_site/images/transp-bg-60-black.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/microsite-logo--mobile-1_5x/public/2017/04/verticals-white-personalspace.png?itok=Yvysn4kX&timestamp=1492116909", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/related-posts--computer/public/field_blog_image/2018/01/personal-space-gwyneth-paltrow-brad-falchuk-engaged.jpg?itok=6k4SkwNq&timestamp=1515428861"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/personal-space-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tamara Palmer"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443/http://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/gwyneth-paltrow-approves-of-dakota-johnson-dating-chris-martin", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Is Consciously Cool About Dakota Johnson Dating Her Ex-Husband", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "vertical_name": "Personal Space", "fb": {"app_id": 1592250694320227}, "og": {"site_name": "Bravo TV Official Site", "type": "article", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Is Consciously Cool About Dakota Johnson Dating Her Ex-Husband", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443/http://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/gwyneth-paltrow-approves-of-dakota-johnson-dating-chris-martin", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u00a0finally just admitted that she's engaged to\u00a0her boyfriend of three years,\u00a0Glee\u00a0co-creator Brad Falchuk, and she's giving her ex-husband's blossoming new romance a thumbs up.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/personal-space-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bravotv", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/personal-space/gwyneth-paltrow-approves-of-dakota-johnson-dating-chris-martin", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Is Consciously Cool About Dakota Johnson Dating Her Ex-Husband", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow\u00a0finally just admitted that she's engaged to\u00a0her boyfriend of three years,\u00a0Glee\u00a0co-creator Brad Falchuk, and she's giving her ex-husband's blossoming new romance a thumbs up.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205044443im_/http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/personal-space-paltrow-chris-martin-dakota-johnson.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-31T13:08:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-31T13:08:59-05:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517422139.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
