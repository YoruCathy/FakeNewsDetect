Sharing some pictures and videos from her Friday night, Nicki can be seen mingling with Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott, Kourtney Kardashian, and Quavo in one clip, with her new Young Thug collaboration \"Anybody\" blasting in the background. Most notable of this assortment of guests is Quavo, who Nicki had just aired her grievances with regarding the drama around \"Motorsport\" Thursday. As she explained today, the two have since made amends, possibly at this very event.\n\nBut back to the squads -- later on, Nicki only expanded the large assortment of famous friends she was partying with, taking a picture with The Weeknd, Nav, Belly, French Montana, and most surprisingly, Canadian country star Shania Twain. \"@shaniatwain is so dope in real life,\" she captioned the pic. On top of that, The Weeknd shared his own picture of the same gathering of familiar faces, which revealed Call Me By Your Name star Timothee Chalamet smiling at the back.\n\nThe Weeknd, of course, headlined day one of the festival. You can watch highlights from his performance, including a stripped-down take on \"Call Out Your Name,\" here.\n\nNicki Minaj is fresh off of dropping two brand new singles \"Chun-Li\" and \"Barbie Tingz.\" Her long-awaited fourth studio album is expected later this year.
