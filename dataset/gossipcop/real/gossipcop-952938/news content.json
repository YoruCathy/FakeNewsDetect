Her number hasn\u2019t changed and they haven\u2019t bounced back,\u201d he said of Meghan, who is expecting a baby with husband Prince Harry in the spring. \u201cI\u2019ve pleaded with her to pick up the phone. I wrote her a two-page letter and sent it by certified mail via her representative in Los Angeles. I asked her why she was believing the lies.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Christmas at Kensington Palace!

In September, Doria tagged along when Meghan hosted a palace lunch for the first time, and she may also celebrate Christmas with the royal family after reportedly being invited by the Queen.\n\nAfter publicly wavering on the decision, Thomas did not attend Meghan\u2019s wedding in May, citing heart problems. In his absence, Prince Charles stepped in and walked Meghan down the aisle after she \u201csadly\u201d confirmed days before the nuptials that Thomas would not be attending the wedding as originally planned.\n\nThomas has since made controversial statements about his daughter, such as declaring that Meghan seemed \u201cterrified\u201d of her new duties in July and comparing the royal family to a \u201ccult\u201d in August. Also that month, Thomas admitted that he lied to Harry about staged paparazzi photos as the couple was preparing for their special day.\n\n\u201cIt was very wearing on her,\u201d a source told PEOPLE in September of the family drama that preceded the nuptials. \u201cIt\u2019s her private life.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Meghan Markle and father Thomas Markle Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images; Good Morning Britain/ITV\n\nThomas suggested that the conflict has been wearing on him, too. \u201cMy life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry,\u201d he told The Mail on Sunday. \u201cTheir treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I\u2019m being punished for things I didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nIn the new interview, Thomas asserted that he and Meghan had a good relationship before she became a duchess.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to rewrite history,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cMeghan and I were as close as a father and daughter could be right up until her wedding to Harry. Then it all fell apart.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Doria Ragland, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty\n\nHe pointed to the cards that Meghan used to send him. \u201cI loved getting cards from Meghan,\u201d he said. \u201cShe wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I\u2019ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, \u2018I love you Daddy.\u2019 I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nThomas told The Mail on Sunday that \u201cmaybe\u201d he will get to see Meghan again \u201csome day.\u201d\n\nThomas also spoke about his upcoming grandchild after saying in October that he considered Meghan\u2019s pregnancy \u201coverwhelming and joyful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.\u201d\n\nHe touched on reports that Kate Middleton and Meghan have feuded, which Kensington Palace has denied. PEOPLE previously confirmed that Kate was \u201cleft in tears\u201d following a fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte\u2018s bridesmaid dress ahead of Meghan\u2019s wedding.\n\nRELATED: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Secretly Snuck in a Christmas Celebration to Their Royal Duties\n\nImage zoom Meghan Markle with father Thomas Markle when she was a baby Source: Meghan Markle/Instagram\n\nA source told veteran royals reporter Camilla Tominey of The Daily Telegraph, \u201cKate had only just given birth to Prince Louis and was feeling quite emotional\u201d \u2014 though just what upset her is unclear. Several insiders have told PEOPLE that there was a notable amount of \u201cstress\u201d surrounding those involved in the wedding.\n\n\u201cThe Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cShe was always demanding but never rude.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fmeghan-markle-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fmeghan-markle-2000.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fmegahn-markle-6.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F10%2Fmeghan-thomas-markle-1-2000c-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmeghan-markle-15.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fmeghan-markle-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Zauzmer"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-thomas-doria-ragland-letter-not-speaking-letter/", "title": "Thomas Markle Asked Why Meghan 'Won't Speak to Me'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "British Royals,Doria Ragland,Meghan Markle,News,Royal News", "news_keywords": "British Royals,Doria Ragland,Meghan Markle,News,Royal News", "description": "Thomas Markle tells The Mail on Sunday that he \"even hand-delivered a letter.\"", "og": {"title": "Thomas Markle Says He Wrote to Doria Ragland Asking Why Daughter Meghan 'Won't Speak to Me'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-thomas-doria-ragland-letter-not-speaking-letter/", "description": "On the outs with daughter&nbsp;Meghan Markle, Thomas Markle&nbsp;had hoped her mother Doria Ragland&nbsp;could shed some light on the situation, he said in a new interview&hellip;", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fmeghan-markle-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1047}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-thomas-doria-ragland-letter-not-speaking-letter/", "description": "Thomas Markle tells The Mail on Sunday that he \"even hand-delivered a letter.\"", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fmeghan-markle-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-thomas-doria-ragland-letter-not-speaking-letter/", "title": "Thomas Markle Says He Wrote to Doria Ragland Asking Why Daughter Meghan 'Won't Speak to Me'", "description": "Thomas Markle tells The Mail on Sunday that he \"even hand-delivered a letter.\"", "site": "@people", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F12%2Fmeghan-markle-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "755183be01bfc739a9cac6673f1f2c1b"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
