Baby items are also included in the sale.\n\n\n\nBids for the pieces start at just $1.00 and the auction will run until February 25.\n\nKardashian, who recently welcomed her third child with husband Kanye West via surrogate, has been a longtime supporter of the hospital, and last year, she opened up about why she gives her time to the facility.\n\n\"You know, this hospital is really important to me,\" she said at the Make March Matter campaign event. \"I've actually had friends that have had their babies here and I've spent, you know, weeks on end with them visiting them.\"\n\n\"My family and I always love to come here and throughout the year, just try to pop in and put a smile on your kids' faces or, more importantly, the families that are struggling so hard to still work and take care of them and not wanting to leave their children by themselves,\" she continued. \"So anything we can do, and my family can do, we love being a part of this community and helping out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also previously explained she wanted to get involved because she knows what it is like having to be in the hospital with a loved one for a significant amount of time after losing her father, Robert Kardashian, to cancer in 2003.\n\n\"I remember what it was like when my dad was going through it,\" she told Variety in 2015. \"You see the kids that are so strong. They feel so helpless. You want to do anything to help them.\"", "images":
