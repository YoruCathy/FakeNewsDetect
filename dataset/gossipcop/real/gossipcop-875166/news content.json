The film brought in only $10.1 million over Memorial Day weekend in China, a record low for \"Star Wars\" films in the country, though the franchise itself has historically never grabbed the attention of China, the world's second-largest movie market.\n\nIf it doesn't see a late surge, as analysts are predicting it won't, \"Solo\" will become the first movie from Disney and Lucasfilm to lose money.\n\n2017's \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" brought in $1.332 billion at the global box office, while the first \"Star Wars\" spin-off \"Rogue One\" grossed $1.056 billion in 2016.\n\nThe first collaboration from Disney and Lucasfilm, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" grossed $2.068 billion in 2015, setting off a renewal of the \"Star Wars\" series that is now likely to see its first miss in \"Solo.\"", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5b168df21ae6624e008b4871?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b168df21ae6624e008b4871?width=24&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://static3.businessinsider.com/assets/images/careerbuilder.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Lynch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "date": "2018-06-05", "news_keywords": "Movies, Culture, Solo A Star Wars Story, Star Wars, Disney, Lucasfilm, Box Office, John Lynch", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "author": "John Lynch", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "og": {"title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5b1691fe1ae6624f008b4890?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "sailthru.date": "2018-06-05", "sailthru.tags": "Movies, Culture, Solo A Star Wars Story, Star Wars, Disney, Lucasfilm, Box Office, John Lynch", "sailthru.description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "sailthru.author": "John Lynch", "sailthru.verticals": "thewire, clusterstock, sai, thelife, media", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5b1691d31ae6621f008b4bbe?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5b1691d31ae6621f008b4bbe?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@EntInsider"}, "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"mobile-sticky": "variant", "pfi-wider-content": "variant", "back-to-top": "variant", "sticky-section-titles": "variant", "post-breadcrumbs": "variant", "tabbed-homepage": "control", "expanded-coverage-module": "control", "subscribe-smallest-price": "control"}, "viking-id": "5b16922c1ae6621c008b4bd5", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "//www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?12-31-19", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528128000.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
