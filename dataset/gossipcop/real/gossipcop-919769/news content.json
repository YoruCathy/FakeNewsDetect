It\u2019s also one of the main reasons that we tune in each week, because you just never know what statement-making ensemble the royal badass (played by Alexandra Park) will step out wearing next. Eleanor\u2019s unpredictable fashion choices on the E! series never fail to catch our attention, and according to the show\u2019s costume designer, Rachel Walsh, it\u2019s easier to recreate the Princess\u2019s look than you might think. \u201cEleanor\u2019s look is actually quite achievable,\u201d the British designer recently told InStyle. \u201cShe wears a ton of high-street brands like Topshop and H&M\u2014we\u2019re just clever in the way that we mix them in with designer pieces.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the combination of classic styles and current trends that create Eleanor\u2019s cool, yet effortless, vibe. \u201cWe use a lot of Maje and Sandro,\u201d said Walsh. \u201cBut I think that if you went on the Topshop website, you could probably find at least one-third of the silhouettes that Eleanor wears. It won\u2019t be exactly the same, but it would certainly give you a bit of her flavor.\u201d To further get Eleanor\u2019s look just right, Walsh seamlessly works in pieces that are less of-the-moment. \u201cWe buy vintage pieces from the shops at Portobello Market,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of them are from the \u201970s and \u201880s.\u201d\n\nWalsh also curates a mix of punk-meets-chic accessories to make Eleanor\u2019s outfits really pop. \u201cWe use a lot of vintage jewelry and buy different bags that keep her look fresh and change it up,\u201d said Walsh, adding that Eleanor\u2019s look has evolved even more in season two. \u201cShe had that real goth, AllSaints, Kate Moss vibe to her in season one, but we\u2019ve put her in more color this year.\u201d (For proof, look no further than the rainbow dress she wore on Season 2, Episode 5.)\n\nRELATED: The Royals Star Alexandra Park Has \"Always Dared to Wear\" Outfits Like Princess Eleanor's\n\nEleanor
