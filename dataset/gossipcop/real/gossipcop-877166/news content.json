Their breakup comes about a year after they started dating on Paradise, and 10 months after Peth proposed with a stunning Neil Lane sparkler on the reunion show last August.\n\n\"It is with much sadness that we have decided to end our engagement. We put everything we could into our relationship and are heartbroken to go forward separately, but we know this is the best decision for the both of us,\" Peth and Nolan said in a joint statement to ET. \"We will still be present in each other's lives with support, admiration and respect for each other.\"\n\nBefore meeting Nolan on Paradise, Peth appeared on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Nolan, meanwhile, gained notoriety for her \"emotional intelligence\" argument with Corinne Olympios on Nick Viall's season of The Bachelor. Peth and Nolan were pretty much inseparable when they hit the beach for season four of Bachelor in Paradise last summer, and two months later, Peth put a ring on it.\n\nManaging a long-distance relationship -- Peth lives in New York and Nolan resides in Seattle -- was always a concern for the pair.\n\n'Bachelor in Paradise' Stars Derek Peth and Taylor Nolan Get Quizzed on Their Future Together This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

We tried not to like each other, but that's what made it so genuine. We tried as hard as possible to not like each other, every step of the way!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very resistant, but part of what I love him about it, is that he is so patient with me,\u201d Nolan added. \u201cHe allows me to go through my process and is very supportive in that -- he's a very good teammate.\u201d\n\nSeason four of Paradise ended with three couples: Lacey Mark and Daniel Maguire (who revealed their breakup at the reunion), Nolan and Peth (who just split), and Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk (who are still together).\n\nSeason five, meanwhile, already has one engagement -- Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon.
