But after a long time of thinking, I started to really see the kind of impact I already have on people, how I was born with a platform, and I didn\u2019t want to waste it.\"\n\n\"There are so many people who work their entire lives to create a platform and mine was just handed to me.... Why not use it for something important?\"\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook for more news, features and video on TV, Music, Film and Art.", "images": ["https://trc.taboola.com/1036135/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/paris-jackson-vmas-2017-speech-donald-trump-white-supremacist-nazis-charlottesville-a7916081.html", "title": "VMAs 2017: Paris Jackson denounces \u2018Nazi white supremacist jerks\u2019 in speech", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#db3739", "og": {"url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/paris-jackson-vmas-2017-speech-donald-trump-white-supremacist-nazis-charlottesville-a7916081.html", "title": "Paris Jackson made a subtle dig at Trump during the VMAs", "description": "'If we were to all put our voices together, imagine the difference we would make'", "updated_time": "2017-08-28T09:00:33+01:00", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg", "site_name": "The Independent", "type": "article", "locale": "en_GB", "video": {"identifier": "https://f1.media.brightcove.com/4/624246174001/624246174001_5554398246001_5554392648001.mp4?pubId=624246174001&videoId=5554392648001", "type": "application/octet-stream"}}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/pwamp/fbi/7916081"}, "description": "With the VMAs offering such a platform of communication to the next generation, to those who can effect real change - there was no way things weren't going to get political.", "keywords": "VMAs 2017, paris jackson, News, Music, Culture", "fb": {"pages": 13312631635, "admins": 729735830, "app_id": 235586169789578}, "article": {"tag": "VMAs 2017", "published_time": "2017-08-28T08:15:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-28T09:00:33+01:00", "section": "News", "subsection": "Video", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 386, "image_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "embed_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 7, "external_link_count": 2}, "twitter": {"title": "Paris Jackson made a subtle dig at Trump during the VMAs", "description": "With the VMAs offering such a platform of communication to the next generation, to those who can effect real change - there was no way things weren't going to get political.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@independent"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Independent"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503904500.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
