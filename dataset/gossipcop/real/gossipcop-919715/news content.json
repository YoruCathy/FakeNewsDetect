The 80-year-old comedian has been accused by multiple women of sexually assaulting them after drugging them. His first trial on those charges ended in a hung jury, and the retrial is expected to start in April.\n\nBonet had a somewhat rocky relationship with Cosby. She was frequently late on the set and posed topless for Interview magazine, a step away from the wholesome family image that the TV shows tried to cultivate. Cosby also opposed her role in the film Angel Heart, in which she had a nude scene with Mickey Rourke, and allegedly opposed her marriage at age 20 to rocker Lenny Kravitz.\n\nDespite that, Bonet is not vindictive. \u201cI don\u2019t need to say, \u2018I told you so\u2019,\u201d she said regarding Cosby. \u201cI just leave all that to karma and justice and what will be.\u201d", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=deadline.com&path=%2F2018%2F03%2Flisa-bonet-speaks-out-about-her-tv-father-bill-cosby-claims-sinister-shadow-energy-1202332025%2F&ct=article&lob=deadline&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202332025&comment_count=28", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bruce Haring"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/03/lisa-bonet-speaks-out-about-her-tv-father-bill-cosby-claims-sinister-shadow-energy-1202332025/", "title": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby \u2013 Claims \u201cSinister, Shadow Energy\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby - Claims \"Sinister, Shadow Energy\"", "news_keywords": "Bill Cosby, Celebrities, Harassment", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby \u2013 Claims \u201cSinister, Shadow Energy\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/03/lisa-bonet-speaks-out-about-her-tv-father-bill-cosby-claims-sinister-shadow-energy-1202332025/", "description": "Lisa Bonet has commented for the first time on her television father, Bill Cosby, with whom she appeared in two of the most popular shows in the world.
