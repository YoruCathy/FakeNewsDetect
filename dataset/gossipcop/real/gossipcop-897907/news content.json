On the cover, Swift is shown in an embellished red dress by YSL that screams fashion-over-function, swapping her classic red lip for a deep purple tone.\n\nSwift thanked the editor -- who referred to her as \"indomitable\" upon revealing the cover -- as well as both photographers, in an Instagram post early Monday (Dec. 4). \"Thank you @edward_enninful and @mertalas for your passion, spirit, and contagious laughter on set,\" Swift noted. \"Mert and Marcus took these photos for @britishvogue and my album photos for reputation, and it\u2019s been such a bonding experience working together so closely and talking so much about what we wanted to make. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done a magazine cover. I\u2019m really happy my first one back was with such wonderful people. #newvogue.\"", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/assets/1586539892/images/Billboard-white.svg?4863e69cb9d656c61185", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/Billie-Eilish-Where-Do-We-Go-World-Tour-Kick-Off-Miami-2020-billboard-1548-1587151378-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/radio-city-music-hall-covid19-2020-billboard-1500x845-1584562361-compressed.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7395269&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/04/miley-cyrus-april-2019-uu-billboard-z-1548-1585925327-compressed.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/7cover_Coronavirus_Touring_WEB-1585231399-220x286.jpg", "https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/GettyImages-1144319419-1583448877-compressed.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8055047/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover", "title": "British 'Vogue' Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "article": {"modified_time": "2017-12-05T11:36:06-05:00", "published_time": "2017-12-04T13:16:25-05:00"}, "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "og": {"description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "height": 677, "width": 1024}, "title": "Taylor Swift Stars in British 'Vogue' January Cover Story | Billboard", "type": "article", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8055047/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover", "site_name": "Billboard"}, "title": "British 'Vogue' Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "image": "https://static.billboard.com/files/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg", "title": "British 'Vogue' Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "site": "@billboard"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512411385.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
