A Los Angeles County District Attorney told the publication that the D.A. declined to file the charges. No other information was provided.\n\nIn early March, 911 responded to a call after the 21-year-old allegedly punched the Motley Crue member at their Calabasas property. Brandon blamed the incident on his father's drinking problem, which the rocker aggressively denied on social media. \"I\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve been in my entire life. I have a few drinks here & there because I\u2019m f--kin retired and enjoying my life. I worked 30+ f--kin years I deserve it,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nLMAAAO!!!!
