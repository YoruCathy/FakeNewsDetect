Milo celebrated the milestone birthday only a few a months ago, which he described as \"pretty great\" when chatting with E!

I can finally wear that not that I've arrived into complete manhood.\"So now that he's officially 40, is there anything Ventimiglia knows now more than ever before? In his words, \"I think I'm old enough to know I'm not young enough to think I know everything. Back then I was like I know everything. Now I'm like, I don't know that. I'm going to learn that. I'm going to take my time. I'm going to stretch.\"\"There's always something to learn,\" he added. As fans of the NBC drama have come to understand, Ventimiglia's co-stars lovingly refer to him as \"dad\" on set. \"I make sure everyone is feeling good and supported,\" he explained of his unofficial role. \"Ready to their art!\"He referred to co-stars Sterling K. Brown and Justi Hartley as his \"sons,\" despite the fact that both celebs are a few years older than Milo IRL. \"I feel a responsibility to make sure everyone is doing well,\" he teased. Milo also had something to say to the millions of viewers who have fallen in love with This Is Us.\"I get a lot of people coming up to me wanting to hug me,\" he told Rancic. \"I think a lot of that comes from the affection they get from the show, the feeling they get, the heart.
