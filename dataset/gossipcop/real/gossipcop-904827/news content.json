But he has made an exception as Rose McGowan started her press tour to promote a new E! show and the publication of her book Brave.\n\nMcGowan has long maintained that Weinstein raped her, and has made her account of an assault at his hands at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997 a major part of the book. Weinstein\u2019s lawyer, Ben Brafman, is disputing McGowan\u2019s version of what happened in that hot tub being non-consensual, and what happened in its aftermath.\n\nRelated Story Harvey Weinstein Hit With New Sexual Battery Charge By L.A. District Attorney\n\nWeinstein\u2019s lawyer has offered as evidence emails from McGowan\u2019s former manager Jill Messick and Ben Affleck, latter of whom McGowan said she told of the assault moments after it happened, eliciting an angry response from the actor/director. Worth noting that Affleck\u2019s email was sent to Weinstein on July 26, long before the New York Times and the New Yorker broke stories on the avalanche of actresses, assistants and others who claimed they were assaulted by Weinstein, who became a pariah overnight. Baring the emails solicited before either Messick or Affleck knew what was coming or even why Weinstein asked for them, is embarrassing for both Affleck and Messick. But we have long passed the point of decorum in this ongoing tawdry saga that has shaken Hollywood to its core.\n\nNo comment from Affleck, who on November 17 said he believed McGowan and supported her, when he appeared on the Today Show. Attempts to reach Messick (who later worked as an executive for Weinstein at TWC) were unavailing.\n\nAs for McGowan, she responded in characteristic unvarnished fashion in a tweet just now, with a spokesman telling Deadline there would be no further comment:\n\nFuck you you fucking douche bag loser from hell.

Watching the \u201cperformance\u201d by Rose McGowan as she looks to promote her new book however, has made it impossible to remain quiet as she tries to smear Mr. Weinstein with a bold lie that is denied not only by Mr. Weinstein himself, but by at least two witnesses, including Ms. McGowan\u2019s own Manager at the time who Ms. McGowan claims to have confided in the day after the alleged assault and an A-list actor Ben Affleck who Ms. McGowan claims to have also told about her encounter with Mr. Weinstein shortly after the incident she now describes as \u201crape\u201d, but which in 1997 she described to her Manager as a \u201cconsensual\u201d act of sex.\n\n\u201cIn an email to Mr. Weinstein regarding the encounter, Jill Messick says the following, \u201cWhen we met up the following day, she hesitantly told me of her own accord that during the meeting that night before she had gotten into a hot tub with Mr. Weinstein. She was very clear about the fact that getting into that hot tub was something that she did consensually and that in hindsight it was also something that she regretted having done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBen Affleck expressed the following in an email to Mr. Weinstein, \u201cShe never told me nor did I ever infer that she was attacked by anyone.
