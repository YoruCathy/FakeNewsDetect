But that day may come sooner than we think.\n\nJill recently posted a lovely message about Bethenny on Instagram, and it seems as though the ice has thawed somewhat between these former friends-turned-foes. \"I\u2019m sitting around going thru photos and put together a collage of @bethennyfrankel with my family,\" Jill wrote in a post that featured photos of Bethenny with her, her late husband Bobby Zarin, her daughter Ally Shapiro, and her mother Gloria Kamen. \"Miss B...thanks for the memories tonight.\"\n\nBethenny attended Bobby's funeral at Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York City on January 15. \"Today is a sad day with a silver lining. I laughed. I cried. I saw old faces & watched a family come together surrounding a loss,\" Bethenny shared on Twitter following the funeral. \"'I have a dream' that Bobby\u2019s death makes us realize what is important & treat each day as our last.\"\n\nToday is a sad day with a silver lining. I laughed. I cried. I saw old faces & watched a family come together surrounding a loss. \u201cI have a dream\u201d that Bobby\u2019s death makes us realize what is important & treat each day as our last. \u2014 Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 15, 2018\n\nBethenny also posted a series of tweets in remembrance of her late friend after his passing on January 13 following a battle with cancer.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to those who wish us well. All the rest can go to hell.\u201d One of Bobby Zarin\u2019s favorites. Another one: \u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d and Bobby, now it really is... #RIP \u2014 Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 14, 2018\n\n\u201cOne more...that\u2019s it.\u201d Bobby Zarin \u2014 Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 15, 2018\n\nThe first housewives producer who found me in the Hamptons just emailed me to tell me that it was Bobby who suggested me to her for RHONY. \u2014 Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) January 14, 2018\n\nJill shared during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in June that she would \"absolutely\" give Bethenny \"a hug and a kiss\" if they ever crossed paths again (clip above). However, Bethenny said she wasn't looking to rekindle her friendship with Jill during the most recent The Real Housewives of New York City reunion.\n\nSee more of Bethenny's thoughts on Jill, below.",
