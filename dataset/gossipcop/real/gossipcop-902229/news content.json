The return of \"Will and Grace\" also glossed over some plot points from its original ending in 2006.\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour_9370906f7c40d78db8842bc0c3e628a7.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_03/1529838/weekend-today-menu_94be02e0ac821819fdb22a090c28163f.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696426/food_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna_00d9547321553d5a5f55c2b3973c514b.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201711/tdy_pop_reiser_171116_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201712/tdy_pop_madaboutyou_171227_1920x1080.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696446/shop_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696466/wellness_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696481/today_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696456/style_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696461/videos_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist_4bc7d2146c228dd9a02a3c15b38527d0.10000;74;7;80;3.png", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696431/home_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/1296895/mad-about-you-today-1-tease-1-171116_e0598c8de740d7a648de1bb4af7f7e54.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696436/parenting_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg", "https://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_52/2696441/popculture_v2_4430f66e4555be0684b8f4bf6875e1e8.focal-120x180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/1296895/mad-about-you-today-1-tease-1-171116_e0598c8de740d7a648de1bb4af7f7e54.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/mad-about-you-revival-reportedly-works-t120570", "title": "'Mad About You' revival reportedly is in the works", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/mad-about-you-revival-reportedly-works-t120570", "title": "'Mad About You' revival reportedly is in the works", "description": "Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt could be returning for a revival of the hit '90s sitcom \"Mad About You,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/1296895/mad-about-you-today-1-tease-1-171116_e0598c8de740d7a648de1bb4af7f7e54.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/1296895/mad-about-you-today-1-tease-1-171116_e0598c8de740d7a648de1bb4af7f7e54.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TodayShow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/1296895/mad-about-you-today-1-tease-1-171116_e0598c8de740d7a648de1bb4af7f7e54.social_share_1024x512_center.jpg", "title": "'Mad About You' revival reportedly is in the works", "description": "Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt could be returning for a revival of the hit '90s sitcom \"Mad About You,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt could be returning for a revival of the hit '90s sitcom \"Mad About You,\" according to The Hollywood Reporter.", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "thumbnail": "https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_46/1296895/mad-about-you-today-1-tease-1-171116_e0598c8de740d7a648de1bb4af7f7e54.social_share_1024x768_scale.jpg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416357699"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514400120.0, "source": "https://www.today.com", "summary": ""}
