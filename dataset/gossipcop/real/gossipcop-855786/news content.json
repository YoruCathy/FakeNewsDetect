The Gypsy actress opened up about their breakup in Vogue Australia\u2019s June 2017 issue.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m single. I\u2019m coparenting,\u201d Watts, 48, said. \u201cThere are good days and bad days. Liev and I are on great terms and we\u2019re trying to do our absolute best for the sake of the children, and we hope to keep moving forward in that way. He\u2019s fantastic dad, a wonderful, wonderful man, and we still want the absolute best for each other. So, that\u2019s pretty much all I\u2019ll say.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnlikely Celebrity Couples\n\nUs Weekly confirmed in September 2016 that Watts and the Ray Donovan actor, 49, split after 11 years together. The pair are parents of sons Alexander \u201cSasha,\u201d 8, and Samuel, 7.\n\n\u201cI feel I\u2019m in a good place in my life and I want to make sure my kids are healthy, my kids are happy and things are going to go well. Those are my hopes for me and for all of us,\u201d Watts told Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph in November. \u201cI feel, whether you\u2019re famous or not, transitions are scary for anybody. I feel like change is always scary, but that\u2019s only because transition for anyone is new, and you wonder how things are going to go.\u201d\n\n\n\nLove on Set\n\nWatts and Schreiber first met in 2005 on set of their film The Painted Veil.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-zoom-d406eca1-b1f7-45e6-9638-a15df371266e.jpg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-inline-3e6c761f-4944-4d2a-89b7-0241f8a05cc5.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-zoom-b56534f4-cbb9-499b-a4f5-abdae1a81776.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-zoom-b56534f4-cbb9-499b-a4f5-abdae1a81776.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/naomi-watts-had-good-days-and-bad-days-after-liev-schreiber-split-w483570/", "title": "Naomi Watts Had 'Good Days and Bad Days' After Liev Schreiber Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Naomi Watts opened up about her split from Liev Schreiber in a new interview \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Naomi Watts: I've Had 'Good Days and Bad Days' After Liev Split", "description": "Naomi Watts opened up about her split from Liev Schreiber in a new interview \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/naomi-watts-had-good-days-and-bad-days-after-liev-schreiber-split-w483570/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:03:28+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-zoom-b56534f4-cbb9-499b-a4f5-abdae1a81776.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-zoom-b56534f4-cbb9-499b-a4f5-abdae1a81776.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2017-05-22T15:59:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:03:28+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Naomi Watts opened up about her split from Liev Schreiber in a new interview \u2014 get the details", "title": "Naomi Watts: I've Had 'Good Days and Bad Days' After Liev Split", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-and-naomi-watts-zoom-b56534f4-cbb9-499b-a4f5-abdae1a81776.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495468789.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
