News that the acting talent was protesting his former agent Tyler Grasham amidst allegations of sexual assault. Two men have come forward alleging that Grasham sexually assaulted them. In response to the claims, APA told E! News, \u201cTyler Grasham\u2019s employment with APA has been terminated, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, Blaise Godbe Lipman (The Office, Weeds), accused Grasham of sexual assault that allegedly happened 10 years ago on Facebook. \u201cTyler Grasham, under the pretense of a business meeting regarding potential agency representation at APA Agency, fed me alcohol while I was underage and sexually assaulted me,\u201d Lipman wrote.\n\nThese allegations are coming almost two weeks after the big scandal involving Harvey Weinstein was terminated from The Weinstein Company. Since then, Hollywood stars such as Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Kate Beckinsale, Cara Delevingne and Ashley Judd, plus others, have all come out to share their qualms with the embattled Hollywood exec.\n\nSource: Deadline", "images": ["https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Finn-Wolfhard-2017-a-billboard-1548-a--e1508593328362.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-bcknOTN_Y03wc.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2028207464136367&ev=PageView\n\t\t&noscript=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-L7GUus8KYDr8V.gif", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17938494&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/427558e8ab6e58dca7fe79a88d20563c?s=96&d=identicon&r=g"], "top_img": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Finn-Wolfhard-2017-a-billboard-1548-a--e1508593328362.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.okayplayer.com/culture/stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-exits-apa-agent-accused-sexual-abuse.html", "title": "Stranger Things' Actor Finn Wolfhard Exits APA After Agent Accused of Sexual Abuse", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width = device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Stranger Things' Actor Finn Wolfhard Exits APA After Agent Accused of Sexual Abuse", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff4200", "description": "The lead star of Netflix\u2019s sci-fi thriller, Finn Wolfhard, has done more than any adult in Hollywood regarding the Weinstein scandal.", "fb": {"pages": 7641733766}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Stranger Things' Actor Finn Wolfhard Exits APA After Agent Accused of Sexual Abuse", "description": "The lead star of Netflix\u2019s sci-fi thriller, Finn Wolfhard, has done more than any adult in Hollywood regarding the Weinstein scandal.", "url": "https://www.okayplayer.com/culture/stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-exits-apa-agent-accused-sexual-abuse.html", "site_name": "Okayplayer", "updated_time": "2017-10-21T09:46:09-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Finn-Wolfhard-2017-a-billboard-1548-a--e1508593328362.jpg", "width": 715, "height": 473}}, "article": {"tag": "Tyler Grasham", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2017-10-21T10:20:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-21T09:46:09-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The lead star of Netflix\u2019s sci-fi thriller, Finn Wolfhard, has done more than any adult in Hollywood regarding the Weinstein scandal.", "title": "Stranger Things' Actor Finn Wolfhard Exits APA After Agent Accused of Sexual Abuse", "site": "@okayplayer", "image": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Finn-Wolfhard-2017-a-billboard-1548-a--e1508593328362.jpg", "creator": "@okayplayer"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 0.9.98.20", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.okayplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-favicon-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508595645.0, "source": "https://www.okayplayer.com", "summary": ""}
