Going forward, I think we should all bear in mind that we need to strive to make this better and a more even playing field for everyone involved \u2014 but not just in our industry, in all industries.\u201d\n\nHis comments come weeks after fans of the royal drama launched a petition, calling on Smith to \u201cmake up for the sexist pay gap\u201d by donating the difference in his and Foy\u2019s paychecks to The Time\u2019s Up movement which aims to stamp out inequality and harassment in the work place.\n\nThe Crown cast and their real-life counterparts -
