(The breathless play-by-plays of Frances McDormand holding court at the post-ceremony parties while clutching a bucket of fried chicken\u2014not to mention the wild caper involving her briefly stolen Oscar\u2014certainly attest to that.)\n\nAnother tease of something we at home were deprived of came Monday afternoon when The Lonely Island, the comedy trio best-known for Saturday Night Live Digital Shorts like \u201cDick in a Box,\u201d posted a music video on their official YouTube channel featuring storyboards and a rough track for a number they said they had written for the Oscars telecast but which was ultimately scrapped for being \u201cfinancially and logistically impossible.\u201d\n\nConceived to include appearances from Thor, Wonder Woman, Pennywise the Clown, the cast of Star Wars, the Hollywood Chrises, Tiffany Haddish, and Michael Fassbender oblivious to his The Snowman flop, the demo is titled \u201cWhy Not Me?,\u201d a lament from stars of movies the Academy typically snubs despite their commercial and critical success.\n\nThe plan, according to an open letter that appears before the YouTube video, was to produce a \u201cfully shot, star-studded music video of exorbitant cost.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how much of this is tongue-in-cheek (this is an Andy Samberg-led comedy trio, after all), but the song and storyboards that play next are fully realized and extremely funny. Considering that The Lonely Island has performed a nominated song at the Academy Awards before\u2014\u201cEverything Is Awesome\u201d from The LEGO Movie\u2014the group\u2019s involvement with the Oscars is entirely feasible.\n\n(A request for clarification on whether the song really was produced with the intent of airing during the Oscars has not been returned.)\n\nComposed by Greg Chun, who worked with The Lonely Island on Michael Bolton\u2019s Big Sexy, Valentine\u2019s Day Special for Netflix, the track would have opened with Chris Hemsworth as Thor in earnest musical theatre voice, lilting: \u201cWhy not me? Do I not a deserve a nomination? The reviews were raves to be sure: \u2018Fun for the whole family, look no farther than Thor.\u2019\u201d\n\nGal Gadot as Wonder Woman would then join in: \u201cWhy not me? I left my family to fight for what\u2019s right. Saved the world from the devil below, but I\u2019m sure it was hard for Sir Daniel Day Lewis to learn how to sew.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re joined by a growing ensemble of embittered characters from box-office hits that were slighted by the Academy. Pennywise the Clown from It wonders if he was snubbed for not being classically handsome. Tiffany Haddish sings an aria about peeing while hanging from a zipline: \u201cMeryl Streep has never done that.\u201d A chorus of Chrises Pratt, Pine, Evans, Hemsworth, and Rock lead into a bridge sung by Michael Fassbender. It builds and builds until the stage, or video frame, as it were, would be filled with box-office stars.\n\nBut alas, the song proved too much of a burden to produce. We\u2019re not sure how much the hot dog guns in the show\u2019s one, interminable star-studded bit cost, or if the Liberace-on-speed-style set really need all those crystals, but we\u2019d venture the funds might have been better spent producing this.", "images": ["https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_1.5/c_limit,w_1044/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1520279546/180305-fallon-oscars-tease_lxb6hn", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1520279546/180305-fallon-oscars-tease_lxb6hn", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1550872986/White2x_hcwpd6.png", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,w_200,x_0,y_0/v1489779074/author/Kevin-Fallon.jpg", "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/v1549916286/logo_km2qs4.png"], "top_img": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1520279546/180305-fallon-oscars-tease_lxb6hn", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-oscars-cut-a-lonely-island-song-for-being-financially-and-logistically-impossible", "title": "The Oscars Cut a Hilarious Lonely Island Song for Being \u2018Financially and Logistically Impossible\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "The Oscars Cut a Hilarious Lonely Island Song for Being \u2018Financially and Logistically Impossible\u2019", "keywords": "Academy Awards, Wonder Woman, Thor", "og": {"title": "The Oscars Cut a Hilarious Lonely Island Song for Being \u2018Financially and Logistically Impossible\u2019", "description": "The comedy trio posted the demo for a star-studded song\u2014Thor!
