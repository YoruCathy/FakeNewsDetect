We\u2019re mature now. We\u2019re grown-ups, and we\u2019re going to take our time and we\u2019re going to do things at our own pace.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old continued, \u201cOur life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work, we\u2019re truly blessed. We don\u2019t need anything more right now.\u201d\n\nLopez has been married three times \u2014 to waiter Ojani Noa (1997 to 1998), dancer Cris Judd (2001 to 2002) and Marc Anthony (2004 to 2014), with whom she shares 10-year-old twins Emme and Max.

It was \u201cwritten about the two of us, but it\u2019s like, not about the two of us,\u201d Lopez explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m like, \u2018Hey \u2026. Where\u2019s my ring?'\u201d she said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\nThe Shades of Blue star added, \u201cI feel like they wrote it because \u2026 they want that to happen.\u201d\n\nImage zoom Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez Mark Sagliocco/Getty\n\nDuring a recent sit-down on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lopez revealed what it would take to break up with the former baseball star.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so competitive [in] every way.
