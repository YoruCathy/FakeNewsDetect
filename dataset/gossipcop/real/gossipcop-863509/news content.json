True story!\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday I took a refresher course \u2014 focusing on infant and toddler CPR,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt takes only a few hours and it\u2019s also kinda, sorta fun. Thank you to Dan from Viva First Aid for the lesson. And thank you to these two helpful yet lifeless dolls whose vacant ocular cavities will haunt me until end times.\u201d\n\nReynolds, 40, has two daughters he shares with his wife and actress Blake Lively, 2-year-old daughter James and a 9-month-old daughter.\n\nThe Shallows actress, 29, posted a similar Instagram post on Monday, urging parents to take CPR courses, especially if they had small children.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t recommend this enough, I took a CPR class with a focus on babies and toddlers,\u201d Lively wrote. \u201cGoogle \u2018infant CPR class near me\u2019 and you\u2019ll see lots of listings.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cFor those of you who haven\u2019t done it, you will love it.

I remember before I had kids, I was always like, \u2018God, that\u2019s hard.'\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause you can see they\u2019re sweating and they\u2019re nervous because their kids are yelling and everyone\u2019s mad at them,\u201d said Reynolds, adding, \u201cI\u2019m the same way.\u201d\n\nStill, the actor has said he wouldn\u2019t change a thing. He told eTalk last December, \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing.
