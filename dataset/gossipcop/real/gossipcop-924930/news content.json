We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together,\u201d a joint statement from the two read. \u201cAbsolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now\u2026We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly.\u201d\n\nBut now that they\u2019ve officially announced their separation, what comes next?\n\nImage zoom Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nLegal experts tell PEOPLE that a lot depends on whether the couple signed a prenuptial agreement when they wed in 2009. But either way, their career paths and Tatum\u2019s stratospheric paychecks will make for a complicated divorce.\n\nForbes estimated that the actor made $60 million in 2013 for movies like The Vow, 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. He then made $29 million in 2015, according to the magazine. Tatum also launched his own vodka line, Born and Bred, in February 2017. Various online estimates place his net worth in the range of $60 to $80 million.\n\nCelebrity divorce attorney Vikki Ziegler says Tatum stands to potentially lose more in a divorce settlement if they didn\u2019t have a prenup.\n\n\u201cNobody knows if they did sign one or not, and both of their careers blossomed since \u2014 especially Channing\u2019s,\u201d Ziegler says. \u201cAt this point, there is so much at stake, for him more than her, because they would be dividing the bulk of their assets. She could be looking at spousal support for a period of time. Child support of course, that could be a huge number.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cObviously houses, retirement assets, bank accounts \u2014 all of those things would be in the pot for division. So he is looking at a substantial depletion of his estate.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters is the fact that neither Tatum or Dewan were as well known at the time of their marriage and Tatum has since gone on to make a blockbuster amount of money after. Ziegler says that in cases like this, the spouse with the suddenly higher income could have taken another step to protect themselves \u2014 a postnuptial agreement.\n\n\u201cThe concept is the same as a prenup and would dictate the divorce,\u201d Ziegler explains. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of trying to do damage control after the marriage when you didn\u2019t do a prenup. It would\u2019ve been super smart for Channing to do that.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Signs of Trouble Surfaced Over Last Few Months in Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan Tatum\u2019s Marriage\n\nCelebrity divorce attorney Stu Slotnick, a shareholder at Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney, tells PEOPLE that the best way to avoid the process getting difficult is for the two to take care of everything in private mediation instead of in court.\n\n\u201cAs a general rule, divorce litigation is something that should be avoided because it is long, it is painful and it is expensive,\u201d Slotnick says. \u201cDivorce bleeds into every aspect of a person\u2019s life. Even if there\u2019s a prenup, litigation surrounding a prenup can be just as costly, just as protractive and just as vicious as a divorce litigation without one. The fact that they released a joint statement is indicative of a present intention to work things out without the public being involved.\u201d\n\nBut while the statement implies the split is amicable, Ziegler says it could get worse down the line if they\u2019re unable to agree about the parting of assets during mediation.\n\n\u201cWhile they could be in a good emotional place, financially they have to come to terms, which is very difficult,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen people start parting with money it becomes a different ball game. So he\u2019s going to have to come to terms with losing a lot of money and hoping that he\u2019s gonna regain it back in the future.\u201d\n\nFor Ziegler, how much money Dewan asks for is the big question. \u201cHow much does she need to live and support their daughter, assuming she\u2019s gonna be the parent of primary residence,\u201d she says. \u201cThis stuff gets ugly quickly, unless they\u2019ve brokered a deal and they\u2019re trying to hash it out.\u201d\n\nEven though Dewan didn\u2019t make as much money as Tatum during their marriage, she could have a higher claim to his earnings if she argues that she helped him in his career through support. Slotnick says that situations like Dewan taking care of the house and their child while Tatum was filming a movie give her an arguing point during mediation.\n\nImage zoom Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan in 2009 Masatoshi Okauchi/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t come to an agreement, the situation would have to go public.\n\n\u201cUsually what happens if they can\u2019t settle after a period of time is one of the parties will file a complaint for divorce and let the courts start unwinding its process because you\u2019re at a crossroads,\u201d Ziegler says. \u201cBut that\u2019s the goal \u2014 to keep it private through mediation.\u201d\n\nSlotnick agrees: \u201cBoth parties would be wise to come to an agreement to keep it out of court, because a public divorce can only potentially damage the parties. If it goes to a public fight it could be a terrible thing.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F03%2F23%2Fmaren-morris-baby-4.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F04%2Fchanning-tatum-jenna-dewan-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F05%2Fchanning-jenna-gallery-3-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2018%2F09%2Fmatthew-perry-2-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1440&h=754&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F11%2Fchanning-tatum7.jpg", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/thumbnail_generic.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F04%2F18%2Fusa418.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=1440&h=754&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2016%2F11%2Fchanning-tatum7.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ale Russian"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-divorce-legal/", "title": "Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan's Divorce Could Get Very Complicated: 'There Is So Much at Stake'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Channing Tatum,Couples,Jenna Dewan,Movie Celebrities,News", "news_keywords": "Channing Tatum,Couples,Jenna Dewan,Movie Celebrities,News", "description": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have a long road ahead of them in legal proceedings after announcing their split", "og": {"title": "Channing Tatum, Jenna Dewan's Divorce Could Get Very Complicated: 'There Is So Much at Stake'", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://people.com/movies/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-divorce-legal/", "description": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan have a long road ahead of them in legal proceedings after announcing their split.
