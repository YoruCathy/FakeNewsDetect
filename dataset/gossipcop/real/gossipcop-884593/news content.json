A pool reporter that day called the scene \u201csurreal\u201d and described Trump doing his \u201cbest Stephen Curry impersonation\u201d as he aimed the towels to the far reaches of the crowd, a performance \u201cthey enjoyed.\u201d\n\nBut nearly a year later, viewed in the prism of a new report about the lethal legacy of Maria, the moment last October does not seem as lighthearted. Trump\u2019s day in San Juan \u2014 limited to the better fortified neighborhoods of the capital and far from the most catastrophic destruction \u2014 included other scenes that suggested the president was eager to congratulate himself prematurely and to minimize a rapidly deepening tragedy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe paper-towel moment in particular has come to symbolize what critics say is Trump\u2019s inability to sympathize with others \u2014 and his self-absorbed leadership in a time of crisis.\n\n\u201cOne could argue it was nothing but then you could argue it was everything,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the celebrity chef who oversaw a massive operation to provide meals on the island, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt showed such a lack of empathy.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s performance reminds some of a Republican predecessor, George W. Bush, who declared \u201cmission accomplished\u201d in May 2003 during a visit to an aircraft carrier supporting troops in the Iraq War \u2014 which would slog on eight more years. Two years later, Bush rushed to congratulate his Federal Emergency Management Agency director for a \u201checkuva job\u201d in response to Hurricane Katrina, a storm that was blamed for the deaths of more than 1,800 people.\n\nAt the makeshift supply center last October at Calvary Chapel, Trump scoffed at a water purification kit that could help save lives. He awarded \u201cA+\u201d grades for his administration for its response to a pair of other hurricanes that struck Texas, Louisiana and Florida. And he characterized a death toll of 16 in Puerto Rico as a kind of victory, though the count would officially grow to 34 later in the day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of love in this room,\u201d Trump, wearing a dark hooded windbreaker, boasted in the church.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThings look far more grim approaching Maria\u2019s first anniversary. A report last month from George Washington University, commissioned by the Puerto Rican government, found that an estimated 2,975 more people died on the island in the six months following the storm than would have been expected under typical mortality rates \u2014 a figure that Puerto Rico\u2019s governor accepted as the official death toll.\n\nTrump, furious over what he considers revisionist history, has angrily watched the clips of him tossing paper towels on television and disputed the death numbers Thursday on Twitter, declaring it a conspiracy from Democrats.\n\nBut on the island, many residents have honed in on Trump\u2019s moment at the church.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat was disrespectful,\u201d said Ramon Pachaco, 58, whose house in Ponce, on the island\u2019s southern coast, suffered $26,000 in damage. Trump\u2019s message to local residents, he said, amounted to: \u201cIf you want to cry, dry your tears with this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n'We get an A+'\n\nMaria wasn\u2019t the only crisis the president was dealing with as he and first lady Melania Trump emerged from the White House just after 8 a.m. on Oct. 3, 2017, to start the day trip to San Juan.\n\nTwo days earlier, a gunman had slaughtered 58 people at an outdoor country music concert in Las Vegas.\n\nOn the South Lawn, the president responded to shouted questions from reporters, calling the mass shooting a \u201ctragedy.\u201d Asked about Puerto Rico, Trump declared victory in an escalating feud with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who had criticized his administration\u2019s response.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now acknowledged what a great job we\u2019ve done,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cIn Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. I think we\u2019ve done just as good in Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides viewed the president\u2019s trip as an important visual counterbalance to his response to the storms on the mainland. Trump already had visited Texas and Florida, but he had appeared more callous toward Puerto Rico, criticizing the island\u2019s poor infrastructure, including the electrical grid, and complaining that the cost of the emergency response would throw the federal budget \u201cout of whack.\u201d\n\nTo Mark Merritt, who served as a FEMA manager in the Clinton administration, Trump had already set the wrong tone for his visit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo one ever gives themselves a grade on disaster response,\u201d said Merritt, who has served as a consultant for the Puerto Rico government over the past year. \u201cThe president should have come out and said, \u2018This is the first truly catastrophic disaster in U.S. history. Never have we had a state that has been devastated with 100 percent of the state impacted.\u201d\n\nAides had set up a full itinerary. The Trumps would meet with people affected by the storm, receive a briefing from local officials and greet U.S. sailors and Marines assisting in the recovery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Puerto Rico many times and the weather is second to none, but sometimes you get hit and you got hit,\u201d Trump said, after disembarking Air Force One at a National Guard base in San Juan. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who had accompanied Trump, gave Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 a hug and an emphatic handshake. Rossell\u00f3, in contrast to the San Juan mayor, had spoken positively of the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter a private briefing, the Trumps proceeded on a walking tour of the relatively affluent Guaynabo neighborhood, where they posed for photos with a local family.\n\nNext stop was Calvary Chapel, for the carefully scripted photo op of Trump handing out supplies. It was something he had done a month earlier in a subdivision in Fort Myers, Fla., where he and the first lady, along with Vice President Pence, had passed out hoagies and bottled water to residents affected by Hurricane Irma.\n\nAs soon as Trump entered the church in San Juan, dozens of locals began cheering, snapping photos and straining to shake his hand.\n\n'It totally belittled the moment'\n\nAndr\u00e9s was disgusted by Trump\u2019s behavior in the church.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t throw them. You hand them,\u201d he said of the paper towels. \u201cYou look the people in the eye and tell them, \u2018We\u2019re here for you, and we\u2019ll do our best to provide relief for you and your family.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\nCurrent and former White House aides acknowledged that the imagery was unhelpful, overshadowing the breadth of the administration\u2019s response. The federal government approved $1.39 billion in grants for more than 462,000 homeowners and renters, and the U.S. Small Business Administration authorized $1.8 billion in low-interest disaster loans, aides said.\n\n\u201cOur sense was that it was a good trip, the president did well, and a lot of the coverage was unfair,\u201d said one former administration official, who spoke on anonymity to discuss the thinking of the president\u2019s team.\n\nAD\n\nThe paper towel moment \u201cwas relatively minor and the media exploited it,\u201d this person added.\n\nAnother former official argued that \u201cthe throwing of the paper towels was one of the funniest things of all time\u201d and brought a bit of humor to an otherwise somber visit.\n\nIn the video, Trump can be seen throwing six rolls in 20 seconds, posing for a selfie in the middle of it. Then he picks up a different item and pretends to toss that to the crowd, drawing oohs.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHis inexperience and lack of understanding of the process made him feel like this is a campaign event,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIt totally belittled the moment and did more damage than good.\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, White House aides have tried to keep Trump focused on the looming threat of Florence. More than 1.5 million people have been evacuated from coastal regions in the Southeast.\n\nBut the president has become increasingly infuriated by the focus on his San Juan trip, aides said. His tweets \u2014 arguing that Democrats inflated the official death count \u201cto make me look as bad as possible\u201d \u2014 have led to still more coverage, contributing to what aides described as a vicious cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from last October, as Air Force One streaked back from San Juan toward Washington and a triumphant Trump chatted with reporters on the plane.\n\nAD\n\nAsked if he\u2019d received any constructive criticism, the president replied: \u201cNone. They were so thankful for what we\u2019ve done. I think it\u2019s been a great day. No, we only heard thank yous from the people of Puerto Rico.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/98ea397c-2d5f-45dc-8cf5-292bcf5610fd.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/c29656ae-2a6a-4142-8e34-4fde090356dc.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/odMTeNm9dg8vHNeYvQXyqEGYhzQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGBQFRVK3EI6PM5KYDRODVA6HA.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/odMTeNm9dg8vHNeYvQXyqEGYhzQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGBQFRVK3EI6PM5KYDRODVA6HA.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Ashley Parker", "White House Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/it-totally-belittled-the-moment-many-look-back-in-anger-at-trumps-tossing-of-paper-towels-in-puerto-rico/2018/09/13/8a3647d2-b77e-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html", "title": "\u2018It totally belittled the moment\u2019: Many look back in dismay at Trump\u2019s tossing of paper towels in Puerto Rico", "meta_data": {"description": "The president\u2019s lighthearted visit to San Juan in the wake of Hurricane Maria now reminds some of Bush\u2019s \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 and Katrina moments.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/it-totally-belittled-the-moment-many-look-back-in-anger-at-trumps-tossing-of-paper-towels-in-puerto-rico/2018/09/13/8a3647d2-b77e-11e8-a2c5-3187f427e253_story.html", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/odMTeNm9dg8vHNeYvQXyqEGYhzQ=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DGBQFRVK3EI6PM5KYDRODVA6HA.jpg", "title": "\u2018It totally belittled the moment\u2019: Many look back in dismay at Trump\u2019s tossing of paper towels in Puerto Rico", "description": "The president\u2019s lighthearted visit to San Juan in the wake of Hurricane Maria now reminds some of Bush\u2019s \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 and Katrina moments."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018It totally belittled the moment\u2019: Many look back in dismay at Trump\u2019s tossing of paper towels in Puerto Rico", "description": "The president\u2019s lighthearted visit to San Juan in the wake of Hurricane Maria now reminds some of Bush\u2019s \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 and Katrina moments."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-09-14T13:57:25.177Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536768000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
