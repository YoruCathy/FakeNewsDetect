The hotels are Disney\u2019s Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort \u2013 Riverside, Disney\u2019s Art of Animation Resort and the cabins at Disney\u2019s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.\n\nThe resorts are still somewhat leashing in their dog-owner guests.\n\nThe dogs have to be well-behaved, leashed in public areas at the resort and properly vaccinated. Only two dogs per room are allowed. And Disney is calling this a pilot program vs. a permanent one.\n\nThere are also nightly pet-cleaning fees involved:\n\nDisney\u2019s Art of Animation Resort: $50\n\nDisney\u2019s Port Orleans Riverside Resort: $50\n\nDisney\u2019s Yacht Club Resort: $75\n\nCabins at Disney\u2019s Ft. Wilderness Resort: $50\n\nHotels have increasingly been welcoming their guests\u2019 canine friends, and it\u2019s not unusual for them to charge fees for them. Resorts also typically have \u201cresort fees\u201d that cover amenities such as swimming pool use and Wi-Fi.\n\nDisney Parks: Halloween events without the screams\n\nStill, the dogs are getting their perks. The properties will offer a Pluto\u2019s Welcome Kit. Inside is a mat, bowls, a pet ID tag, plastic disposable bags, puppy pads, and dog walking maps. Rooms will have a Pluto \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d door hanger so staff will know that there is a dog in the room.\n\nAnd soon: pet merchandise will be available at four Walt Disney World Resort properties.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3672b70a59f0937f71524ddcf6dcb83bec736ee/c=0-102-1793-1115/local/-/media/2017/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636438822495679621-Disney-1.jpeg?width=1793&height=1013&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/21/USAT/5639f46d-6f1a-4cdf-bd8d-aa1cde5d8058-doorjammer.png?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb81ee65f1040ebc88e516837795f1deb16f315d/c=0-150-1800-2550/local/-/media/2017/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636438822495679621-Disney-1.jpeg?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3672b70a59f0937f71524ddcf6dcb83bec736ee/c=0-102-1793-1115/local/-/media/2017/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636438822495679621-Disney-1.jpeg?width=1793&height=1013&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2017/10/18/pets-now-welcome-disney-world-resorts/774803001/", "title": "Dogs now welcome at Disney World resorts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Dogs now welcome at Disney World resorts", "description": "Select Disney World resorts will let guests check in with dogs.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/roadwarriorvoices/2017/10/18/pets-now-welcome-disney-world-resorts/774803001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3672b70a59f0937f71524ddcf6dcb83bec736ee/c=0-102-1793-1115/local/-/media/2017/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636438822495679621-Disney-1.jpeg?width=1793&height=1013&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1793, "height": 1013}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Nancy Trejos", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Select Disney World resorts will let guests check in with dogs.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3672b70a59f0937f71524ddcf6dcb83bec736ee/c=0-102-1793-1115/local/-/media/2017/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636438822495679621-Disney-1.jpeg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Dogs now welcome at Disney World resorts", "description": "Select Disney World resorts will let guests check in with dogs."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508256000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
