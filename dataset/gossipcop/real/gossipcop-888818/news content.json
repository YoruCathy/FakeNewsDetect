The artist claims that the incident took place at a beach in California following a photoshoot where the director asked her to pose naked.\n\n\u201cAt first I had the understanding I was just going to the beach with my mom. We were there for a little while by ourselves and then he was there,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cAnd she explained that this man wanted to take pictures of me in this fur coat. I thought it was to go into a magazine or something.\u201d\n\nBarnard says that Polanski initially took photos of her wearing a fur coat and a bikini but later asked her to pose naked. \u201cAt some point I realised my mom had gone. I don\u2019t know where she went and I didn\u2019t really register her leaving but she was no longer there. Then he molested me,\u201d she added.\n\nBarnard, who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and claustrophobia as a result of her experiences, felt emboldened to come forward following the scandal surrounding disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein, who denies allegations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault made against him by more than 50 women.\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt terribly conflicted that I have been silent all this time and all these women are bravely coming forward and I thought to myself I can\u2019t in good conscience knowing what I know \u2013 and having gone through what I\u2019ve gone through \u2013 not speak out,\u201d Barnard said. \u201cEven though it puts me in a very bad \u2026 position with my mom and Polanski and other people who are involved, I can\u2019t be silent any more.\u201d\n\nBarnard has made an official report with the Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD) sex crimes unit about the incident and has also launched a petition calling on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revoke Polanski\u2019s membership, as they have done with Weinstein.\n\nSpeaking via his agent, Polanski denied the claims. \u201cI entirely reject the unfounded allegations of Mme. Barnard, of whom I have no knowledge,\u201d the director said.\n\nPolanski remains a fugitive from justice after leaving the US shortly before he was due to stand trial for the sexual assault of a minor in 1977. The director had admitted to unlawful sexual intercourse with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in pre-trial custody, but fled the country, fearing that a plea bargain he had made with prosecutors would be overruled. In June, a superior court judge rejected a request to dismiss the case by Geimer, who says she has forgiven Polanski and wants the incident put to rest \u201cas an act of mercy to myself and my family\u201d.\n\n\n\nSince Geimer\u2019s allegations, the director has faced allegations of sexual assault by three additional women. In 2010, British actor Charlotte Lewis said that Polanski had \u201cforced himself\u201d on her while she was auditioning for a role in Paris in 1983, while this year, two more women have come forward with their own accounts of alleged assault at the hands of the director.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/357a91d585e83bf6891106b4b208d9c95826aec1/0_215_2557_1534/master/2557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3673ed16d04fb6f1b7b22d70360040e", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/357a91d585e83bf6891106b4b208d9c95826aec1/0_215_2557_1534/master/2557.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=c680c3675de0ab5643104c6435577919", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Roman Polanski,Harvey Weinstein,Film,Culture"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/357a91d585e83bf6891106b4b208d9c95826aec1/0_215_2557_1534/master/2557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3673ed16d04fb6f1b7b22d70360040e", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gwilym Mumford"], "canonical_link": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations", "title": "Roman Polanski accused of sexually assaulting 10-year-old girl in 1975", "meta_data": {"description": "Roman%20Polanski%20accused%20of%20sexually%20assaulting%2010-year-old%20girl%20in%201975%20%7C%20Roman%20Polanski%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/357a91d585e83bf6891106b4b208d9c95826aec1/0_215_2557_1534/master/2557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3673ed16d04fb6f1b7b22d70360040e", "description": "Marianne Barnard \u2013 the fifth woman to make abuse allegations against the film director \u2013 claims Polanski molested her in 1975 in California", "type": "article", "title": "Roman Polanski accused of sexually assaulting 10-year-old girl in 1975", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwilym-mumford", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2017-10-23T13:30:35.000Z", "tag": "Roman Polanski,Harvey Weinstein,Film,Culture", "modified_time": "2020-02-24T18:37:29.000Z"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2017/oct/23/roman-polanski-marianne-barnard-allegations?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/357a91d585e83bf6891106b4b208d9c95826aec1/0_215_2557_1534/master/2557.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=a84db7a1423908991467071a422bf35b", "site": "@guardian", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508688000.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
