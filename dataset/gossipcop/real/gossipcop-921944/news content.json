The film, which stars Chadwick Boseman and is directed by Ryan Coogler, has amassed more than 35 million tweets.\n\n\"Black Panther\" Twitter chatter was loud enough to topple two other box office hits that held the title from a galaxy far, far away: \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" and \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi.\"\n\nIn January, Kendrick Lamar fired off what is now the most-retweeted \"Black Panther\" tweet ever when he posted to Twitter the track list to the film's soundtrack, which was curated and produced by the Grammy-winning rapper. \"Black Panther The Album 2/9,\" Lamar wrote in the tweet, which has now been retweeted more than 240,000 times.\n\nBlack Panther The Album 2/9 pic.twitter.com/MqhsEcj6iF \u2014 Kendrick Lamar (@kendricklamar) January 31, 2018\n\nThe film, which is Marvel's first to be directed by an African-American, opened to a record-breaking $201.8 million in North America last month. That's the largest opening for an African-American director ever.\n\nSince then, \"Black Panther\" has gone on to take on the global box office by storm.\n\nRelated: 'Black Panther' to cross $1 billion worldwide in less than a month\n\nIt took only 26 days for \"Black Panther\" to crack $1 billion at the global box office, and since opening last month the film has been at the top of the box office five weeks in a row.\n\nSo far the film has made more than $1.1 billion worldwide.\n\nThe film also holds a 97% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, making it one of the best-reviewed comic book films in history.", "images": ["http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/authors/byline-icon/frank-pallotta.png", "http://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnnbusiness.png", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201120814-black-panther-3-780x439.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/newsletters/reliable_sources/rs-with-button_large1x1.jpg", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif", "http://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnn.svg", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170503120510-marvel-studios-umbrella-1024x576.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201120814-black-panther-3-780x439.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "canonical_link": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/20/media/black-panther-twitter/index.html", "title": "'Black Panther' is the most tweeted about movie ever", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140", "date": "2018-03-20 02:32:27", "title": "'Black Panther' is the most tweeted about movie ever", "description": "\"Black Panther,\" the Disney and Marvel Studios blockbuster, has amassed more than 35 million tweets, according to Twitter.", "keywords": "Black Panther, Disney, Marvel, Marvel Studios, Twitter, CNN, CNNMoney, Frank Pallotta", "news_keywords": "Black Panther, Disney, Marvel, Marvel Studios, Twitter, CNN, CNNMoney, Frank Pallotta", "author": "Frank Pallotta", "section": "media", "og": {"title": "'Black Panther' is the most tweeted about movie ever", "type": "article", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/20/media/black-panther-twitter/index.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201120814-black-panther-3-780x439.jpg", "width": 780, "height": 439}, "site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "\"Black Panther,\" the Disney and Marvel Studios blockbuster, has amassed more than 35 million tweets, according to Twitter."}, "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNMoney", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/20/media/black-panther-twitter/index.html", "title": "'Black Panther' is the most tweeted about movie ever", "description": "\"Black Panther,\" the Disney and Marvel Studios blockbuster, has amassed more than 35 million tweets, according to Twitter.", "image": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/180201120814-black-panther-3-540x304.jpg"}, "DC.date.issued": "2018-03-20T02:32:27"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521475200.0, "source": "http://money.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
