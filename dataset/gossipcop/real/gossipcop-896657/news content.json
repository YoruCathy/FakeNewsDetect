She will also start the process of becoming a British citizen prior to the marriage \u2014 a process that involves her applying for a spousal visa and could take several years.\n\nAD\n\nStill, many questions remain: What specific day in May will they wed? What title will Markle take after the marriage? Who will be on the guest list? Will there be a sea of dazzling hats in the audience?\n\nAD\n\nWe are told that more details will follow in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nMany royal watchers said that St George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor \u2014 a charming city about 20 miles west of London \u2014 was the most likely venue for the wedding. The chapel is contained inside the walls of Windsor Castle, and has been the setting for other royal weddings, including Harry\u2019s cousin Peter Phillips, who married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian, in 2008.\n\nWhen Harry\u2019s father, Prince Charles, married Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005, they held a civil ceremony in Windsor but afterward had a service of blessing at the chapel.\n\nAD\n\nHarry's spokesman told reporters at a briefing in London on Tuesday that Windsor was a \"special place for them.\u201d It\u2019s also where Harry was baptized.\n\nIn the meantime, palace officials said that the couple will \u201cundertake their first official engagement\u201d together in Nottingham on Friday where they will mark World AIDS Day by meeting organizations supporting people living with HIV/AIDS.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPrince Harry is looking forward to introducing Ms. Markle to a community that has become very special to him,\u201d Kensington Palace tweeted.\n\nIt will be Markle\u2019s first outing in her new role. During an interview broadcast Monday on BBC, Markle was asked about giving up her acting career. She recently wrapped up filming in the legal drama \"Suits.\u201d\n\nAD", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHK5OXBQHY6HLAI4JYCMKNEE5M.jpg&w=150", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/f87cfca4-5656-47df-9be9-83cb6ec9ad1f.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dm_oqjl4awWpIFactDNuYAvzRGA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHK5OXBQHY6HLAI4JYCMKNEE5M.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dm_oqjl4awWpIFactDNuYAvzRGA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHK5OXBQHY6HLAI4JYCMKNEE5M.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/28/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-pick-a-date-and-place-windsor-castle-in-may/", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "meta_data": {"description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/28/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-pick-a-date-and-place-windsor-castle-in-may/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Dm_oqjl4awWpIFactDNuYAvzRGA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RHK5OXBQHY6HLAI4JYCMKNEE5M.jpg", "title": "Analysis | Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analysis | Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-25T23:10:50.049Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511798400.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
