She says her family struggled to get by when she was growing up and she turned to food for comfort. Because of her size, she says some of the most difficult experiences she had during her childhood revolved around back-to-school shopping.\n\n\u201cIt was terrible. I had to settle for clothes. I wanted cute little cutoff shorts, but I had to get the longer ones because of my thighs. I thought, \u2018Maybe I could cut them and maybe I could make them my own,\u2019\u201d she told People magazine last year. \u201cIt was really hard. My younger sister is thin and she would always be wearing cute clothes, so I had no one to talk to.\u201d\n\nNow, Metz isn\u2019t afraid to wear what she wants and show off her personality in her fashion choices. For example, the latex dress she wore at the MTV Movie & TV Awards that she said made people \u201cget rowdy\u201d.\n\nWhere To Get Some Of Metz\u2019s Best Looks For Yourself\n\nDespite now having access to some of the world\u2019s most in-demand designers and labels, Metz has revealed she shops at popular plus-size clothing stores, like Eloquii, where she purchased a $139 tie-neck ruffle-sleeve dress that she wore at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards. In this case, Metz\u2019s stylist did make the dress slightly longer, but the original can be purchased online.\n\nGetty Images | Frazer Harrison\n\nShe also wore a faux leather jacket to her 36th birthday party from Avenue. While that jacket appears to no longer be available, the retailer has other coats online that cost $100 or less.\n\nThe latest fashion news from the star is even better for anyone that\u2019s looking to replicate her style. Loft, the sister brand of Ann Taylor, is now offering plus-size clothing and Metz has already been seen in two of its dresses.\n\nIn September 2017, Metz wore a polka dot wrap midi dress for an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers.\u201d The cost? Only $89!\n\nAnother $89 find that the actress has been seen wearing is the paisley wrap midi dress from Loft, which she rocked at a pre-Golden Globe Awards party in January.\n\nGetty Images | Phillip Faraone\n\nLoft Plus has sizes ranging from 16 to 26, with prices from about $20 to $110. The entire line is available online.\n\nBefore she found her style through custom outfits and plus-size clothing lines, Metz told People magazine she used to design her own, \u201cbecause otherwise you\u2019d look like someone\u2019s grandma and you\u2019re 14.\u201d\n\nNow, the actress says she is even planning a clothing line for the future to help all women, regardless of their size, feel confident in what they\u2019re wearing.\n\n\u201cWe need to be specific about how clothing fits different body shapes,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cI want to show personality, and make something that I want to wear. If I don\u2019t want to wear it, I would not want to sell it.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Matt Winkelmeyer\n\nHow could you not love Chrissy Metz?
