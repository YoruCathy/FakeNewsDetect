Kailyn Lowry shared her relationship regrets and revealed that she was \u201chooking up\u201d with ex-husband Javi Marroquin while they considered a reconciliation.\n\nThe Teen Mom 2 star opened up about her relationship with Marroquin in a series of tweets on Saturday, June 2. \u201cJavi & I talked about getting back together at one point. Why? I don\u2019t know because we both knew we didn\u2019t want to & it would never work,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI regret even having those conversations. I regret filming about it. And hooking up w him as I know people from the reunion leaked that.\u201d\n\n2- Javi & i talked about getting back together at one point. Why? I don\u2019t know because we both knew we didn\u2019t want to & it would never work. I regret even having those conversations. I regret filming about it. And hooking up w him as i know people from the reunion leaked that. \u2014 Kailyn Lowry (@KailLowry) June 3, 2018\n\nMarroquin, 25, recently announced that he is expecting a child with girlfriend Lauren Comeau, and Lowry wished them well, adding: \u201cThat being said, I am wishing him and his new family the best. I have no hard feelings about the baby whatsoever despite what people are saying.\u201d\n\nLowry spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about the situation. \u201cBeing on the show for so long, I get the ability to look back (literally) at decisions I\u2019ve made and really reflect on my life. There are a lot of things I\u2019ve been regretting lately,\u201d she told Us. \u201cAs for Javi, the timeline is so messy. I regret ever revisiting our past and even speaking about a reconciliation. We\u2019ve always made better friends than romantic partners. And I do wish him and his family the best.\u201d\n\nThe reality TV star also tweeted that she is now choosing to focus on herself and removing all \u201ctoxic people and situations\u201d from her life. \u201cFor anyone, fans & supporters included, that I\u2019ve hurt or offended, I apologize,\u201d she added. \u201cSometimes I have to look at a situation & be honest with myself & I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve handled things the right way lately. Soooo I\u2019m starting over.\u201d\n\nAlluding to her relationship with ex-girlfriend Dominique Potter, she added: \u201cAlso \u2013 don\u2019t lead people on. I\u2019ve been lead on & I\u2019ve lead people on. Nobody benefits from it. Hooking up with someone else won\u2019t get you over your ex.\u201d\n\nMarroquin reunited with Comeau this March after previously dating. He had been in a relationship with Teen Mom 2 star Briana DeJesus, but they split in January.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1440px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1440px%2C813px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1440px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kailyn-lowry-reveals-she-was-hooking-up-with-ex-javi-marroquin/", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Reveals She Was \u2018Hooking Up\u2019 With Ex Javi Marroquin", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Kailyn Lowry revealed she was recently 'hooking up' with ex-husband Javi Marroquin, and they were considering getting back together \u2014 details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Was \u2018Hooking Up\u2019 Again With Ex Javi Marroquin", "description": "Kailyn Lowry revealed she was recently 'hooking up' with ex-husband Javi Marroquin, and they were considering getting back together \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kailyn-lowry-reveals-she-was-hooking-up-with-ex-javi-marroquin/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-03T18:05:23+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1440px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1440px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-06-03T16:10:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-03T18:05:23+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kailyn Lowry revealed she was recently 'hooking up' with ex-husband Javi Marroquin, and they were considering getting back together \u2014 details", "title": "Kailyn Lowry Was \u2018Hooking Up\u2019 Again With Ex Javi Marroquin", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kailyn-lowry-javi-marroquin.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1440px%2C756px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528042225.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
