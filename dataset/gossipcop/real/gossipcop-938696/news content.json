Chrissy Teigen shaded President Donald Trump after a judge ruled that it\u2019s unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users.\n\nThe commander in chief, 71, made headlines in July 2017 for blocking the former model, 32, on the social media platform after years of her trolling his feed. Teigen teased Trump again on Wednesday, May 23, by sharing a video of herself watching an MSNBC report detailing the ruling.\n\n\u201cWell well well we meet again @realDonaldTrump,\u201d the cookbook author captioned the clip.\n\nTeigen hasn\u2019t shied away from voicing her disdain for the real estate magnate. Back in January, she hilariously Snapchatted herself hosting Trump\u2019s \u201cMost Dishonest & Corrupt Media Awards of the Year,\u201d which she jokingly promised to host earlier that month.\n\nLast June, the Lip Sync Battle host told the Celebrity Apprentice alum to \u201cgrow the f\u2014k up\u201d after he bashed a New York Times story about his stance on the Senate health bill.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t stop there. Earlier that year, Teigen slammed Trump\u2019s views on immigration after he tweeted, \u201cWe must keep \u2018evil\u2019 out of this country.\u201d She wasted no time before snapping back, \u201cWhat time should we call your uber?\u201d\n\nThe Sports Illustrated stunner opened up about her feud with the hotel mogul during a February 2017 interview with USA Today. \u201cI\u2019ve been [trolling him] forever and I take pride in that. I can\u2019t believe somebody could actually do this all day, every day, and still be president,\u201d she quipped at the time. \u201cIf I mysteriously go missing in the next four years, then that\u2019s what happened.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-09-at-11.48.30-AM.png?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/woman-eating-bar1-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=200%2C113&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-download.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_1701843913-1.jpg?w=100&h=100&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chrissy-teigen-trolls-donald-trump-over-twitter-blocking-rule/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Trolls Donald Trump Over Twitter Blocking Rule", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "msvalidate.01": "097DBAAF43A9B61E9E4259AA7D75B069", "description": "Chrissy Teigen shaded President Donald Trump after a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users \u2014 get the details", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Trolls Donald Trump Over Twitter Blocking Rule", "description": "Chrissy Teigen shaded President Donald Trump after a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chrissy-teigen-trolls-donald-trump-over-twitter-blocking-rule/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-05-24T18:58:59+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1785612128341436}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Chrissy Teigen shaded President Donald Trump after a federal judge ruled it unconstitutional for him to block Twitter users \u2014 get the details", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Trolls Donald Trump Over Twitter Blocking Rule", "site": "@usweekly", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/chrissy-teigen-donald-trump.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1", "creator": "@usweekly"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527188339.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
