I really love this show and I can't believe this is its last season it seems like it just started yesterday... Goodbye wizards:(\n\nGravity Falls is so much better, Cartoons are supposed to be the most popular genre on Disney Channel, and that's what Gravity Falls is, and it doesn't have a repetitive plot like Phineas and Ferb does. I will really miss. Especially alex russo played by Selena Gomez. I will miss the whole atmosphere of waiting for a new episode. I shall cry on the last episode. I wish I was BFF with Selena because she is a great actor and singer but I prefer her as an actor.\n\n\n\nI hope the have another movie...\n\n\n\nLove you WOWP\n\n\n\nYou were the best show ever\n\n\n\nReally miss can't believe it is over.. I can still remember watching the first episode and being gripped and not being able to say Waverley properly when I told my friends about the amazing show Wizards of Waverly Place is a really good show. It even relates to Harry Potter a little. It has vampires, werewolfs, and a pot of monsters just like Harry Potter does. They both involve magic and are both about teenagers lives This and Girl Meets World are the best Disney Channel shows ever! I love Wizards of Waverly Place, and Alex Russo is an amazing character! I also think Harper and Malex are great.\n\nThe Suite Life of Zack and Cody The Suite Life of Zack & Cody is an American sitcom created by Danny Kallis and Jim Geoghan. The series was first broadcast on Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, with 4 million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for Disney Channel in 2005. It was one of their first five shows available on ...read more. I LOVE THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY!\n\nSo sad it's ending... :'( It was very good, but doesn't compare to Gravity Falls as a matter of fact, but you'll have to go to Disney to watch it, since that's where they moved it, which was so dumb of them. This is best show ever, it was so funny. I miss it so much, I miss Dylan and Cole Brenda Debby. I like Debby's new show but I miss suit life of Zack and Cody. This show didn't have Debby. This show was much better than that one. And gravity falls is terrible. THE SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY IS 1 OF MY FAVOURITE SHOW AND EVERYDAY I WATCH THIS SHOW FROM 50 TO 60, I WISH THAT I WOULD ALSO HAVE A TWIN BROTHER LIKE THEM... I JUST WANNA SAY 5 WORDS FOR YOU... ZACK AND CODY YOU ROCK You are WRONG, It's not the best show ever, the best show on Disney Channel as a matter of fact is Gravity Falls, Just watch it please, everybody loves it more than any other Disney Channel show. This show was one of my favorites when I was a kid! I recently watched a few episodes late at night (yes, it does air on Disney Channel now but at night haha! ) and I still laugh at their jokes to this day.\n\n\n\nWhat makes this show great is the fact that even though the characters can be stereotypical and all (like, London can be very annoying, but that was until I watched the recent shows on Disney Channel), they have their redeeming qualities that are highlighted well. Even though London, for example, is the typical rich, greedy child who complains all the time and gets what she wants, we are reminded later in the show several times why she is like that, and that she can be kind at times and not ALWAYS who she comes off as. Plus, Zack and Cody are so charming and their lives are so interesting and always adventurous.\n\nGood Luck Charlie Good Luck Charlie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from April 4, 2010, to February 16, 2014. The series' creators, Phil Baker and Drew Vaupen, wanted to create a program that would appeal to entire families, not just children. Good luck Charlie is, in my opinion, one of the best shows on Disney at the moment. It's hilarious, it's something everyone all ages will enjoy! BEST SHOW EVER! Good lick Charlie is my favorite show! It is the best show. It should definitely be #1 I can't believe this is ranked 18! In my opinion, Good Luck Charlie is hilarious, enjoyable for all ages. It's a great show. I love good luck charlie very much because is about a family that going to have a another baby that name charlie and everybody need be good and kind so all this funny thing and something that normal family should have. I'm so happy that Good Luck Charlie is leagues higher than Austin and Ally. Unlike Austin and Ally, this is the most thoughtful sitcom ever that changes the lives of its viewers. The best part: laugh tracks are not misused, but rather used after all of the real family jokes. I literally burst into laughter when I saw Bob's legendary catch of Charlie in the first episode of Season 1. Furthermore, Teddy's video diaries teach such valuable life lessons on friendship and bullying. Unlike the modern family-centered sitcoms like Dog With a Blog where the parents endorse a negligent attitude, the parents are the opposite in this one; Amy and Bob actually care about their kids and the sitcom actually focuses on normal family matters. You definitely want to binge watch this sitcom because this one delivers a lot of serious yet positive messages. I sobbed when I saw the GLC finale 2014. Fingers crossed for a potential GLC spinoff.\n\nGravity Falls Gravity Falls is an American animated television series produced by Disney Television Animation that first aired on Disney Channel, and then on Disney XD from June 15, 2012 to February 15, 2016. The series follows the adventures of Dipper Pines and his twin sister Mabel in the fictional town of Gravity ...read more. UM, HELLO?! Wake up from your coma people! Gravity Falls is Way better than Ant Farm and Jesse, and Austin and Ally!\n\n\n\nIt's the perfect setting for a kid around Dipper's age. He battles with his desire to be mature along with his awkwardness, something all kids will go through. His crush on Wendy is an amazing aspect that drives his desires to act more like a teenager, but he simply can't because it simply ISN'T that mature yet! It's just brilliant! (not to mention my favorite line when Stan says \"now you know about the birds and the bees\")\n\n\n\nNot to mention that the theme is way more intriguing than any Disney show on nowadays. It has plot lines way deeper than Disney shows will normally go, especially with \"Dreamscapers\" and \"Gideon Rises\". I mean, Austin and Ally rated better than Gravity Falls! That show is shit. The plot is always about either Austin or Ally trying to do some gig, but they run into trouble and fix it! It got boring quickly, ...more You got everything right. Gravity Falls is just outstanding. The mystery, the music, the characters and settings. It's the best Disney cartoon the channel has had in ages! WHAT!? This show is the best show Disney has right now! I remember when Alex Hirsch worked on the Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and voiced Captain K'nuckles, so when I heard the he was working on a new show, I had to take a look. I can't believe how amazing this show is. Animation wise, its perfectly done and the character design isn't to outlandish or too realistic. Now my take on the characters:\n\n\n\nDipper-A perfect representation of a 12 year old. He's logical and curious, but still trying to wrap his head around growing up. I'd have to say his entire attitude around having a crush on Wendy is way to perfect. always anxious and on the edge. Too good\n\n\n\nMabel- What can I say. eccentric, energetic, adorable and silly. But, seriously, she's the perfect type of person to be the twin of dipper. She's always really bright and upbeat. She can be pretty funny too honestly. Their personalities are so colliding, but they still remember their brother and sister. If anything in ...more This show is one of the best Disney Channel shows I've seen in years. I personally think even Phineas and Ferb can't beat it.\n\n\n\nThe best part is the cast of characters. Dipper is logical, Mabel is eccentric, Grunkle Stan (short for Great Uncle Stan) is a scam-artist but still warm-hearted, Soos is the strange but funny maintenance guy at Stan's Mystery Shack, and Wendy is the chill and awesome teenage girl who works at the Mystery Shack, too.\n\n\n\nThis show provides many funny moments for people of all ages, whether it be the fact that Mabel is eating hallucinogenic candy or there are gnomes barfing rainbows on your screen. I think this will be Disney's best show so far. I love it. There are a lot of mysteries and secret stuff in the show. It's funny and has a lot of references. It's mysterious and the whole show is a mystery, which you can solve if you follow all of the clues. I feel that this show will be like Avatar the Last Airbender on Nickelodeon, it will and has attract all sorts of viewers, not just kids. This is really good in the long run.\n\nThat's So Raven That's So Raven is an American supernatural teen sitcom television series. It debuted on the Disney Channel on January 17, 2003, and ended its run on November 10, 2007. The show had a spin-off series, Cory in the House. The series was nominated in 2005 and 2007 for Emmy Awards for Outstanding Children's ...read more. THIS WAS THE BEST SHOW EVER ON DISNEY, THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER SHOW LIKE THIS ON DISNEY. ALL OF THESE NEW SHOWS ON DISNEY ARE JUST FAKE COPIES OF OLD DISNEY SHOWS.\n\nThis show was amazing. It brings back so many wonderful memories when I was a child. There coming put wit a sequel. So happy. That's is so raven Omg, this is 100% hilarious, Its the best tv show in the whole wide world! Back 2 back episodes like these are quite amusing and is the best Disney Dhow and successful show in Disney usually it finishes at 1-65 episodes but it had 100 episodes and achieved lots of positive reviews and did you know that That's so raven had won an image award in 2008 and won all these magnificent awards: Outstanding children awards 2008,2007, Best children's T. V programming, Favorite television actress twice in 2004 and 2005 and Best T. V series of the year 2008 and Best season of the year 2008 and Best comedy series 2008 and 2007 this show revolves around A lovely female that is a psychic that usually has a unique point of view of her predictions what happens and in the end (mostly) turn out successful or extremely funny! This show overall is the best! No offense but this should be number 1 and is filled with love and also success this T. V series number 2 should be Hannah Montana then Wizards of waverly place and phineas and ferb because this show got nominated lot's of ...more Wait, wait, wait, what the hell is Wizards of Waverly Place doing at the top of this list? I'm not saying Wizards is particularly bad, it's just that I think it's far from the best show on this list. Moreover, I think the whole idea of the show, being about \"having magic powers that must be kept secret\" is AWFULLY similar to the idea of That's So Raven. And, frankly, Raven does it better.\n\n\n\nWhy? Because Raven didn't \"jump the shark.\" It was a show that was consistently good from beginning to end. It also never brought us \"out of the real world,\" whereas Wizards was constantly throwing you into magical realms with crazy plot lines of being kept in a gov. facility, doing some weird wizards competition, a having totally unnecessary werewolf and vampire secondary characters. Suddenly the show stopped being about a teenager overcoming life's problems, and started being a fantasy epic about harnessing your inner power to save the universe.\n\n\n\n... Wait, ...more\n\nThe Suite Life On Deck The Suite Life on Deck is an American sitcom that aired on Disney Channel from September 26, 2008 to May 6, 2011. It is a sequel/spin-off of the Disney Channel Original Series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. This show should be the best! I can't believe it ended! They should make \"The Suite Life In College\"! Yes, I wish that could happen, sadly, they're all grown up. Heck, Dylan and Cole Sprouse graduated last year! It was a great show, it was extremely funny! I'm sad to let it go. I remember growing up with suite life of zach and cody this is the best plot ever! I mean the love story the comedy the irony and sarcasm it clearly must be no. 1! Sailing Away from Boston... The ONLY Disney Channel Show on a cruise ship so far, It shoul be 1\n\nKim Possible Kim Possible is an American animated children's television series created by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle for Disney Channel. It's my favorite show, I love ron and rufus. I am crazy about this show, I love ron, rufus, and kim to Most loveable show filled with all you want, ron is the best Warning: This show contains well developed characters, original story lines, tons of humor, and awesome animation. Not meant for those who live a boring lifestyle void of fun and enjoyment. Do not allow children to watch due to the danger that they might get hooked on this great show. Do not allow them to watch due to the danger that they might attempt to imitate Kim's butt-kicking talents which include olympic level gymnastics and tumbling skills, knowing 16 styles of kung fu, skydiving, cliff climbing, grappling, dodging energy comet-powered plasma blasts, escape unharmed through A...\n\n\n\nOkay, now that that's over, in case there was any confusion, everything above were all huge complements. Great show, great chracters, great animation, well you get the point. Kim does show her midriff most of the time through seasons 1-3, but other than that, awesomest, most badical show ever on Disney.\n\nPhineas and Ferb Phineas and Ferb is an American animated comedy-musical television series. Originally broadcast as a one-episode preview on August 17, 2007 and again previewed on September 28, 2007, the series officially premiered on February 1, 2008 and ended on June 12, 2015 on Disney Channel, and follows Phineas ...read more. Phineas And Ferb is my favorite Disney show on Disney Channel, I like this show more than Fish Hooks. This is the only good and also only cartoon on Disney Channel, well not just Phineas And Ferb... Gravity Falls was pretty good and was a cartoon too. Anyways I love Phineas And Ferb because it's funny, great animation, awesome and has great characters! Phineas and Ferb are cool main characters, Cadence is however funny when shes trying to bust her brother laugh out loud and falling in love with Jermy, Perry aka Agent P is a pretty cool Platypus, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is funny too and always fail with his inators, Isabella is adorable and cute when she is in love with Phineas and all the characters are very creative! Even the quotes are funny, for an example \"Aren't you a little young to _____\" or \"Curse you Perry the platypus! \" I even enjoy the songs, my favorite song in there is Goochie Goochie Goo. If this show was cancelled then I will not be happy, Phineas And ...more It's stupid, all that happens is nothing but a repeat, the same thing happens in EVERY episode and that's the reason why it's so hated. I love this show I even have phineas and ferb silly bands they are so big that they fit around my neck It's stupid to watch, the plot is always the same, Disney ran out of ideas. This must be FIRST HERE! D:! Love all the songs, theme story and of course the characters! ^o^ its funny, amazing and brilliant This should be first.. I love Phineas And Ferb because their plot is brilliant, they're funny, and they rock. I don't watch anything other than Phineas And Ferb on Disney, the Disney T.V. shows are now all dumb sitcoms, and Phineas and Ferb isn't. What I like about it is that anyone can watch it. For example, my 23 year old brother loves Phineas and Ferb, and my 5 year old cousin also loves Phineas and Ferb. What I also like about it is that they have those ' adult ' reference jokes, so older people would get attracted to the show as well. I love this show, and in my opinion, this show beats any show on Disney, it's humorous AND it inspires people to create anything they want. I love them!\n\nHannah Montana Hannah Montana, also known as Hannah Montana Forever for the fourth and final season, is an American musical comedy series created by Michael Poryes, Rich Correll, and Barry O'Brien which focused on Miley Stewart, a teenager living a double life as an average schoolgirl by day and a famous recording ...read more. I love miley cyrus aka hannah montana I'm sad that hannah montana is gone This show has the most views and ratings for a reason it's AWESOME! And no other Disney show can be compared to it it because of this show that shows like wizards and sonny were created. I love hannah and miley. Never will be a show better. Wish it was still showing. Wizards of Waverly place will never get that big. Miley cyrus rocks. Awesome show nothing can hold a candle to it, plus it had Disney's biggest breakout star of all time Miley Cyrus in it.\n\nJessie Jessie is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from September 30, 2011 to October 16, 2015. The series was created and executive produced by Pamela Eells O'Connell and stars Debby Ryan as Jessie Prescott, a small town Texas girl who moves to New York City to try to become an actress, ...read more. 10 This is the best show ever. It should be at least the sixth best or something. I love this show. Jessie is how. And luke and dance so well. @ two most recent replies, yes, this show DOES have racist elements, in addition to the stereotypes. Zuri is racist to African-Americans and Ravi is racist to Indians. And to the person who said that this is best, no, Liv and Maddie is the best! And it's so hypocritical that this is #10 on THIS list and #6 on the WORST Disney Channel Shows list. Seriously, HOW does that make sense? I hate how no one on this site can even make up their ever loving MINDS on whether or not shows like this are good or bad. For me, it's neither. It's not the best because it has other bad qualities besides the racism and stereotypes, but it has good qualities too. But for me, Liv and Maddie does it all better. So why can't Liv and Maddie be the most loved show instead?! Even though it DOES have stereotypes like Jessie, but my mom says that EVERY show and movie has stereotypes! However, they DO seem offensive in Jessie, but not in Liv and Maddie. How is Jessie lower than Phineas and Ferb? Phineas and Ferb teaches kids the already debunked lesson that creativity should be limited and the Phineas and Ferb plot is too repetitive. However, the plot in Jessie is varied. In fact, the serious and positive messages outweigh the negative ones. Most importantly, this show teaches viewers to have faith in themselves because their families certainly have their backs. Another perfect example of a sitcom where laugh tracks are used after real jokes and not misused after the fake ones. While some people believe that the acting is poor, this show teaches important leadership lessons on how to cope with critical situations like when you are confronted with disrespectful people. This show is as good as Good Luck Charlie. Cameron Boyce's death literally made me sob that I literally wanted to binge watch this creative idea for a sitcom in order to honor his legacy and pay respect. This should be higher up. This show sucks. It's about a crazy lady women who gets thrown outta a taxi and finds a super nice penthouse to live in. But she has to take care of a bunch of crazy stupid spoiled brats who run around on stupid idiotic adventures with their fat butler who likes cheese and is lazy. And the crazy lady girl is from Texas. Out of no where. The crazy lady girl wants to be an actress but she sucks and cries and is sad. Then she struggles between her acting carrier and her flirty guy boyfriend who is weird and stupid and she breaks up with him like 20 times and almost gets married to someone but then says no and like this crazy lady girl is crazy. I am obsessed with jessie its the best show ever plus emma is so pretty. I wish it would actually show a little bit more of new york but because it only shows central park which gets boring. It's actually the most racist show on Disney Channel, it's horrible.\n\nThe Newcomers\n\n? Parker Plays\n\nThe Contenders\n\nAustin & Ally Austin & Ally is an American teen sitcom that premiered on Disney Channel on December 2, 2011, and ended on January 10, 2016. The series was created by Kevin Kopelow & Heath Seifert, the writers and producers of the Disney Channel sitcoms Sonny with a Chance and Jonas. 11 Let me start out by asking a few questions regarding where this is placed. 1) Why is this higher than Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens, Cory in the House and basically every other show on this list. I Don't quite understand how this show made the top 10 for best Disney Channel shows ever.\n\n\n\n2) What was going on in the person's head who made this show? I don't not think that this show deserves to be this high in the list. I am not saying that you are not in titled to your own opinion I am just saying that I don't particularly like this show.\n\n\n\nI am not actually bothered by many of the actors, hence the word \"by many\". There is really only one actor I hate on this show. Laura Morano. In my opinion I just don't really like her. I love Ross Lynch, and I am okay with Raini and Calum. Laura in my opinion can't sing. Her voice is like she is talking with just more breath behind her voice. She always makes the weirdest faces when she sings and smiles way to much and way to ...more Okay for my last reply it's my own honest opinion and for those who may hate me or whatever and send out replies saying that I'm wrong well I don't care I can respect your opinions as best as I can may be for those who may possibly hate me and say those things maybe you should respect mine too. I must admit, I didn't like as much of the music and season 1. But then season 2 came, and BAM! Don't Look Down, You Can Come To Me, I Think About You, Finally Me- it trended on twitter! Austin & Ally is really one of the last good shows on Disney. There is so much character development- somehow this show also wounded up on the top 10 WORST Disney Channel shows, and one if the reasons is no character development which I don't understand. Ally overcame her stage fright, there is supposed to be an arc in which Austin starts writing songs, everyone (except Dez) is maturing just a little bit. It's not all rainbows and unicorns in it either- there is actually drama. And it has a purpose. It doesn't seem like it in the first episode- but they actually work to get where they are. As unrealistic as it is to be an overnight sensation, after all if that the team has to work. Unlike on Shake It Up, it might be just me, but lately it just seems like everything comes easy to them. On Jessie, I ...more I love it! It's so funny some people don't give it a chance! I also love Ross! He is so hot and he I love the music on the show Why is this thing on here? For those of you who think this is a funny sitcom because of the laugh tracks, it's not a legitimate excuse for a sitcom! Laugh tracks are misused after Dez's communication failures in order to make people laugh and binge watch this weak excuse for a Disney show! Ally is insecure and doesn't know how to stand up to others. Austin influences viewers to exploit other people just to make money off of their career, and Trish is a bossy businesswoman who constantly gets fired due to her negligent attitude! Laugh tracks should be used after real jokes. Or even better, cut laugh tracks off of future sitcoms! TAKE THIS OFF!\n\nLizzie McGuire Elizabeth Brooke McGuire, famously known as Lizzie, is the main character in the show. She is portrayed as a caring, rational, and cooperative person, although her animated alter-ego displays her true feelings from time to time. 12 Best show ever, Hilary is one of the few childhood stars who still respects themselves! Also Lizzie McGuire is the best show ever made on Disney! They never bring it on any more even though it the best show ever PLEZ vote 4 it Lizzie is the Best\n\nHer shows should come again\n\nI Love Her,\n\nEAST OR WEST, LIZZIE IS ONE OF THE BEST, BEST & BEST Dealt with serious issues that shows nowadays wouldn't teach kids\n\nSonny With a Chance Sonny with a Chance is an American sitcom created by Steve Marmel which aired for two seasons on Disney Channel from February 8, 2009 to January 2, 2011. The series follows the experiences of teenager Sonny Munroe, portrayed by Demi Lovato, who becomes the newest accepted cast member of her favorite ...read more. 13 I love sonny with a chance because I can relate to it I can sing plus though thing seem hard when your a newcomer you will fit in and persevere and that's what I did. I thank you so much demi lovato you are my idol. I just love this show and I wish that its second season I am just waiting for its season <2 demi rocks and Demi and Sterling couple is so cute... The best and least stupid of the Disney Channel shows. Demi Lovato is a rare gem and the supporting cast is fantastic (which is good since she is leaving the show). Would like to see if they can keep up their momentum in the second season. I definitely think this is the best Disney channel show but all the old Disney shows from 2006-2011 were really good what I love about this show is the cast Demi lovato can sing and act she is crazy talented and Tiffany Thornton was hilarious plus the show was relatable maybe not the fact that there on a to show but the pressures teens like me face and we may not be on a to show but we r looked at and judged by the people around us constantly wether we like it or not and we all go through relationship issues even if they seem silly this is my personal favourite Disney show I have watched each episode about a hundred times and I'm not bored I learn something new every time I watch it x by the way girl meets world is a great show too x\n\nStar vs. the Forces of Evil \"Star vs. the Forces of Evil\" is an American animated television comedy produced by Disney Television Animation for Disney XD. It was created by Daron Nefcy and developed by Jordana Arkin and Dave Wasson. The series follows teenage magical princess from the dimension of Mewni Star Butterfly and her ...read more. 14 The fact that this got lower than bonkers hurts me! Star Vs the forces of evil is good. It wants to be the next gravity falls and with the serious moments such as Mewnipendence day and Storm The castle showing it might actually be. Its formula is odd sometimes it wnats to be funny and sometimes serious and sometimes stupid. whereas Gravity falls decided to go for funny in its first season and you get warmed up for when it drills you with serious in season 2 star vs the forces of evil doesn't have a such secure formula\n\n\n\nIts still a great show to watch when gravity falls isn't on and I'm perfectly fine with gravity falls being cancelled if more shows like Star surface take its place It's a really great show in this garbage of bad animations. Yet, it has to improve. The plot is kinda feels like it does not exist in first few episodes but time to time, it will definitely get better. It is funny and very creative. I enjoy watching this show a lot. I consider it as Gravity Falls and Steven Universe's baby. If you like these shows, you will love it. I HATE shows without plot because I think it makes no sense. In last few episodes you can see character developments and leaks from the actual plot. I think it is starting now.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it grows on you, you either love or hate this show. If you have a child's spirit, I can guarantee that you will absolutely love this show which makes you feel yourself like a little kid again who waves a wand around and screams spells.\n\n\n\nIt has to improve to get better and I believe it will.\n\n\n\nP.S.: If you are a Fangirl, GO AND WATCH WITHOUT THINKING. THIS SHOW IS MADE FOR YOU, FOR US. AND SHIP STARCO! What this show is so much better then everything on this list other than phineas and ferb and gravity falls Better than wander over yonder.\n\nLiv and Maddie Liv and Maddie is a live-action Disney Channel sitcom that started on July 19, 2013, and ended on March 24, 2017. It is about two identical twin sisters named Olivia \"Liv\" Rooney and Madison \"Maddie\" Rooney (both portrayed by actress Dove Olivia Cameron; born in January 1996 as Chloe Celeste Hosterman) ...read more. 15 Liv and Maddie is not that different from the other Disney Channel shows, the comedy doesn't exist, yet they play laugh tracks on it, the dialogue is very weak in sense and is pretty nonsense, the camera quality is very choppy, like the other sitcoms, which makes this show, like the others, look like a movie from the 80's/90's, There's no good background music or suspense like the classics, it's very un-Disneylike, Disney Channel was supposed to be about Disney Characters and adventures and good plots and stories, and That went away and got replaced with stupid teenybopping shows like Hannah Montana, Shake It Up, ANT Farm, and THIS! Liv and Maddie, although That's So Raven, Cory in the House, Lizzie McGuire, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, The Suite Life on Deck, Sonny with a Chance, Pair of Kings (Seasons 1 to 2), Zeke and Luther and Wizards of Waverly Place were good, It sucks, you ruined a good channel it once was, the only good show on Disney Channel now is Gravity Falls, which ...more Dove Cameron's performance in this is seriously one of the best performances in the entire Disney channel Also with liv and Maddie I just finished watching all of the seasons fir the 10th time 15th maybe? I am glad it is still on Netflix All the characters r very lovable\n\nI love the relationship drama\n\nBest catchphrases are\n\nSing it loud\n\nBam what\n\nChallenge accepted\n\nSing it louder\n\nRecess Recess is an American animated television series created by Paul Germain and Joe Ansolabehere and produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, with animation done by Grimsaem, Plus One Animation, Sunwoo Animation, and Toon City. 16 I wish they still had the old generation of Disney Channel airing! I loved all those shows from my childhood and it makes me pissed off that even Disney has gone into this garbage the media created. Recess is one of the best shows, I love all the charcters especially spinelli recess is one of the best programs I VE SEEN ITS AMAZING ITS MY FAVOUITE SERIES ITS FUNNY ITS COOL ITS GREAT ITS THE BEST SIRES ON DISNEY THE STORY LINE AND THE CHARICTERS WORK GREAT HOW THE GANG GET IN TROUBLE I SHOOR MISS IT YER ITS ON SOME TIMES BUT I THINK ITS THE BEST EVER ANDERESRY WON IN MY ESTATE LIKES IT MORE PEPLOE SHUDE LIKE RESECE BUT I SOUPOSE EVERY WON HAS THERE OWN APINYEN. I Been whatching it from when I was like 5\n\nLilo & Stitch: The Series Lilo & Stitch: The Series is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television. 17 It is funny and I could watch it 10 times without getting slightly bored! Original, funny, and creative. Lilo and stitch is a really good tell because it is cute and funny and also sometimes very educational and Lilo and stitch have a very close bond with Lilo plays the role of a little girland stitch plays the role of a rat can wrap I used to watch the episodes online all the time in like 4th grade. This show was great.\n\nGirl Meets World Girl Meets World is an American coming of age television sitcom. The series made its debut on Disney Channel on June 27, 2014. 18 Girl Meets World should be higher up in fact it should be number 1. I know a lot of people hate it but it really affects some people and makes them a lot happier and make them a better person. It has helped me and my friend because at first we were down all the time and we weren't happy but the life lessons they teach are actually amazing and help a lot. They almost never have episodes that are copies of other shows and you don't see the same boring, lame, cheesy things you see in most kids shows. This show has changed my life it's seriously underrated and I love it and I wish I could tell Rowan, Sabrina, Corey, Peyton, Ben, Danielle, and August thank you so much. I hope the people who don't like it actually watch it and see how amazing and inspiring it is. I'm sorry, I thought that Riley liked the Texan not her best friend. The dad acts like he's hopped up on drugs probably because his brother's way more famous then him. The girl acts retarded and is sniffin' some rainbow crap because she acts insane. And there is no way in heck that Farkle is autistic, he just needs a slap across the face acting like some ADHD psycho! Give him a fidget spinner and tell him to just SHUT UP and stop quaking like some duck on weed.\n\n\n\nI've got to say everything about this show is on crack! I mean, they pull you in with some quick humor at the beginning, and then it all goes to heck! Farkle and Maya are on drugs because their parents don't love them. I bet Maya only hangs out with Riley for a decent meal and a ride to school. Farkle's quacking is probably from his hangover! And if he can't get Maya just use your money to buy a stripper if u need one. I feel like Farkle only likes Maya to get a cigarette every once and a while! And what does that texan ...more This is the best show I have ever watched! It's mostly clean and is fulk of adventures. It teaches great life lessons. It helped me through hard times. It needs to be number 1. Must watch! I love it when Girl meets world teaches so much not just about knowledge about life in general! The metaphors they make connects the lessons to the real life world which not only them as characters can understand but us as the audience can relate to. It is a beautifully constructed show and I'm sorry Lucaya all the way! The connection between the characters are so strong and the random flashbacks to Boy meet World is amazing. If you like Disney shows this is definitely not one that you should skip out on because Girl meets world makes life lessons entertaining and I think that anyone no matter what age will enjoy the show.\n\nPhil of the Future Phil of the Future is an American science fiction sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 18, 2004, to August 19, 2006, for two seasons. 19 Best show ever! I wish they made the show longer. It was so amazing. It bring back so much of my childhood! This show is funny along with cute! I watch the videos on youtube! I am like addicted to it. Phil and Keeley are the nicest and cutest couple and Pim is hilarious! I loved Phil of the future, I could relate to it cause I have an older brother. We always fight and it seem like we hate each other but he is my bro so I love him! The show was really interesting and funny. I loved it, the best show ever! Phil of the Future is one of the only real Disney Channel Originals. It should be number 2 on this list =!\n\nShake It Up Shake It Up (sometimes stylized as Shake It Up!) is an American sitcom that originally aired on Disney Channel in the United States from November 7, 2010 to November 10, 2013. Created by Chris Thompson and starring Bella Thorne and Zendaya, the show follows the adventures of CeCe Jones (Bella Thorne) ...read more. 20 I will praise Shake It Up in a moment, but first I wanted to talk about some of the other Disney Channel shows. I'm a little older and I'm not saying my opinion is more valuable, but I can say that I've watched many of the new and older shows. I wanted to say that That's So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Even Stevens (and possibly Kim Possible) are some of the best shows Disney Channel has ever had. That's So Raven episodes can make anyone crack up and Hilary Duff's success outside of Disney really paved the way for other female artists like Miley, Selena, and Demi. At least some of those older shows ranked decently. That's So Raven #5!\n\n\n\nI had pretty much gave up on Disney Channel and watched very little of it from 2006-2011. I still liked to turn back to it and relive my childhood every once in a while. One day I come across this show called Shake It Up (the episode was \"Sweat It Up\") and I could not stop laughing. It was hilarious and I had to see more. And that isn't even ...more NOT A GOOD SHOW THIS SHOW IS BAD AND NOT FUNNY. This show is also inappropriate because Rocky hates angels which is a threat to God. Cece is bad at reading and she likes to pass gas in the elevators and laugh about it. Like I said about Rocky she hates Angels and she never minds her own business. One time Rocky was mean to an old lady and tried to make the lady like her but the lady was angry at Rocky and the lady told Rocky to go away. Cece's brother Flynn is a brat that likes to talk when someone else is talking (rude). Flynn also use to whine for no reason in season one. One time Flynn was whining because somebody ripped up his teddy bear (He deserves it for being bad). In shake it up Flynn is never in school which is weird. Cece and Rocky go to school, it's just a show but he should be in school. Flynn is usually around Ty in this show. He should be at home eating Doritos and drinking Mountain Dew and be watching T.V. or playing video games. Ty is really lazy and he always tells ...more This show really good! I hope this show will success because those kids are so talented! Really! No offense intended but, I hate the show. I don't understand, the girls say they are best friends, nut they are very cruel. They are very inconsiderate and never think of the possible ramifications of the situation. The show is a rip of HAIRSPRAY I love this show! I wish there were full episodes on YouTube! I hope that Shake It Up goes on for a long time!\n\nLab Rats Lab Rats, also known as Lab Rats: Bionic Island for the fourth season, is an American television sitcom that premiered on February 27, 2012, on Disney XD, and aired through February 3, 2016. The series was created by Chris Peterson and Bryan Moore and produced by It's a Laugh Productions for Disney ...read more. 21 This is my one of my favorite Disney shows. I love all the characters and the plots are exiting. This is a great show for almost everybody. Lab Rats was my childhood T.V. show I would love it if they put it back on netflix This is a great show! I love how they start in the beginning and how the teenagers blend in with the other's! It's just so cool to see those bionic teens develope and how they go through their troubles. What I like about this show is it actually has a plot. It has an antagonist, at least one new one per season, protagonists, good actors/actresses, and the jokes are original and actually pretty funny. The show has morals just like any other show, and I like how the parents aren't brainless, or nonexistent. Lab Rats should be way higher, it's a big step for Disney. The show's plot, which is centered around bionics, thickens as the show goes around, and the fight scenes aren't cheesy. There's the occasional cliche or stereotype, but compared to shows like Austin and Ally, you barely notice them.\n\nBoy Meets World 22 How is this not higher on the charts? This show was funny, had life lessons, and was realistic. It had been on for years! You saw these characters grow up. By far the best! Look it up on Youtube you will see why. I feel bad for the kids who haven't seen this. This is by far the best show. It is the most funny and the way Eric acts is so funny. The old Disney was by far the best but then they started trying too hard and the jokes aren't even funny, and they have laughs in the background at the wrong time. And I own all seven seasons. Are you kidding me. ARe yOu kidDiNg ME!?! This show is #23!? This is one of the best shows on television. It taught important life lessons, it was funny, and wasn't afraid to get a little real at times. Topanga and Corey are the bomb. Watch it on ABC Family, it is so much better than Girl Meets World, Austin and Ally, ANT Farm, Jessie, and all other dumb new shows combined.\n\nCory in the House Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007, to September 12, 2008, and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. 23 I love cory in the house its very funny. I love the episode when Raven came to visit in the white house. I really liked it very much. Probably one of the only shows on Disney that actually makes you laugh. Cory and the crew I love your show. Every time it's one I watch it. Not only the best Disney channel show of All Time but also the best Anime of All Time\n\nDuckTales DuckTales is an American animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation. It premiered on September 18, 1987 and ended on November 28, 1990 with a total of four seasons and 100 episodes. 24 Excuse me? Why isn't Ducktales above Wizards of Waverly Place? Get Ducktales up to number 1. Disney Channel doesn't deserve to make more sitcoms more than cartoons. I loved this show when I was a kid. A lot of people don't know how epic this show truly was Ducktales is getting a reboot! 2017!\n\nThe Proud Family The Proud Family is an American animated sitcom that ran on Disney Channel from September 15, 2001 to August 19, 2005. 25 Why is this show at 32nd after all this other new crap. This show was one of the best ever. It should have replaced any of the neawer shows. That's So Raven should've taken the first place spot because it was actually comedy that made sense. Unlike this new junk where they yell out the most random crappy stuff on the planet. Also Proud Family should've been right behind it. I LOVE THIS SHOW WISH IT WAS BACK ON LOVE THE DAD AND PENNY PROUD I WOULD WATCH DISNEY CHANNEL EVERYDAY IF THIS WAS ON! WISH THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER MOVIE OF THIS! I have seen a couple of episodes of \"The Proud Family\" and I love the episode when Penny Proud has a sleepover in Rumors, I love this show so much it was like a reality show in cartoon form it showed how Penny was with her friends how her mom was crazy along with her grandmother and the dad was jealous and always high alert about boys like a normal dad is and the little devils that were the babies miss this so much.\n\nEven Stevens Even Stevens is an American comedy television series that aired on Disney Channel with a total of three seasons and 65 episodes from June 17, 2000, to June 2, 2003. It follows the life of the Stevens, a family living in suburban Sacramento, California, mainly focusing on the clashing personalities of ...read more. 26 The older shows are funnier and better then the new ones, today they are trying everything just to make the show funny no matter how disgusting, inappropriate or misleading. This was the funniest show ever on television. I would still watch it if it came on and I'm grown. Also good shows: boy meets world bug juice phil of the future life with derek kim possible. Lizzie mcguire was pretty good and so was American dragon. That's so raven suite life of zach and cody and hannah montana were disney's downfall. These days, everyone always love those teen shows like Kim Possible, Cory in the House, Hannah Montana, Lizzie McGuire, Life with Derek, The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, and Wizards of Waverly Place. I hate all of those shows, but this and that's so Raven were the only Disney teen shows I actually liked. Boy Meets World was okay. And that's right, hate me for it, but I think Hannah Montana is a stupid show. But of ALL of those Disney teen shows, THIS was THE BEST, and those who've watched this would probably agree with me too. This was the funniest show Disney ever made. The only reason this isn't at the top, is because it isn't modern and no one has seen it.\n\nDog With a Blog Dog with a Blog is an American television sitcom that premiered on Disney Channel on October 12, 2012, and ended on September 25, 2015. The series stars G Hannelius, Blake Michael, Francesca Capaldi, Stephen Full, Regan Burns, and Beth Littleford. The series was co-created by Michael B. Kaplan. 27 This show is such a piece of crap, A talking dog with a blog who makes things worse and teaches kids bad lessons, No wonder Disney Channel went downhill, but thankfully, it's improving, Disney is getting better, in fact, Better than Disney Channel, Disney Channel isn't as good as Disney or Cartoon Network, but better than Nickelodeon as a matter of fact since Nickelodeon has hardly improved, Cartoon Network and Disney have 4 4 or 5 good shows, Disney Channel has 2 very good shows and one so so show, while Nickelodeon has only 2 good shows. I especially enjoy this show, primarily as a dog person, but on the whole, I LOVED THIS SHOW! How is this show only number 16?! This is my most absolute favorite show on Earth, and if I had to choose any show to live with for the rest of my life, it would be Dog With A Blog. Stan's special ability is unique, creative, and funny! There are many hilarious jokes that I laugh at. And most other shows also have inappropriate parts or are bad influences for kids, but Dog With A Blog is kid-friendly and there is no bad language or anything. Dog with a Blog is a great and cute family show to watch. Stan is funny and makes people laugh. Avery is a one of a kind character-she dreams of becoming a president in the white house one day. Tyler wants to be a BMX rider one day and he chases his dreams as well. Chloe lives in her own little world that's filled with a ton of imagination and magic. Not to mention the funny relationship between Bennett and Ellan. Every episode has a new plot and a creative one too. Dog with the Blog is a great kids and family show to watch\n\nLife with Derek 28 I have not seen that show in so long but I remember some and I loved it so please come back on disney... I love this show it is the best show in the world, I hope in real life Michael seater and ashley leggat will date and never brake up. I wish this show will never end. I love life with derek. I love life with derek Life with derek is the coolest ever show on dysney channel, if you want to laugh really hard while still watch a show with a storyline, watch this. I will tell you one thing you are bound to fall in love with either derek or casey and by the time the show ends you will roam around like a lost puppy...talking from experience :-)\n\nMy Babysitter's a Vampire My Babysitter's a Vampire was a Canadian comedy horror television movie starring Vanessa Morgan and Matthew Knight. 29 I LOVE THIS SHOW IT IS BEAST THE BEST ON Disney I HOPE IT STAYS ON Disney THAT IS LIKE THE ONLY SHOW I WATCH! MY FAVORITE ON THE SHOW IS ERICA AKA: KATE TODD LOVE THE SHOW! this show is sexy and dangerous! I thought it would be like a copy of Twillight and you know love! But it was so funny! I watched disney channel when I was in vacation and this show was AMAZING! But I live in Canada so... I searched it but there was only Family Channel and this show is not in this channel! cry with me :, ( Really good show Reminds me of my life and friends in general. So deserves to be higher up! I love this show lots! I even think it should be at the top of this whole entire list! This show is way better then Hannah Montana! I would make it switch with Hannah Montana!\n\nKickin' It Kickin' It is an American martial arts-inspired comedy television series that originally aired on Disney XD from June 13, 2011 to March 25, 2015. Created and executive produced by Jim O'Doherty, the series is rated TV-Y7 and follows the karate instructor at an under-performing martial arts academy, ...read more. 30 Kickin' It is one of the fairly new Disney shows, first premiering in 2011, early June. From the start, Kickin' It had shown viewers the meaning of loyalty and friendship, clearly stating that this sitcom isn't just another one to laugh about, but has meaning and life lessons.\n\n\n\nLike other Disney shows such as, Hannah Montana, Suite Life, and Wizards of Waverly Place, the show is K+ rated humorous - obviously, this is Disney. The lines aren't too corny, and each episode will have you smiling until the end.\n\n\n\nKickin' It is not only humorous and meaningful, but also includes martial arts and displays of love interests. The most popular between Jack (Leo Howard) and Kim (Olivia Holt). With that, the show reaches out not only to boys, but to girls.\n\n\n\nIt's always enjoyable to watch these Disney kids (and their characters) grow up, even if they are just reading their script papers. I watched all the episodes and was really surprised that this show is not in the top 10. I have to say that this is on my list of favourite shows and it would be ranked 2nd. This show made me laugh really hard and I enjoy the comedic moments. Don't have a favourite one because they all were really funny. Kickin' It I say is Unique... Every Single Disney show is about friends and friends and friends, but this has friendship and determination on saving what they love the most. This is creative putting Disney-usual classic of friendship but original.. The actors are amazing and some episode might even inspire you to do something you love even if your amazing and even if your not... A lot of the top ten should not even be in the top ten... But for me Kickin' it is BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST T.V. sHOW Disney HAS TO OFFER... If this would go to Disney Channel AN INSTANT HIT I WILL SAY! Why are Kickin it Not in The top? Its one of The greatest Series on Disney Channel! The ideas are great, The actors are great, The story is great. It makes me want to start doing karate!\n\nSo please vote for one of The greatest Series of All time!\n\nAnd if anyone from Kickin it Sees This, then I just want to say that I would love too meet you in Real life!\n\nGreetings from Denmark!\n\nClara\n\nA.N.T. Farm A.N.T. Farm is an American teen sitcom which originally aired on Disney Channel from May 6, 2011 to March 21, 2014. 31 I absolutely love this show! The show is really funny, and the actors are so cute and talented. This should not be number 20! At the worst I would give it a 5 maybe a 6 but not even close to 20. This show is the best show ever known. I love it because it is funny and because its about friendship. Its cool because they have really amazing talants. I love olive and flecher together they would make such a good couple I mean they have been friend more then chyna has with them. BEST SHOW EVER! This should be like number 2 it is a really good show and it deserves to b 2! It is so funny and I love Fletcher with all his art of chyna (; I love all the episodes and olive makes me laugh everybody and anybody should watch this show chyna is one of the most talented people I have seen (; I loved the show until the last season was aired.\n\nI mean...This show is stupid but so genius! I loved it!\n\nIt was so funny and it was one of my favorite disney shows, but the last season really disappointed me because it got really hard to watch.\n\nBut I still love the first two seasons\n\nPair of Kings Pair of Kings is an American television sitcom that originally aired on the cable channel Disney XD from September 10, 2010 to February 18, 2013. The sitcom's target audience was teenagers. 32 My favorite series ever... I love this series.. The story is so nice ad king Brady and boomer are so mad evil kings... I love this series...\n\nTill the end.. I agree. It's the best show ever. I am obsessed with it but It's to bad that the show aired late. I'm in my 20's but it's so hard not to love everybody especially king Brady. I love it forever and always. I love this show with all my heart! I might be just saying that I love this show because I think Mitchel Musso is SEXY but ever since they replaced him with Adam Hicks... I've stopped watching it. it's just not the same anymore. I love PAIR OF KINGS until Brady was removed... That's when the show got less exciting... it ruined the show.\n\nWander Over Yonder Wander Over Yonder is an American animated television series on Disney XD. Created by Craig McCracken, it follows Wander and his best friend and steed Sylvia. Adventurous and optimistic, Wander rides across the galaxy to help persons live freely, against the intentions of Lord Hater to rule the universe. ...read more. 33 Wander Over Yonder is one of the best shows ever! I am really sad that they moved it to Disney. Disney needs to bring it back the original channel! I'm sad because Wander Over Yonder does not get as much credit than it should. For one, the promos are terrible for this show! If you are not used to the show and take a first glance at one of the commercials, then I don't really blame you for not watching it! But still, I advise everyone to watch this great cartoon. If you are really into animation and love to study things like cinematography, than this is defiantly a great show to watch! It is so clever and has some great morals and jokes! It is basically a combination of Roadrunner and Coyote and Looney Tunes and space. This show defiantly in the style of older cartoons. The animation and voice acting is wonderful! This show will defiantly surprise you! Go watch it now and I promise you that you will not regret it! Wander Over Yonder is one of the best shows ever! Not only is this show great, but underrated too! Disney shows Gravity Falls more than Wander Over Yonder, and that show ended! This show is going to get cancelled because of Disney's stupid decisions unless the fans can support all the way! This show has memorable characters, interesting stories, has valuable morals, and a silly tone that will lift anyone's spirit! Not to mention how funny it is! I enjoy the voice acting and the animation is so creative, fun, and original! Wander Over Yonder was one of the last Awesome shows on Disney along with Gravity Falls And The New Mickey Mouse Series. I just hope they don't fall into hell like Spongebob Squarepants. I am a HUGE die-hard, hardcore fan of this and Star vs. the Forces of Evil!\n\nMickey Mouse Club (90's version, MMC) 34 Greatest show ever on the Disney Channel beside mickey mouse cartoons of course! It was a good show when I was small but now I am no a big of it I have watched for 7 now I am 12 Shows kids great lessons, awesome show! I looked up this show on YouTube and loved it! Little Cristina Augulara was sooo cute!\n\nAmerican Dragon: Jake Long American Dragon: Jake Long is an American animated television series. It was produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and created by Jeff Goode. 35 I love this but at my home Disney Channel does not come. But I love it. I watched it everyday. Their clothes are so cool. American dragon is the best show I have ever seen. It's so cool the way of turning in to a drago I like the idea of being able to turn into a dragon plus it's a real good show. This is the best show on Disney Channel. Jake gets to be a dragon and has the best life ever. I used to see the show all the time. They should make a third and fourth season. This is the only good show that Disney Channel has and ever did- and they canceled it. This is the best show I have seen from Disney shows. This show is funny and interesting. Some of the things can happen in the real life. People usually don't know about this show yet. IF they knew and watched, then I am sure that they will surely like and love this show. Please support this if you have watched this show.\n\nMilo Murphy's Law Milo Murphy's Law is an American animated television series from the creators of Phineas and Ferb, Dan Povenmire and Jeff \"Swampy\" Marsh, which premiered on October 3, 2016 on Disney XD. 36 This show is really funny and WAY better than all the crap sitcoms that some how are said to be \"better some how... disney is really raising the bar on there cartoons and is really paying off. with many gems on cartoon network ending like regular show, gumball, and steven universe (possibly) we are all questioning if this network will go downhill. And we say \"ARE CARTOONS GETTING WORSE\" well the answer to that is no. We all thought disney was the worst but now it is becoming the best. Disney is giving us AMAZING cartoons like this, Star vs the forces of evil, Gravity falls AND MORE! Another point for disney I just watched a few episodes today and can I say that it's amazing. However hopefully it doesn't get boring quickly like Phineas and Ferb because you know the creators of the two shows are the same. How is this show not # 1? It's funny, and is WAY better than Austin and Ally It's perfect just keep it the same as it is.\n\nDarkwing Duck Darkwing Duck is an American animated action-adventure comedy television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation that first ran from 1991 to 1992 on both the syndicated programming block The Disney Afternoon and Saturday mornings on ABC. 37 He's a unique superhero who's unashamed of how egotistical and glory-seeking he is HOW IS THIS ONLY NUMBER 50 this was my child hood even though I grew up in the early 2000s it has that disturbing mix of action and it is a great show This needs to be higher.\n\nHouse of Mouse 38 House of mouse is, in my opinion, the best Disney Channel show, partially because of the nostalgia I associate with it. This was my favorite show when I was younger, and, watching it again years later, I find that it's still entertaining. Also, having a show where every single Disney character, even the obscure ones, come together, while mixing traditional Disney shorts in is a great and creative idea. This show basically took all of the Disney films, brought them together, mixed in Disney shorts as well, and, in addition, made she show extremely entertaining for all ages. I love this show, and I wish Disney Channel would bring it back, because all of the other Disney Channel shows currently airing (except possibly Gravity Falls) pale drastically in comparison. This show exemplifies what a Disney Channel show should be: It should capture at least a majority of the magic presented in Disney films, as well as be funny, Disney-related, and entertaining, regardless of age. This is why The ...more As much as I love the new Mickey Mouse shorts, the House of Mouse will always be my personal favorite Disney Channel show! This was always something I looked forward to watching on the network (next to Dave the Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, and Lilo and Stitch). I miss the old days when Disney Channel aired their animated shows more often. I loved house of mouse as a child and now the only versions of mickey mouses you can watch is mickey mouse clubhouse which I think is rubbish. There should be more programmes around mickey mouse because that is what the whole Disney legacy was based on. As Walt Disney said, it all started with a mouse. A great show case of the old Disney shorts, but also adds some depth to classic Disney movies and chareters. It was always fun to see your favorite Disney charecters interacting with each other.\n\nFancy Nancy 39 I like the Fancy Nancy book so much! I use to get them at my libary school all the time when I was a 3rd grade.\n\nBest Friends Whenever Best Friends Whenever is an American multi-camera sitcom developed for Disney Channel, created by Jed Elinoff and Scott Thomas and executive produced by Jed Elinoff, Scott Thomas, and Michael B. Kaplan. The series stars Landry Bender as Cyd, Lauren Taylor as Shelby, Gus Kamp as Barry, Ricky Garcia as ...read more. 40 I love this show! It was funny, cool, and awesome! My favorite episodes were definitely the Butterscotch Effect and Shake Your Booty. What an AMAZING show with an original concept! Definitely one of the best shows on Disney Channel! Love all the characters and all the adventures they get into along with two amazing actresses: Landry Bender and Lauren Taylor! This is one of the worst shows ever, for all of you people that think this show is funny and cool, well it's not. Their basically copying the theme of girl meets world, except I don't think this show teaches lessons, but seriously a blonde girl with a dark haired girl with two friends that are boys, and the dude who wears hats all the time is basically copying farkle, and Barry, is like the Lucas. Sid is like the Riley, and the blonde girl is pretty much maya Okay you might think what you wanna think but I know this show better then you. You don't even watch it you called Shelby the blonde girl! This show teaches you about friendship.\n\nThe New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is an American Saturday morning original animated television series produced by Walt Disney Television that ran from January 17, 1988 to October 26, 1991. 41 I LOVED THIS SHOW! I would wake up at like, five thirty and watch it every day. My old room is painted Winnie the pooh :-) Back in the day this was the best Disney Channel show besides DuckTales and gummy bears Ok I know that I'm 13 but I love Winnie the Pooh I don't watch the shows but I have a HUGE Winnie the Pooh stuffed bear My favorite classic Disney show!\n\nChip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers 42 One of the greatest Disney Afternoon shows ever I have seen a fwiw. But... It it great\n\nDisney's Mickey Mouse Shorts 43 I hope it has a lot more seasons! It's so funny! I'm glad disney channel brought it back! I love the animated shorts. The best one is Stay'n Cool Potatoland is my favorite episode. I HIGHLY recommend this series. Love it\n\nSydney to the Max 44 I love this show it's so awesome I lloovvve it guys don't take it away\n\nK.C. Undercover K.C. Undercover is an American sitcom developed for Disney Channel, created by Corinne Marshall and executive produced by Rob Lotterstein. 45 Don't understand people saying it's a rip off of That's So Raven. The only similarities are that they both have to keep a secret in my opinion. Oh well. I think it was a good show and I still watch it. You have GOT to see this new episode on Disney Channel. It's about this spy family, mostly K.c(ZENDAYA! ), this family has a robotic girl and they need to do missions and not let anyone know about them. IT IS also damn hilarious. I love it. It is great it should have a spin-off with K.C in college and there is an enemy spy who betrayed her and was her best friend Probably the best Disney shows right now. Good acting and characters have a meaning, but are not repetitive. Jokes can be kinda cheesy but still better then jessie. THIS SHOULD BE IN TOP TEN.\n\nKid vs Kat 46 Millie is hilarious in this. This isn't even Disney This is a ytv cartoon if I can remember good enough This was such a cool little short show I loved it its awesome yoo hhoo rock on\n\nTaleSpin TaleSpin is an American animated television series based in the fictional city of Cape Suzette, that first aired in 1990 as a preview on The Disney Channel and later that year as part of The Disney Afternoon, with characters adapted from Disney's 1967 animated feature The Jungle Book, which was theatrically ...read more. 47 I like the accurate portrayal of aviation technology\n\nAladdin 48 I Like the Movie and I Enjoy this Show I remember when him and Hercules teamed up Why is this not higher u this was more enjoyable then doug Alladen is my favrout Disney movei yet\n\nThe Original Mickey Mouse Club 49 I'm still waiting for the day Walt Disney rises from his grave and takes revenge on what all of these horrible new shows did to his good name and classic masterpieces. I'm only sixteen, but I can recall a time when the name Disney meant so much more than it does now. I think Walt Disney would be proud. Look at all the great cartoons. Kim Possible, Phil of the Future, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Recess, Boy meets World, and etc... That generation has passed though and it's different for this generation. I imagine there also be complaining in about 10 more years. When Austin and Ally is history and they come out with something even more silly. Just because I'm 13 I still love every mickey mouse Even Mickey Mouse Clubhouse? That show is nothing but a disgrace to all the Mickey Mouse shows, the characters act like polar opposites to those in the other shows, Donald is friendly in it, when he should be angry, and it makes parents think Mickey Mouse is for babies, when in fact it's for all ages, what a disgrace. I love it and it is the best T.V. show every", "images": ["https://www.thetoptens.com/favicon.ico", "https://static.thetoptens.com/logo200.jpg", "https://static.thetoptens.com/logo100.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thetoptens.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thetoptens.com/best-disney-channel-television-series/", "title": "Best Disney Channel Shows", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Best Disney Channel Shows", "url": "https://www.thetoptens.com/best-disney-channel-television-series/", "site_name": "TheTopTens"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 163057887059389}, "theme-color": "#888485"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thetoptens.com", "summary": ""}
