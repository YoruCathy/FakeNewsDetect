Kotb took over the co-anchoring duties on Nov. 29, hours after Lack had dismissed Lauer for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior.\u201d At the time, the NBC News chairman said in a memo that the company had received a \u201cdetailed complaint\u201d that represented \u201ca clear violation of our company\u2019s standards.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,\u201d Lack added.\n\nHours later, Variety published a report detailing allegations by multiple women that Lauer had sexually harassed them in the workplace.\n\n\u201cSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed,\u201d the former TV host said in a statement.\n\nSuddenly, NBC News was without its high-profile co-anchor. But Kotb and Guthrie have shown that \u201cToday\u201d didn\u2019t need Lauer for ratings. \u201cToday\u201d beat rival \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on ABC for weeks after his firing.\n\n\u201cOver the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,\u201d Lack wrote in his Tuesday memo, CNN reported. \u201cThey have an undeniable connection with each other and most importantly, with viewers, a hallmark of \u2018Today.\u2019 \u201d\n\nKotb\u2019s promotion could help repair some of the optics damage done by Lauer. The staffing news was met with praise from broadcast journalists and others.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCongrats to Hoda! This is a moment for women. https://t.co/rLNXoNz24o \u2014 Ana Cabrera (@AnaCabrera) January 2, 2018\n\nCongratulations @hodakotb! Looking forward to you lighting up my morning in a brand new way. \u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Mindy Kaling (@mindykaling) January 2, 2018\n\nKotb\u2019s journalistic credentials run deep. She started out as a broadcast journalist in New Orleans and Fort Myers, and joined NBC News in 1998 as a \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent.\n\nSince 2008, Kotb has hosted the 10 a.m. hour of \u201cToday\u201d alongside Kathie Lee Gifford, which she\u2019ll continue to do.\n\nWith news of Kotb\u2019s promotion comes questions about gender pay parity: Will she be compensated similarly as Lauer, who reportedly had a four-year, $20 million contract?\n\nThese are incredibly profitable hours for TV networks, and there\u2019s a lot of pressure to present a dynamic hosting team with plenty of on-air chemistry. \u201cToday,\u201d in particular, attempts to project the image that its on-air personalities are essentially a family.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cToday\u201d won\u2019t be the first morning show with female co-anchors; Diane Sawyer and Robin Roberts co-hosted \u201cGood Morning America\u201d from 2006 to 2009. George Stephanopoulos replaced Sawyer when she retired.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCBS This Morning\u201d still hasn\u2019t named a permanent replacement for Charlie Rose, who was fired in November over allegations of sexual misconduct detailed in a Washington Post report. (Rose apologized for \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d but said that not \u201call of these allegations are accurate.\u201d) Other CBS News staffers have filled in, joining hosts Gayle King and Norah O\u2019Donnell.\n\nBut, by and large, men have been dominant presences on morning shows, even as their audiences are dominated by women. Perhaps as the conversation about sexism and representation continues to build steam, more and more women will see themselves reflected on their TV screens.\n\nAD\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story erroneously attributed some of Guthrie\u2019s past job positions to Kotb.\n\nRead more:", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/5bd13033-50c2-4ef3-a231-2f9d3ef43dcc.png&w=90&h=90", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PPLAI6lLTi6b6TiDPGJ6mW-Jmuw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VH3MXARLWA25VBCG2ZPBCCKGMI.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PPLAI6lLTi6b6TiDPGJ6mW-Jmuw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VH3MXARLWA25VBCG2ZPBCCKGMI.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elahe Izadi", "Pop Culture Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/02/hoda-kotb-replaces-matt-lauer-on-today-and-makes-history-in-the-process/", "title": "Hoda Kotb replaces Matt Lauer on \u2018Today,\u2019 and makes history in the process", "meta_data": {"description": "She joins Savannah Guthrie as a permanent co-host \u2014 meaning the NBC News show for the first time is led by an all-women anchor team.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/02/hoda-kotb-replaces-matt-lauer-on-today-and-makes-history-in-the-process/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PPLAI6lLTi6b6TiDPGJ6mW-Jmuw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VH3MXARLWA25VBCG2ZPBCCKGMI.jpg", "title": "Hoda Kotb replaces Matt Lauer on \u2018Today,\u2019 and makes history in the process", "description": "She joins Savannah Guthrie as a permanent co-host \u2014 meaning the NBC News show for the first time is led by an all-women anchor team."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hoda Kotb replaces Matt Lauer on \u2018Today,\u2019 and makes history in the process", "description": "She joins Savannah Guthrie as a permanent co-host \u2014 meaning the NBC News show for the first time is led by an all-women anchor team."}, "last_updated_date": "2018-02-26T00:21:40.326Z", "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514822400.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
