You gotta get your therapy and you got to go through it. But I always tell people and I always tell couples who are going through it \u2014 especially the dudes who seek out my advice who are like, 'How did you do it?' \u2014 I always say, 'You gotta put in the work, and just remember that you were friends beforehand.' Like, try to think about things like that, and think about your goals.\"\n\nGarcia and Johnson are parents to 17-year-old daughter Simone Alexandra Johnson.", "images":
