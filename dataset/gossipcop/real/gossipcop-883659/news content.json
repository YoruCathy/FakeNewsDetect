I decided to buy it on a lark, convinced I was throwing $68 directly out the window, but at least I\u2019d have a fun story. Instead, it\u2019s become my constant companion.\n\nFirst of all: the light. You\u2019ll find that it\u2019s beyond embarrassing to use the LuMee Duo in public (you\u2019re flashing a blazing rectangle of light onto yourself and everyone in the vicinity, after all), but it produces undeniably perfect photos. Turn it on and you\u2019re awash in a warm (or incandescent, depending on your preference) radiance that\u2019s almost angelic. You know how makeup contouring is all about creating the perfect shadows and light on your face? The LuMee\u2019s glow is the effect it\u2019s going for.\n\nThe advancement of the new Duo (which came out late last year) is, of course, the rows of LEDs now on the back of the case. Not just for selfies anymore, the case gives your phone powerful lighting on both sides \u2014 it\u2019s like your flashlight app on steroids. Now, my main photography subject is actually not myself, but my black chihuahua, Casey. He\u2019s impossible to photograph in anything other than full sunlight, but the Duo has turned my pet photos into Instagram gold. Not only that \u2014 if I drop something on the floor of a movie theater, the powerful light means I\u2019ll spot it right away. Add to that the powerful battery: a full USB charge lasts over two hours of continuous use; I only juice mine up once every two weeks or so, and I\u2019ve spent $68 on stupider things.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/14/14-lumee-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/14/14-lumee-lede.w600.h396.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/14/14-lumee-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alison Freer"], "canonical_link": "https://nymag.com/strategist/2017/02/lumee-lighting-phone-case-kim-kardashian-selfie.html", "title": "The Phone Case That Bathes My Selfies in Flattering Light", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "The Phone Case That Bathes My Selfies in Flattering Light", "url": "https://nymag.com/strategist/2017/02/lumee-lighting-phone-case-kim-kardashian-selfie.html", "description": "My Instagrams have never looked better.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/14/14-lumee-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "The Strategist", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Phone Case That Bathes My Selfies in Flattering Light", "description": "My Instagrams have never looked better.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2017/02/14/14-lumee-lede.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@strategist"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-02-14T14:57:00.000-05:00", "tag": "the strategist, this thing's incredible, phones and accessories, electronics, flattering week", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nymagstrategist", "opinion": "true"}, "description": "My Instagrams have never looked better.", "sailthru.tags": "the strategist, this thing's incredible, phones and accessories, electronics, flattering week", "author": "Alison Freer", "fb": {"app_id": 1782502952000064}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Strategist", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Strategist", "application-name": "The Strategist", "msapplication-TileColor": "#111", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/strategist/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1487102220.0, "source": "http://nymag.com", "summary": ""}
