That doesn\u2019t mean that Lamar doesn\u2019t care about Rob. In fact, he cares very much and is hoping Rob pulls through the Blac Chyna scandal unscathed.\n\nWhen Odom was questioned about the Blac Chyna nude photo scandal on the red carpet of the Nickelodeon Kids\u2019 Choice Sports Awards, he didn\u2019t hold back. Lamar told Erin Lim from E! News that Rob should \u201cStay strong.\u201d\n\nThen Lamar followed up his first little bit of wisdom by saying, \u201cPut God first.\u201d\n\nThat might be some pretty good advice, especially in Rob\u2019s case where the damage is already done. It\u2019s not like he can travel back and not post Blac Chyna\u2019s nude photos to Instagram.\n\nLamar Odom also recently said that he doesn\u2019t blame Rob for walking away from him after his split from Khloe. That was due to the fact that Lamar hurt Khloe so bad and Rob is her brother, after all.\n\nLamar said that he\u2019s in a really good place right now. The former NBA star claims to be sober and very happy.\n\nDespite the former brother in laws being on the outs, it really sounds like Lamar Odom still cares for his former roommate. Maybe there is a chance that, in the future, Lamar and Rob can reconnect. After all, Rob really could use all the support he can get right now, especially if Lamar is sober and taking care of himself again.", "images":
