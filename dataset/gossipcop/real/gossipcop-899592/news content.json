Like, what\u2019s happened? Am I tired? It\u2019s slowly processing,\u201d she told Vulture. \u201cViola Davis made this beautiful speech last night [at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards]. It was so moving and I was in tears. To be the unconventional actress or finally [to have] art catching up to life, it really means a lot because there were times where I was like, Maybe I\u2019m not gonna be able to do this.\u201d\n\nMetz learned she was nominated, along with her TV mother, Mandy Moore, for best supporting actress in a TV drama while watching the announcements on Facebook Live with her agent Nick Roses, who arrived at her home at 4:30 a.m. This Is Us, the fall\u2019s biggest broadcast hit, was also nominated for best drama.\n\n\u201cI would have been elated to have our show nominated especially because we\u2019re contending with really heavy cable hitters,\u201d Metz said. Co-star Sterling K. Brown, who was nominated for his role on FX\u2019s American Crime Story: People v. O.J., texted the cast from set, where he is filming scenes this morning. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re all on a group chat,\u201d Metz said. \u201cSterling was very excited. Emoji, emoji, and we\u2019re sending all kinds of GIFs to each other. It\u2019s very cute.\u201d\n\nSince the show\u2019s fall finale aired last week, everyone\u2019s been stopping Metz to ask what happens to Toby, Kate\u2019s boyfriend, played by Chris Sullivan. The episode ended with Toby having a heart attack during the family\u2019s Christmas celebration and flatlining in the emergency room \u2014 scenes Metz says were especially difficult, considering how much fun she usually has working with Sullivan.\n\n\u201cChris actually made a joke several episodes before pretending to have a heart attack and one of the directors was like, That\u2019s actually gonna be foreshadowing so we can\u2019t do that, as funny as that is,\u201d Metz said. \u201cAnd we were like, Wait, what does that mean? You know, with every drama, with every TV show, there\u2019s highs and lows, so you never know what they\u2019re gonna write. I wasn\u2019t ready and I still wasn\u2019t ready even after shooting it and then seeing it. I\u2019m like, #PrayforToby. That\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d\n\nKate has been struggling all season to find herself after her twin brother, Kevin (Justin Hartley), moves to New York, and she falls in love with Toby, who she meets in a weight-loss program. The show has been critiqued for defining Metz\u2019s character too much by her weight, but Metz says that as the season develops, this won\u2019t remain the focal point. \u201cShe has been living in the shadow of her brother and never feeling adequate and not as beautiful and thin as her mother,\u201d Metz says. \u201cThese are demons she has to battle. Once she gets that under her belt and gets over that, then she can really become the woman she\u2019s meant to be. It definitely will evolve.\u201d\n\nMetz says she is grateful that NBC and 20th Century Fox, the studio that owns the show, took a chance on hiring a \u201creal plus-size woman, not just a size 6 or 8\u201d for a series regular role. \u201cAs an actor you use who you are and what you look like in your roles, and this is what I took on and this is who I am in some capacity,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not all that I am. Kate is a true woman who is really contending with that. She can still be sexy or exciting or fun, but really vulnerable. It\u2019s really a gift.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/12/12/12-Chrissy-Metz-chatroom-silo.w330.h412.png", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/12/12/12-Chrissy-Metz-chatroom.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/12/12/12-Chrissy-Metz-chatroom.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2016/12/chrissy-metz-golden-globe-nomination-this-is-us.html", "title": "This Is Us\u2019 Chrissy Metz on Her Golden Globe Nomination: \u2018To Be the Unconventional Actress, It Really Means a Lot\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "This Is Us\u2019 Chrissy Metz on Her Golden Globe Nomination: \u2018To Be the Unconventional Actress, It Really Means a Lot\u2019", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2016/12/chrissy-metz-golden-globe-nomination-this-is-us.html", "description": "There were times where I was like, <i>Maybe I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to do this</i>.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/12/12/12-Chrissy-Metz-chatroom.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "This Is Us\u2019 Chrissy Metz on Her Golden Globe Nomination: \u2018To Be the Unconventional Actress, It Really Means a Lot\u2019", "description": "There were times where I was like, <i>Maybe I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to do this</i>.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2016/12/12/12-Chrissy-Metz-chatroom.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "description": "There were times where I was like, <i>Maybe I&rsquo;m not gonna be able to do this</i>.", "article": {"tag": "golden globes 2017, tv, this is us, chrissy metz, mandy moore, sterling k. brown, golden globes", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "sailthru.tags": "golden globes 2017, tv, this is us, chrissy metz, mandy moore, sterling k. brown, golden globes", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cache.nymag.com/media/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1481568120.0, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
