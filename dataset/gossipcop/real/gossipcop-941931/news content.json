The reality TV actress owned up to the things she\u2019s done that caused the latter\u2019s early retirement from the sport.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wilkinson took to Twitter to publicly say sorry to her soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cI want to apologize publicly to Hank. I was the reason your football career ended. I regret doing that to u and i hope u learn to forgive me one day. I loved u and was always your number one fan (sic),\u201d she wrote in a series of now-deleted tweets, according to ET Online.\n\nWilkinson continued her apology by saying, \u201cI was 24 when i got married. Now I\u2019m 33. I made a lot of mistakes through those young years and im sorry for making u feel the way i did (sic).\u201d She noted that what she only wanted was to have a family with Baskett because she never had \u201ca solid one\u201d and she regretted not being able to give more to her ex.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why the \u201cKendra on Top\u201d star quickly deleted her tweets, but she also did the same thing a day before when she live-tweeted her and Baskett\u2019s argument. She previously revealed on the social networking platform that her baby daddy was blaming her for his failed football career. Baskett also allegedly blamed her for the cheating scandal because he only looked for pleasure elsewhere because she was pregnant at the time.\n\nThe exchange did not end well because Wilkinson discovered that Baskett was recording her the entire time. \u201cI\u2019m minding my business and after I tell him to leave me alone he disrespects me. I\u2019m trying to get out of my house fast. I\u2019m beyond sad. But recording me is my trigger,\u201d she explained in her final but now-deleted tweet during their argument.\n\nIt\u2019s not known if Baskett has learned about his ex\u2019s apology. Around the same time that the glamour model posted it on Twitter, the former NFL star was spotted in Calabasas casually grabbing breakfast-to-go from Lovi\u2019s Delicatessen. Photos of the retired athlete walking the streets while carrying his meal were published by Daily Mail.\n\nMeanwhile, celebrity publicist and event planner Richard Harlow dished that prior to their intense fight, Wilkinson and Baskett attended a party at Kids World in Oak Park, California with son Hank IV, eight, and Alijah, three. Harlow claimed they looked very happy while co-parenting their children at the event.\n\n\u201cThey both had a great time with their kids and had smiles on their faces the whole time,\u201d Harlow told Us Weekly of the family\u2019s appearance at the birthday bash for Jessica Hall\u2019s daughter, Sophie, last Sunday. \u201c[They were] having some good family fun together [and] there was no indication there was any kind of friction or trouble brewing.\u201d", "images": ["https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/11/17/north-korea-said-former-vice-president-joe-biden.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/trump-has-largely-left-decisions-on-easing-lockdowns.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/06/kendra-wilkinson.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2019/04/20/apple-tim-cook-watch.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/leader-of-italys-far-right-league-party-matteo.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/17/kristi_l._noem_113th_congress.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/ny-governor-andrew-cuomo-in-a-march-27.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/elon-must-sent-wrong-kind-ventilators-california-hospitals.jpg", "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2020/04/18/messages-of-support-for-the-residents-are-displayed.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/06/kendra-wilkinson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kendra-wilkinson-apologizes-admits-she-ended-hank-basketts-football-career-2688165", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Apologizes, Admits She Ended Hank Baskett\u2019s Football Career", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "kendra wilkinson, kendra wilkinson divorce, reality tv, hank baskett, kendra wilkinson playboy, kendra wilkinson kids, kendra on top, hugh hefner, kendra wilkinson twitter, hank baskett scandal", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kendra-wilkinson-apologizes-admits-she-ended-hank-basketts-football-career-2688165", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Apologizes, Admits She Ended Hank Baskett\u2019s Football Career", "description": "A day after live-tweeting her argument with Hank Baskett, Kendra Wilkinson admits that she\u2019s the reason why her ex-husband\u2019s football career ended.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/06/kendra-wilkinson.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/06/kendra-wilkinson.jpg", "height": 900, "width": 600, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Mel Rose Matulac", "modified_time": "2018-06-07T04:10:40-04:00", "published_time": "2018-06-07T04:10:40-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson Apologizes, Admits She Ended Hank Baskett\u2019s Football Career", "url": "https://www.ibtimes.com/kendra-wilkinson-apologizes-admits-she-ended-hank-basketts-football-career-2688165", "description": "A day after live-tweeting her argument with Hank Baskett, Kendra Wilkinson admits that she\u2019s the reason why her ex-husband\u2019s football career ended.", "image": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/06/kendra-wilkinson.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-config": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#000000", "keywords": "kendra wilkinson, kendra wilkinson divorce, reality tv, hank baskett, kendra wilkinson playboy, kendra wilkinson kids, kendra on top, hugh hefner, kendra wilkinson twitter, hank baskett scandal", "author": "Mel Rose Matulac", "description": "A day after live-tweeting her argument with Hank Baskett, Kendra Wilkinson admits that she\u2019s the reason why her ex-husband\u2019s football career ended."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528359040.0, "source": "https://www.ibtimes.com", "summary": ""}
