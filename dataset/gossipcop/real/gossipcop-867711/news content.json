Simpson was released on parole in Nevada on Sunday after serving nine years in a state prison on charges stemming from an armed robbery in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2007.\n\nMr. Simpson, 70, was released at 12:08 a.m. local time from Lovelock Correctional Center in northern Nevada, the Nevada Department of Corrections announced. It provided images of Mr. Simpson leaving the prison in a baseball cap, white tennis shoes, jeans and a denim jacket.\n\nIt was unclear where Mr. Simpson was staying, but his lawyer, Malcolm P. LaVergne, said in an interview on Sunday that \u201cMr. Simpson is going to wind up in Florida.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, neither Florida nor California had received the requisite paperwork for Mr. Simpson to return to those states. According to Mr. LaVergne, Nevada needs to make a request to the receiving state, which has 45 days to reply.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/02simpson1-sub/02simpson1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/02simpson1-sub/02simpson1-sub-articleInline.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/02/us/02simpson1-sub/02simpson1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Harmon", "Christina Caron"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/us/oj-simpson-parole-nevada.html", "title": "O.J.
