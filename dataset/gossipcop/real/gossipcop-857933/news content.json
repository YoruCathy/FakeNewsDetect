Well, up until that moment at least.\n\nSome of Kendall\u2019s BFFs including Gigi and Bella Hadid are some of Taylor\u2019s pals, and the Estee Lauder beauty has even joined the Bad Blood star on stage for her shows.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t heard from Taylor again and we\u2019re not surprised (Picture: Bravo/WWHL)\n\nKim doesn\u2019t seem to be that bothered though (Picture: Bravo/WWHL)\n\nDuring an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Kim was asked if she had made life awkward for Kendall and her pal Taylor after she posted the conversation on her Snapchat. (Much to the delight of the world).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know if Kendall was a part of her squad, I don\u2019t think she was,\u2019 said Kim.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think it was awkward.\u2019\n\nWhen asked if Kim had ever heard from Taylor again, she simply shook her head and then shrugged her shoulders.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPeople may say Kim doesn\u2019t have any talent, but she managed to pull a Julian Assange on Taylor last year.\n\nThe reality star released the video of Kanye West on the phone to Taylor where he recited the lyrics to his song Famous and she told him \u2018 I mean go with whatever line you think is better. It\u2019s obviously very tongue in cheek either way.\u2019\n\nKendall Jenner, Taylor Swift and Gigi Hadid perform The 1989 World Tour onstage during the British Summertime (Picture: by Dave Hogan/TAS/Getty Images for TAS)\n\nTaylor hit back by claiming that she never heard the use of the word \u2018that bitch\u2019 when Kanye recited the lyrics, which technically wasn\u2019t heard on the recordings Kim posted to Snapchat.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nBack in February last year when the song was released, Taylor released a statement condemning Kanye which he responded to by tweeting that Swift had approved the line well before it was released.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe then offered (what many assumed to be) a not so veiled dig at the rapper during her Grammy awards acceptance speech.\n\nAnd as the first woman to win Album of the Year at the Grammys twice, I want to say to the young woman out there, there are going to be people along the way who try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame. But if you just focus on the work and you don\u2019t let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you\u2019re going, you will look around and you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world.\n\nShe didn\u2019t mention the use of \u2018bitch\u2019 in her speech but did refer to the line it was used in as she hit back at Kanye for claiming he made her famous.\n\nFull Taylor Swift/Kanye West transcript Kanye West: You still got the Nashville number? Taylor Swift: I still have the Nashville um, area code but I had to change it. KW: For all my southside n***** that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. TS: I\u2019m like this close to over exposure\u2026 KW: Oh well this this one, I think this is a really cool thing to have, uh\u2026 TS: I know, I mean it\u2019s like a compliment kind of. KW: All I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend I want things that make\u2026 TS: That\u2019s sweet. KW: I don\u2019t want to do rap that makes people feel bad. TS: Um, yeah I mean go with whatever line you think is better. It\u2019s obviously very tongue in cheek either way. And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that\u2019s really nice. KW: Yeah, I just had a responsibility to you as a friend, you know, and thanks for being like so cool about it. TS: Aw thanks. Yeah I really appreciate it. The heads up is soo nice, and I really appreciate it and I never would\u2019ve expected you to tell me about a line in one of your songs. And the flowers that you sent me, I like Instagrammed a picture of them and it\u2019s the most Instagram likes I\u2019ve ever gotten it was like 2.7\u2026 KW: Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know. TS: Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t think anybody would listen to that and be like oh that\u2019s a real diss, like she must be crying. You\u2019ve gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way that you experienced it. Like you honestly didn\u2019t know who I was before that. It doesn\u2019t matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn\u2019t know who I was before that it\u2019s fine. I might be that I can make these things happen that I create these things and concepts and like I\u2019m always going to respect you and I\u2019m really glad that you have the respect to call me and tell me that this time about the song and\u2026 It\u2019s just like a really cool thing to do like and it really shows the friendship so thank you. KW: Thank you too. TS: And you know if people ask me about it I think it would great for me to be like look he called me and told me the line before it came out like so jokes on you guys we\u2019re fine. You guys want to call this a feud you want to call this throwing shade. Right after the song comes out I\u2019m going to be on a Grammy red carpet and I\u2019m gonna be like, He called me. Yeah, she does, it made her famous. You know, it\u2019s more provocative to say \u2018Might still have sex\u2019\u2026 it\u2019s not..it\u2019s not..it doesn\u2019t matter to me. There\u2019s not one that hurts my feelings and one that doesn\u2019t.\n\nBut in the recording she tells Kanye, \u2018Yeah, I mean I don\u2019t think anybody would listen to that and be like oh that\u2019s a real diss, like she must be crying. You\u2019ve gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way that you experienced it. Like you honestly didn\u2019t know who I was before that. It doesn\u2019t matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you didn\u2019t that, which is what happened. You didn\u2019t know who I was before that it\u2019s fine.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the recording has been released the online world has thrown their support behind Kim and Kanye.
