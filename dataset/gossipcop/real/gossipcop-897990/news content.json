Oh, and he also says he saw her and James in the hot tub together the night before. Now, not only do these two have history, but their significant others (Carter and Raquel, respectively) are not on the trip. Also though, this is JAX TALKING.\n\n\n\nThe devil is in the details, then (AKA the closed captioning, mercifully provided by the show). On the golf course later, Tom Sandoval asks James if he'd \u201chung out\u201d with Kristen and, innocently enough, James responds in the affirmative. Here\u2019s where wires got crossed: the rest of the guys who were listening thought Tom said, \u201chook up\u201d instead of \u201chang out.\u201d\n\nNews quickly spreads through the resort to the rest of the cast and lines are immediately drawn in the sand. For whatever reason (JK, it\u2019s tequila), no one quite remembers Tom and James\u2019 exact conversation, culminating in Kristen and James having a screaming match at dinner. She throws a drink at him and he storms out, calling her a \u201cratchet whore.\u201d\n\nThe gang decamps back to LA, where James has the full support of Raquel. Kristen has a harder time breaking down the rumour to long-time boyfriend, Carter. Why? Well\u2026 in the very early days of Kristen and Carter\u2019s relationship, she had hooked up with James (and had sex with him on the hood of her BMW).\n\nAnd that\u2019s not it! Jax, for some reason incensed that James and Kristen are getting away with \u201csomething,\u201d has a middle-finger meltdown at SUR, which causes him to be kicked out by his bosses, Lisa and Ken. How does this story end? We will find out at the season 6 reunion.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-3-08-33-pm-1523992268.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=1.00xw:0.893xh;0,0.0307xh&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0342xh&resize=1200:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0342xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Tallarico", "I M An Entertainment Writer Specializing In Things That Are None Of My Business."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/g19722703/vanderpump-rules-cheating-drama/", "title": "Vanderpump Rules Cheating Drama \u2014 All the Times Vanderpump Rules Cast Cheated", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "All The Times The Vanderpump Rules Cast Were Messy Drama Queen Cheaters", "description": "After all, you can't spell infidelity without \"LIT.\"", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/g19722703/vanderpump-rules-cheating-drama/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0342xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2018-04-21 03:45:17", "published_time": "2018-04-18 06:59:00", "section": "TV", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0342xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Vanderpump Rules Cheating Drama \u2014 All the Times Vanderpump Rules Cast Cheated", "description": "In the immortal words of Lisa Vanderpump, \u201cVilla Blanca is where you take your wife, SUR is where you take your mistress.\u201d", "keywords": "vanderpump rules, sur, bravo tv, bravo vanderpump, lisa vanderpump, jax taylor, stassi schroeder, tom sandoval, lala kent, james kennedy, kristen doute, scheana marie, jax taylor cheating, stassi schroeder cheating, james kennedy cheating, tom sandoval cheating, jax taylor cheater", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.220xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.contenttype": "listicle", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,tv", "sailthru.date": "2018-04-18T18:59:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0342xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-2-46-41-pm-1523990894.png?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.220xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "All The Times The Vanderpump Rules Cast Were Messy Drama Queen Cheaters", "sailthru.excerpt": "In the immortal words of Lisa Vanderpump, \u201cVilla Blanca is where you take your wife, SUR is where you take your mistress.\u201d While there are approximately 8,952 reality shows on television, even the most imaginative ones follow a formula based around things like family, romance, voyeurism, and/or talent &mdash; or..."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524005940.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
