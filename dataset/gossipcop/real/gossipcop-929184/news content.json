Tensions boil in particular between Rachel and Eleanor, Nick\u2019s steely and domineering mother, played by the legendary Michelle Yeoh.\n\nThe film is remarkable for how it balances the general with the specific, following the conventions of a fun, splashy, summer romantic comedy while providing nuanced representations of Asians, which have deeply resonated with Asian audiences.\n\nHere are some ways, both thematic and stylistic, in which the film captures aspects of Asian culture. (Minor spoilers ahead.)\n\nAsian-American Versus Asian\n\nEleanor doesn\u2019t just reject Rachel over class differences. As she explains in several pivotal scenes, she also looks down on her for being Asian-American and considers her not really Asian or not Asian enough, and therefore not worthy of marrying Nick.\n\nSetting up one of the central themes of the film, Rachel\u2019s mom, Kerry, warns her early on that while she may look Chinese, \u201chere and here, you\u2019re different.\u201d And she points to Rachel\u2019s head and heart.\n\nYou\u2019re a foreigner, an American. Eleanor Young to Rachel Chu, in one of the movie's climactic scenes\n\nLater, Rachel\u2019s friend Peik Lin (the riotously funny Awkwafina) reminds her that Nick\u2019s family sees her as \u201can unrefined \u2018banana\u2019 \u2014 yellow on the outside, white on the inside.\u201d It\u2019s an expression used to describe Asian-Americans.\n\nThe Mahjong Scene\n\nThe conflict between Eleanor and Rachel culminates in a mahjong showdown between the two women, a frenetic and impressively crafted scene in which the game\u2019s strategy and tactics cleverly match up with the women\u2019s conversation and symbolize their cultural tensions. (Journalist Jeff Yang has a much more comprehensive explanation of how the game works.)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a foreigner, an American,\u201d Eleanor says with derision, adding that Rachel is not \u201cour own kind.\u201d\n\nEleanor\u2019s remarks reflect the experience of many Asian-Americans when they go to Asia and meet their extended families. Those relatives then treat them as strangers, making them feel out of place. Add to that the experience of being seen as perpetual foreigners in the U.S., and Asian-Americans can feel caught between two cultures, not belonging in either world.\n\nSpeaking Chinese\n\nA significant portion of the film is conducted in Mandarin Chinese, and for those who understand that language, there are additional moments to savor.\n\nIn one climactic scene involving Nick running onto a plane, a woman in line to board, exasperated by the holdup, says, \u201cHello, quickly quickly,\u201d in Mandarin. Unlike some other non-English parts of the film, her remark is not subtitled, making it an Easter egg for some viewers.\n\nAnother potential Easter egg: When Nick, speaking Mandarin, orders food for Rachel, he discreetly asks for one dish with extra spice. Moments later, the taste of that dish appears to take Rachel by surprise.\n\nLanguage can also indicate social class. For example, Nick\u2019s grandmother, who presides over his ultra-wealthy family, speaks precise and refined Mandarin.\n\nSome scenes feature two major Chinese dialects, Cantonese and Hokkien.\n\nAlso, There\u2019s \u2018Singlish\u2019\n\nReflecting the range of cultures that form Singapore, viewers can also hear bits of Malay and \u201cSinglish,\u201d or Singaporean English. Kwan\u2019s book goes into much more detail about these various tongues, with sardonic footnotes explaining certain oft-used expressions.\n\nWhen Nick\u2019s family and friends send a flurry of text messages trying to find out information about Rachel, one person writes, \u201cWhy are there so many Rachel Chus, lah,\u201d tacking on a Singlish phrase commonly used for emphasis. (They also appear to be using WeChat, a messaging app popular among ethnic Chinese people, both in China and overseas.)\n\nWhile serving Rachel a multi-course meal, Peik Lin\u2019s mother tries to downplay it as just \u201csimple food, lah.\u201d\n\nAncient Designs With A Modern Flair\n\nChinese culture is reflected in some of the film\u2019s more subtle details and aesthetic choices.\n\nRachel and Nick\u2019s grand hotel room contains a blue and white ceramic vase that bears the Chinese characters for \u201cdouble happiness,\u201d a phrase often used in wedding decorations. The same characters appear on other objects and ornaments throughout the film.\n\nThe gates that lead to the Young family\u2019s mansion, Tyersall Park, are designed to resemble ancient Chinese coins with a square hole.\n\nThe film\u2019s style was also influenced by modern Asian cinema. Costume designer Mary Vogt told Vulture that the movie\u2019s color palette was inspired by the vivid colors of Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai\u2019s \u201cIn the Mood for Love,\u201d a favorite of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d director Jon M. Chu.\n\nThe Symbolism Of Red\n\nBefore Rachel embarks on her trip to meet Nick\u2019s family, Kerry instructs her to buy a red dress. The color symbolizes good luck and prosperity \u2014 as well as \u201cfertility,\u201d Kerry says with a wink.\n\nLater seeing the dress, Peik Lin\u2019s family teases Rachel about it before advising her to wear something more lavish to meet the Youngs.\n\n2018 WARNER BROS ENTERTAINMENT INC Peik Lin talks to Rachel about her much-too-simple red dress.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t red a lucky color?\u201d Rachel asks.\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re an envelope,\u201d Peik Lin\u2019s dad (Ken Jeong) jokes, referring to the red envelopes of money traditionally given at Chinese New Year and other special occasions, like weddings and births.\n\nAddressing Elders As \u201cAuntie\u201d And \u201cUncle\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me auntie,\u201d Peik Lin\u2019s mother instructs Rachel early in the film. In many Asian cultures, younger generations refer to older people as \u201caunts\u201d and \u201cuncles\u201d as a sign of respect, even if they\u2019re not related. The practice also reflects how close family friends can be considered family, especially in immigrant communities where, in the absence of relatives, friends provide a support system.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s hard to keep track of the correct forms of address, like when Rachel is unsure what exactly to call Eleanor: Mrs. Young or Auntie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still learning the lingo,\u201d she says nervously.\n\n2018 WARNER BROS ENTERTAINMENT INC Rachel and Nick greet Eleanor upon arriving at the Young mansion for the first time.\n\nMaking Dumplings As A Group\n\nMaking dumplings brings families together, particularly when celebrating Chinese New Year. In the film, Nick introduces Rachel to the assembly-line process: You first flatten the dough using a rolling pin (a smaller and thinner kind than its Western equivalent). Then you place a dollop of filling in the center of each circle of dough, and fold and crimp it to seal the dumpling and prevent the filling from leaking out when cooking. Nick\u2019s grandmother gives Eleanor, her daughter-in-law, a hard time for the appearance of her dumplings.\n\nBringing Leftover Meals On A Trip\n\nWhen they get to the airport for their flight to Singapore, Rachel shows Nick the three Tupperware containers of food prepared by Kerry for their long journey. Before heading to the airport in a key scene toward the end of the movie, Kerry can be seen carrying another container of food.\n\nWhich Chu Family Do You Come From?\n\nWhen meeting Rachel for the first time, Nick\u2019s cousin Eddie (Ronny Chieng) jokingly inquires which famous Chu family she belongs to. He offers up \u201cthe packing peanut Chus\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018Cup of Noodle\u2019 Chus,\u201d before finally asking, \u201cRachel, Chu are you?\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcf1900002b01501ea7.jpeg?cache=5tox3gpcxl&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b75e649200000420034a88f.jpeg?cache=lo6httrwe7&ops=210_120", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b76d53f1900002b015020f3.jpeg?cache=wioewyx7av&ops=210_120", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Left-21b09569bfefc9a8cbc653ce84457f56babbe8110db830981db681171fd94505.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-youtube-thumb-bc749e049bc1ccaa0c46e34471943d53a325b9901991bb2b6cc3d62e3d53321f.png", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcf1900002b01501ea7.jpeg?cache=5tox3gpcxl&ops=1778_1000", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cd4e0072500005500a0c2af.jpeg?ops=100_100", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/slideshow-tweet-thumb-86ce75b4fe0b7c897dac13973b0667c9f12ba3c538c72689a0a0ef69fe74f76f.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcb2000002c0034a71f.jpeg?cache=txlu512qkn&ops=210_120", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcb200000dd02379cb2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b71d3502000009f0037999b.jpeg?cache=nlrpr6qxrv&ops=210_120", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPost-Logo-Right-b109f49b50e598958eafa8a8405c6896be046ec55882a3cfa902854998b8fbb1.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b79b62d200000dd0237a0a6.jpeg?cache=met4ws8h6k&ops=210_120", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcf1900002b01501ea7.jpeg?cache=5tox3gpcxl&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crazy-rich-asians-cultural-references_n_5b7b29ede4b0a5b1febe0336", "title": "10 'Crazy Rich Asians' Culturally Nuanced Moments That Speak Directly To Asian Viewers", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "A look at some of the cultural references you might be wondering about.", "keywords": "Movies,Asian Americans,Crazy Rich Asians film,Culture of Asia,mandarin", "og": {"title": "10 'Crazy Rich Asians' Cultural Moments That Speak Directly To Asian Viewers", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcf1900002b01501ea7.jpeg?cache=5tox3gpcxl&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcf1900002b01501ea7.jpeg?cache=5tox3gpcxl&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/crazy-rich-asians-cultural-references_n_5b7b29ede4b0a5b1febe0336", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "A look at some of the cultural references you might be wondering about."}, "article": {"tag": "Movies,Asian Americans,Crazy Rich Asians film,Culture of Asia,mandarin", "section": "Asian Voices", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marina.fang", "published_time": "2018-08-21 14:29:35 -0400", "modified_time": "2018-08-21 16:17:21 -0400"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HPAsianVoices", "title": "10 'Crazy Rich Asians' Cultural Moments That Speak Directly To Asian Viewers", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b749dcf1900002b01501ea7.jpeg?cache=5tox3gpcxl&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "A look at some of the cultural references you might be wondering about.", "creator": "marinafang"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b7b29ede4b0a5b1febe0336", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "asian-voices"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534876175.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
