With a roster of candidates that includes \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d \u201cMean Girls\u201d and \u201cFrozen,\u201d these are the Tony nominations\u2019 biggest snubs and surprises:\n\nSURPRISE: Amy Schumer, \u201cMeteor Shower\u201d\n\nThe Steve Martin comedy \u201cMeteor Shower\u201d was one of the season\u2019s giant hits, thanks to Schumer\u2019s name on the marquee. But after the show earned very mixed reviews, no one expected Tony nominators to remember it particularly favorably, and even if they did, a nomination seemed most likely to have gone to Tony favorite Laura Benanti. Still, Schumer\u2019s performance impressed nominators enough that now she\u2019ll add an extra jolt of star power to the ceremony, where she\u2019s up against acting royalty Glenda Jackson, among others, in the race for lead actress in a play.\n\nSNUB: Chris Evans, \u201cLobby Hero\u201d\n\nThe \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d actor has surprised a lot of Broadway audiences with his turn in \u201cLobby Hero,\u201d in which he plays, very convincingly, a deeply unlikable cop who\u2019s a far cry from Captain America. But with shows like \u201cAngels in America\u201d and \u201cThe Iceman Cometh\u201d also in the mix, the field of male actors was particularly packed this season, and while nominators found room for \u201cLobby Hero\u201d cast members Brian Tyree Henry and Michael Cera, Evans was left out.\n\nSURPRISE: Michael Cera, \u201cLobby Hero\u201d\n\nPlaying a slacker doorman in \u201cLobby Hero,\u201d Michael Cera gives a performance that\u2019s so on-brand for the actor and so seemingly effortless that theatergoers have dismissed his work in what some might not notice is the play\u2019s linchpin role. But Tony nominators didn\u2019t make that mistake, giving Cera a nod for his skilled, subtle work.\n\nSNUB: \u201cFrozen\u201d\n\nSure, Disney\u2019s incipient hit earned a trio of big award noms, placing in the races for new musical, book of a musical (Jennifer Lee) and score (Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez). But that\u2019s the only recognition the production got from nominators, who overlooked notable contributors like director Michael Grandage, as well as the well-received lead performances from Caissie Levy and Patti Murin. (The silver lining: \u201cFrozen\u201d doesn\u2019t need Tony Awards to run forever, anyway.)\n\nSURPRISE: \u201cAngels in America\u201d breaks a record\n\nIf we were going to pick one show from this season that seemed most likely to hit a new high for total nominations earned by a play, we would have gone with sweeping two-part epic \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child,\u201d the frontrunner in the new play category. But while \u201cPotter\u201d emerged with a plenty impressive haul of 10 noms, it was another sweeping two-parter, \u201cAngels in America,\u201d that set a new record with 11 nods for play revival, including director (Marianne Elliott) and actors Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane, plus design awards. One of the most notable nods: A nomination in the category for original score (Adrian Sutton), where the play\u2019s music will compete with songs for musicals like \u201cThe Band\u2019s Visit\u201d and \u201cMean Girls.\u201d\n\nSNUB: Americans\n\nThis Tony season\u2019s big trend on the red carpet: English accents. With so many new plays and play revivals transferring to Broadway from the U.K. \u2014 including notable candidates like \u201cCursed Child\u201d and \u201cAngels\u201d \u2014 Brits dominate the nonmusical categories. For instance, three of the five new play nominees come from U.K. writers and performers, and in the lead actor in a play race, there\u2019s only one American, Denzel Washington (\u201cThe Iceman Cometh\u201d), up against Andrew Garfield (\u201cAngels in America\u201d), Tom Hollander (\u201cTravesties\u201d), Jamie Parker (\u201cHarry Potter\u201d) and Mark Rylance (\u201cFarinelli and the King\u201d). (Or maybe it\u2019s 1.5 Americans in the category: Garfield was born in California and has dual citizenship.)\n\nSURPRISE: John Leguizamo and \u201cLatin History for Morons\u201d\n\nJohn Leguizamo\u2019s latest solo show wasn\u2019t much on the radar as a potential nominee in a category dominated by \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.\u201d But \u201cLatin History for Morons,\u201d about his relationship with his son and his quest to learn all he could about the overlooked contributions of Latin Americans to American history, was one of the quiet successes of the Broadway season, recouping its commercial capitalization during its limited run on the boards. Tony nominators not only gave the show a nod for best play, but they went a step further by picking Leguizamo to receive a special Tony Award for his influential body of stage work.\n\nSNUB: \u201cEscape to Margaritaville\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect too many Parrotheads at Radio City next month. \u201cEscape to Margaritaville,\u201d the Jimmy Buffett musical that\u2019s having trouble attracting crowds, didn\u2019t get a single nomination, not even from a talent roster that included last year\u2019s directing Tony winner Christopher Ashley. That means no awards-season attention to potentially boost sales \u2014 although that doesn\u2019t mean producers of the Tony ceremony won\u2019t throw the show a bone and give it a performance segment on the live telecast.\n\nCBS will broadcast the 72nd annual Tony Awards live from Radio City Music Hall June 10, with Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban on board to host.\n\nRELATED VIDEO:", "images": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tony-nominations-snubs-and-suprises-2018.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2018%2Flegit%2Fawards%2F2018-tonys-snubs-surprises-nominations-amy-schumer-chris-evans-1202793534%2F&ct=article&lob=variety&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=1202793534&comment_count=3", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tony-nominations-snubs-and-suprises-2018.jpg?w=1000", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tony-nominations-snubs-and-suprises-2018.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gordon Cox"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/legit/awards/2018-tonys-snubs-surprises-nominations-amy-schumer-chris-evans-1202793534/", "title": "8 Biggest Tony Nominations Snubs and Surprises", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "With nominees like \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"Frozen,\" these are the morning's biggest snubs and surprises.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202793534, "author": "Gordon Cox", "pmc-category": "Awards,Box Office,News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-05-01T09:50:33"}, "pmc-tag": "Amy Schumer,Broadway,Chris Evans,Frozen,Tony Awards,Tony Nominations", "title": "8 Biggest Tony Nominations Snubs and Surprises", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "legit", "pmc-primary-category": "Awards", "pmc-primary-vertical": "legit", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "8 Biggest Tony Nominations Snubs and Surprises", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/legit/awards/2018-tonys-snubs-surprises-nominations-amy-schumer-chris-evans-1202793534/", "description": "Nominations for the 2018 Tony Awards were announced Tuesday morning \u2014 and they gave Broadway plenty to chatter about.
