Don\u2019t forget to subscribe for more exclusive interviews and photos, only in EW.\n\nThe series famous for giving makeovers is getting one of its own. Come February on Netflix, Karamo Brown (culture), Jonathan Van Ness (grooming), Tan France (fashion), Antoni Porowski (food and wine), and Bobby Berk (design) will assume the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy Fab 5 mantle once occupied by Jai Rodriguez, Kyan Douglas, Carson Kressley, Ted Allen, and Thom Filicia.\n\nWhen the show \u2014 which follows the stars as they give holistic makeovers to straight men \u2014 premiered in 2003 on Bravo, it quickly became a cultural phenomenon, even winning the Outstanding Reality Program Emmy the following year. A lot has changed in the years since, though. \u201cIt\u2019s a new time with a new audience,\u201d series creator David Collins tells EW. \u201cIf the original round was about tolerance, this time it is about acceptance.\u201d\n\nWhich means audiences \u2014 but especially each episode\u2019s subject, or \u201chero\u201d as they\u2019re called \u2014 will learn more about the Fab 5\u2019s personal lives as they ditch the concrete jungle of New York City to take on straight guys in red states. \u201cIn order to make the emotions bigger, you actually had to see how [the Fab 5] were reacting to being with a cop from the South who was a Trump supporter, [or] \u2018hillbilly Tom,\u2019 who refers to himself by saying \u2018you can\u2019t fix ugly,\u2019\u201d executive producer Rob Eric explains. \u201cThese guys walked away truly loving every single hero that they made over and talked about them for weeks afterward. It affected them just as much as they affected our hero.\u201d\n\nFinding the new Fab 5 was \u201ca blast,\u201d Collins says, but still no easy task. Producers narrowed the field from hundreds to 40 guys after an international search, with some \u201csilly, amazing\u201d auditions earlier this year in L.A. The result is an eclectic mix of personalities. Brown, who appeared on The Real World: Philadelphia, stood out for his charisma and style. Viewers may know Van Ness from his hit web series Gay of Thrones, or Berk from his line of home furnishings. Producers have former Fab 5-er Ted Allen to thank for finding Porowski; he was the Chopped host\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and personal chef. And France, originally from England, is the creator of women\u2019s clothing line Kingdom & State and co-creator of Rachel Parcell Inc, serving as lead designer for both brands until this year.\n\n\u201cEach one of them is so unique,\u201d Collins says proudly. Not to mention, fabulous.\n\nAbove, check out the exclusive first look at the new Fab 5, and below, Collins explains why now was the right time to revive the show, how the move to Netflix has given them more freedom, what he loves about each of the new guys, and whether we might see any of the original Fab 5 on the revival.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: In the couple episodes I got to watch, the thing that really stood is out is how much more of a \u201cconnection\u201d there seems to be between the new Fab 5 and the straight guy than I remember from the original series. These stories are so entirely different but so engrossing\u2026 and emotional!\n\nDAVID COLLINS: It\u2019s great to hear that. Storytelling, obviously, is ultimately the topline goal. There is a format to the show \u2014 it\u2019s all in pieces there \u2013 but for sure the episodic hero is our main focus, his story and his interactions with the Fab 5. It\u2019s all about story, always.\n\nWhen I watched the episode featuring Cory, the police officer from Winder, Georgia, I wondered where it would go with him considering he wasn\u2019t in huge need of a physical makeover, but that episode really proves it\u2019s not always about the clothes and mustache and hair.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that you bring up the makeover part because a lot of times for us, this time is \u2014 makeovers are very important and the reveal and all that, but really the bottom line is that inside change, that moment where they\u2019ve had a revelation, they\u2019ve had an understanding; \u201cconfidence breeds success\u201d has always been our through line there, and that\u2019s one of those things that I have to say we\u2019re really proud of that\u2019s come through in these individual stories.\n\nThere\u2019s a really powerful moment between Karamo and Cory as they discuss relations between police and black communities. Karamo admitted he was not excited to spend time with Cory because of something that happens at the beginning of the episode. Did you have any idea that\u2019s how he was going to react?\n\n[Laughs] We had no idea how Karamo was going to react, and it really ended up, obviously, driving the entire episode and telling the story. The experience of our Fab 5 with each guy is real-time \u2014 five full days with our guy \u2014 so that conversation really got to grow organically and authentically over their time together, and that\u2019s been something in the Netflix Queer Eye that we\u2019ve been able to do, which is allow those relationships to really develop and grow over their time together.\n\nOn that topic, what kind of new freedoms do you have being on Netflix versus cable?\n\nA lot. There was the one \u201cgay day\u201d in the original Queer Eye and in this one we realized that the Fab 5 and the time spent with our episodic hero was critical. To allow a real, authentic relationship to grow, you gotta hang out, you gotta have some coffee, you gotta eat some bread. Those are the moments we realized really gave breadth to the story\u2026 you see how the conversation grows and especially how the questions change; the episodic hero says, \u201cHuh, well I never thought of it this way, but what about this?\u201d and our Fab 5, because we get to hear their stories now and see them and hear their journey as part of the individual episode, it\u2019s been a really great marriage of those two worlds.\n\nWhy was now the right time to revive the show?\n\nIt\u2019s one of those things that for me is really simple: It\u2019s a really great show, and it\u2019s a new time with a new audience. The millennials don\u2019t remember the old show. It\u2019s got such a great heart and soul and humor to it, so I\u2019m excited for a new audience. But I guess if there was something to be real specific, if the original round was about tolerance, this time it is about acceptance. We ultimately realized that there was a great opportunity for the Fab 5 to grow and be much more open about their personal lives. If you think about the original five, we definitely weren\u2019t going to be talking about that Tan is married to a Mormon cowboy, let alone that he\u2019s Muslim. [Laughs] So it\u2019s those authentic moments that really pay off in this new version of Queer Eye.\n\nWhy now? There\u2019s really an ultimate moment: Why not? These are five guys who come in, they help someone in not just the outward but the inward, and ultimately, we\u2019ve always said confidence breed success, and when they bring that confidence into someone\u2019s world, like Tom \u2014 when you see Tom realize that he starts to feel good about himself, you see it, you feel it. And the same with Cory; Cory had such a great experience. It\u2019s been funny, because we had to keep everything under wraps, he is so dying to reconnect with the guys. He keeps texting and sending me Instagram messages because he really wants to stay in touch with them. It\u2019s been that; it\u2019s kinda cool.\n\nWhich one of the Fab 5 did you cast first?\n\nThe casting was a blast. [Laughs] We had a really large nationwide \u2014 actually it was global because we had Australia and the U.K. all part of our casting \u2014 we had literally hundreds and hundreds of guys that we went through, and we ultimately picked our top 40 and flew them all out to Los Angeles and had a three-and-a-half day extravaganza like you\u2019ve never seen. [Laughs] We brought everyone to the same hotel and we rented out this big banquet hall room and had some silly, amazing casting going on. The team really \u2014 it\u2019s probably one of those full circle moments for me \u2014 when the first Fab 5 were coming together, the same thing happened; it just starts to happen, the chemistry starts to click, you see that this guy and that guy are an amazing duo, and then you add the third, fourth, and fifth and you realize, wow, this is a team. Each one of them is so unique.\n\nWhat is it you love about each of them?\n\nJonathan, obviously, it would be hard to miss how authentic he is. He\u2019s so proud of being himself and he\u2019s so confident in himself because he really battled that. He was the middle-of-nowhere kid who really grew up getting bullied hard. He fought, he really fought, for being who he is; he has no body shame, he has no shame of his sexuality, he is beautifully himself and authentic. [Laughs] And he\u2019s kinda funny too\u2026 just cracking you up at every turn.\n\nKaramo is just the epitome of style and taste and class. He\u2019s so charismatic, he pulls you right in, smart as a whip. What\u2019s beautiful about him is, he\u2019s an amazing listener; he stops and really hears what everyone, what the guys are saying to him and then he\u2019s able to really process that and bring it back. It\u2019s really a beautiful gift of his.\n\nTan\u2026 style and class\u2026 he is the full picture there. His sense of posh is just beautiful. He\u2019s also got that edge to him. He\u2019s a little like Adele, I used to say [laughs] \u2014 Adele has that gorgeous voice and she sings so beautifully, and then when she talks she\u2019s got that Cockney accent and will tell you how to shove it up your whatever. Tan\u2019s got the same thing; he\u2019s smart and witty, but always classy.\n\nBobby, aside from being crazily talented \u2014 he\u2019s so, so good with what he does with his style and his design work \u2014 Bobby is a guy who worked really hard to get where he is. He\u2019ll tell you, he\u2019s a kid who grew up with nothing and really fought hard to really do well for himself. He\u2019s a hard worker, he\u2019s a really hard worker, and he brought that to the table. He really cared about each of our episodes and each of the guys and bringing something special along the way.\n\nAnd then, Mr. Antoni. He\u2019s just so filled with passion and he\u2019s scarily smart. He was actually Ted [Allen]\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Ted sent him our way and we couldn\u2019t be happier. He\u2019s got that adorable face and you just want to squeeze his little head off. He\u2019s so, so smart, he\u2019s very well read, and his sense of passion and taste is beautiful as well.\n\nSpeaking of Ted, is there any chance we\u2019ll see the original Fab 5 show up in any episodes with the new guys, or does moving the show from New York into more rural areas make that difficult?\n\nWell, I\u2019m not going to say no or never because you never know, but the new team is there and\u2026 I can\u2019t say no because who knows, maybe we will do something where they all come together. But I think right now it\u2019s the new show, it\u2019s the new Fab 5 and they are definitely out there in the red states and seeing the world. It\u2019s kind of their moment and their time, but definitely the original guys, the OG, are thrilled for us. That\u2019s probably been one of the most beautiful things is that everyone has been so supportive on this journey and really, really loved each other. The Fab 10, as they are, have all really bonded beautifully.\n\nQueer Eye will debut on Netflix in February.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F13%2Fbetter-call-saul-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2Frhbh-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F09%2Flennykravitz.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2F115093_46282_b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F09%2FHomeland_810_4979_R.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2F115093_48676b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2017%2F11%2Frolestout.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F17%2FNUP_189932_0195.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2FListen-to-Your-Heart.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F10%2Fcelebrity-binge.jpg%3Fw%3D768", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2F116494_0767b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fqueereye-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fqueereye-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fthe-voice-rec.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Frhony.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2064'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2Fdee-rogan-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F12%2Fsnl.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F03%2Fgreys-anatomy-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Fevan-rachel-wood-aaron-paul-1.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F14%2Fthe-challenge-b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F10%2Foutlander-sea5.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F15%2F116400_1225b.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F04%2F08%2FRVD417d_0162b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1047&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fqueereye-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gerrad Hall", "Seija Rankin", "Jodi Walker", "Maureen Lee Lenker", "Andy Hoglund", "Dalton Ross", "Chancellor Agard", "Samantha Highfill", "Sydney Bucksbaum", "James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/08/queer-eye-fab-5-netflix-first-look/", "title": "Meet the new Queer Eye Fab 5 in this first look", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Exclusive,First Look,Netflix", "news_keywords": "Exclusive,First Look,Netflix", "description": "The makeover reality series revival premieres in February on Netflix", "og": {"title": "Meet the new 'Queer Eye' Fab 5 in this first look", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/08/queer-eye-fab-5-netflix-first-look/", "description": "To see more from the First Look issue, pick up the latest Entertainment Weekly on stands Friday, or buy it here now.
