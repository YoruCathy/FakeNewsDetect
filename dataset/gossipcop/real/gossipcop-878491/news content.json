Throughout the history of the Academy Awards, there have been actors and actresses who have received multiple Academy Awards for Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, or Best Supporting Actress.[1] The only restriction is that actors cannot receive multiple nominations for the same performance.[2] This rule was implemented after Barry Fitzgerald received a Best Actor and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Going My Way.[3]\n\nAs of 2020 , 43 actors and actresses have received two or more Academy Awards in acting categories. Katharine Hepburn leads the way with four Best Actress awards.[4] Five have won three Academy Awards: Daniel Day-Lewis (three Best Actor awards), Meryl Streep (two Best Actress awards and one Best Supporting Actress award), Jack Nicholson (two Best Actor awards and one Best Supporting Actor award),[5] Ingrid Bergman (two Best Actress awards and one Best Supporting Actress award),[6] and Walter Brennan (three Best Supporting Actor awards),[7] Brennan was the first to receive three or more Academy Awards in 1940, followed by Hepburn in 1968, Bergman in 1974, Nicholson in 1997, Streep in 2011, and most recently Day-Lewis in 2012. Of the six, only Nicholson, Streep, and Day-Lewis are still living.\n\nWhile there is no restriction on a performer winning the Best Actor/Actress and Best Supporting Actor/Actress awards in the same year for two different roles in two different movies, this has yet to happen.\n\n\u2020 = deceased\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nMedia related to Actors with multiple Academy Award wins at Wikimedia Commons", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Video-x-generic.svg/28px-Video-x-generic.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/wikimedia-button.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg/220px-Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg/1200px-Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg/1200px-Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_actors_with_two_or_more_Academy_Awards_in_acting_categories", "title": "List of actors with two or more Academy Awards in acting categories", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.35.0-wmf.28", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "og": {"image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg/1200px-Katharine_Hepburn_promo_pic.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
