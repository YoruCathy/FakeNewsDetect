All Rights Reserved.\n\nIf you are a reasonable human person, your first reaction upon seeing Julianna Margulies in Dietland was to shout \u201cwig!\u201d and so, after doing just that, we decided to investigate just what was going on with her hair. On the AMC series, based on Sarai Walker\u2019s book, the naturally curly- and raven-haired Margulies plays Kitty Montgomery, a fearsome magazine editor with a distinctive flame-red do. The hair makes Margulies even more intimidating than usual, especially when playing against Joy Nash\u2019s Plum Kettle. Ahead of the show\u2019s Monday premiere, Vulture got on the phone with Dietland\u2019s head of hair Sarah Hindsgaul to learn everything we could about Margulies\u2019s new look.\n\nIt (almost) matches Kitty\u2019s hair in the book\n\nKitty was always going to be a redhead. At a Vulture Festival panel, Margulies said that Walker chose the hair color because the character was based on a woman who did not have red hair and she wanted to hide her identity. The show followed the description in the book, with one exception. \u201cIn the book though, it\u2019s big and curly,\u201d Hindsgaul said. \u201cWe took that away and laid it down because otherwise it was just crazy.\u201d\n\nMargulies was willing to experiment\n\nHindsgaul said that Margulies, who wore a wig on The Good Wife, was happy to experiment with a variety of shades of red until they found one that worked best for her skin color. \u201cWe just wanted to make sure that it\u2019s the right shade of red, that she could carry it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to darken it so it was a deeper red. We ended up going with it very, very bright and silky and shiny. I think it really brings out the fire in her character. We paled her out a little bit, so she gets a very \u2018plastic-y\u2019 look.\u201d\n\nKitty definitely dyes her hair\n\n\u201cA woman that\u2019s in charge of a fashion magazine, I feel like they have a look and they stick to it,\u201d Hindsgaul said, \u201cShe probably looked like that the last 25 years.\u201d Hindsgaul imagines Kitty as having a very particular beauty routine, which meant that her wig is precisely layered and arranged into the stiff-yet-flowing look she\u2019d prefer. \u201cI think a woman like that has a hair-and-makeup artist show up every single morning in their apartment and it gets done for the day,\u201d she said. \u201c[She\u2019s] definitely dying her hair. I mean, this is a choice that she made.\u201d The wig, as you might guess, is also dyed red.\n\nJoy Nash is also wearing a wig\n\nDietland needed to hide Nash\u2019s natural confidence \u2014 and her own fiery red hair \u2014 so they chose a messy bob-like cut that would flatten her face and hide her distinctive eyebrows. \u201cThe color of the Plum wig is like completely natural, undyed hair to get it as flat and as plain as possible,\u201d Hindsgaul said. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t have a lot of self-esteem always tries to cover their face as much as possible, so it\u2019s just this really sad, droopy thing.\u201d\n\nThe show has tons of other wigs\n\nAs the story line progresses, Plum tries out various makeovers and even imagines her looks differently in a few dream sequences. Those required a series of fantastical wigs \u2014 many of them synthetic and in bright colors. \u201cI have never done this many wigs on a non-period show,\u201d Hindsgaul, who also works on Stranger Things, said. \u201cSometimes we shot four different wigs for her in one day. We just kept on changing her up.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/31/31-dietland.w1200.h630.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/31/31-dietland.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/0da/6a3/acc3a4da4b0db3eb648f313e668d7c0672-04-10-2020-social-cover-issue-8.w90.h120.2x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/31/31-dietland.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/dietland-julianna-margulies-wig.html", "title": "Everything to Know About Julianna Margulies\u2019s Dietland Wig", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Everything to Know About Julianna Margulies\u2019s Dietland Wig", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/dietland-julianna-margulies-wig.html", "description": "The story behind Kitty Montgomery\u2019s flame-red look.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/31/31-dietland.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Everything to Know About Julianna Margulies\u2019s Dietland Wig", "description": "The story behind Kitty Montgomery\u2019s flame-red look.", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/05/31/31-dietland.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@McHenryJD", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-04T14:32:54.696Z", "tag": "dietland, wigs, tv, julianna margulies, amc", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Obsessed with Julianna Margulies\u2019s wig in AMC\u2019s \u2018Dietland\u2019?
