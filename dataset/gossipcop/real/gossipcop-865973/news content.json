Among other unverified claims, the gossip website said Kardashian agreed to pay Chyna $20,000 a month in child support in order to ensure there are nannies on duty when she leaves home \"to party.\"\n\nThat last claim infuriated Bloom, who said Chyna, like many working mothers, sometimes leaves her baby with a nanny while she goes to work.\n\n\"Chyna did not leave 'Dream at home this weekend while she left to party.' This is a false and outrageous statement,\" Bloom said in her statement.\n\n\"Rob should stop defaming the mother of his child and instead should become accustomed himself to the concept of working for a living \u2014 something Chyna has always done before, during and after her relationship with him to support herself and her children.\"\n\nThis last was a dig at the work habits of Kardashian, a member of the multi-millionaire Kardashian-Jenner clan who lacks their resources. Instead, he owns a sock company.\n\nSniping-by-leak-and-or-press release has been going on for months between Kardashian and Chyna.\n\nBut it reached a repulsive level in July when he attacked his estranged ex-fianc\u00e9e on Instagram and Twitter by posting pictures of her naked breasts, backside and genitals and accusing her in profane terms of sleeping with another man in \"the same bed Chyna and I made our baby in.\"\n\nEven though he took down some of the pictures, it made him vulnerable to charges of revenge porn, which is a crime in California. Soon, Chyna and Bloom were in court seeking, and receiving, a temporary restraining order over the social media posts and claims that Kardashian had beaten her.\n\nThe hearing Monday was to discuss an extension of the restraining order. Now that Kardashian has agreed to stay away, the hearing is no longer necessary, Bloom said.\n\nIt's not clear what else remains to be resolved, and Bloom did not provide details.\n\nKardashian's lawyer, his late father's old friend Robert Shapiro, did not return an email from USA TODAY seeking comment.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98e267d0ccb3206befe5af92fdd78ef9dee83d43/c=164-0-2900-3648/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410884099779861-XXX-IMG-AP-PEOPLE-ROB-KARDAS-1-1-T2IVA59V.JPG?width=300&height=400&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/206d93eb1a64598cd30954b93072ae7dd91890b9/c=0-437-3056-2164/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410884099779861-XXX-IMG-AP-PEOPLE-ROB-KARDAS-1-1-T2IVA59V.JPG?width=3056&height=1727&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5501263313001_5501252903001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/206d93eb1a64598cd30954b93072ae7dd91890b9/c=0-437-3056-2164/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410884099779861-XXX-IMG-AP-PEOPLE-ROB-KARDAS-1-1-T2IVA59V.JPG?width=3056&height=1727&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/09/15/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-settle-part-their-toxic-dispute/671249001/", "title": "Rob Kardashian, Blac Chyna settle part of their toxic dispute", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Rob Kardashian, Blac Chyna settle part of their toxic dispute", "description": "The parents have agreed to 'peacefully co-parent' their daughter Dream, according to Chyna's lawyer.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/09/15/rob-kardashian-blac-chyna-settle-part-their-toxic-dispute/671249001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/206d93eb1a64598cd30954b93072ae7dd91890b9/c=0-437-3056-2164/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410884099779861-XXX-IMG-AP-PEOPLE-ROB-KARDAS-1-1-T2IVA59V.JPG?width=3056&height=1727&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3056, "height": 1727}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Maria Puente", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The parents have agreed to 'peacefully co-parent' their daughter Dream, according to Chyna's lawyer.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/206d93eb1a64598cd30954b93072ae7dd91890b9/c=0-437-3056-2164/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410884099779861-XXX-IMG-AP-PEOPLE-ROB-KARDAS-1-1-T2IVA59V.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Rob Kardashian, Blac Chyna settle part of their toxic dispute", "description": "The parents have agreed to 'peacefully co-parent' their daughter Dream, according to Chyna's lawyer."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505404800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
