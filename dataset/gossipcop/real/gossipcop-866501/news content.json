In May, she was sentenced for bankruptcy fraud and bringing $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the country without reporting it.\n\nIn addition to prison time, a federal judge also ordered her to pay a $40,000 fine and spend two years on probation after her release.\n\nIn the case, prosecutors said Miller was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy when she tried to hide $775,000 worth of income from her Lifetime network reality show and its spinoffs.\n\nThe investigation began when a channel-surfing bankruptcy judge saw Miller on TV in December 2012 and figured she had to be making more than the $8,899 in monthly income she was claiming.\n\nEntertainment Tonight caught up with Miller at a red-carpet event in Los Angeles on Saturday night, when she talked about her pending imprisonment.\n\n\"I'll just have me to concentrate on and that\u2019s different,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"I\u2019ve always put everybody else\u2019s child first, before my own health, before my own outfit, before my own time frame. Everybody else was dressed and out the door and looking perfect and I was running around trying to find a clean towel to take a shower with, so I think this will be a little 'me' time.\"\n\nMiller announced in March 2016 that she was leaving Dance Moms. In an Instagram post, she declared that she would no longer participate in the series as she had \"ASKED, BEGGED, AND EVEN DEMANDED CREATIVE CREDIT FOR ALL THE IDEAS, AWARD WINNING ROUTINES, THEMES, AND COSTUMING\" without success.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe1a2be9b6dcfc7cc1f08f8f441b6defe52dbe88/c=0-0-1992-1126/local/-/media/2017/07/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636354504340680254-GTY-810865908.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6b58521a57e28de6ee38ab235c48107ced6a410a/c=0-74-1992-2730/local/-/media/2017/07/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636354504340680254-GTY-810865908.jpg?width=300&height=401&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5504135653001_5504127253001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001&width=660&height=372&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe1a2be9b6dcfc7cc1f08f8f441b6defe52dbe88/c=0-0-1992-1126/local/-/media/2017/07/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636354504340680254-GTY-810865908.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/07/12/dance-moms-star-abby-lee-miller-reports-prison/471450001/", "title": "'Dance Moms' star Abby Lee Miller checks into prison", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "og": {"title": "'Dance Moms' star Abby Lee Miller checks into prison", "description": "Former 'Dance Moms' star is at a federal facility in Victorville, Calif. to serve a 366-day sentence for bankruptcy fraud, more.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/07/12/dance-moms-star-abby-lee-miller-reports-prison/471450001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe1a2be9b6dcfc7cc1f08f8f441b6defe52dbe88/c=0-0-1992-1126/local/-/media/2017/07/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636354504340680254-GTY-810865908.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1992, "height": 1126}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Lorena Blas", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Former 'Dance Moms' star is at a federal facility in Victorville, Calif. to serve a 366-day sentence for bankruptcy fraud, more.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 215046668549694}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe1a2be9b6dcfc7cc1f08f8f441b6defe52dbe88/c=0-0-1992-1126/local/-/media/2017/07/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636354504340680254-GTY-810865908.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "'Dance Moms' star Abby Lee Miller checks into prison", "description": "Former 'Dance Moms' star is at a federal facility in Victorville, Calif. to serve a 366-day sentence for bankruptcy fraud, more."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499788800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
