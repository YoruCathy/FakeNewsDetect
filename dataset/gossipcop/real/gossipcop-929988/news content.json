The duo loves it when other artists record songs they have written.\n\nTyler and Brian have written many of their own hit songs. However, they have had hits they wrote recorded by other artists like Jason Aldean\u2018s \u201cBurnin\u2019 It Down\u201d and \u201cYou Make It Easy\u201d as well as Cole Swindell\u2018s \u201cHope You Get Lonely Tonight,\u201d just to name a few. The songwriter in them gets excited when they hear those songs sung by another artist.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just something special about hearing another artist sing a song that we were a part of writing,\u201d Tyler admits, \u201cand somehow just kind of putting their stamp on it and saying I believe in this song. That just means a lot to us as songwriters.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t get satisfaction from having a hit song that they both wrote and recorded. It is just something different seeing another artist having success with a song they wrote.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s an FGL song or, probably even more exciting, someone else singing one of our songs, it\u2019s always rewarding,\u201d Tyler states. \u201cIt never gets old and it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nTyler and Brian teamed with Michael Hardy and Mark Holman to write their current single titled \u201cSimple.\u201d The song has reached the top five this week on the country radio airplay singles charts. It could become the duo\u2019s next chart topper as singer-songwriters in the coming weeks.\n\nHere\u2019s to more success for Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley as both singers and songwriters in the future.\n\nListen for \u201cSimple\u201d by Florida Georgia Line as well as the songs by Jason Aldean and Cole Swindell that Tyler and Brian wrote on Bloomington-Normal\u2019s #1 Country, B104.\n\nBy: Buck Stevens", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2014/10/amazon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2014/10/googleplay.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=181461212508101&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://cumulus.pro.poolb.tritondigitalcms.com/wbwn-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2014/10/facebook.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2016/05/listen-live.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/380/2018/01/02150338/Alexa-Social-Logo-MUSIC.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://cumulus.pro.poolb.tritondigitalcms.com/wbwn-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2015/04/site-logo-1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://cumulus.pro.poolb.tritondigitalcms.com/wbwn-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2014/10/twitter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2014/10/appstore.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/380/2018/09/21103426/Florida-Georgia-Line-652x512.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2015/04/220_Buck.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://cumulus.pro.poolb.tritondigitalcms.com/wbwn-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2015/01/cumulus-vip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2014/10/sweetdeals.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://www.wbwn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/380/2016/03/instagramicon.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/6616/sites/380/2018/09/21103426/Florida-Georgia-Line-652x512.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755/http://www.wbwn.com/2018/09/21/florida-georgia-line-loves-writing-songs-other-artists-record/", "title": "Florida Georgia Line Loves Writing Songs Other Artists Record", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "B104 WBWN-FM", "title": "Florida Georgia Line Loves Writing Songs Other Artists Record", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180921184755/http://www.wbwn.com/2018/09/21/florida-georgia-line-loves-writing-songs-other-artists-record/", "type": "article", "description": "Tyler Hubbard and Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line are not only singers, they are also song writers.
