For you, it's, 'Do we still go to Celine's show on Tuesday night, only two days after the nightmare?' For me, it's, 'Can I still do my show? Should I still do my show only two days after the nightmare?' These are difficult questions.\"\n\nDion said she ultimately decided to go on with her performances \"to show love and support for those who are affected.\"\n\n\"On Sunday, we lost too many beautiful, innocent souls and so many are still suffering. But tonight, we are going to let these families know that we are supporting them and that we will help them through their tragic loss,\" she said. \"They are going to need a lot of love, a ton of emotional support, as well as a great deal of financial aid.\"\n\nRead More", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif?labels=noscript%3ANo%20Labels%20Set", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160906115810-iyw-impact-your-world-background-full-169.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171004075904-celion-dion-vegas-super-tease.jpg", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160923150226-impact-your-world-logo-resized-large-169.png", "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171004075904-celion-dion-vegas-large-169.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171004075904-celion-dion-vegas-super-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/entertainment/celine-dion-vegas-shooting-victims/index.html", "title": "Celine Dion donates concert proceeds to Vegas shooting victims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "section": "entertainment", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "og": {"pubdate": "2017-10-04T16:10:54Z", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/04/entertainment/celine-dion-vegas-shooting-victims/index.html", "title": "Celine Dion donates concert proceeds to Vegas shooting victims", "description": "An emotional Celine Dion returned to the stage in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, two days after the city and the country were rocked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.", "site_name": "CNN", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171004075904-celion-dion-vegas-super-tease.jpg", "width": 1100, "height": 619}}, "pubdate": "2017-10-04T16:10:54Z", "lastmod": "2017-10-05T14:30:48Z", "author": "Sandra Gonzalez, CNN", "twitter": {"title": "Celine Dion donates concert proceeds to Vegas shooting victims", "description": "An emotional Celine Dion returned to the stage in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, two days after the city and the country were rocked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171004075904-celion-dion-vegas-super-tease.jpg"}, "description": "An emotional Celine Dion returned to the stage in Las Vegas on Tuesday night, two days after the city and the country were rocked by the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.", "keywords": "entertainment, Celine Dion donates concert proceeds to Vegas shooting victims  - CNN", "thumbnail": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171004075904-celion-dion-vegas-super-tease.jpg", "vr": {"canonical": "https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/04/entertainment/celine-dion-vegas-shooting-victims/index.html"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content-tier": "free"}, "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489, "pages": "5550296508,18793419640"}, "template-top": "entertainment,bra-impact-your-world,art-img"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507046400.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
