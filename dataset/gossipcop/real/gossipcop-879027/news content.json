She expressed an interest in its change from the inside positive towards its current trajectory, \"the organization really did exactly what it was meant to do, and that was to empower women and give them the skills to be able to stand up for themselves.\"[8]\n\nIn August 2018, Mund criticized the Miss America Organization in a five-page letter, stating \"My voice is not heard nor wanted by our current leadership, nor do they have any interest in knowing who I am and how my experiences relate to positioning the organization for the future.\" [21] She further stated, \"The rhetoric about empowering women, and openness and transparency, is great; however, the reality is quite different. I am living that difference. To stay silent is to give away my power and the power of the women who will follow me. I am not comfortable with any of us being controlled, manipulated, silenced, or bullied.\"[22] In January 2020, the leadership was removed.[23]\n\nOn December 8, 2019, Mund became the first and only Miss America to ever judge the Miss Universe Competition.
