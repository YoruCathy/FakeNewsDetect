He faces up to five years behind bars. He was charged with filing false tax returns in 2010 and 2012 and not paying taxes on $8.9 million in income.\n\nThe court granted his lawyer\u2019s request for a delay in sentencing, now set for June 20, 2018. Sorrentino, on probation, also received permission to travel to Florida for the Jersey Shore Family Vacation reunion show. A requirement was he not consume any alcohol.\n\nNext: The woman by his side\n\n3.

He was clearly on something when the cast went camping. He paced back and forth near the campfire as his friends asked what was wrong. Worried someone was going to jump out at them, he eventually hid out in a tent.\n\nSoon after taping the season, he entered a 60-day stint in rehab for addiction to prescription medication. When that was done, his website released a statement thanking fans, friends, and family for their support.\n\nNext: He hit rock bottom again\n\n5.

Pesce pleaded with him not to go on the pills. \u201cYou know [painkillers] are not good for you \u2014 whether they\u2019re doctor prescribed or not,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been down this road before.\u201d\n\nBut he used the doctor\u2019s orders as an excuse to go back on painkillers, he said. Eventually, he again sought help and has been sober since then.\n\nNext: What are his family plans?\n\n6. Plans for the future\n\nSorrentino is looking to move ahead in his life. | Sorrentino is looking to move ahead in his life. | Lauren Elizabeth via Instagram\n\nAlthough he faces possible jail time, Sorrentino has put on a brave face, with Pesce\u2019s support. He is happy to \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d with her most nights \u2014 including sometimes watching old Jersey Shore episodes.\n\nThe two say they plan to tie the knot soon. Speculation was it might even happen on Jersey Shore Family Vacation Season 2. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ready for this, so we\u2019re definitely not looking for a long engagement,\u201d Sorrentino said. One of his most important priorities? \u201cHaving a family and kids.\u201d\n\nNext: What he does for a living (other than Jersey Shore)\n\n7.
