{"url": "https://thesaltyju.com/tag/jessie-james-decker/", "text": "Since Valentine\u2019s Day was Saturday, I thought it would be an appropriate time to list all of the celebrity couples that I would\u2019ve liked to be a third wheel with for the holiday of Looooove. Here\u2019s the ten best celeb couples (in no particular order) who are going to make it the long haul\u2026according to me. (If you\u2019re reading this months or weeks from now and any or all of these couples have broken up please do not blame me. I\u2019m still reeling from the dissolution of Nick and Jessica. It\u2019ll be too much to handle if I\u2019m also a curse.)\n\nJohn Krasinski & Emily Blunt.\n\nI have a REAL difficult time separating John Krasinski from Jim Halpert and I think many Office fans can agree, which basically means that John must be the most romantic and adorable husband alive. The best part is that Emily Blunt is a sassy Brit instead of a meek little deer in the headlights like Pam was, so this relationship is EVEN better. They prank Jimmy Kimmel together every year, they crushed the ALS ice bucket challenge and they never take Hollywood too seriously.\n\nYears Together: 7 (Married in 2010)\n\nBeyonce & Jay-Z.\n\nThere cannot be a top celeb couples list without the Queen & King themselves. They\u2019re outrageously rich and spend like 90% of their time just F-ing around on yachts with baby royalty Blue Ivy. I respect the hell out of their lavish lifestyles because they deliver some sick beats, and most recently the coolest married couple concert ever. Only Bey & Jay can get away with recording a song about the two of them banging constantly and make the term \u201cSurfbordt\u201d popular. Also no one should ever be caught saying bad things about these two, because Illuminati.\n\nYears Together: 11 (Married in 2008)\n\nBen Affleck & Jennifer Garner.\n\nBen and Jen are easily the most normal Hollywood couple ever. They\u2019re more likely to be seen taking their kids to school or going to a soccer game in sneakers and jeans than doing stupid frivolous celeb things. They\u2019re not all in yo face when they\u2019re at awards shows together and Jen even let it slide when Ben won a bunch of awards for Argo and said that their marriage was work cause he got nervsies. Cool, calm and all about the fam.\n\nYears Together: 11 (Married in 2005)\n\nBlake Lively & Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHave you seen these two? I have unrealistic high hopes that their baby will be the most beautiful baby on this earth, should they ever show her or reveal her name. Also I have a bigger crush on Blake than I do on Ryan, judge me, I dare you. Although it certainly helps Ryan\u2019s charisma that he recently called Blake a human Denny\u2019s because she\u2019s breakfast lunch and dinner for their daughter. He\u2019s quick to add that she\u2019s the most beautiful Denny\u2019s you\u2019ve ever seen. Swooooon.\n\nYears Together: 4 (Married in 2012)\n\nEric Decker & Jessie James Decker.\n\nI first learned about these two when they got a reality TV show on E! and I loved them immediately but was also SUUUPER nervsies that they would catch the reality show curse of Newlyweds. They\u2019ve got a little bit of the Nick & Jessica dynamic because Jessie\u2019s the goofy crazy one and Eric calms her down and puts up with her antics, but I\u2019m pleased to report that their marriage is still intact and they recently had the most adorbs baby ever. I don\u2019t even like babies and I\u2019m obsessed with this one so that\u2019s saying a lot. Please feel free to drool over their family photos like I do on a regular basis.\n\nYears Together: 4 (Married in 2013)\n\nEmma Stone & Andrew Garfield.\n\nThese two crazy kids have a nice way of staying mostly private but still letting everyone know that they\u2019re in love and are fun and stuff. Emma made an appearance when Andrew hosted SNL and they did a goofy kissing skit together. They\u2019re known for photobombing and using their paparazzi shots to promote good causes. Also this just gives me an excuse to post Emma Stone\u2019s lip sync battle on Fallon, which was epic. When Fallon had Andrew on after that he pointed out that they should\u2019ve never given Emma a mic because she got real serious with it, real quick. The couple that lip syncs at home together, stays together.\n\nYears Together: 4\n\nChrissy Teigen & John Legend.\n\nI\u2019m starting to see a trend here with the outspoken crazy girl and the other half that calms her down and I HAVE NO IDEA WHY. Anyway Chrissy is a supermodel who also has a pottymouth, isn\u2019t afraid to look like an idiot and creates twitter wars with her haters. John is a classy 9-time Grammy-winning singer/songwriter piano playing extraordinaire. They met on the set of one of his music videos. They found love in a hopeless place. Just kitten, but seriously all you need to do is watch the music video for \u201cAll of Me\u201d and your heart will be all kinds of melting. Chrissy also pretty frequently screenshots her texts with John where she basically just trolls him, which is always good for a laugh. Bonus Points: When she had an ugly crying face after seeing John perform at the Globes she handled it real well. By making fun of herself.\n\nYears Together: 8 (Married in 2013)\n\nDavid & Victoria Beckham.\n\nAh, British royalty. Becks was the sex-tastic futbol player, Victoria was Posh Spice. It was the 90\u2019s and everything was magical. Becks fell in love with Posh\u2019s ability to never look like she\u2019s having an ounce of fun and the rest is history. They invaded America finally and we all haven\u2019t been the same since. They also created a crop of future models with their four kids that have been high fashion since they were in diapers. Harper\u2019s toddler top knot at fashion week for all the awards.\n\nYears Together: 18 (Married in 1999)\n\nChanning Tatum & Jenna Dewan-Tatum.\n\nThey met on the set of Step Up, arguably one of the best dance movies of all time and couldn\u2019t deny the chemistry of their dirty dancing. They got married and Channing rewarded every woman in America with Magic Mike and his \u201cPony\u201d striptease. And Jenna was like yeah bitches, that\u2019s my husband and he used to be a stripper. Then they had a kid and Jenna supported Channing putting on the lbs and coined it \u201cfappy\u201d (Fat+Happy) Channing. Just recently they were snapped having a dance-off after the Golden Globes proving to be the best thing to come out of Step Up, and yes that was a direct dig to Step up 2-100.\n\nYears Together: 10 (Married in 2009)\n\nKristen Bell & Dax Shepard.\n\nKristen and Dax are goobers.They\u2019ve been doing a series of ads for Samsung for about a year now and call me a sucker but how they are in these commercials is exactly how I assume they interact at home. I eat that shit right up. They\u2019ve always been all about sharing funny stories and being open about their relationship on talk shows and a few years ago Dax surprised Kristen with a sloth on her 31st birthday and she was so happy that she hysterically cried about it. Always the good husband, Dax filmed it all for our viewing pleasure. (See clip below) Plus after second baby Delta was born, Dax described Kristen\u2019s C Section in the most romantic of ways, \u201cAfter seeing this autopsy, I would rather see a school bus drive out of her vagina.\u201d So he\u2019s almost as much of a wordsmith as Ryan Reynolds comparing Blake\u2019s breast-feeding to a diner chain.\n\nYears Together: 8 (Married in 2013)", "images":
