Kardashian said surrogacy can be done anonymously, but the star insisted on meeting to make sure the surrogate was comfortable with the situation.\n\n\u201cWhat if they weren\u2019t a fan of me or my husband?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if they didn\u2019t want to be carrying our baby? I wanted to give them that choice.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 3, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nA post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Nov 9, 2017 at 12:21pm PST\n\nWhen they did meet, Kardashian says the surrogate was \u201creally excited\u201d and previously aware of her struggles to conceive. The star experienced preeclampsia while pregnant with North, and placenta accreta throughout both pregnancies.\n\n\u201cI love her. I have the best relationship with my surrogate. She\u2019s so nice,\u201d Kardashian added. \u201cShe\u2019s the perfect person to do this for my family.\u201d\n\nDespite once describing pregnancy as \u201cthe worst experience of my life,\u201d Kardashian says the surrogacy was \u201cso much harder\u201d than conceiving naturally.\n\n\u201cAnyone that says or thinks (surrogacy) is just the easy way out is just completely wrong,\u201d she recently told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cObviously you pick someone that you completely trust and that you have a good bond and relationship with, but it is still ... knowing that I was able to carry my first two babies and not, you know, my baby now, it\u2019s hard for me. So, it\u2019s definitely a harder experience than I anticipated just in the control area.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/donut-a63d2a21ca5f04f551be212a9496d4deba5d40f4bcb801f34ba14f27bb3bb32a.svg", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/H-icon-72fd5782b36a1a42ab82a4af65cbc6dd6ddc4d4a71190a91c5cfaab7c66fd836.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d88f91b2100003200dab6d8.png", "https://s.m.huffpost.com/assets/HuffPostHero-d783f680fb974e80346bdfa145131d058e596e1d32f791981875aa481702c770.svg", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0de225180000aa09f6c8bc.png?cache=ag5lldc3uu&ops=1778_1000", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc855a6240000090c524d4f.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0de225180000aa09f6c8bc.png?cache=ag5lldc3uu&ops=1778_1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-didnt-invite-surrogate-to-her-baby-shower_n_5a0de09de4b0b37054f5658e", "title": "Kim Kardashian Didn't Invite Surrogate To Her Baby Shower", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8", "oath": {"guce": {"product-eu": "false", "consent-host": "guce.huffpost.com", "locale": "en-US", "inline-consent": "true"}}, "fb": {"pages": 70242384902, "app_id": 46744042133}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"It was a weird decision to have to make,\u201d the reality TV star said.", "keywords": "Pregnancy,kim kardashian,family planning", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Didn't Invite Surrogate To Her Baby Shower", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0de225180000aa09f6c8bc.png?cache=ag5lldc3uu&ops=1778_1000", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0de225180000aa09f6c8bc.png?cache=ag5lldc3uu&ops=1778_1000", "type": "image/png", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-didnt-invite-surrogate-to-her-baby-shower_n_5a0de09de4b0b37054f5658e", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"It was a weird decision to have to make,\u201d the reality TV star said."}, "article": {"tag": "Pregnancy,kim kardashian,family planning", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-11-16 15:27:04 -0500", "modified_time": "2017-11-16 16:38:49 -0500"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Kim Kardashian Didn't Invite Surrogate To Her Baby Shower", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a0de225180000aa09f6c8bc.png?cache=ag5lldc3uu&ops=1778_1000", "width": 1778, "height": 1000}, "description": "\"It was a weird decision to have to make,\u201d the reality TV star said.", "creator": "cdelbyck"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a0de09de4b0b37054f5658e", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510864024.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
